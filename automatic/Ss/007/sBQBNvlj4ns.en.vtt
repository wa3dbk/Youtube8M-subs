so<00:00:03.090> welcome<00:00:03.270> to<00:00:03.389> another<00:00:03.570> Java<00:00:03.929> program

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
so welcome to another Java program

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.800 
so welcome to another Java program
tutorial<00:00:04.920> and<00:00:05.100> in<00:00:05.580> this<00:00:05.640> tutorial<00:00:05.819> I'll<00:00:06.750> be

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
tutorial and in this tutorial I'll be

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.839 
tutorial and in this tutorial I'll be
showing<00:00:06.930> you<00:00:07.259> how<00:00:07.470> to<00:00:07.500> generate<00:00:08.340> random

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
showing you how to generate random

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.780 
showing you how to generate random
numbers<00:00:09.090> and<00:00:09.559> what<00:00:10.559> this<00:00:10.650> would<00:00:10.830> do<00:00:10.980> is<00:00:11.190> we

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
numbers and what this would do is we

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.879 
numbers and what this would do is we
generate<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.480> random<00:00:12.540> number<00:00:12.870> between<00:00:13.110> 0<00:00:13.769> and

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
generate a random number between 0 and

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.029 
generate a random number between 0 and
the<00:00:14.130> number<00:00:14.309> you<00:00:14.730> choose<00:00:15.109> so<00:00:16.109> let<00:00:16.770> me<00:00:16.859> show<00:00:17.010> you

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
the number you choose so let me show you

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:17.599 
the number you choose so let me show you
how<00:00:17.220> it's<00:00:17.369> done

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
how it's done

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.519 
how it's done
first<00:00:18.600> we're<00:00:18.750> going<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:18.930> do<00:00:19.020> is<00:00:19.199> create<00:00:19.470> an

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
first we're going to do is create an

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.300 
first we're going to do is create an
integer<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.180> let's<00:00:21.180> call<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.390> random<00:00:22.310> because

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
integer and let's call it random because

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.410 
integer and let's call it random because
you<00:00:23.460> know<00:00:23.550> it's<00:00:23.730> rainy<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.480> put<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.500> equal<00:00:25.650> to

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
you know it's rainy and put it equal to

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.479 
you know it's rainy and put it equal to
in<00:00:27.470> it's<00:00:28.470> going<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.650> have<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.769> cost<00:00:29.070> with<00:00:29.369> int

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 
in it's going to have a cost with int

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.660 
in it's going to have a cost with int
math<00:00:32.930> dot<00:00:33.930> random<00:00:34.309> like<00:00:35.309> in<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.520> previous

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
math dot random like in the previous

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.750 
math dot random like in the previous
tutorials<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.540> very<00:00:36.930> similar<00:00:37.399> and<00:00:38.399> then<00:00:38.550> we

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
tutorials is very similar and then we

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.130 
tutorials is very similar and then we
put<00:00:39.320> brackets<00:00:40.320> after<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.829> times<00:00:41.550> by<00:00:42.090> fire<00:00:42.870> for

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
put brackets after it times by fire for

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.709 
put brackets after it times by fire for
now<00:00:44.180> it's<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.239> meager

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
now it's a meager

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.020 
now it's a meager
so<00:00:46.200> basically<00:00:46.559> we're<00:00:46.980> generally<00:00:47.370> creating<00:00:47.789> a

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
so basically we're generally creating a

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.410 
so basically we're generally creating a
variable<00:00:48.539> simple<00:00:49.410> stuff<00:00:49.700> it's<00:00:50.700> an<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:51.000> telling

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
variable simple stuff it's an in telling

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.860 
variable simple stuff it's an in telling
an<00:00:51.510> Addison<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.110> again<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.850> then<00:00:53.850> here<00:00:54.239> math

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
an Addison in again and then here math

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.830 
an Addison in again and then here math
dot<00:00:55.140> random<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:56.340> method<00:00:56.820> that's<00:00:57.480> just<00:00:57.719> gonna

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
dot random is a method that's just gonna

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.290 
dot random is a method that's just gonna
generate<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.530> random<00:00:58.710> number<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.370> put<00:01:00.210> it

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
generate a random number and put it

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.830 
generate a random number and put it
inside<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:00.989> variable<00:01:01.230> random<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.719> we<00:01:03.719> do

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
inside of this variable random and we do

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.010 
inside of this variable random and we do
times<00:01:04.140> 5<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.460> becomes<00:01:05.790> between<00:01:06.450> 0<00:01:06.780> and

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
times 5 so that it becomes between 0 and

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.490 
times 5 so that it becomes between 0 and
5<00:01:08.540> so<00:01:09.540> what<00:01:10.409> we're<00:01:10.530> going<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.680> do<00:01:10.860> now<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.700> just

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
5 so what we're going to do now is just

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.429 
5 so what we're going to do now is just
display<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:13.740> number<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.820> system<00:01:15.509> dot<00:01:16.259> out

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
display this number so system dot out

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:24.130 
display this number so system dot out
dot<00:01:16.880> print<00:01:19.130> ellen<00:01:20.509> brackets<00:01:21.509> semicolon<00:01:23.119> the

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
dot print ellen brackets semicolon the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:32.510 
dot print ellen brackets semicolon the
random<00:01:26.540> number<00:01:27.920> is<00:01:30.710> and<00:01:31.710> then<00:01:32.070> what<00:01:32.400> we're

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
random number is and then what we're

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.140 
random number is and then what we're
gonna<00:01:32.640> do<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.180> plus<00:01:34.140> random<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.820> that's<00:01:35.970> gonna

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
gonna do is plus random so that's gonna

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.230 
gonna do is plus random so that's gonna
just<00:01:36.439> put<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> random<00:01:37.890> number<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.280> colon

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
just put the random number is colon

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.460 
just put the random number is colon
space<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:40.079> then<00:01:40.500> put<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.790> random<00:01:42.000> number<00:01:42.470> so

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
space and then put the random number so

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.069 
space and then put the random number so
you<00:01:43.530> save<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.100> run<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:45.240> random<00:01:45.630> number<00:01:45.930> is

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
you save it run the random number is

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:58.459 
you save it run the random number is
full<00:01:47.659> 3<00:01:49.340> 0<00:01:50.840> 3<00:01:52.220> 1<00:01:53.840> 0<00:01:55.130> 3<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.939> get<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.180> idea<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.659> i'm

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
full 3 0 3 1 0 3 you get the idea so i'm

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.899 
full 3 0 3 1 0 3 you get the idea so i'm
going<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.799> put<00:01:58.950> this<00:01:59.009> up<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.280> 10<00:01:59.520> just<00:01:59.729> say

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
going to put this up to 10 just say

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.609 
going to put this up to 10 just say
we've<00:02:00.149> got<00:02:00.270> more<00:02:00.509> numbers<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.020> work<00:02:01.140> with<00:02:01.409> and

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
we've got more numbers to work with and

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.760 
we've got more numbers to work with and
then<00:02:02.579> 6<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:04.640> 0<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.450> at<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.200> moment<00:02:07.380> it's<00:02:07.619> going

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
then 6 a 0 so at the moment it's going

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.580 
then 6 a 0 so at the moment it's going
between<00:02:07.920> 0<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.640> 9<00:02:08.970> if<00:02:09.479> even<00:02:10.050> though<00:02:10.140> petina

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
between 0 and 9 if even though petina

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.290 
between 0 and 9 if even though petina
it's<00:02:10.830> going<00:02:10.979> between<00:02:11.099> 0<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.520> 9<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:12.390> reason<00:02:12.720> is

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
it's going between 0 and 9 the reason is

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.140 
it's going between 0 and 9 the reason is
like<00:02:13.510> with<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.750> Aries<00:02:14.070> with<00:02:15.070> arrows<00:02:15.520> they

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
like with the Aries with arrows they

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.410 
like with the Aries with arrows they
start<00:02:16.480> at<00:02:16.630> zero<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.730> that<00:02:18.730> means<00:02:18.940> they'll<00:02:19.150> end

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
start at zero and that means they'll end

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.340 
start at zero and that means they'll end
one<00:02:19.870> lower<00:02:20.170> than<00:02:20.500> 10<00:02:21.630> so<00:02:22.630> to<00:02:22.720> get<00:02:22.960> around<00:02:23.020> this

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
one lower than 10 so to get around this

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.400 
one lower than 10 so to get around this
what<00:02:23.560> we<00:02:23.620> can<00:02:23.740> do<00:02:23.860> is<00:02:24.370> do<00:02:24.580> a<00:02:24.610> random<00:02:25.110> if<00:02:26.110> you<00:02:26.290> can

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
what we can do is do a random if you can

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.280 
what we can do is do a random if you can
spell<00:02:26.740> it<00:02:27.210> equals<00:02:28.210> random<00:02:29.910> plus<00:02:30.910> 1<00:02:31.330> so

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
spell it equals random plus 1 so

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.110 
spell it equals random plus 1 so
basically<00:02:32.560> this<00:02:32.740> will<00:02:32.890> add<00:02:33.130> 1<00:02:33.520> to<00:02:33.940> whatever

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
basically this will add 1 to whatever

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.820 
basically this will add 1 to whatever
the<00:02:34.360> random<00:02:34.690> number<00:02:34.900> is<00:02:34.990> so<00:02:35.500> if<00:02:35.560> there<00:02:35.680> are<00:02:35.800> no

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
the random number is so if there are no

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.490 
the random number is so if there are no
Rosie<00:02:36.430> row<00:02:36.490> it<00:02:37.030> will<00:02:37.120> make<00:02:37.300> it<00:02:37.450> 1<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:38.140> random

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
Rosie row it will make it 1 the random

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.860 
Rosie row it will make it 1 the random
number<00:02:38.740> is<00:02:38.830> 9<00:02:39.070> will<00:02:39.400> make<00:02:39.580> a<00:02:39.610> 10<00:02:39.910> if<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.450> random

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
number is 9 will make a 10 if the random

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.710 
number is 9 will make a 10 if the random
number<00:02:41.140> is<00:02:41.230> 5<00:02:41.500> or<00:02:41.800> make<00:02:42.040> it<00:02:42.190> 6<00:02:42.460> 7<00:02:42.670> will<00:02:43.360> become<00:02:43.540> 8

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
number is 5 or make it 6 7 will become 8

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.200 
number is 5 or make it 6 7 will become 8
8<00:02:44.140> will<00:02:44.350> become<00:02:44.560> 9<00:02:44.710> so<00:02:45.340> you<00:02:45.370> go<00:02:45.610> you<00:02:45.880> get<00:02:46.150> the

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
8 will become 9 so you go you get the

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:58.500 
8 will become 9 so you go you get the
idea<00:02:46.480> so<00:02:46.690> if<00:02:47.500> we<00:02:47.620> run<00:02:47.800> it<00:02:48.300> 9<00:02:49.770> 10<00:02:50.770> 8<00:02:53.790> 3<00:02:55.200> 10<00:02:56.550> 5<00:02:57.550> so

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
idea so if we run it 9 10 8 3 10 5 so

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.450 
idea so if we run it 9 10 8 3 10 5 so
you<00:02:58.570> get<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.750> idea<00:02:58.780> you<00:02:59.140> cannot<00:02:59.740> get<00:03:00.160> 0

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
you get the idea you cannot get 0

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.230 
you get the idea you cannot get 0
anymore<00:03:00.820> and<00:03:01.150> you<00:03:01.570> can<00:03:01.870> get<00:03:02.500> 10<00:03:02.820> so<00:03:03.820> what<00:03:04.150> about

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
anymore and you can get 10 so what about

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.280 
anymore and you can get 10 so what about
if<00:03:04.480> we<00:03:04.630> wanted<00:03:05.020> to<00:03:06.180> randomly<00:03:07.180> select<00:03:07.300> a<00:03:07.870> name

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
if we wanted to randomly select a name

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.980 
if we wanted to randomly select a name
or<00:03:08.610> randomly<00:03:09.610> select<00:03:09.970> something<00:03:10.600> from<00:03:10.870> an

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
or randomly select something from an

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.170 
or randomly select something from an
area<00:03:11.380> well<00:03:12.250> we'd<00:03:12.430> have<00:03:12.490> to<00:03:12.610> remove<00:03:12.940> this

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
area well we'd have to remove this

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.290 
area well we'd have to remove this
because<00:03:13.570> if<00:03:14.260> we<00:03:14.410> were<00:03:14.470> to<00:03:14.650> do<00:03:14.710> that<00:03:14.920> then<00:03:15.790> the

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
because if we were to do that then the

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.229 
because if we were to do that then the
first<00:03:16.630> item<00:03:17.230> in<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.560> array<00:03:17.790> wouldn't<00:03:18.790> come<00:03:19.090> up

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
first item in the array wouldn't come up

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.240 
first item in the array wouldn't come up
at<00:03:19.480> all<00:03:19.630> because<00:03:20.110> we're<00:03:20.380> adding<00:03:20.560> 1<00:03:20.800> remember

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
at all because we're adding 1 remember

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.580 
at all because we're adding 1 remember
area<00:03:21.580> starts<00:03:21.910> at<00:03:22.000> 0<00:03:22.270> as<00:03:22.450> well<00:03:22.630> and<00:03:22.959> it'd<00:03:23.470> be

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
area starts at 0 as well and it'd be

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.360 
area starts at 0 as well and it'd be
impossible<00:03:23.830> to<00:03:24.160> get<00:03:24.520> to<00:03:24.580> area<00:03:24.850> number<00:03:25.209> 0<00:03:26.370> so

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
impossible to get to area number 0 so

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.100 
impossible to get to area number 0 so
what<00:03:28.060> we're<00:03:28.150> going<00:03:28.239> to<00:03:28.300> put<00:03:28.510> here<00:03:28.660> is<00:03:28.780> it's

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
what we're going to put here is it's

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.960 
what we're going to put here is it's
going<00:03:29.260> to<00:03:29.320> create<00:03:29.440> an<00:03:29.709> array<00:03:29.920> and<00:03:30.250> I<00:03:30.730> never

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
going to create an array and I never

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.760 
going to create an array and I never
actually<00:03:31.150> went<00:03:31.300> over<00:03:31.570> string<00:03:32.110> arrays<00:03:32.500> which<00:03:32.680> I

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
actually went over string arrays which I

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.740 
actually went over string arrays which I
should<00:03:33.010> have<00:03:33.040> I<00:03:33.370> only<00:03:33.880> went<00:03:34.060> over<00:03:34.330> integer

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
should have I only went over integer

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.650 
should have I only went over integer
arrays<00:03:35.080> in<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.709> areas<00:03:36.040> tutorial<00:03:36.580> so<00:03:37.480> what

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
arrays in the areas tutorial so what

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.350 
arrays in the areas tutorial so what
we're<00:03:37.750> gonna<00:03:37.840> do<00:03:37.989> is<00:03:38.230> string<00:03:38.910> then<00:03:39.910> square

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
we're gonna do is string then square

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.360 
we're gonna do is string then square
brackets<00:03:40.720> to<00:03:40.810> say<00:03:41.020> us<00:03:41.140> at<00:03:41.230> Mary<00:03:41.440> and<00:03:42.010> call<00:03:42.250> it

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
brackets to say us at Mary and call it

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.800 
brackets to say us at Mary and call it
names<00:03:42.610> because<00:03:42.910> we'll<00:03:43.060> put<00:03:43.209> a<00:03:43.239> list<00:03:43.450> of<00:03:43.540> names

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
names because we'll put a list of names

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.500 
names because we'll put a list of names
inside<00:03:44.230> this<00:03:44.640> and<00:03:45.640> then<00:03:45.970> what<00:03:46.090> we're<00:03:46.180> gonna<00:03:46.270> do

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
inside this and then what we're gonna do

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.620 
inside this and then what we're gonna do
is<00:03:46.750> do<00:03:46.959> names<00:03:48.150> equals<00:03:49.150> new<00:03:49.750> string<00:03:51.330> then<00:03:52.330> put

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
is do names equals new string then put

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.960 
is do names equals new string then put
square<00:03:52.959> brackets<00:03:53.080> offer<00:03:53.500> it<00:03:53.650> and<00:03:53.800> then<00:03:54.610> here

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
square brackets offer it and then here

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.090 
square brackets offer it and then here
we've<00:03:55.510> put<00:03:55.540> how<00:03:56.020> many<00:03:56.080> they're<00:03:56.560> going<00:03:56.830> to<00:03:56.950> be

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
we've put how many they're going to be

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.050 
we've put how many they're going to be
so<00:03:57.730> we're<00:03:58.180> going<00:03:58.270> to<00:03:58.330> put<00:03:58.480> 5<00:03:58.930> names<00:03:59.290> in<00:04:00.060> but

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
so we're going to put 5 names in but

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.000 
so we're going to put 5 names in but
then<00:04:01.300> afterwards<00:04:01.630> we<00:04:02.200> have<00:04:02.320> got<00:04:02.440> names<00:04:02.739> and

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
then afterwards we have got names and

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.780 
then afterwards we have got names and
then<00:04:03.790> 0<00:04:04.330> so<00:04:04.870> in<00:04:05.050> slot<00:04:05.350> 0<00:04:05.680> we're<00:04:06.400> going<00:04:06.520> to<00:04:06.580> set

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
then 0 so in slot 0 we're going to set

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.759 
then 0 so in slot 0 we're going to set
this<00:04:06.910> equal<00:04:06.970> to<00:04:07.330> been<00:04:09.390> it's<00:04:10.390> just<00:04:10.769> copy-paste

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
this equal to been it's just copy-paste

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.170 
this equal to been it's just copy-paste
this

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.129 

four<00:04:16.180> or<00:04:16.269> five<00:04:16.509> and<00:04:17.430> put<00:04:18.430> slot<00:04:18.639> one<00:04:18.900> slot<00:04:19.900> two

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
four or five and put slot one slot two

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:21.390 
four or five and put slot one slot two
three

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
three

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.390 
three
oops<00:04:23.699> slot<00:04:24.699> 4<00:04:24.910> I<00:04:25.180> mean<00:04:26.050> but<00:04:26.229> this<00:04:26.680> ends<00:04:27.070> up<00:04:27.130> for

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
oops slot 4 I mean but this ends up for

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.070 
oops slot 4 I mean but this ends up for
because<00:04:27.669> we<00:04:27.940> still<00:04:28.120> have<00:04:28.330> got<00:04:28.479> five<00:04:28.720> knickers

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
because we still have got five knickers

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.770 
because we still have got five knickers
we're<00:04:29.229> including<00:04:29.440> zero<00:04:29.949> as<00:04:30.190> well<00:04:30.509> so<00:04:31.509> this<00:04:31.720> is

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
we're including zero as well so this is

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:43.370 
we're including zero as well so this is
going<00:04:31.870> to<00:04:31.930> be<00:04:32.020> been<00:04:32.289> Bob<00:04:34.020> bill<00:04:37.080> Tim<00:04:38.080> and<00:04:40.979> Tom

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
going to be been Bob bill Tim and Tom

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.620 
going to be been Bob bill Tim and Tom
just<00:04:44.380> like<00:04:44.560> that<00:04:44.740> so<00:04:45.639> if<00:04:45.940> we<00:04:45.970> save<00:04:46.240> that<00:04:46.449> and

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
just like that so if we save that and

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.020 
just like that so if we save that and
run<00:04:46.840> oh<00:04:47.080> wait<00:04:47.740> you<00:04:47.949> know<00:04:47.979> we<00:04:48.550> still<00:04:48.759> need<00:04:48.910> to

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
run oh wait you know we still need to

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.360 
run oh wait you know we still need to
stop<00:04:49.360> it<00:04:49.479> from<00:04:49.570> generating<00:04:50.020> random<00:04:50.139> numbers

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
stop it from generating random numbers

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.560 
stop it from generating random numbers
so<00:04:51.370> what<00:04:51.729> we're<00:04:51.820> going<00:04:51.910> to<00:04:51.970> do<00:04:52.090> is<00:04:52.210> turn<00:04:52.300> just

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
so what we're going to do is turn just

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.600 
so what we're going to do is turn just
to<00:04:52.660> five<00:04:52.960> because<00:04:53.590> we<00:04:53.800> don't<00:04:53.979> have<00:04:54.039> ten<00:04:54.430> areas

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
to five because we don't have ten areas

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.969 
to five because we don't have ten areas
we've<00:04:54.849> got<00:04:54.970> five<00:04:55.240> instead<00:04:55.690> so<00:04:56.680> that's<00:04:56.860> going

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
we've got five instead so that's going

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:00.420 
we've got five instead so that's going
to<00:04:57.070> generate<00:04:57.150> between<00:04:58.150> zero<00:04:58.870> and<00:04:59.110> four<00:04:59.620> and

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
to generate between zero and four and

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.200 
to generate between zero and four and
then<00:05:00.910> here<00:05:01.120> we're<00:05:01.210> gonna<00:05:01.300> change<00:05:01.599> the<00:05:01.780> random

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
then here we're gonna change the random

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:13.920 
then here we're gonna change the random
name<00:05:04.210> is<00:05:04.599> and<00:05:05.400> random<00:05:06.570> so<00:05:07.570> and<00:05:11.250> names<00:05:12.930> then

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
name is and random so and names then

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.930 
name is and random so and names then
here<00:05:14.169> we're<00:05:14.259> going<00:05:14.349> to<00:05:14.410> do<00:05:14.560> random<00:05:14.940> basically

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
here we're going to do random basically

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.870 
here we're going to do random basically
what<00:05:16.090> this<00:05:16.150> will<00:05:16.330> do<00:05:16.479> is<00:05:17.130> the<00:05:18.130> random<00:05:18.550> number

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
what this will do is the random number

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.850 
what this will do is the random number
will<00:05:19.120> be<00:05:19.240> put<00:05:19.449> into<00:05:19.630> this<00:05:19.840> variable<00:05:20.380> random

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
will be put into this variable random

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.990 
will be put into this variable random
and<00:05:21.389> then<00:05:22.830> what<00:05:23.830> we'll<00:05:24.009> do<00:05:24.220> is<00:05:24.400> we'll<00:05:24.639> put<00:05:24.880> that

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
and then what we'll do is we'll put that

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.140 
and then what we'll do is we'll put that
random<00:05:25.419> numbers<00:05:25.750> chosen<00:05:26.380> into<00:05:27.099> here<00:05:27.280> so<00:05:27.880> if

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
random numbers chosen into here so if

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.510 
random numbers chosen into here so if
it's<00:05:28.330> 1<00:05:28.570> then<00:05:29.050> it<00:05:29.169> will<00:05:29.320> go<00:05:29.830> over<00:05:29.860> to<00:05:30.039> here<00:05:30.280> and

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
it's 1 then it will go over to here and

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.020 
it's 1 then it will go over to here and
say<00:05:30.699> ok<00:05:31.120> that's<00:05:31.270> Bob<00:05:31.539> display<00:05:32.110> Bob<00:05:32.490> if<00:05:33.490> it's<00:05:33.669> 3

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
say ok that's Bob display Bob if it's 3

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.370 
say ok that's Bob display Bob if it's 3
we'll<00:05:34.270> go<00:05:34.479> uh-huh

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
we'll go uh-huh

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.490 
we'll go uh-huh
that's<00:05:35.650> Tim<00:05:35.919> let's<00:05:36.310> display<00:05:36.669> Tim<00:05:37.110> so<00:05:38.110> save

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
that's Tim let's display Tim so save

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.800 
that's Tim let's display Tim so save
that<00:05:38.530> and<00:05:38.919> run<00:05:39.669> it<00:05:40.770> the<00:05:41.770> random<00:05:42.039> name<00:05:42.220> is<00:05:42.370> Bob

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
that and run it the random name is Bob

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:51.990 
that and run it the random name is Bob
your<00:05:43.810> own<00:05:43.930> am<00:05:44.050> name<00:05:44.199> is<00:05:44.349> Ben<00:05:44.970> Tom<00:05:46.530> Ben<00:05:47.970> bill<00:05:51.000> so

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
your own am name is Ben Tom Ben bill so

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.149 
your own am name is Ben Tom Ben bill so
you<00:05:52.060> get<00:05:52.330> the<00:05:52.449> idea<00:05:52.479> pretty<00:05:52.990> much<00:05:53.169> now<00:05:53.440> Tim

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:54.159 
you get the idea pretty much now Tim

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:57.959 
you get the idea pretty much now Tim
still<00:05:54.400> hasn't<00:05:54.699> come<00:05:54.820> up<00:05:56.130> there<00:05:57.130> so<00:05:57.460> those<00:05:57.759> two

00:05:57.959 --> 00:05:57.969 
still hasn't come up there so those two

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:58.980 
still hasn't come up there so those two
just<00:05:58.270> approve<00:05:58.509> works

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990 
just approve works

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.810 
just approve works
so<00:05:59.380> taking<00:05:59.680> watching<00:05:59.919> this<00:05:59.979> tutorial<00:06:00.490> don't
