00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.420
 Hi, people here are hard and today it's going to be a 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:10.849
 super-requested tutorial that is the 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.849
 cascade braid eye fire reid 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.089
 so people start seeing with a wick 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.670
 very fine near the root and due to 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.260
 this average in three equal pieces and 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.840
 People are going to make a braid 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.060
 start by passing the corner 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.890
 over the stocking so I went through one 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.550
 The top of the nei will be another over 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.699
 medium 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.730
 now that fuse that falls down I 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.420
 I'll let him loose and I'll get the root 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.129
 a not so thick wick and pass it 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.530
 over the middle 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.500
 Now in the other corner, I'll put it together. 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.899
 hair is that corner and also pass through 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.760
 up the middle as if it were half braid 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.160
 half the inheritance that people 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.110
 then you are seeing that the 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.379
 low average I left to the side 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.140
 I got a wick from the root 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.120
 I passed over the corner and on the other side 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.340
 I took the wick from the corner with the hair 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.180
 from above and I also passed over the 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.070
 corner 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.010
 I do this until I get more or less 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.070
 back of the head after I 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:19.409
 I still have a normal braid and fasten with 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:21.780
 a pine clamp like you are seeing there 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.189
 What happens on my other side, I 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.290
 I have more hair if you make the 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.930
 cascade split in half 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.920
 would advise you to do this on both 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.799
 sides 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.170
 Just like on my side on my side. 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.990
 I have more hair, I'll start. 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.329
 that other side as follows I 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.579
 beginning divided into 3 passed in the corner by 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.979
 above the middle and above the middle 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.649
 In this first one or two laps I go 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.750
 do only built-in hair grips game 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.729
 corner over the middle picks up the hair 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.280
 I play corner over the middle 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.909
 now I leave the loose wick loose 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.729
 I get a wick from the root just behind the 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.500
 where did this soltinha stay and pass this 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.170
 average over medium 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.649
 the other corner together hair goes through 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.410
 above the middle loosens a wick from below 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.140
 I get a lock of the queen 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.920
 behind the last ones and passes over the 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.980
 medium 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.170
 now in the hair from above together hair and 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.420
 also passes over the middle you will 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.780
 repeating this leaves the average low 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.690
 loose pulls hair from behind her goes through 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.580
 from the middle to the other the other point you 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.850
 will also gather hair will go through 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.460
 up the middle is basically what you 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.230
 You have to do it only, it's something that I 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.270
 I could only do well when I went 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.310
 repeating the steps in my head and 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.380
 you might find it easier to do 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.410
 braid as long as you have to 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.580
 learn those wicks that you are 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.260
 letting loose 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.140
 I learn with my mouth even though your 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.730
 I found this history to be super useful but 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.190
 if you have little one and want to learn 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.790
 with the entrepreneur is totally his 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:01.370
 choice and it is ready to be 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.970
 in this opposite mecha on the other side I 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.140
 before and then I did until I did not 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.570
 cascading 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.640
 remembering what I need when our 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.459
 not going straight to the other side of me 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.370
 I prefer to attach with the clip and that I 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.900
 I think it gets more delicate then 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.240
 people became the transit 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.540
 cascade was many people asking then 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.430
 Is she ordering here? Is she? 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.830
 Looks beautiful in straight or curly hair 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.290
 so if you have hair pulled made 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.030
 so it looks beautiful if you have hair 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.620
 smooth were made after china 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.959
 also looks beautiful 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.980
 I really like them here, it's a child. 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:42.709
 difficult people I spent months not to 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.920
 able to do it then but who 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:48.440
