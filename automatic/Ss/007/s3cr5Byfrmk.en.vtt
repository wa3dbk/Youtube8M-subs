00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.109 
that to change that's the one last thing
in<00:01:42.600> my<00:01:42.689> career<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.799> don't<00:01:44.009> have<00:01:44.159> yet<00:01:44.399> so

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
in my career that I don't have yet so

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.990 
in my career that I don't have yet so
yes<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:46.020> course<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.409> definitely<00:01:47.009> still<00:01:47.729> looking

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
yes of course I definitely still looking

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.090 
yes of course I definitely still looking
for<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.149> first<00:01:48.240> title<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.380> think<00:01:49.619> in<00:01:49.950> any

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
for that first title and I think in any

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.590 
for that first title and I think in any
aspect<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.670> your<00:01:50.759> career<00:01:51.060> once<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.360> get<00:01:51.479> that

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
aspect of your career once you get that

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.319 
aspect of your career once you get that
first<00:01:51.659> one<00:01:52.079> kind<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.649> snowballs<00:01:53.100> into<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.880> lot

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
first one kind of snowballs into a lot

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.760 
first one kind of snowballs into a lot
more<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:54.810> I'm<00:01:54.899> hoping<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.380> definitely

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
more so I'm hoping that that definitely

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.389 
more so I'm hoping that that definitely
happened<00:01:56.390> but<00:01:57.390> only<00:01:57.540> one<00:01:57.960> bowler<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.649> unbeaten

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
one that I'm proud of and hopefully

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.199

describe<00:02:59.410> it's<00:03:00.410> something<00:03:00.830> I<00:03:00.920> worked<00:03:01.100> for<00:03:01.310> my

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
describe it's something I worked for my

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.260 
describe it's something I worked for my
entire<00:03:01.489> life<00:03:02.000> since<00:03:02.239> I<00:03:02.420> was<00:03:02.570> two<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:02.870> a<00:03:02.989> half

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
entire life since I was two and a half

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.970 
entire life since I was two and a half
full<00:03:05.270> so<00:03:05.930> it<00:03:06.290> would<00:03:06.440> mean<00:03:06.860> the<00:03:06.890> world

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
full so it would mean the world

hopefully<00:03:07.790> a<00:03:08.420> jump<00:03:08.959> start<00:03:09.260> for<00:03:09.670> my<00:03:10.670> adult<00:03:11.030> and

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
hopefully a jump start for my adult and

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.630 
hopefully a jump start for my adult and
single<00:03:11.930> career<00:03:12.890> I<00:03:12.920> guess<00:03:13.070> you<00:03:13.340> can<00:03:13.489> say

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
single career I guess you can say

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.400 
single career I guess you can say
because<00:03:13.910> I<00:03:14.120> pretty<00:03:14.420> much<00:03:14.540> done<00:03:14.870> what<00:03:15.290> I<00:03:15.320> could

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
because I pretty much done what I could

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.640 
because I pretty much done what I could
do<00:03:15.739> and<00:03:15.920> call<00:03:16.070> in<00:03:16.430> collegiate<00:03:16.730> bowling<00:03:17.180> so
