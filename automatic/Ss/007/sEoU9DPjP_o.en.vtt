00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.790
 showing the other books that I got 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.219
 between January February and March and they are not 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.350
 many but just let's start this 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.660
 book it preorder so I was not 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.550

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.869
 account but what do I need 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.560
 Concentrate the same while I do 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.430
 this because 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.430
 easier 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:33.810
 seriously you're just supposed to just 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.810
 Let us get the shivers 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.420
 at that point to tell us an unboxing that 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.030

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.690
 the book how came loft and jingles from 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.310
 the olive and the truth I do not know much of what 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.090
 try this book I was just reading 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.320
 the synopsis that comes in the book and 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.250
 I'm surprised I knew I had to 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.739
 see obviously with girls that 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.200
 they disappeared but nothing more and 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.760
 honestly I am willing to 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.379
 buy any book of alaron the 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.630
 book because I liked it a lot as he writes 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.340
 or as he wrote at least in the saga 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.110
 of delirium because actually now 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.360
 I'm reading panic which is another of his 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.850
 books and do not have the same writing 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.720
 but I do not know if maybe this one yes latina and 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.119
 I want to show you the loin is very cute 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.160
 the cover to me the truth did not seem 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.830
 so cute or anything but the loin cui cute 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.350
 very nice edition and good this book 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.630
 is about cocoa really is about 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.700
 about two sisters will give ini they are 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.580
 inseparable are best friends until 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.050
 that one day you will see a boy and also 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.880
 have an accident that leaves you 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.980
 scars on the face and none of the 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.660
 sisters wants to fix all this 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.580
 and that they are united as 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.320
 they were before but give seems to have 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.470
 other plans and the day of his birthday 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.210
 she disappears and I think it's a 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.670
 joke but not long after a 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.560
 nine-year-old girl also disappears and 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.930
 think that these two events are 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.430
 related and start investigating and the 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.380
 true that it looks much more interesting 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.820
 of what I thought I could I'm not going 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.730
 to show the other books that I got 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.950
 between January to March and the first book 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.480
 What I have is the dark star for the 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.220
 hottie black this is the last book of 

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.100
 holy black that was published this year and 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.350
 is about a place where in the 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.910
 darker part of the forest there is a box 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.700
 of glass where there is a boy inside 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.410
 that since the protagonists 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.390
 remember and a long time before 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.490
 this boy was always sleeping and 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.470
 the protagonists heysel and bernanke are 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.690
 brothers when they were kids they played 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.090
 near this guy who is sleeping 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.400
 in the middle of the forest and it's a place 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.500
 also very known tourist let's say 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.510
 what is this boy and sleeping and 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.670
 they always thought that there was no 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.470
 possibility to wake him up ever 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.010
 they knew how until one day they 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.010
 awake 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.720
 and basically everything will change I will not do it 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.879
 I like another book that I also bought 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.659
 on bidder ship and it's 10 things play the 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.549
 stars game 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:56.099
 this is the book that contains the 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.840
 short novels that are prequels to the 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.579
 saga the strong splash has five 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.459
 short stories and they are all about 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:04.470
 that is the protagonist of the zones 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.940
 before they treat her and send her 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.280
 to prison that's how the 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.650
 first book that does not come out by the first 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.989
 I liked that book a lot and I feel 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.120
 that this prequel is going to be that I like 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.269
 even more because the only thing we call 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.430
 all the flash program is the lack of 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.890
 previous information on how is that 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.930
 line became the best killer 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.389
 of the kingdom and all that so I hope 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.239
 to have 14 those answers that I wanted 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:32.400
 have already in bloom plus and the last book 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.980
 I have a poster and for this 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.470
 house is scarlett by marissa mayer that 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.359
 is the second book in the mole saga 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.180
 chronic or the lunar chronicles in 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:44.510
 Spanish and I do not have no pain that is 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.170
 the first one I already know but they had bought it 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.880
 Unfortunately not 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.700
 they could send it I bought it for 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.500
 vowels and never again will I buy a bus 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.660
 cable because I have not had good 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.830
 experiences with them and all this saga 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.620
 each book has a protagonist 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.360
 different and they are 3 richard wright aliens 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.489
 what do you mean they are stories 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.319
 based on fairy tales and the first 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.030
 painless book has to do with no 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.160
 defeat with ashen but the 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.680
 difference is that without giving is a robot and 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.510
 that already makes it pretty epic 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.769
 He heard very good things from this saga and 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.870
 in this second book we know 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.519
 scarlett what has to do with the 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.560
 presita red and as I said I hear very 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.060
 good things happened and I would love it for 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.040
 have without giving to be able to read it and 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.870
 after being able to read scarlett but I do not know 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.690
 when it will happen and that they 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.610
 give the fact that yesterday editor will 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.110
 be bringing scam and the first 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.120
 book at least I'm sure that 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.070
 will be for the dates of the fair 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.780
 of the book here in Buenos Aires so 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.460
 there they have that information 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.229
 they 're going to get translated into 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.639
 Spanish and that's great and the 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.620
 next book that I have is not from 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.780
 literature in reality but it's a book 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.190
 that I really like is a gift and I 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.660
 love is part of what he studied 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.320
 then only 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:54.180
 and it's paris mou actually in french 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.670
 means fashion so it's Paris fashion 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.730
 and it's a picture book it's very very 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:02.400
 cute and remember throughout the 20th century with 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.170
 iconic photographs of fashion and without 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.000
 thank you very much to the pretty one who is who 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.490
 he gave it to me finally I have books of 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.710
 editions see that I had the opportunity to 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.420
 go to a meeting at a snack that 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.310
 they did for the presentation of a 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.370
 new saga and the first book is rebellion 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.690
 of anaga francos and is a trilogy of the 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.300
 which I have the first book 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.940
 autographed this book is about a 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.710
 girl named Elena who dies 10 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.830
 resurrected several exits can be of 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.720
 2,056 in a world that already unknown and in 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.060
 this society that has already resolved 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.250
 many issues there is no disease sometimes 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.220
 everything very perfect but obviously this 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:40.590
 perfection is not so and everything goes 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.790
 coming to a rebellion a revolution and 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.880
 also make known 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:48.289
 yesterday nobody yesterday 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.990
 mayer 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:53.059
 a boy although he is really a clone 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.129
 and the clones do not have feelings in 

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:57.529
 this world but we will probably see 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:59.180
 how that changes throughout the book and 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:01.550
 This is a book by an Argentine author 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.830
 and now that I really want to read it 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.360
 and know how it also continues in all 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.219
 other books because they are also very 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.259
 interesting and finally I have memory 

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:11.119
 by leonardo patrick nani this is the 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:13.879
 second book in the trilogy of 

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:15.979
 multiverse the first book I read it and I 

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:18.409
 he liked quite a lot of topics 

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:20.539
 that I liked a lot but there are some 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:22.849
 things that not so much but I still have 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:24.199
 I want to continue with the saga and the truth 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:26.270
 that what I really liked about first is 

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:28.069
 that entertained me and kept me pretty 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.180
 trapped all the time to what was 

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:31.639
 happening what happened to the 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.439
 characters so I hope that follows 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:35.719
 also in this book and multiverse treats 

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:38.990
 about precisely multiverses where 

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:41.240
 we have two characters to Alex and Jenny 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.810
 that they can communicate through 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.810
 of the 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.760
 in some way but they do not know why 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.139
 they have to discover it and they end 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.210
 discovering that they are not in the same 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:52.160
 world are in two universes and that 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.870
 there are these multiverses if those 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.940
 story of the first book so I want 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.710
 know how you can get to follow this 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.110
 history things here I have the seven 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.430
 books that I get in January to March I 

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:03.380
 It seems that I am very good with my 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.850
 amounts to make a game of mine that 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.400
 she knows that my son finished 

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:09.560
 doing the 34 months but has like 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.450
 more than 20 books so this time I'm 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.850
 a little better and despite the fact that they are few 

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:18.200
 books this weighs the hardcover books 

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:19.970
 it weighs so I better go down this is 

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.889
 are all the books that I wanted them 

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.750
 show in this job tell me you are injured
