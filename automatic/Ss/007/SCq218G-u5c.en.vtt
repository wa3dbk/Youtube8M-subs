00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:06.940
 today is September 11, 2012 and without 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.889
 realize that 10 months have passed 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.440
 since it came out call of duty modern 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:14.049
 warfare 3 since we were able to buy it on 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.570
 first day but and I'm very happy because 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:20.080
 how are you seeing in the title those 4 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.720
 wonderful lyrics the m side and the 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.800
 beige and that had to fall and finally 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:30.550
 has fallen was a couple of days ago and nothing 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.950
 finally the first fad fell finally and I have the 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.200
 pleasure of bringing the commented to my channel 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.930
 so we go there as I always say 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.110
 hello everyone and maxi gamer and today we are 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.420
 once again here on the xbox channel and 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.700
 gamer and today I bring you a new gameplay 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.340
 commented this is about a game 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.190
 of call of duty modern warfare 3 and in the 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.720
 that I'm playing in domain mode 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.880
 well not exactly is the mode of 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.480
 domain now go on to explain it and I'm 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:01.300
 playing with the app 90 with the best weapon 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.100
 of the game the app 90 and above I took it 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.620
 super quiet because I carry it with 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.659
 extended chargers and with rapid fire 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.689
 we are an authentic beast of more 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:13.840
 to create a video explaining this weapon 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:16.719
 which is pretty good for me the best 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.140
 of the game and well what I was going to explain 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:22.569
 said that I am playing in the mode of 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.189
 domain but it's not exactly that way 

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:27.250
 of game actually what I 'm 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:29.170
 playing is the mercenary mode so that 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.750
 those who do not know is a game mode 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.869
 that encompasses three other game modes 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.060
 a duel by equipment low confirmed and 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.069
 domain and it is a game mode in which 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.920
 You have to go play alone you can not go 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:44.200
 to play with a group of friends so 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.090
 when I'm playing alone, I come 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.340
 to this game mode and so we avoid that 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.479
 other groups of people that tend to be 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.459
 better prepared then play with them and 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.979
 so nothing I will explain a little 

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:59.560
 the game because I think this is a 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.590
 of the items it deserves comments like this 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.929
 I was playing a little bit in that 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.479
 mercenary game mode is playing 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:09.849
 a pretty good class and it's gone up from 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.370
 level so I already have everything that 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.870
 I want to go to form I am playing 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.019
 with what is necessary 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.670
 to go to get fashions 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.370
 I'm playing with the gusts of 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.769
 specialist to help me because as 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.780
 the 2024 fashion streak and the 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:29.019
 I'm going to take her with 7 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.150
 but hey I guess all that already 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:34.060
 you can explain a little what I do 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.430
 When I usually go to play for fashion 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.549
 Well, I'm using the first advantage 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.170
 I'm using a second-line scavenger 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.030
 hard and good the third is not 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.760
 imperative I am using marksmanship 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.680
 stable but it serves me it serves me for 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.989
 aim before the enemies and there we see 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.170
 is already in the fashion streak so 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.819
 Stay tuned and good I wear the stripes of 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.260
 specialist and thanks to hard line with 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.049
 the first low and I already get 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.900
 prestidigitation then it seems to me that 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.340
 I have drawn fast, those would be 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.709
 more to choose 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.950
 and also hunter so we eat here 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.560
 I have already taken the streak of specialist 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.340
 and to say that in this game I already had 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:18.099
 practically for lost because if you see 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.280
 there the score the bonus game is left 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:23.080
 lot and I was no longer thinking of me out 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.209
 fashion but good when I got that 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.549
 the specialist and he was still killing and 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.549
 killing here you see that it kills me two 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:33.129
 bullets practically kills me two bullets 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:36.069
 practically the last weapon if it 's 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:37.460
 still two threads is visited what happened 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.740
 but good 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:43.250
 as I was saying when I saw that I started 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:45.290
 kill and kill and kill people and then what 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.260
 typical I started to get nervous but 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.200
 at the end between luck the weapon that 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:55.190
 I had my connection and I do not know what cocks 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:58.310
 more in the end came out I left love and 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:01.430
 good as we see here we have captured 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:05.300
 two flags the typical thing we are leaving 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:09.020
 that the enemies reappear in one and the 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:11.660
 it's true that I was in a lobby that 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.030
 I did some really good games this afternoon 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.560
 It was a lobby that good ended almost all 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.790
 the items with a proportion of more than 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:22.430
 three and we see here that I keep killing and 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.800
 I continue to kill here and that's when you 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.640
 you start to get nervous and I already had the 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.290
 Helping hands because you did not feel like it 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.880
 to get my first hand out of what 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.190
 I was playing here basically but 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.750
 as I say in this same game and the 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.750
 I thought it was lost here, it has needed me 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.980
 shoot pilla be behind here 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:45.680
 it would take a streak more or less 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:49.040
 17 here and I'm still looking for people 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.500
 I find that way and how you see is that it is 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.120
 pretty flippant as it kills those of grief 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.700
 mint and here we're going to get to a point 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.610
 quite important of the game as 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:02.000
 we see now a land and directly 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:05.180
 when I take off, everything gets normal 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.050
 he killed those two directly enough 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.990
 weird and I'm on a run of 22 me 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.450
 it seems right now I will find the 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.660
 next two I will kill me I do not eat 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.940
 see very well here we see and here we see 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.280
 we have the girl I saw the shot directly 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.290
 because the game was about to 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.840
 finish leads to finish the game at 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:29.060
 final we get it by winning and not 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.700
 I get the double points for being 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.910
 inside the flag but as I say 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:37.070
 I'm still very happy to be able to have that 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.960
 fashionable because good to say that new 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.820
 that we have taken out is not that they are very 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.850
 legal is precisely I do not know who 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.980
 complaint that wants to understand that what 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:48.110
 understand so nothing here ends the 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.220
 departure as I always say a like without 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.160
 favorites 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:54.500
 this video helps a lot and a greeting 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.100
 this has been maxi gamer and even the 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.730
 next 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.730
 goodbye
