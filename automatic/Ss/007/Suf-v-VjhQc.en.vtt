00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.400 
make my own antenna for the downstairs
TV<00:00:10.260> don't<00:00:10.769> really<00:00:11.040> watch<00:00:11.190> TV<00:00:11.219> downstairs<00:00:11.880> but

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:12.410 
TV don't really watch TV downstairs but

TV don't really watch TV downstairs but
not<00:00:13.410> what<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.679> hell<00:00:13.889> why<00:00:14.309> not<00:00:14.490> make<00:00:14.670> one<00:00:14.880> right

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:15.049 
not what the hell why not make one right

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.099 
not what the hell why not make one right
um<00:00:16.049> so<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.619> simply<00:00:17.279> cut<00:00:17.850> two<00:00:18.210> coat<00:00:18.600> hangers<00:00:18.869> in

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
um so I simply cut two coat hangers in

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.460 
um so I simply cut two coat hangers in
half<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.710> got<00:00:20.400> rid<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:21.090> hooks<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.840> clean<00:00:22.350> off

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
half I got rid of the hooks I clean off

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.710 
half I got rid of the hooks I clean off
all<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.710> paint<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.310> was<00:00:23.460> on<00:00:23.699> him<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.150> then<00:00:24.480> I

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
all the paint that was on him and then I

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.750 
all the paint that was on him and then I
stripped<00:00:25.230> some<00:00:25.680> rg6<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:27.000> cable<00:00:28.310> and<00:00:29.310> took<00:00:29.640> out

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
stripped some rg6 of cable and took out

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.900 
stripped some rg6 of cable and took out
the<00:00:29.789> copper<00:00:30.150> core<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.890> use<00:00:31.890> those<00:00:32.040> for<00:00:32.160> my<00:00:32.430> leads

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
the copper core I use those for my leads

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
the copper core I use those for my leads
I<00:00:33.410> simply<00:00:34.410> cross<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.250> two<00:00:35.460> antennas<00:00:36.149> one<00:00:36.630> goes

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
I simply cross the two antennas one goes

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.750 
I simply cross the two antennas one goes
from<00:00:37.050> there<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.620> here<00:00:37.649> now<00:00:38.100> goes<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.489> here<00:00:38.670> to

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
from there to here now goes in here to

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.610 
from there to here now goes in here to
there<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.210> then<00:00:40.140> they<00:00:40.350> simply<00:00:40.860> plug<00:00:41.129> into<00:00:41.309> a

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
there and then they simply plug into a

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.760 
there and then they simply plug into a
transformer<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.950> got<00:00:44.789> that's<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.239> VHF<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.410> old

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
transformer I got that's the VHF and old

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.580 
transformer I got that's the VHF and old
VHF<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.610> found<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.180> garage<00:00:48.539> later<00:00:49.260> or

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
VHF I found it in the garage later or

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.709 
VHF I found it in the garage later or
not<00:00:49.800> um<00:00:50.989> I'm<00:00:51.989> debating<00:00:52.260> on<00:00:52.800> buying<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.550> UHF<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
not um I'm debating on buying a UHF the

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.950 
not um I'm debating on buying a UHF the
ultra<00:00:55.079> high-frequency<00:00:55.289> one<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.420> don't<00:00:57.420> know<00:00:57.719> if

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
ultra high-frequency one I don't know if

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.080 
ultra high-frequency one I don't know if
that<00:00:58.140> will<00:00:58.230> make<00:00:58.410> any<00:00:58.590> difference<00:00:59.100> or<00:00:59.250> not<00:00:59.399> if

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
that will make any difference or not if

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.840 
that will make any difference or not if

nearly all HD and I'm getting about a
hundred<00:01:20.970> percent<00:01:21.530> signal<00:01:22.549> and<00:01:23.549> that's<00:01:23.790> being

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
hundred percent signal and that's being

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.810

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
do to hide this so here is my antenna in

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.190 
do to hide this so here is my antenna in
the<00:01:55.829> window<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.420> reason<00:01:57.719> why<00:01:57.899> it's

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
the window that is the reason why it's

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.380 
the window that is the reason why it's
so<00:01:58.469> short<00:01:58.829> because<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.310> wanted<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.880> fit<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.210> in

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
so short because I wanted to fit it in

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.740 
so short because I wanted to fit it in
the<00:02:01.229> basement<00:02:01.439> window<00:02:02.009> here<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.570> it<00:02:03.570> actually

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
the basement window here and it actually

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.440 
the basement window here and it actually
works<00:02:04.049> good<00:02:04.340> like<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.460> said<00:02:05.640> I'm<00:02:05.759> getting<00:02:05.880> 100%

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
works good like I said I'm getting 100%

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.380 
works good like I said I'm getting 100%
signal<00:02:07.409> as<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:08.220> right<00:02:08.369> now<00:02:08.489> on<00:02:08.729> most<00:02:09.030> channels

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
signal as the right now on most channels

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.140 
signal as the right now on most channels
and<00:02:09.750> not<00:02:10.349> only<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.800> it's<00:02:11.009> cloudy<00:02:11.310> Oh

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.429 
and not only that it's cloudy Oh
so<00:02:12.439> imagine<00:02:13.439> our<00:02:13.709> nice<00:02:13.890> clear<00:02:14.189> day<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:15.439> signal

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
so imagine our nice clear day the signal

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.500 
so imagine our nice clear day the signal
will<00:02:16.769> probably<00:02:17.040> go<00:02:17.129> up<00:02:17.340> what<00:02:18.060> should<00:02:18.209> I<00:02:18.239> do<00:02:18.299> to

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
will probably go up what should I do to

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.100 
will probably go up what should I do to
hide<00:02:18.720> that<00:02:18.989> so<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.829> don't<00:02:20.010> see<00:02:20.310> an<00:02:20.670> ugly

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
hide that so you don't see an ugly

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.020 
hide that so you don't see an ugly
antenna<00:02:22.110> well<00:02:22.709> I<00:02:22.739> got<00:02:23.099> the<00:02:23.280> South<00:02:23.549> Park<00:02:23.790> gang

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
antenna well I got the South Park gang

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.289 
antenna well I got the South Park gang
blocking<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.989> view<00:02:25.170> of<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.860> antenna<00:02:26.340> now<00:02:26.670> you

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
blocking the view of the antenna now you

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.410 
blocking the view of the antenna now you
think<00:02:27.810> this<00:02:28.110> might<00:02:28.319> degrade<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.730> signal<00:02:30.180> bit

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
think this might degrade the signal bit

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.539 
think this might degrade the signal bit
well<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:31.049> actually<00:02:31.439> doesn't<00:02:31.799> on<00:02:32.069> some

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
well it actually doesn't on some

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.940 
well it actually doesn't on some
channels<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.329> actually<00:02:33.810> improved<00:02:34.319> it<00:02:34.500> believe

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
channels it actually improved it believe

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.550 
channels it actually improved it believe
