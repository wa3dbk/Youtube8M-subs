00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.410 

the<00:02:47.430> scope<00:02:47.670> is<00:02:47.850> like<00:02:49.190> just<00:02:50.190> like<00:02:50.310> this

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
the scope is like just like this

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.410 
the scope is like just like this
and<00:02:53.050> it<00:02:53.140> has<00:02:53.290> a<00:02:53.319> camera<00:02:53.560> on<00:02:53.860> the<00:02:53.980> end<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.420> they

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
and it has a camera on the end and they

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.850 
and it has a camera on the end and they
can<00:02:55.540> turn<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.870> camera<00:02:56.170> around<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:56.650> look

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
can turn the camera around to look

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.260 
can turn the camera around to look
backwards

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.050 

so<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.020> head<00:03:01.170> of<00:03:01.290> you<00:03:01.440> know<00:03:01.560> like<00:03:01.800> this<00:03:02.060> thus

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
so the head of you know like this thus

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.700 
so the head of you know like this thus
far<00:03:03.330> in<00:03:04.430> basically<00:03:07.910> here's<00:03:08.910> what<00:03:09.090> it

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:09.710 
far in basically here's what it

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:18.800 
far in basically here's what it
essentially<00:03:15.890> so<00:03:16.890> this<00:03:17.700> is<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:18.270> inside<00:03:18.420> you

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
essentially so this is the inside you

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:32.600 
essentially so this is the inside you
know<00:03:19.520> the<00:03:20.520> outside<00:03:21.060> view

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.080 

is<00:03:33.210> pretty<00:03:35.150> sweet

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090
