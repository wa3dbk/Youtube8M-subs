 or I implode even when I was digging 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.000
 could cause air to tear up 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.730

 in this decreed at the previous year 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.329

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.879

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.339

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.290
 do not even wait four months or just 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.490

 I will give my computer the edition 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.470

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.640
 So without a lot of footage so well 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.079
 the only thing you see there is 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.119
 really such a small teaser more 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.740
 not it is nothing to see ingame and 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.030
 Only the two cover last games too 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.530
 see and fill needs to be said 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.229
 Alone this video already has 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.090
 enough for me to quiver in the lust 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.070
 and to release with joy 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.649

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.270

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.379
 This weekend I have a lot there 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.030
 Have a nice time! 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.780
 incredible 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.760
 And yes, I always have it now 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.140
 also a little bit clean up so far 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.930
 wiped away in erkrath and so on and on 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.520
 so not clear that on but that 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.400
 was really such a bomb the 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.750
 nintendo has therefore let which burst 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.020
 not counting in life before all 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.430
 not that in november 2014 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.290
 comes out that's that's is a four 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.930
 months in four words we have the 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:41.220
 new pokémon editions in hand and 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:44.580
 would never have expected that in life 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.170
 which is now so short or so short 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.290
 be announced and then also 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.170
 So yes, I'm looking forward to it 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.200
 every case again on a 3ds 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.790
 Execution of the fighting zone the first and 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.269
 the best fight scene ever 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.950
 Pokemon gave the first thing ingame 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.130
 really also strategically extreme 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.170
 demanded the fight zone with mine 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:12.030
 Brother excluded and so on 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:14.220
 on and on or hit that was 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.870
 pretty awesome so let me 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.880
 your thoughts on the two new ones 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.920
 pokémon edition now in four months 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.150
 already appearing to be heard 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.019
 you follow the most and yes 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.340
 I just write in the 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.970
 comments I am pleased as I said on 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.110
 Most on the fighting zone and possibly 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.670
 become now 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.840
 yogurt even plays an important role 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.849
 Maybe the two sound 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.769
 even mega developments, I even think 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.540
 pretty kohls and mega developers from bonn 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:45.319
 or such a mega development of kay 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.659
 uwe would have somehow like him 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:50.629
 all these elements from xy now 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:52.220
 in this 39 here in the third because with 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.260
 that's going to be pretty good 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.970
 awesome, I'm really looking forward to it 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.060
 I'm very loaded because I could 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:02.720
 explode I could crush things 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.950
 and what I know but what good should 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.790
 now only a small announcement 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.250
