00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.250
 so around the very small car work 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.800
 do share with you and not so sweet yes 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.389
 yes it was the ugliest car 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.460
 people don't want to be found dead 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.720
 this snow and your feet move 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.750
 yes that can also set how you do that 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.750
 want 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:31.340
 this is the slow 14 so not the pvv 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.040
 xiv that other who still has 50 percent 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.450
 more now tom meters so tell me so 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.290
 I found nobody so dangerous 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.220
 to have 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.220
 I really thought that was just that 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.150
 and then you are someone who is just ow 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.320
 beasts of cars and say hip and 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:53.989
 what a porsche 911 gts it was 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.260
 creates 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:02.329
 small very light very many horsepower it 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:04.699
 means to do more hp this is 360 hp 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:09.229
 and then a car that the half-empty of 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:14.000
 feather that evil and gates that heavy it 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:15.560
 will be just as heavy this and that and b's 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.020
 that's just 0 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.890
 and then the fire and that you pull on one 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.880
 blow even in fear at 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.850
 bring together 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.470
 that is what this is actually very style 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:33.170
 you here with you 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:35.410
 bring what I find special is that 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.410
 clapping 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.910
 so everything is fun and everything is fun 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.910
 just 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:57.010
 rinsing with also 500 hp so you do n't know 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:02:01.410
 Agree that is already a mustang minutes 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:07.840
 work on someone was going to have that 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:12.119
 anyway rhine no then what do you have 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.119
 then cars you need to find as much fun 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:22.360
 could like what a grin it is 10 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.130
 You can easily do that in this work 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.410
 useful then you can drive as you can 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.150
 policy remained what her for or what 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.830
 lower ever was the lowest wild 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.660
 shout like a prince 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:36.520
 yes see if thats what you make the difference 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.900
 notes sport 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:43.200
 sympathy not if not allowed 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.200
 should be something that you do want to call it 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.930
 we will compare you to those three 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.320
 cars that this how they and it 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.320
 to estimate 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.200
 well don't compare parents that i have i 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.960
 generate easy noise 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.040
 I like that 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.330
 and I also have a range rover there 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.670
 you need a little meter same as that 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:11.080
 is a very quiet soft moving car 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.880
 and how comfortable is in the engine 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.460
 we can still join you no because you feel 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.560
 no training no 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:22.110
 the things in asia or something 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.110
 hears nothing becomes a little season 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:30.620
 manpower at the bottom so maserati that this 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:34.190
 regrets also that I just 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:41.659
 you can still order as a ratty like that at 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:43.340
 the power bass that they dq on my god what 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:50.569
 this really is what those other cars can't 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:52.040
 have oh and it's a linear go 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.970
 come and do it 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.970
 no that is indeed normal 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.390
 it 's very relaxed 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.580
 with the dragon that is concerned is the 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.650
 combination of that range rover and such 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:12.740
 racing device without the huge noise 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:15.440
 and the noise and the simplicity and what me 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.390
 have two computer screens and a computer chip 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.160
 and 17 moving parts and what there is 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.560
 it really just a very easy thing 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.560
 for yes it is indeed a real introduction 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.930
 car after gambling iat 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:33.250
 your jaguar the back and aston martin 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:33.250
 in the front but it's not bad 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.830
 I am such 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.360
 i don't think i'm really a pimp 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.040
 Parent ever think that I would never 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.530
 more wanted to be old 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.090
 that are very bad car and also if you 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.160
 the inside you have no room at all 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.260
 which is the battery completely packed 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.390
 this is this between the batteries 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.960
 and we are also really going to be through 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.730
 the bend have an idea May 19 roams 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.740
 you are that the here is that 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.330
 center of gravity very low there is something you know 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.919
 none of it 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.560
 I have to be a very tight race older 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:11.300
 mac this is feeling now and what a bit 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:12.710
 sometimes you would ever be the well that's you 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.479
 collection you again once it 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.250
 think to me so in things the better the 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.630
 district have like everywhere I looked was 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.340
 floor a lot of distances then I thought 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.050
 ok yes we make distances now 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.850
 Amsterdam on way help to on way 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.690
 because I then electric car find that 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.030
 that does 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:30.080
 after then no no no then not and 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:32.390
 that is now possible but you see with nostalgia 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.610
 often sees and groningen 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.450
 so see an Amsterdam go make two 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.840
 three appointments 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:40.880
 no yes it is true that there is somewhere 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.930
 if you are somewhere then you need a moment 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.500
 hour or two hours 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.510
 yes to one 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.260
 but in the charger like if you like the 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:51.450
 even push those drawers to 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.220
 inside yes you are ready 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:58.740
 look like i was after about the laares 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:06:00.390
 and you know how to mark it if yes yes 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.250
 and the end say did the year 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.500
 you everywhere fast chargers that are from that 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.430
 things that in 20 minutes 50% the weather 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.530
 throw 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:11.250
 and then you just finished and it is 

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:14.640
 absolute well that i just while 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.260
 your neighbor needs its own tesla 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.640
 I come to Amsterdam this rain 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.090
 years to show that says yes and 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.090
 report
