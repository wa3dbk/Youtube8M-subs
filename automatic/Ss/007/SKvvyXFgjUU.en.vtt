00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
this time stops short of where you

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.620 
this time stops short of where you
stopped<00:02:47.810> last<00:02:48.140> time<00:02:49.120> because<00:02:50.120> you're<00:02:50.360> trying

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
to build an opaque layer towards the tip

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.960 
to build an opaque layer towards the tip
of<00:02:53.569> the<00:02:53.690> nail<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:54.260> less<00:02:55.130> so<00:02:55.400> towards<00:02:55.819> the

of the nail and less so towards the

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.320 
of the nail and less so towards the
middle<00:02:56.530> again<00:02:57.530> wiping<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.519> access<00:02:59.000> and

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
middle again wiping the access and

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.840 
middle again wiping the access and
tapping<00:03:00.080> along<00:03:00.230> where<00:03:00.950> you<00:03:00.980> stopped<00:03:01.549> to<00:03:01.819> make

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
tapping along where you stopped to make

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.509 
tapping along where you stopped to make
sure<00:03:02.150> that<00:03:02.330> it<00:03:02.480> blends<00:03:02.870> if<00:03:03.860> you<00:03:04.040> have<00:03:04.190> a<00:03:04.220> few

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
sure that it blends if you have a few

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.430 
sure that it blends if you have a few
gaps<00:03:04.760> that's<00:03:05.209> okay<00:03:05.600> we're<00:03:05.840> gonna<00:03:05.930> do<00:03:06.200> another

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
gaps that's okay we're gonna do another

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.490 
gaps that's okay we're gonna do another
layer<00:03:07.269> so<00:03:08.269> once<00:03:08.480> that<00:03:08.569> is<00:03:08.840> blended<00:03:09.290> you'll

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
layer so once that is blended you'll

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.890 
layer so once that is blended you'll
cure<00:03:09.830> again<00:03:10.190> and<00:03:10.489> we'll<00:03:11.269> move<00:03:11.390> on<00:03:11.569> to<00:03:11.690> the

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
cure again and we'll move on to the

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.150 
cure again and we'll move on to the
third<00:03:12.110> layer

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.510 

at<00:03:18.120> this<00:03:18.270> point<00:03:18.660> we<00:03:19.050> are<00:03:19.080> going<00:03:19.230> to<00:03:19.770> once<00:03:20.400> again

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
at this point we are going to once again

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.790 
at this point we are going to once again
add<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.060> little<00:03:21.540> bit<00:03:21.780> of<00:03:21.870> Polish<00:03:22.110> to<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.560> very

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
add a little bit of Polish to the very

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.840 
add a little bit of Polish to the very
end<00:03:23.160> of<00:03:24.380> an<00:03:25.380> L<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:25.980> this<00:03:26.460> time<00:03:26.670> you'll

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
end of an L and this time you'll

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.550 
end of an L and this time you'll
probably<00:03:26.880> add<00:03:27.270> a<00:03:27.300> little<00:03:27.630> less<00:03:27.960> than<00:03:28.200> you<00:03:28.350> did
