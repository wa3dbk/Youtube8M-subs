00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.820
 Hello dear viewers with you again 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.859
 ridgid and I continue to pass call of 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.880
 duty modern warfare 3 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:25.429
 and we continue to rake 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.730
 effects of an electromagnetic pulse 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:32.860
 Well, naturally not alone but with the squad 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.870
 led by sergeant pauli 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.410
 the last part we found out that this 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.760
 some kind of cool on top 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.640
 presidential race but what you really 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.170
 very ruined and Dima our heroes 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.420
 wrong and maybe not so wrong 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:52.900
 knows and here we met his like 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.090
 now we have to cross each other 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.910
 the last fight the last difficult fight 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.780
 absolutely without any technology only 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.780
 firearm 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:09.950
 as I understand somewhere near the capitol 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.380
 I think we will not go there 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.360
 still we play them hitman blood 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.620
 money 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:21.290
 infinity ward is less reserved to say 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.470
 less reckless than 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.750
 The eidos of this is of course not afford 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.730
 can't even the capitol how many times 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.410
 destroyed 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.409
 since their films even now 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.499
 even 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:39.060
 count at least 100 films 

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:41.789
 and its exactly this at least 2 a 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.130
 ahead of us quite difficult fight and 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:47.719
 by the way with good china very much he left 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.869
 just wonderful and difficult it is so that 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:55.140
 it's raining or it's dark 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:58.849
 devotes only fire which was 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:02.009
 everywhere just after the explosion 

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:03.569
 now they have missed me very much 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.049
 crawling literally on the belly 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:08.910
 doing some movie soldier 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.569
 trained and do not remember some kind of military 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.930
 film 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:15.799
 of this type save ordinary ryan there 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.720
 soldier just live what nonsense why 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:23.220
 why do we crawl than we need it 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:27.709
 remember the screen says when you find yourself 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.910
 on the battlefield you'll dream about what 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:33.870
 dig under the ground just to not get 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:37.310
 bullets in some position pose 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.900
 really helpful took a machine gun 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.790
 many have asked me why i am past 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.700
 parts did not use the machine gun but here 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:49.620
 among the spectators took a machine gun with him night 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.690
 without him building a better century 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.810
 I probably noticed I tried right 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.900
 passage use 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.060
 can be a variety of weapons because 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.880
 all optics shot from these 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.000
 shotgun rifles tried everything for you 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.349
 show all the fun 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.980
 no you do not think that passage 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:13.610
 coming to an end and ahead at least 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.010
 4 missions and who especially do not flatter yourself 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.849
 little you have to see 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:23.459
 my passage 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:27.349
 and I hear some kind of signal is coming 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.349
 from this building listen 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.770
 I 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.940
 position natalya you serve want more 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.819
 settings numb 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.920
 to label yourself 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:48.249
 no longer this signal we will stop 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:52.510
 performance of tasks and here I understand it 

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:54.700
 place they just want to bomb now we 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.810
 limited time and we need both 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.709
 you can quickly get out of creation 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:04.120
 whisper a green signal 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:06.969
 to prostate bombardment and legs 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.719
 Apparently the command does not suspect the 

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:12.639
 cut survived to still go 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:16.090
 imagine how was in real life later hands 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:18.729
 shook the soldiers this situation is 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.060
 above scary is actually a word of their own 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:24.070
 same 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:26.830
 rockets was destroyed and generally now 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:30.120
 can move as fast as possible 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:33.720
 so far my time is not mine 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:38.530
 limited but gaze nasa boundaries mom 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:44.020
 a few literally a few now 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:46.979
 By the way, I shoot pp-2000 I do not know how 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.509
 call it square anyway for free 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:52.690
 submachine gun one of the most come 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:54.320
 life is quite rare in the game 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.510
 weapon 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.060
 not generally found around used in 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:02.930
 mostly very exact sacraments 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:07.010
 special services for the first time in my such 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:10.180
 the item appeared in the games series with iphone 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:14.540
 filter as far as I know, maybe earlier 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:17.000
 as I understand it to get from the roof of the building 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.710
 and the eggs just go for 7 climb 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.710
 on the roof of this building is no easy task 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:24.710
 he and so I grabbed the rocket very much 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:28.180
 strange that not all of them died there 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:31.330
 took a comfortable position on top 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.650
 him on the board distant singing effective 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.840
 will be less now on and 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.160
 free 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:43.350
 because it seems that it is possible to come to an end 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:46.780
 move forward no matter how 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.360
 this signal is still repeated in very 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.010
 strongly actually responds 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.110
 but in real life I would tell you so 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:56.320
 everything and it was repeated repeated until 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.010
 the end because it is precisely in 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.710
 dams 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.280
 the Americans were not three soldiers they 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.540
 cherish 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:09.670
 trying to save it and probably somewhere 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:11.470
 starting from here until 2 minutes now mass 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:15.330
 exactly two minutes 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:18.160
 move the rolls quickly 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.860
 the end of the missions will remind one more 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.810
 film 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:25.390
 more precisely not another movie film which 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:29.950
 I mentioned earlier literally three 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:30.960
 weeks ago by this shattered 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:34.210
 aisle 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:36.970
 We get out there creating play that's who 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:39.310
 I'm going to be overwhelmed by man now 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.210
 finished off well krasava in general you get everything 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:45.790
 Medal of Honor 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:49.390
 dude you are well done you killed 16 of my nerves 

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:51.940
 cells now they do not expect 

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:58.920
 benefit the control point is very close and 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:07:02.070
 so then went for a resident but 

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:03.780
 but it is generally scripted and not as 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:05.970
 here you can not run ahead of time 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.280
 okay now there is no time to think about it 

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:12.350
 need to fight well fight both 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:15.050
 real gallant address 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:18.390
 state and non-state 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:21.960
 intelligence is shorter just fight 

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:25.170
 good soldier will tell you on hard 

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:28.170
 passed this moment is extremely difficult here 

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:32.010
 whale soldiers generally not killed not 

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:34.910
 seems to chip all the way through to the plus 

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:38.310
 to everything they become some 

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:40.410
 impenetrable but maybe meters 

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.750
 showed swelling stand higher trying to get through 

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:44.280
 on hard 

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:47.460
 so you all we almost got to 

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:53.710
 we light the roof we light the signal lights 

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:56.780
 green all year signal 

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:59.230
 the bombing is canceled and it's all just 

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:02.980
 up shaved reminds cinema and klinsky 

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:02.980
 just yes thank you 

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:12.040
 hello soon 

00:08:09.409 --> 00:08:18.870
 we beat we land on the ground 

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:18.870
 on balls would you for such words on balls
