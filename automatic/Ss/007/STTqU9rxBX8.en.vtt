flight out so this is how you do it you

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.909 
flight out so this is how you do it you
make<00:00:06.420> yourself<00:00:06.450> a<00:00:06.870> drill<00:00:07.109> along<00:00:07.440> this<00:00:07.620> string

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
make yourself a drill along this string

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.560 
make yourself a drill along this string
Line<00:00:08.130> which<00:00:08.400> should<00:00:08.670> be<00:00:08.820> about<00:00:08.970> half<00:00:09.269> an<00:00:09.450> inch

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
Line which should be about half an inch

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.709 
Line which should be about half an inch
deep<00:00:10.250> you<00:00:11.250> can<00:00:11.429> do<00:00:11.580> this<00:00:11.759> just<00:00:11.969> by<00:00:12.179> taking<00:00:12.420> out

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
deep you can do this just by taking out

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.730 
deep you can do this just by taking out
tip<00:00:13.530> it<00:00:13.650> up<00:00:13.769> inside<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.280> trap<00:00:15.020> all<00:00:16.020> right<00:00:16.170> take
