there's lots of key issues because the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.700 
there's lots of key issues because the
program<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.079> really<00:00:40.350> very<00:00:40.829> very<00:00:41.010> simple<00:00:41.309> and

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
program is really very very simple and

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.200 
program is really very very simple and
in<00:00:43.710> many<00:00:43.950> ways<00:00:44.270> people<00:00:46.789> oversimplify<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
in many ways people oversimplify to the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.389 
in many ways people oversimplify to the
point<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.780> not<00:00:49.530> really<00:00:49.890> following<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
point of not really following the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.369 
point of not really following the
program<00:00:50.910> where<00:00:51.570> they<00:00:51.750> think<00:00:52.170> they're

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
program where they think they're

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.810 
program where they think they're
following<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.890> program<00:00:53.309> when<00:00:53.640> they're

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
following the program when they're

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.350 
following the program when they're
really<00:00:53.969> not

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
really not

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.439 
really not
or<00:00:55.199> they<00:00:56.129> haven't<00:00:56.430> done<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.730> numbers<00:00:57.090> enough

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
or they haven't done the numbers enough

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.619 
or they haven't done the numbers enough
to<00:00:58.020> just<00:00:58.289> be<00:00:58.440> familiar<00:00:59.070> this<00:01:00.030> isn't<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.390> diet

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
to just be familiar this isn't a diet

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.630 
to just be familiar this isn't a diet
that<00:01:00.780> requires<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.440> lot<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.739> weighing<00:01:02.160> and

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
that requires a lot of weighing and

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.090 
that requires a lot of weighing and
measuring<00:01:03.470> but<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.589> don't<00:01:04.769> have<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.979> at<00:01:05.070> least

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
measuring but you don't have to at least

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.250 
measuring but you don't have to at least
learn<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.700> basics<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.810> know<00:01:06.990> what<00:01:07.140> you're

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
learn the basics so you know what you're

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.870 
learn the basics so you know what you're
dealing<00:01:07.439> with<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.950> understand<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.700> most

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
dealing with to understand that most

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.750 
dealing with to understand that most
fruits<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.260> single-digit<00:01:11.159> fat

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
fruits have a single-digit fat

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.289 
fruits have a single-digit fat
percentage<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.409> most<00:01:13.860> vegetables<00:01:14.520> have

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
percentage and that most vegetables have

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.730 
percentage and that most vegetables have
a<00:01:15.439> have<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.470> protein<00:01:16.979> percentage<00:01:17.670> in<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.970> teens

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
a have a protein percentage in the teens

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.080 
a have a protein percentage in the teens
to<00:01:19.740> just<00:01:19.950> know<00:01:20.100> some<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> little<00:01:20.790> bitty

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
to just know some of the little bitty

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.050 
to just know some of the little bitty
basics<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.680> fruits<00:01:23.040> carry<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.549> lot<00:01:23.820> more

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
basics that the fruits carry a lot more

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.840 
basics that the fruits carry a lot more
calories<00:01:24.390> than<00:01:25.290> vegetables<00:01:26.040> as<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.310> rule

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.030 

but<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.689> think<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.020> primary<00:01:31.260> thing<00:01:31.500> about<00:01:31.860> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
but I think the primary thing about the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.960 
but I think the primary thing about the
diet<00:01:32.330> is

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.899 

then<00:01:37.210> it's<00:01:37.390> a<00:01:37.480> program

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
then it's a program

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.739 
then it's a program
where<00:01:39.539> you<00:01:40.289> experience<00:01:40.710> no<00:01:41.189> cravings<00:01:41.819> if

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:42.749 
where you experience no cravings if

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:44.899 
where you experience no cravings if
you're<00:01:42.929> experiencing<00:01:43.560> any<00:01:43.859> cravings<00:01:44.579> at<00:01:44.729> all

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
you're experiencing any cravings at all

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.419 
you're experiencing any cravings at all
