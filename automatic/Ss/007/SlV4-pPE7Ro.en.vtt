 Hi everyone, today I wanted to do this 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:11.040
 video to show you the game 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.679
 nova shooter and go gameloft for the 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.330
 shooter lovers I think this one 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.880
 here is one of the best games that 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:23.759
 at least I could find 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:25.199
 but unfortunately for 3 euros 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:29.130
 I think we can do this 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:32.730
 sacrifice if you really want a little 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.220
 then have fun with the images that 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.260
 you will see in this video 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.309
 unfortunately they are not like as in 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.220
 reality but in reality 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.470
 the graphics are much, much better 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.229
 but with this video I hope that you 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.690
 can you get an idea of ​​what it is 

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:52.439
 fluid on our samsung galaxy s 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:56.220
 this game with a decent indeed 

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:59.189
 excellent graphics then and now I will make you 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.769
 see briefly how it works and I'll be 

00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:05.420
 of few words 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.420
 and then I found it a match 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:21.840
 here 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:21.840
 the controls are really handle them 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.890
 santoro 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:32.670
 it does it in soft or stuff that's enough i hope 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:38.190
 that with this video you made yourself 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:41.190
 an idea of ​​this is my opinion 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.590
 done really well with this vi 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.250
