00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.279 
is funny because that should have been
the<00:02:08.220> very<00:02:08.429> first<00:02:08.729> thing<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.030> did

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
the very first thing I did

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.229 
the very first thing I did
but<00:02:10.439> instead<00:02:11.189> of<00:02:11.340> trying<00:02:11.519> to<00:02:11.579> lock<00:02:11.730> doors<00:02:12.000> and

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
but instead of trying to lock doors and

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.289 
but instead of trying to lock doors and
run<00:02:12.950> anyway<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.010> as<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.400> started<00:02:14.879> pray<00:02:15.090> for

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
run anyway so as I started pray for

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.069 
run anyway so as I started pray for
protection<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.959> want<00:02:16.379> that<00:02:16.609> so<00:02:17.629> this<00:02:18.629> dream<00:02:18.900> is

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.079 
protection I want that so this dream is

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.289 
protection I want that so this dream is
in<00:02:19.469> obvious<00:02:19.620> contrast<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.519> the<00:02:20.730> earlier<00:02:21.060> dream

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
in obvious contrast to the earlier dream

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.360 
in obvious contrast to the earlier dream
that<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.480> had<00:02:21.540> where<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.439> baby<00:02:23.099> lion

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
that I had where the baby lion

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.509 
that I had where the baby lion
represented<00:02:24.030> yahushua<00:02:24.859> this<00:02:25.859> line<00:02:26.069> I<00:02:26.099> believe

represented yahushua this line I believe

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.089 
represented yahushua this line I believe
is<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.760> one<00:02:26.909> represented<00:02:27.569> in<00:02:27.689> first<00:02:27.930> Peter<00:02:28.230> 58

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
is the one represented in first Peter 58

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.640 
is the one represented in first Peter 58
