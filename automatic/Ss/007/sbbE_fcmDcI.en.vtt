00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.169 

people<00:00:28.740> learn<00:00:28.890> languages<00:00:29.400> by<00:00:29.580> listening<00:00:29.939> and

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
people learn languages by listening and

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.179 
people learn languages by listening and
the<00:00:30.359> brain<00:00:30.510> creates<00:00:30.869> more<00:00:31.080> synapses<00:00:31.439> to

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
the brain creates more synapses to

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.180 
the brain creates more synapses to
accommodate<00:00:33.090> in<00:00:33.360> your<00:00:33.719> information<00:00:34.190> those

high pitch and high frequency music can

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.930 
high pitch and high frequency music can
cause<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.600> mess<00:00:48.600> with<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.899> synapses

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
cause you to mess with the synapses

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.860 
cause you to mess with the synapses
cause<00:00:50.940> your<00:00:51.090> brain<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.449> mess<00:00:51.570> with<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
synapses causing brain damage making you

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.569 
synapses causing brain damage making you
go<00:00:55.649> crazy<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.489> kill<00:00:57.270> yourself<00:00:58.250> now<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.309> age

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
that's actually it's actually 72 around

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.539 
that's actually it's actually 72 around
1820<00:01:12.020> because<00:01:13.020> right<00:01:13.320> after<00:01:13.409> 20<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.159> it's

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
1820 because right after 20 this it's

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.090 
1820 because right after 20 this it's
proven<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.530> right<00:01:16.530> after<00:01:16.799> that

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
proven that right after that

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:26.010 
proven that right after that
your<00:01:18.689> starts<00:01:20.460> losing<00:01:24.150> capability<00:01:25.150> to<00:01:25.180> pick<00:01:25.900> up

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
your starts losing capability to pick up

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.840 
your starts losing capability to pick up
high<00:01:26.200> frequencies<00:01:26.770> so<00:01:27.070> that's<00:01:27.310> how<00:01:27.520> the<00:01:27.549> age

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
high frequencies so that's how the age

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.440 
high frequencies so that's how the age
of<00:01:27.880> the<00:01:28.119> New<00:01:28.270> York's<00:01:28.540> and

grooving on your own just get a sample
of<00:01:40.719> music

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479
