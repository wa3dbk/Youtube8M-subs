the<00:02:04.039> whole<00:02:04.219> different<00:02:04.459> game<00:02:04.579> a<00:02:04.929> linebacker

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
the whole different game a linebacker

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.979 
the whole different game a linebacker
closer<00:02:06.409> of<00:02:06.709> don't<00:02:07.610> see<00:02:07.789> as<00:02:08.000> much<00:02:08.269> but<00:02:08.420> safety

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
closer of don't see as much but safety

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.890 
closer of don't see as much but safety
you<00:02:09.170> get<00:02:09.289> to<00:02:09.410> get<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:10.069> run<00:02:10.190> around<00:02:10.250> see<00:02:10.900> every

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
you get to get to run around see every

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.319 
you get to get to run around see every
bottle<00:02:12.140> miss<00:02:12.260> Beales<00:02:12.470> so<00:02:12.769> there's<00:02:13.519> just<00:02:13.700> got

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:14.329 
bottle miss Beales so there's just got

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:15.610 
bottle miss Beales so there's just got
to<00:02:14.360> be<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:14.480> lot<00:02:14.630> quicker<00:02:14.810> as<00:02:15.049> a<00:02:15.079> linebacker<00:02:15.290> i

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
to be a lot quicker as a linebacker i

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.270 
to be a lot quicker as a linebacker i
guess<00:02:15.860> for<00:02:16.400> he<00:02:16.880> reads<00:02:17.150> nothing<00:02:17.450> like<00:02:17.540> that<00:02:17.720> so

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
guess for he reads nothing like that so

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.470 
guess for he reads nothing like that so
it's<00:02:19.280> no<00:02:19.400> difference<00:02:19.760> but<00:02:19.910> it<00:02:19.940> helped<00:02:20.360> out<00:02:20.450> a

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
it's no difference but it helped out a

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.360
