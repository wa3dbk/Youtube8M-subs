big even for 40-inch I went from a 52 46
to<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:40.980> 42<00:00:41.399> now<00:00:41.550> back<00:00:41.850> out<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.090> 40<00:00:42.480> where<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:42.690> had

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
to a 42 now back out of 40 where I had

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.580 
to a 42 now back out of 40 where I had
deferred<00:00:43.530> like<00:00:43.980> years<00:00:44.190> ago<00:00:44.280> um<00:00:44.930> basically<00:00:45.930> I

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
deferred like years ago um basically I

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.619 
deferred like years ago um basically I
was<00:00:47.010> looking<00:00:47.250> at<00:00:47.340> some<00:00:47.489> Bank<00:00:47.700> u<00:00:47.969> monitors<00:00:48.390> and

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
was looking at some Bank u monitors and

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.150 
was looking at some Bank u monitors and
the<00:00:48.960> reason<00:00:49.170> why<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.289> didn't<00:00:49.530> go<00:00:49.680> with<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.890> bank

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
the reason why I didn't go with a bank

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.520 
the reason why I didn't go with a bank
you<00:00:50.340> monitor<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.760> because<00:00:51.120> it's<00:00:51.539> like<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.379> I

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
you monitor is because it's like this I

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.889 
you monitor is because it's like this I
guess<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.070> name-brand<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:54.180> even<00:00:54.690> if<00:00:54.809> I

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
guess is the name-brand that even if I

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.630 
guess is the name-brand that even if I
were<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.170> get<00:00:55.289> like<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.410> 200<00:00:55.890> dollar<00:00:55.980> monitor<00:00:56.460> it

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
were to get like a 200 dollar monitor it

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.840 
were to get like a 200 dollar monitor it
had<00:00:57.210> like<00:00:57.420> such<00:00:58.289> low<00:00:58.559> specs<00:00:58.949> on<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.730> would

had like such low specs on it you would
have<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.030> get<00:01:00.149> like<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.300> $400<00:01:01.399> 500<00:01:02.399> the

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
built-in speakers so I was basically

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.180 
built-in speakers so I was basically
hype<00:02:09.840> out<00:02:10.019> that<00:02:10.170> guy<00:02:10.289> cool<00:02:10.590> even<00:02:10.890> though<00:02:11.039> I'm

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
hype out that guy cool even though I'm

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.040 
hype out that guy cool even though I'm
not<00:02:11.310> gonna<00:02:11.459> use<00:02:11.610> their<00:02:11.760> speakers<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.840> listen

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
not gonna use their speakers to listen

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.380 
not gonna use their speakers to listen
the<00:02:13.349> audio<00:02:13.709> because<00:02:14.400> I'm<00:02:14.700> most<00:02:14.910> likely<00:02:15.150> gonna

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
the audio because I'm most likely gonna

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.960 
the audio because I'm most likely gonna
be<00:02:15.510> using<00:02:15.780> my<00:02:15.900> Astros<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.680> plug<00:02:16.920> in<00:02:17.129> and<00:02:17.340> also

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
be using my Astros to plug in and also

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.780 
be using my Astros to plug in and also
have<00:02:18.180> my<00:02:18.470> 3.5<00:02:19.470> millimeter<00:02:19.890> jack<00:02:19.980> plugged<00:02:20.550> into

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
have my 3.5 millimeter jack plugged into

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.460 
have my 3.5 millimeter jack plugged into
that<00:02:21.090> because<00:02:21.420> of<00:02:21.599> course<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:21.959> supports<00:02:22.049> that

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
that because of course it supports that

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.309 
that because of course it supports that
also<00:02:23.220> what<00:02:23.340> I<00:02:23.370> like<00:02:23.549> is<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:24.060> DCP<00:02:24.510> support<00:02:25.080> so

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
also what I like is a DCP support so

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.050 
also what I like is a DCP support so
there's<00:02:25.590> no<00:02:25.799> bullshit<00:02:26.280> where<00:02:26.430> some<00:02:26.640> monitors

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
there's no bullshit where some monitors

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.150 
there's no bullshit where some monitors
can't<00:02:27.299> read<00:02:27.510> off<00:02:27.629> of<00:02:27.660> HDMI<00:02:28.290> need<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.650> go<00:02:28.739> to<00:02:28.799> DVI

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
can't read off of HDMI need to go to DVI

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.789 
can't read off of HDMI need to go to DVI
not<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.180> also<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.660> display<00:02:30.840> colors<00:02:31.379> is<00:02:31.530> up<00:02:31.650> to

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
not and also the display colors is up to

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.860 
not and also the display colors is up to
sixteen<00:02:32.160> point<00:02:32.430> seven<00:02:32.610> million<00:02:33.150> which<00:02:33.840> means

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
sixteen point seven million which means

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.350 
sixteen point seven million which means
if<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.290> game<00:02:34.470> is<00:02:34.500> rendered<00:02:35.099> and<00:02:35.280> creative<00:02:36.120> and

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
if a game is rendered and creative and

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.839 
if a game is rendered and creative and
developed<00:02:36.840> in<00:02:37.280> specific<00:02:38.280> colors<00:02:38.640> that<00:02:38.760> are

developed in specific colors that are
rich<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.180> vibrant<00:02:39.360> but<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:39.840> have<00:02:39.959> a<00:02:39.989> TV<00:02:40.410> or

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
rich and vibrant but you have a TV or

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.100 
rich and vibrant but you have a TV or
monitor<00:02:40.650> that<00:02:41.310> is<00:02:41.519> not<00:02:41.880> of<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:42.120> quality<00:02:42.720> it

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
monitor that is not of that quality it

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.259 
monitor that is not of that quality it
might<00:02:43.380> be<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.560> little<00:02:43.769> bit<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.280> dull<00:02:44.940> you<00:02:45.209> know

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
might be a little bit a dull you know

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.880 
might be a little bit a dull you know
what<00:02:45.390> I'm<00:02:45.480> saying<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.840> just<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:46.470> pulls<00:02:46.709> out

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
what I'm saying it just it pulls out

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.160 
what I'm saying it just it pulls out
from<00:02:47.069> a<00:02:47.160> color<00:02:47.760> that's<00:02:48.060> closest<00:02:48.569> to<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:48.930> and

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
from a color that's closest to it and

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.710 
from a color that's closest to it and
why<00:02:50.010> this<00:02:50.069> is<00:02:50.489> good<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.150> get<00:02:51.269> a<00:02:51.329> monitor

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
why this is good to get a monitor

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.740 
why this is good to get a monitor
because<00:02:52.049> it<00:02:52.590> beats<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.610> dominates<00:02:54.060> TVs

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
because it beats it dominates TVs

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.509 
because it beats it dominates TVs
if<00:02:54.870> you're<00:02:55.319> playing<00:02:55.590> against<00:02:55.829> somebody<00:02:55.980> on<00:02:56.250> TV

like when I play against people who have

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.030 
like when I play against people who have
monitors<00:02:58.110> they<00:02:58.200> have<00:02:58.380> such<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.590> faster

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
monitors they have such a faster

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.920 
monitors they have such a faster
response<00:02:59.160> time<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.640> mark<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.480> eight-member

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
response time to mark the eight-member

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.569 
response time to mark the eight-member
