00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
here like so there we go transforming

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.480 
here like so there we go transforming
him<00:01:26.430> into<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.789> Train<00:01:27.030> form<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.479> fairly<00:01:27.810> simple

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
him into the Train form is fairly simple

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:36.099 
him into the Train form is fairly simple
just<00:01:29.490> take<00:01:29.729> his<00:01:29.909> gun<00:01:30.750> off<00:01:30.899> from<00:01:31.079> underneath

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:36.109 

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:39.889 

fold<00:01:37.109> the<00:01:37.799> entire<00:01:38.210> shuttle<00:01:39.210> wing<00:01:39.600> assembly

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
fold the entire shuttle wing assembly

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.660 
fold the entire shuttle wing assembly
around<00:01:40.200> like<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:42.079> hold<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.289> down<00:01:43.590> rotate<00:01:44.399> this

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
around like so hold it down rotate this

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.139 
around like so hold it down rotate this
or<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.840> down<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:49.340> rotate<00:01:50.340> this<00:01:50.549> little<00:01:50.939> fin

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
or that down to rotate this little fin

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.279 
or that down to rotate this little fin
and<00:01:52.640> split<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.759> apart<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.689> really<00:01:55.079> need

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
and split it apart and you really need

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.050 
and split it apart and you really need
good<00:01:55.500> fingernails<00:01:56.130> for<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.429> though

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:06.149 

finally<00:02:01.460> rotate<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.640> Train<00:02:02.939> halves<00:02:03.270> around

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:19.229 

and<00:02:11.340> snap<00:02:12.340> them<00:02:12.550> together<00:02:17.250> like<00:02:18.250> so<00:02:18.310> and<00:02:18.910> the

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
and snap them together like so and the

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:26.960 
and snap them together like so and the
gun<00:02:19.620> can<00:02:20.620> be<00:02:20.739> placed<00:02:21.900> on<00:02:22.900> top<00:02:23.459> as<00:02:24.459> you<00:02:25.180> see<00:02:25.420> here

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
gun can be placed on top as you see here

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.759 
gun can be placed on top as you see here
instead<00:02:27.970> of<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.180> old<00:02:28.360> steamie<00:02:28.959> this<00:02:29.440> time

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
instead of the old steamie this time

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.520 
instead of the old steamie this time
he's<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.069> bullet<00:02:30.489> train<00:02:30.989> however<00:02:31.989> I<00:02:32.110> think<00:02:32.410> we

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
he's a bullet train however I think we

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.259 
he's a bullet train however I think we
can<00:02:32.709> all<00:02:32.860> agree<00:02:32.980> that<00:02:33.190> this<00:02:33.549> is<00:02:33.610> definitely

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
can all agree that this is definitely

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.530 
can all agree that this is definitely
the<00:02:34.930> weakest<00:02:35.379> of<00:02:35.500> his<00:02:35.650> three<00:02:35.920> modes

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
the weakest of his three modes

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.819 
the weakest of his three modes
especially<00:02:37.540> since<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:38.019> shutter<00:02:38.349> wings<00:02:38.620> are

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
especially since the shutter wings are

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.479 
especially since the shutter wings are
so<00:02:39.069> glaringly<00:02:39.849> obvious<00:02:40.030> at<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.629> back<00:02:41.489> even

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
so glaringly obvious at the back even

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.240 
so glaringly obvious at the back even
with<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.910> windows<00:02:43.870> modern<00:02:44.530> in<00:02:44.680> here<00:02:45.160> it

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
with the windows modern in here it

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.600 
with the windows modern in here it
doesn't<00:02:45.459> really<00:02:45.760> work<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:47.920> know<00:02:48.069> the<00:02:48.190> problem

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
doesn't really work you know the problem

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.559 
doesn't really work you know the problem
is<00:02:48.849> that<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.420> thin<00:02:49.989> halves<00:02:50.549> sort<00:02:51.549> of<00:02:51.670> stick

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
is that the thin halves sort of stick

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.900 
is that the thin halves sort of stick
out<00:02:52.780> from<00:02:53.170> underneath<00:02:53.560> of<00:02:53.890> you<00:02:54.099> can<00:02:54.310> look<00:02:54.519> here

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
out from underneath of you can look here

out from underneath of you can look here

are a little too skinny compared to the
lower<00:05:12.190> legs<00:05:14.460> but<00:05:15.460> the<00:05:15.580> main<00:05:15.760> problem<00:05:16.210> I<00:05:16.330> have

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
lower legs but the main problem I have

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.420 
lower legs but the main problem I have
with<00:05:16.750> this<00:05:16.900> toy<00:05:17.170> is<00:05:17.440> that<00:05:17.470> the<00:05:17.800> Train<00:05:18.100> halves

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
with this toy is that the Train halves

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.270 
with this toy is that the Train halves
are<00:05:18.940> very<00:05:19.270> loose<00:05:19.570> and<00:05:20.290> can<00:05:20.500> slide<00:05:20.920> back<00:05:21.220> down

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
are very loose and can slide back down

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.180 
are very loose and can slide back down
over<00:05:21.910> the<00:05:22.000> arm<00:05:22.180> quite<00:05:22.510> easily<00:05:23.040> unless<00:05:24.040> of

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
over the arm quite easily unless of

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.150 
over the arm quite easily unless of
course<00:05:24.220> you<00:05:25.050> flip<00:05:26.050> the<00:05:26.200> arm<00:05:26.320> up<00:05:26.500> like<00:05:26.650> this<00:05:26.890> and

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
course you flip the arm up like this and

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:34.470 
course you flip the arm up like this and
put<00:05:28.090> the<00:05:28.780> gun<00:05:29.080> in<00:05:29.230> one<00:05:29.410> of<00:05:29.530> his<00:05:29.620> hands<00:05:33.330> here<00:05:34.330> we

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 
put the gun in one of his hands here we

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.720 
put the gun in one of his hands here we
go

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:37.730 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.830 

so<00:05:38.390> there<00:05:38.600> we<00:05:38.750> are<00:05:40.180> overall<00:05:41.180> it's<00:05:41.570> a<00:05:41.690> great

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
so there we are overall it's a great

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.640 
so there we are overall it's a great
update<00:05:42.320> to<00:05:42.350> a<00:05:42.560> popular<00:05:43.100> g1<00:05:43.520> character<00:05:44.380> each<00:05:45.380> of

the alt modes tries to look as realistic

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.170 
the alt modes tries to look as realistic
as<00:05:48.080> possible<00:05:48.310> which<00:05:49.310> is<00:05:49.340> much<00:05:49.700> better<00:05:49.970> than

I'll be back with in another review when

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.060 
I'll be back with in another review when
I<00:06:04.010> get<00:06:04.280> the<00:06:04.400> chance<00:06:04.930> but<00:06:05.930> until<00:06:06.320> then<00:06:06.620> this<00:06:07.010> is

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.070 
I get the chance but until then this is

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.060 
I get the chance but until then this is
