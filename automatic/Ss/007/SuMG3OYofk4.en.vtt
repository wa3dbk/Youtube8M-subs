this on the side here let's see what

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.880 
this on the side here let's see what
else<00:01:02.609> we<00:01:02.760> have<00:01:02.940> inside<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.449> box<00:01:03.750> nice<00:01:04.589> purple

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
else we have inside this box nice purple

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.580 
else we have inside this box nice purple
inside<00:01:08.210> let's<00:01:09.210> say<00:01:09.360> we<00:01:09.479> got<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.720> guide

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
inside let's say we got a guide

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.719 
inside let's say we got a guide
instructions<00:01:12.080> manuals<00:01:13.080> or<00:01:13.920> pamphlets<00:01:14.220> and

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
instructions manuals or pamphlets and

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.060 
instructions manuals or pamphlets and
stuff<00:01:17.600> like<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.659> USB<00:01:19.229> cable<00:01:19.439> here<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.799> think<00:01:20.009> if

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
stuff like a USB cable here I think if

this uh
Kinect<00:01:49.649> sensor<00:01:49.950> here<00:01:50.159> we'll<00:01:50.310> do<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.460> quick

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
Kinect sensor here we'll do a quick

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.179 
Kinect sensor here we'll do a quick
Hardware<00:01:51.030> tour<00:01:51.240> ok<00:01:52.170> now<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.680> we<00:01:52.860> have<00:01:53.040> the

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
Hardware tour ok now that we have the

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.039 
Hardware tour ok now that we have the
Kinect<00:01:53.490> on<00:01:53.579> box<00:01:53.880> there<00:01:54.180> let's<00:01:54.689> do<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> quick

Kinect on box there let's do a quick

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.319 
Kinect on box there let's do a quick
hardware<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.590> around<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.880> we'll<00:01:57.000> start<00:01:57.210> off

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
hardware to around so we'll start off

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.539 
hardware to around so we'll start off
here<00:01:57.540> in<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.719> front<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.070> frontier

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
here in the front and on the frontier

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.270 
here in the front and on the frontier
these<00:02:00.180> two<00:02:00.420> here<00:02:00.659> your<00:02:00.869> 3d<00:02:01.200> depth<00:02:01.469> sensors<00:02:01.979> and

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
these two here your 3d depth sensors and

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.660 
these two here your 3d depth sensors and
in<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.790> center<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.210> your<00:02:03.270> RGB<00:02:03.869> camera<00:02:04.670> below

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
in the center is your RGB camera below

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.789 
in the center is your RGB camera below
that<00:02:05.939> is<00:02:06.180> your<00:02:06.329> multi<00:02:06.689> array<00:02:07.079> microphone

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
that is your multi array microphone

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.430 
that is your multi array microphone
right<00:02:08.190> here<00:02:08.390> and<00:02:09.390> then<00:02:10.020> this<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.349> your

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
right here and then this is your

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.710 
right here and then this is your
motorized<00:02:10.890> tilt<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.390> really<00:02:12.540> isn't

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
motorized tilt and it really isn't

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.660 
motorized tilt and it really isn't

nice<00:02:19.020> shiny<00:02:19.319> plastic<00:02:19.620> clip<00:02:20.129> which<00:02:20.489> we've<00:02:21.060> seen

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
nice shiny plastic clip which we've seen

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.839 
nice shiny plastic clip which we've seen
before<00:02:21.270> pretty<00:02:21.930> much<00:02:22.020> matches<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.709> new<00:02:23.400> Xbox

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
before pretty much matches the new Xbox

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.979 
before pretty much matches the new Xbox
360s<00:02:24.420> design<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:26.180> then<00:02:27.180> on<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:27.450> back<00:02:27.660> here

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
360s design and then on the back here

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.259 
360s design and then on the back here
who's<00:02:28.230> wearing<00:02:28.440> it's<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.709> little<00:02:28.950> interesting

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
who's wearing it's a little interesting

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.530 
who's wearing it's a little interesting

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
so if you have a older Xbox 360 you're

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.259 
so if you have a older Xbox 360 you're
going<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:33.750> need<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:33.989> use<00:02:34.050> a<00:02:34.470> USB<00:02:34.769> and<00:02:35.370> this

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
going to need to use a USB and this

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.300 
going to need to use a USB and this
power<00:02:36.840> adapter<00:02:37.290> here<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.590> use<00:02:37.739> a<00:02:37.769> Kinect<00:02:38.190> on
