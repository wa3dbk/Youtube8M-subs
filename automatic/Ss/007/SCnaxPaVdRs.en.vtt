Richmond<00:00:14.160> model<00:00:14.400> railway<00:00:14.670> club<00:00:14.910> started<00:00:15.389> in

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
Richmond model railway club started in

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.560 
Richmond model railway club started in
about<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.230> mid<00:00:16.379> seventies<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.730> joined<00:00:18.420> it

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
about the mid seventies I joined it

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.430 
about the mid seventies I joined it
about<00:00:18.840> 1516<00:00:19.470> years<00:00:19.980> ago<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:21.080> in<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.140> length

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:22.440 
about 1516 years ago and in that length

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.620 
about 1516 years ago and in that length
of<00:00:22.590> time<00:00:22.650> it's<00:00:23.160> moved<00:00:23.400> from<00:00:23.640> place<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.360> place

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
of time it's moved from place to place

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.860 
of time it's moved from place to place
to<00:00:25.050> place<00:00:25.640> and<00:00:26.640> therefore<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.330> layouts<00:00:27.660> have

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:27.870 
to place and therefore the layouts have

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.990 
to place and therefore the layouts have
moved<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.500> been<00:00:29.070> scrubbed<00:00:29.520> and<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.850> new

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
moved and been scrubbed and the new

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.999 
moved and been scrubbed and the new
layouts<00:00:30.300> been<00:00:30.570> started<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.380> account<00:00:31.680> story

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
layouts been started the account story

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.700 
layouts been started the account story
did<00:00:32.309> very<00:00:32.640> very<00:00:32.850> difficult<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.330> store<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.020> and

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
did very very difficult to store so and

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.590 
did very very difficult to store so and
eventually<00:00:35.220> we<00:00:35.460> came<00:00:35.670> down<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.210> one<00:00:36.420> you

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
eventually we came down to the one you

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.930 
eventually we came down to the one you
seen<00:00:37.020> for<00:00:37.200> him<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.350> be<00:00:37.470> now<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.800> gone<00:00:38.070> because

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
seen for him to be now is gone because

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.540 
seen for him to be now is gone because
we're<00:00:39.330> keen<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.630> do<00:00:39.870> something<00:00:40.170> local<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:41.460> if

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
we're keen to do something local and if

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.030 
we're keen to do something local and if
you<00:00:41.640> look<00:00:41.790> at<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.150> gas<00:00:42.420> station<00:00:42.960> itself<00:00:43.290> it

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
you look at is gas station itself it

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.280 
you look at is gas station itself it
lends<00:00:44.370> itself<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:45.000> being<00:00:45.300> modeled<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:45.960> that

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
lends itself to being modeled in that

00:00:46.290 --> 00:01:06.830 
lends itself to being modeled in that
it's<00:00:46.440> still<00:00:46.710> here

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.020 

we<00:01:07.840> were<00:01:07.960> set<00:01:08.170> on<00:01:08.280> naming<00:01:09.280> it<00:01:09.400> for<00:01:09.550> about<00:01:09.640> the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
we were set on naming it for about the

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.100 
we were set on naming it for about the
the<00:01:10.810> button<00:01:11.170> of<00:01:11.320> the<00:01:11.409> Ellen<00:01:11.770> e-r<00:01:12.070> e-r<00:01:13.110> before

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
the button of the Ellen e-r e-r before

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
the button of the Ellen e-r e-r before
the<00:01:14.260> war<00:01:14.440> so<00:01:14.920> probably<00:01:15.880> about<00:01:16.920> 1930s<00:01:17.920> late

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
the war so probably about 1930s late

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.969 
the war so probably about 1930s late
late<00:01:18.369> 1930s<00:01:19.300> don't<00:01:19.479> think<00:01:19.780> so<00:01:19.990> they<00:01:20.110> they

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
late 1930s don't think so they they

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.830 
late 1930s don't think so they they
stuff<00:01:21.310> on<00:01:21.460> the<00:01:21.580> layout<00:01:21.880> accords<00:01:22.450> with<00:01:22.630> that

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
stuff on the layout accords with that

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.870 
stuff on the layout accords with that
like<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.350> traction<00:01:23.770> engines<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:24.340> horses<00:01:24.729> and

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
like the traction engines the horses and

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.440 
like the traction engines the horses and
trucks<00:01:25.180> the<00:01:25.930> people<00:01:26.320> on<00:01:26.409> the<00:01:26.530> way<00:01:26.650> out

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
trucks the people on the way out

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
trucks the people on the way out
anything<00:01:28.450> that<00:01:28.690> was<00:01:28.810> too<00:01:28.840> modern<00:01:29.350> were

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
anything that was too modern were

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.380 
anything that was too modern were
wouldn't<00:01:29.770> sure<00:01:30.009> you<00:01:30.460> have<00:01:30.550> to<00:01:30.640> also<00:01:30.820> aim<00:01:31.150> for<00:01:31.330> a

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
wouldn't sure you have to also aim for a

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.359 
wouldn't sure you have to also aim for a
period<00:01:31.780> of<00:01:31.810> time<00:01:32.050> and<00:01:32.740> within<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:33.159> year

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
period of time and within the year

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.190 
period of time and within the year
because<00:01:34.090> if<00:01:34.420> it's<00:01:34.539> middle<00:01:34.720> of<00:01:34.840> winter<00:01:34.990> you

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
because if it's middle of winter you

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.290 
because if it's middle of winter you
don't<00:01:35.470> want<00:01:35.590> to<00:01:35.649> leaves<00:01:35.830> on<00:01:36.039> the<00:01:36.130> trees<00:01:36.369> and<00:01:36.670> so

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
don't want to leaves on the trees and so

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.029 
don't want to leaves on the trees and so
we<00:01:37.420> decided<00:01:37.750> with<00:01:38.020> pitch<00:01:38.200> showers<00:01:38.590> in<00:01:38.800> the

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
we decided with pitch showers in the

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.960 
we decided with pitch showers in the
late<00:01:39.910> spring<00:01:40.180> and<00:01:41.310> he<00:01:42.310> seems<00:01:42.580> to<00:01:42.670> floor

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
late spring and he seems to floor

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.240 
late spring and he seems to floor
without<00:01:43.270> period

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:57.250 

you

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.960 

they're<00:01:57.920> features<00:01:58.310> on<00:01:58.640> here<00:01:58.820> I<00:01:58.880> like

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
they're features on here I like

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.350 
they're features on here I like
particularly<00:02:00.100> at<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:01.370> under<00:02:01.700> bridge<00:02:01.910> area

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
particularly at the under bridge area

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.830 
particularly at the under bridge area
because<00:02:03.290> when<00:02:03.830> I<00:02:03.860> I<00:02:04.400> was<00:02:04.940> I<00:02:05.210> was<00:02:05.540> a<00:02:05.570> volunteer

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840

group on you under bridge area and that

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.230 
group on you under bridge area and that
interested<00:02:12.500> me<00:02:12.650> so<00:02:12.680> I<00:02:13.130> almost<00:02:13.790> like<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.090> think

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
interested me so I almost like to think

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.820 
interested me so I almost like to think
of<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.390> Honda<00:02:14.690> bridge<00:02:14.870> and<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.140> bit<00:02:15.530> around

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
of the Honda bridge and the bit around

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.560 
of the Honda bridge and the bit around
there<00:02:16.100> was<00:02:16.310> a<00:02:16.340> bit<00:02:16.610> I<00:02:16.700> spent<00:02:16.970> some<00:02:17.090> of<00:02:17.210> my<00:02:17.270> time

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
there was a bit I spent some of my time

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.690 
there was a bit I spent some of my time
anyway<00:02:17.990> that's<00:02:18.650> not<00:02:18.770> very<00:02:18.800> little<00:02:19.340> bit<00:02:19.490> yeah

that<00:02:39.010> when<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:39.370> see<00:02:39.549> the<00:02:39.730> size<00:02:40.030> of<00:02:40.299> the<00:02:40.390> layout

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
that when you see the size of the layout

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.640 
that when you see the size of the layout
which<00:02:40.959> is<00:02:40.989> about<00:02:41.319> 25<00:02:41.920> 26<00:02:42.310> feet<00:02:42.730> long<00:02:43.409> it's<00:02:44.409> well

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
which is about 25 26 feet long it's well

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.399 
which is about 25 26 feet long it's well
cut<00:02:44.890> down<00:02:45.069> in<00:02:45.280> size<00:02:45.489> to<00:02:45.670> what<00:02:45.790> he<00:02:45.879> should<00:02:46.090> be<00:02:46.409> if

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
cut down in size to what he should be if

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:49.710 
cut down in size to what he should be if
it<00:02:47.620> was<00:02:47.769> a<00:02:47.799> correct<00:02:48.250> size<00:02:48.579> for<00:02:49.239> this<00:02:49.329> skirt

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
it was a correct size for this skirt

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.720 
it was a correct size for this skirt
then<00:02:50.650> he<00:02:50.739> would<00:02:50.859> be<00:02:50.890> about<00:02:51.220> two<00:02:51.489> and<00:02:51.640> a<00:02:51.700> half

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
then he would be about two and a half

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.720 
then he would be about two and a half
times<00:02:52.209> as<00:02:52.390> long<00:02:52.540> as<00:02:52.599> you<00:02:52.780> see<00:02:52.959> it<00:02:53.019> now<00:02:53.260> so<00:02:54.129> the

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
times as long as you see it now so the

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.550 
times as long as you see it now so the
whole<00:02:55.269> thing<00:02:55.450> about<00:02:55.599> model<00:02:55.930> railways<00:02:56.349> is

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
whole thing about model railways is

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.740 
whole thing about model railways is
betraying<00:02:57.129> the<00:02:57.940> image<00:02:58.299> of<00:02:58.510> what<00:02:58.629> you're

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
betraying the image of what you're

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.629 
betraying the image of what you're
trying<00:02:58.870> to<00:02:58.989> portray<00:02:59.139> and<00:02:59.680> making<00:03:00.069> it<00:03:00.190> so<00:03:00.609> that

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:00.639 
trying to portray and making it so that

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:02.399 
trying to portray and making it so that
somebody<00:03:01.000> can<00:03:01.239> see<00:03:01.480> look<00:03:01.810> at<00:03:01.930> it<00:03:02.019> and<00:03:02.109> say<00:03:02.260> well

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409 
somebody can see look at it and say well

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:13.130 
somebody can see look at it and say well
that's<00:03:02.889> it<00:03:03.069> is<00:03:03.190> gone

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.740 

now<00:03:14.140> what<00:03:14.349> happened<00:03:14.709> was<00:03:14.860> that<00:03:15.569> when<00:03:16.569> we

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
now what happened was that when we

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.839 
now what happened was that when we
eventually<00:03:17.220> finished<00:03:18.220> working<00:03:18.459> on<00:03:18.700> the

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
eventually finished working on the

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.750 
eventually finished working on the
layout<00:03:19.120> by<00:03:19.360> that<00:03:19.540> time<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:20.799> Richmond<00:03:21.519> model

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
layout by that time the Richmond model

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.160 
layout by that time the Richmond model
railway<00:03:22.030> Club<00:03:22.269> was<00:03:22.420> down<00:03:22.659> to<00:03:22.840> three<00:03:22.870> or<00:03:23.079> four

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
railway Club was down to three or four

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.350 
railway Club was down to three or four
members<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:24.069> we<00:03:24.220> work<00:03:24.430> in<00:03:24.670> somebody's<00:03:25.150> back

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
members and we work in somebody's back

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.750 
members and we work in somebody's back
room<00:03:25.659> so<00:03:26.079> three<00:03:26.409> is<00:03:26.650> about<00:03:26.829> as<00:03:27.099> many<00:03:27.250> as<00:03:27.430> we<00:03:27.610> can

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
room so three is about as many as we can

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.449 
room so three is about as many as we can
take<00:03:28.030> and<00:03:28.480> what<00:03:29.200> we<00:03:29.319> found<00:03:29.560> was<00:03:29.860> that<00:03:29.890> when<00:03:30.310> we

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
take and what we found was that when we

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.640 
take and what we found was that when we
got<00:03:30.610> this<00:03:30.730> layout<00:03:31.060> finished<00:03:31.510> he<00:03:32.290> went<00:03:32.319> an

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
got this layout finished he went an

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.440 
got this layout finished he went an
exhibition<00:03:33.220> in<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.370> Northeast<00:03:33.909> of<00:03:34.090> various

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
exhibition in the Northeast of various

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.009 
exhibition in the Northeast of various
venues<00:03:34.690> but<00:03:35.620> for<00:03:35.829> three<00:03:36.010> people<00:03:36.720> it<00:03:37.720> was<00:03:37.840> just

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
venues but for three people it was just

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.770 
venues but for three people it was just
sheer<00:03:38.260> hard<00:03:38.530> work<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:39.790> so<00:03:40.090> we<00:03:40.209> decided<00:03:40.599> that

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
sheer hard work and so we decided that

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.410 
sheer hard work and so we decided that
the<00:03:41.489> what<00:03:42.489> should<00:03:42.640> we<00:03:42.730> do<00:03:42.849> with<00:03:43.030> it<00:03:43.060> do<00:03:43.329> you

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
the what should we do with it do you

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.930 
the what should we do with it do you
scrap<00:03:43.750> it<00:03:43.989> do<00:03:44.319> you<00:03:44.439> put<00:03:45.099> it<00:03:45.220> in<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.519> shed<00:03:45.790> and

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
scrap it do you put it in the shed and

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.750 
scrap it do you put it in the shed and
forget<00:03:46.269> about<00:03:46.299> it<00:03:46.540> and<00:03:46.959> we<00:03:47.049> thought<00:03:47.500> no<00:03:47.760> it's

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
forget about it and we thought no it's

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.849 
forget about it and we thought no it's
too<00:03:49.060> good<00:03:49.299> and<00:03:49.569> this<00:03:49.989> would<00:03:50.140> always<00:03:50.260> stored<00:03:50.680> in

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
too good and this would always stored in

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.559 
too good and this would always stored in
the<00:03:50.950> corner<00:03:51.280> of<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:51.489> room<00:03:51.670> and<00:03:52.000> gradually

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
the corner of the room and gradually

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.089 
the corner of the room and gradually
getting<00:03:52.750> bits<00:03:53.049> knocked<00:03:53.290> off<00:03:53.500> it<00:03:53.680> and<00:03:53.829> getting

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
getting bits knocked off it and getting

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.129 
getting bits knocked off it and getting
worse<00:03:54.280> and<00:03:54.489> worse<00:03:54.639> for<00:03:54.670> wear<00:03:54.970> and<00:03:55.629> our

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
worse and worse for wear and our

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.740 
worse and worse for wear and our
decision<00:03:56.680> that<00:03:57.040> more<00:03:57.280> or<00:03:57.430> less<00:03:57.459> come<00:03:57.819> to<00:03:58.060> one

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
decision that more or less come to one

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.629 
decision that more or less come to one
way<00:03:58.930> or<00:03:58.989> another<00:03:59.230> and<00:03:59.560> get<00:03:59.769> rid<00:03:59.980> of<00:04:00.010> it<00:04:00.190> and<00:04:00.430> in

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:00.639 
way or another and get rid of it and in

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.930 
way or another and get rid of it and in
fact<00:04:00.940> we<00:04:01.480> had<00:04:01.659> decided<00:04:02.109> to<00:04:02.530> see<00:04:03.280> if<00:04:03.459> Wensley

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
fact we had decided to see if Wensley

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.500 
fact we had decided to see if Wensley
Dale<00:04:04.150> wanted<00:04:05.019> it<00:04:05.400> and<00:04:06.400> that<00:04:06.670> coincided<00:04:07.299> with

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
Dale wanted it and that coincided with

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.599 
Dale wanted it and that coincided with
an<00:04:07.720> approach<00:04:08.079> more<00:04:08.620> or<00:04:08.769> less<00:04:08.920> from<00:04:09.190> one<00:04:09.400> still

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
an approach more or less from one still

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:11.640 
an approach more or less from one still
railway<00:04:10.030> to<00:04:10.090> say<00:04:10.359> well<00:04:10.540> could<00:04:11.079> we<00:04:11.260> still<00:04:11.440> have

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
railway to say well could we still have

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.000 
railway to say well could we still have
the<00:04:11.769> layout<00:04:11.950> and<00:04:12.310> so<00:04:13.180> it<00:04:14.049> seemed<00:04:14.379> ideal<00:04:14.530> that

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
the layout and so it seemed ideal that

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.979 
the layout and so it seemed ideal that
this<00:04:15.159> was<00:04:15.340> a<00:04:15.370> place<00:04:15.609> for<00:04:15.790> you<00:04:15.849> to<00:04:15.970> come<00:04:16.150> and<00:04:16.419> so

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
this was a place for you to come and so

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.930 
this was a place for you to come and so
Taiwanese<00:04:17.620> golf<00:04:17.919> layout<00:04:18.310> ending<00:04:18.699> up<00:04:18.820> these
