amazing this headphones has a rich Chris
rich<00:02:25.830> and<00:02:26.100> crisp<00:02:26.550> based<00:02:27.150> response<00:02:27.750> so<00:02:28.200> but

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
rich and crisp based response so but

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.270 
rich and crisp based response so but
this<00:02:29.340> but<00:02:29.850> it's<00:02:30.030> still<00:02:30.570> like<00:02:30.840> space<00:02:31.280> although

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
this but it's still like space although

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.400 
this but it's still like space although
the<00:02:32.459> base<00:02:32.610> is<00:02:32.790> rich<00:02:33.030> I'm<00:02:33.600> pet<00:02:33.900> still<00:02:34.170> like

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
the base is rich I'm pet still like

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.940 
the base is rich I'm pet still like
space<00:02:34.800> because<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:36.410> don't<00:02:37.410> know<00:02:37.470> just<00:02:37.739> like

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
space because I don't know just like

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.360 
space because I don't know just like
space<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.900> think<00:02:39.900> it's<00:02:40.019> because<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.769> driveway

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
space I think it's because the driveway

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.280 
space I think it's because the driveway
is<00:02:41.430> not<00:02:41.610> big<00:02:41.760> enough<00:02:41.790> um<00:02:42.300> if<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:42.870> want<00:02:43.110> a
