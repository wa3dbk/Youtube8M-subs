00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
job with no guarantee that will actually

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.420 
job with no guarantee that will actually
work<00:00:22.199> because<00:00:22.470> apparently<00:00:22.830> have<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:23.039> have<00:00:23.310> to

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
work because apparently have to have to

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.740 
work because apparently have to have to
cut<00:00:23.609> something<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.119> might<00:00:24.240> not<00:00:24.269> actually

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
cut something that might not actually

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.240 
cut something that might not actually
cut<00:00:25.050> properly<00:00:25.410> or<00:00:25.560> some<00:00:26.039> like<00:00:26.099> that

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
cut properly or some like that

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.130 
cut properly or some like that
so<00:00:27.210> thought<00:00:27.359> I'd<00:00:27.449> give<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.750> go<00:00:27.779> with<00:00:28.050> this

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
so thought I'd give it a go with this

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.599 
so thought I'd give it a go with this
old<00:00:28.349> Tosh<00:00:28.560> off<00:00:28.769> they<00:00:28.890> got<00:00:28.980> laid<00:00:29.160> around<00:00:29.279> it's<00:00:29.580> a

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
old Tosh off they got laid around it's a

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.659 
old Tosh off they got laid around it's a
bit<00:00:29.760> rusty<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:31.009> just<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.130> see<00:00:32.279> how<00:00:32.520> and

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
bit rusty and just to see how and

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.630 
bit rusty and just to see how and
go<00:00:33.649> so<00:00:34.649> all<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.890> basically<00:00:35.160> don't<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.489> see

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
go so all the basically don't you see

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.049 
go so all the basically don't you see
I've<00:00:35.760> put<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.480> on<00:00:36.540> here<00:00:36.800> looks<00:00:37.800> all<00:00:37.980> right<00:00:38.059> all

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
I've put it on here looks all right all

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.630 
I've put it on here looks all right all
I've<00:00:39.270> done<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.510> I've<00:00:39.890> brace<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:40.920> part<00:00:41.399> here

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
I've done is I've brace that part here

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.920 
I've done is I've brace that part here
in<00:00:41.850> Vice<00:00:42.320> device<00:00:43.320> up<00:00:43.500> there<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.629> just<00:00:45.629> marked

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
in Vice device up there and just marked

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.880 
in Vice device up there and just marked
it<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.440> it's<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.680> line<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:48.110> hit<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.710> back<00:00:49.860> of

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
it so it's in line and hit the back of

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.910 
it so it's in line and hit the back of
here<00:00:50.219> with<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> big<00:00:50.820> hammer<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.620> the<00:00:52.620> idea

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
here with a big hammer and the idea

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.770 
here with a big hammer and the idea
there<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.160> it'll<00:00:53.460> split<00:00:53.760> inside<00:00:54.300> here<00:00:54.600> and

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
there is it'll split inside here and

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.720 
there is it'll split inside here and
there's<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.800> spline<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.250> there<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.550> comes

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
there's a spline in there and it comes

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.510 
there's a spline in there and it comes
out<00:00:57.649> once<00:00:58.649> you've<00:00:58.800> got<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.039> part<00:00:59.280> off<00:00:59.399> you

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
out once you've got that part off you

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.799 
out once you've got that part off you
can<00:00:59.640> remove<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.030> outside<00:01:00.329> which<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:00.480> usually

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
can remove the outside which is usually

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.399 
can remove the outside which is usually
separated<00:01:02.600> depending<00:01:03.600> on<00:01:03.660> how<00:01:03.780> badly<00:01:04.019> damaged

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
separated depending on how badly damaged

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.479 
separated depending on how badly damaged
it<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.619> can<00:01:04.769> probably<00:01:04.920> just<00:01:05.070> rip<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.280> off

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
it is can probably just rip it off

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.410 
it is can probably just rip it off
because<00:01:05.700> you're<00:01:05.790> not<00:01:05.850> going<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.060> reuse<00:01:06.210> it

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
because you're not going to reuse it

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.149 
because you're not going to reuse it
anyway<00:01:06.689> get<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.500> piece<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.680> crap<00:01:07.799> out<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
anyway get that piece of crap out of the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.920 
anyway get that piece of crap out of the
way<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.670> then<00:01:09.540> you're<00:01:09.630> left<00:01:09.750> with<00:01:09.900> something

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
way and then you're left with something

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.700 
way and then you're left with something
like<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:11.240> which<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:13.820> that<00:01:14.820> part<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.150> there<00:01:15.710> it

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
like that which is that part in there it

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.690 
like that which is that part in there it
earlier<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.939> part<00:01:18.150> in<00:01:18.270> there<00:01:18.740> now<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:20.040> can't

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
earlier that part in there now I can't

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.560 
earlier that part in there now I can't
work<00:01:20.820> out<00:01:20.909> what<00:01:21.060> they're<00:01:21.210> talking<00:01:21.479> about

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
work out what they're talking about

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.770 
work out what they're talking about
cutting<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:22.140> gave<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.009> go<00:01:23.189> cutting<00:01:23.780> started

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
cutting I gave it a go cutting started

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.810 
cutting I gave it a go cutting started
grinding<00:01:24.960> away<00:01:25.229> through<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.650> but<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.549> was<00:01:26.700> too

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
grinding away through it but it was too

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.920 
grinding away through it but it was too
hard<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.119> couldn't<00:01:27.270> be<00:01:27.390> bothered<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.780> didn't

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
hard I couldn't be bothered I didn't

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.960 
hard I couldn't be bothered I didn't
really<00:01:28.110> see<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.320> need<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.680> just<00:01:29.400> put<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.549> chisel

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
really see the need I just put a chisel

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.569 
really see the need I just put a chisel
a<00:01:30.180> big<00:01:30.600> screwdriver<00:01:30.840> behind<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:32.549> just

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
a big screwdriver behind it and it just

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.580 
a big screwdriver behind it and it just
slides<00:01:32.850> off<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.180> spline<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.689> way<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.500> I've

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
slides off the spline that way so I've

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.710 
slides off the spline that way so I've
just<00:01:34.650> hit<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:34.950> from<00:01:35.850> behind<00:01:36.000> while<00:01:36.450> again

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
just hit it from behind while again

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.569 
just hit it from behind while again
holding<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.110> here<00:01:37.259> in<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.439> vise<00:01:37.619> those<00:01:38.400> are

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
holding it here in the vise those are

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.830 
holding it here in the vise those are
the<00:01:38.640> crap<00:01:38.790> out<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.420> came

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
the crap out of it and that came

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.429 
the crap out of it and that came
straight<00:01:39.930> off<00:01:40.700> put<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.759> new<00:01:41.790> one<00:01:42.030> on<00:01:42.350> line<00:01:43.350> the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439
