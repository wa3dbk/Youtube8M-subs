00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.880
 good to all the boys and girls 

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:07.220
 friends of youtube here 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:11.059
 radcliffe the moon with a new tutorial 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:14.780
 in this case I bring you a tutorial 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:17.300
 how to run a virtual machine 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.289
 ms-two in a current operating system is 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:24.050
 say a lot of people have problems because 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:27.679
 has old games of ms-two and 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.740
 applications that can not be executed in 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:35.239
 the new windows or even on mac 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:38.000
 in unix systems and so on then it's 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.970
 it's a very simple and very easy way and 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.190
 free to solve this problem what 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:47.840
 first thing to do is go to the 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:50.780
 page of a ms-two virtual emulator 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:55.280
 called 2 box is worth the page to the 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:58.610
 address I leave it in the description 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.680
 of the video is this the page you see here 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.780
 here you have our friend wilfredo who 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.860
 gives you the free download this is 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.049
 free code with which you will not have 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.510
 to pay nothing or are you promoting the 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.790
 piracy nor will the fbi come to you 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.440
 home for downloading this install it or 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.920
 nothing like that 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:23.210
 good once I downloaded the program 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.130
 really what we download is the 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.800
 installer we install it is really 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.850
 simple an installation really 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:35.900
 basic and then here we have the executable 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.910
 I already have it installed, okay, and this 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.280
 when you open it, the 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.770
 such box and you get a very interface 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.439
 similar 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:50.590
 the old ms 2 in fact is very similar 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.740
 to today's terminal of the new 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.310
 windows operating systems 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.939
 I what what I do now for 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:05.330
 run ms-two applications on this 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:09.070
 case is going to faith 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:13.040
 and create a folder in that in the file 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:15.530
 root file and make it the folder that 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.410
 I'm going to ride because this is really a 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.260
 emulator this is not that you have to 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.030
 mount a particular folder for 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.940
 can run the files then 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.200
 well I have put 2d games of ms-two 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.070
 because for now good and what I have 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.050
 here are two games worth a measure of 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.060
 this now comes the most complicated part 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.270
 to prepare you because this is really 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.430
 complicated and you're going to see it first 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.510
 place what you have to use is the function 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.400
 mount that comes to be mount in English 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.260
 whereupon what we do is 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.370
 the next thing we wrote mobile 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:55.520
 we wrote a symbolic letter in which 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.010
 it's supposed to be assembling the folder 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.650
 which we are going to specify later on 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.990
 example cee and we mount the folder that 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.250
 we want in this case I'm going to ride the 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.959
 root directory you are going to see that here 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.720
 it is specified that this is dangerous and 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.459
 such because clear in the root directory 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.350
 You can specifically enter the folder 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.660
 of windows and you can build the fat but 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.670
 it should not be a problem and yes 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:24.440
 well you should not have any problem 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:28.070
 so it is written mount cc two 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.940
 points and the bar is given intro and here 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:34.280
 you see from montins historically the same 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.130
 director and next time but nevertheless it 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.550
 has been able to mount is to say this really 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:43.400
 now it's pretty good because the 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.890
 keyboard that recognizes the emulator is the 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.570
 Spanish, I suppose the ones you have 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.900
 keyboard in English will recognize it in 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:54.230
 English formerly the keyboard was the 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.790
 English is to say the two points do not 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.680
 they were where the two points of the 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.720
 Spanish keyboard the bar was not and 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.000
 you had to be checking to see where 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:06.210
 was everything once this was done 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.830
 of two points this is plus two of the same 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.810
 then two points to go to 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.420
 directory that is already mounted as 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.370
 we have here 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.690
 the next command to change from 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.230
 folder is the cd 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.880
 this is basic ms 2 or that is the one that knows more 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.560
 2 will know how to do this and if not good 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:26.720
 Well, here you have it, it's pretty 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:29.330
 easy yields and how I play games 1 in this 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.840
 case because it is shortened as an address 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.639
 from ms-dos I'm already in games here dir is 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.940
 to see the directories that are inside 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:40.940
 from that game folder and we have dark 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.669
 font that is to give force is the wolf wolf in 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:48.229
 which it is Wolfenstein for nothing we will 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:50.080
 give it to give force and find the 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:53.479
 directory here we have a few 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.340
 files that are the ones that I've already 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:58.490
 previously downloaded from another's 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.440
 other pages and there is how you can 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.169
 check some executables in this 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:07.300
 case that should be executed in which 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:10.030
 must be executed is the dark exe 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.250
 and then well then, I just already 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.430
 like in that one file or nothing for the 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:21.270
 style you just have to write the 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:23.910
 executable path is given inside 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:27.540
 and once this is done 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.289
 As you can see if the game runs 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.509
 perfectly 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:33.849
 and well this has been all this is like 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:35.919
 you can see is extremely simple 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:38.339
 I'm going to remove this, it's not going to be that 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:42.129
 Jodan is extremely simple 

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:44.529
 surely make more videos playing 

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:46.539
 games of these old ones and I will give you the 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:48.339
 links to download it in the description 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:50.319
 of the videos and you know if it has 

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:52.300
 seemed interesting or something you can give 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:54.849
 to like and if you want to see more tutorials 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:58.680
 of this type then subscribe to my channel 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:58.680
 greetings and see you soon friends
