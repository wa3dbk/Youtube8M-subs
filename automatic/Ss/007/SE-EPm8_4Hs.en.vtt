00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
but it's like it doesn't to me I think

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.620 
but it's like it doesn't to me I think
foo<00:02:18.560> just<00:02:18.830> is<00:02:18.920> way<00:02:19.190> better<00:02:19.430> this<00:02:19.670> way<00:02:19.880> I<00:02:20.120> would

foo just is way better this way I would

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.330 
foo just is way better this way I would
