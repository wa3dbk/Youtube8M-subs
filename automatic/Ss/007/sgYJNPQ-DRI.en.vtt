Allosaurus

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
Allosaurus

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.339 
Allosaurus
this<00:00:18.150> one<00:00:18.359> looks<00:00:18.510> really<00:00:18.900> bright<00:00:19.080> and

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:19.349 
this one looks really bright and

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:20.660 
this one looks really bright and
colorful<00:00:19.769> it's<00:00:19.890> smaller<00:00:20.189> than<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.520> other

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
colorful it's smaller than the other

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.340 
colorful it's smaller than the other
predators<00:00:21.119> we've<00:00:21.300> had<00:00:21.450> so<00:00:21.660> far<00:00:21.690> but<00:00:22.200> it

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
predators we've had so far but it

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.350 
predators we've had so far but it
doesn't<00:00:22.680> look<00:00:22.800> any<00:00:23.039> less<00:00:23.130> detailed<00:00:23.789> so<00:00:24.000> let's

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
doesn't look any less detailed so let's

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:32.950 
doesn't look any less detailed so let's
break<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.600> one<00:00:24.930> out<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.380> packaging<00:00:28.940> okay

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.869 

the<00:00:33.960> Allosaurus<00:00:34.530> does<00:00:34.770> come<00:00:35.010> with<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.430> stand

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
the Allosaurus does come with a stand

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.029 
the Allosaurus does come with a stand
and<00:00:36.180> with<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.899> other<00:00:37.109> dinosaurs<00:00:37.440> we've<00:00:37.890> had

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:38.039 
and with the other dinosaurs we've had

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:39.680 
and with the other dinosaurs we've had
trouble<00:00:38.249> getting<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.699> dinosaurs<00:00:39.179> on<00:00:39.449> those

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
trouble getting the dinosaurs on those

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.529 
trouble getting the dinosaurs on those
stands<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:40.350> let's<00:00:41.010> see<00:00:41.280> how<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.729> Allosaurus

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:42.539 
stands so let's see how the Allosaurus

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:45.469 
stands so let's see how the Allosaurus
does<00:00:42.839> so<00:00:43.350> here<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.190> Allosaurus<00:00:44.940> out<00:00:45.239> of

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:45.479 
does so here is the Allosaurus out of

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:47.569 
does so here is the Allosaurus out of
its<00:00:45.629> packaging<00:00:46.019> and<00:00:46.319> on<00:00:46.530> its<00:00:46.769> display<00:00:47.069> stand

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
its packaging and on its display stand

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.059 
its packaging and on its display stand
and<00:00:47.850> as<00:00:48.449> usual<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.289> dinosaur<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.799> having

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:50.069 
and as usual the dinosaur is having

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:52.610 
and as usual the dinosaur is having
trouble<00:00:50.429> attaching<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.600> his<00:00:51.870> stand<00:00:52.229> I<00:00:52.530> don't

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
trouble attaching to his stand I don't

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.200 
trouble attaching to his stand I don't
know<00:00:52.829> if<00:00:52.889> you<00:00:52.979> can<00:00:53.100> see<00:00:53.370> there<00:00:53.609> but<00:00:53.760> one<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:53.999> the

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
know if you can see there but one of the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.930 
know if you can see there but one of the
feet<00:00:54.479> is<00:00:54.839> actually<00:00:55.260> peeling<00:00:55.889> off<00:00:56.129> one<00:00:56.429> of<00:00:56.729> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
feet is actually peeling off one of the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.270 
feet is actually peeling off one of the
pegs<00:00:57.269> which<00:00:57.959> is<00:00:58.139> not<00:00:58.409> a<00:00:58.440> good<00:00:58.709> sign

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
pegs which is not a good sign

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.099 
pegs which is not a good sign
having<00:00:59.639> said<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.239> one<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.629> standing

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
having said that this one is standing

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.959 
having said that this one is standing
more<00:01:01.229> stable<00:01:01.679> II<00:01:01.799> than<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.219> Spinosaurus<00:01:02.789> and

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
more stable II than the Spinosaurus and

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.609 
more stable II than the Spinosaurus and
the<00:01:03.119> t-rex<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.600> we've<00:01:03.749> both<00:01:03.869> reviewed<00:01:04.290> so

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
the t-rex that we've both reviewed so

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.350 
the t-rex that we've both reviewed so
far<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.280> actually<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> really<00:01:06.030> nice

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
far this is actually a really nice

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.630 
far this is actually a really nice
looking<00:01:06.810> figure<00:01:07.140> it's<00:01:07.740> smaller<00:01:08.250> than<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
looking figure it's smaller than the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.700 
looking figure it's smaller than the
other<00:01:08.820> dinosaurs<00:01:09.450> but<00:01:09.690> actually<00:01:10.050> it's<00:01:10.170> really

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
other dinosaurs but actually it's really

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.680 
other dinosaurs but actually it's really
highly<00:01:11.040> detailed<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.850> love<00:01:12.120> this<00:01:12.270> orange

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
highly detailed and I love this orange

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.750 
highly detailed and I love this orange
and<00:01:12.810> red<00:01:12.960> paint<00:01:13.200> scheme<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.280> without<00:01:14.520> further

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
and red paint scheme so without further

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.940 
and red paint scheme so without further
ado<00:01:15.120> let's<00:01:15.570> take<00:01:15.690> a<00:01:15.870> closer<00:01:16.170> look<00:01:16.320> starting

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
ado let's take a closer look starting

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.680 
ado let's take a closer look starting
off<00:01:17.370> with<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.640> display<00:01:18.060> base<00:01:18.300> you<00:01:18.510> can<00:01:18.660> see

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
off with the display base you can see

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.180 
off with the display base you can see
we've<00:01:18.900> got<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.110> really<00:01:19.470> natural-looking

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
we've got this really natural-looking

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.550 
we've got this really natural-looking
rocky<00:01:20.790> surface<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.540> think<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.410> probably

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
rocky surface I think this is probably

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.290 
rocky surface I think this is probably
the<00:01:22.740> best<00:01:22.890> one<00:01:23.130> we've<00:01:23.280> seen<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:23.670> far<00:01:23.700> simply

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
the best one we've seen so far simply

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.360 
the best one we've seen so far simply
because<00:01:24.570> it's<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:24.870> understated<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:26.070> can<00:01:26.190> just

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
because it's so understated you can just

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.620 
because it's so understated you can just
see<00:01:26.430> it's<00:01:26.580> got<00:01:26.670> some<00:01:26.700> little<00:01:27.030> highlights<00:01:27.450> of

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
see it's got some little highlights of

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.780 
see it's got some little highlights of
lighter<00:01:27.840> gray<00:01:28.260> and<00:01:28.950> it's<00:01:29.070> just<00:01:29.220> really<00:01:29.460> simple

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
lighter gray and it's just really simple

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.520 
lighter gray and it's just really simple
in<00:01:30.090> terms<00:01:30.120> of<00:01:30.480> its<00:01:30.600> sculpt<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.110> think<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.410> is

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
in terms of its sculpt I think this is

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.350 
in terms of its sculpt I think this is
probably<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.830> most<00:01:31.980> effective<00:01:32.520> one<00:01:32.730> as<00:01:33.090> you

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
probably the most effective one as you

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.880 
probably the most effective one as you
can<00:01:33.420> see<00:01:33.540> we've<00:01:33.750> got<00:01:33.810> indentations<00:01:34.470> for<00:01:34.740> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
can see we've got indentations for the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.370 
can see we've got indentations for the
feet<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.370> little<00:01:35.670> pegs<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.630> keep<00:01:37.200> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
feet and little pegs to keep the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.470 
feet and little pegs to keep the
dinosaur<00:01:37.860> secure<00:01:38.370> if<00:01:38.640> his<00:01:38.910> feet<00:01:39.210> will

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 
dinosaur secure if his feet will

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.450 
dinosaur secure if his feet will
actually<00:01:39.990> fit<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.620> on<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.860> reverse<00:01:40.980> we<00:01:41.280> just

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
actually fit and on the reverse we just

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.270 
actually fit and on the reverse we just
got<00:01:41.580> a<00:01:41.610> simple<00:01:41.850> flat<00:01:42.510> gray<00:01:42.930> there<00:01:43.230> so<00:01:43.590> really

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
got a simple flat gray there so really

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.090 
got a simple flat gray there so really
nice<00:01:44.460> simple<00:01:44.730> display<00:01:45.480> base<00:01:45.690> so<00:01:46.380> starting<00:01:47.010> off

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
nice simple display base so starting off

the<00:06:10.140> Spinosaurus<00:06:10.680> to<00:06:10.890> stand<00:06:11.310> for<00:06:11.610> just<00:06:11.820> a<00:06:11.910> few

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
the Spinosaurus to stand for just a few

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.940 
the Spinosaurus to stand for just a few
seconds<00:06:12.660> but<00:06:12.780> he<00:06:12.870> might<00:06:13.020> topple<00:06:13.380> over<00:06:13.590> any

minute and you can see that the

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.090 
minute and you can see that the
Spinosaurus<00:06:16.110> is<00:06:16.260> much<00:06:16.470> larger<00:06:16.890> than<00:06:16.979> the
