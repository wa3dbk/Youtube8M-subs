have any little trapdoor for anything
like<00:02:10.660> that

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
like that

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.630 
like that
let's<00:02:12.460> just<00:02:12.550> go<00:02:12.670> back<00:02:12.820> to<00:02:12.850> open<00:02:13.630> us<00:02:13.750> up<00:02:13.870> again

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
let's just go back to open us up again

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.710 
let's just go back to open us up again
the<00:02:16.450> keyboard<00:02:16.870> itself<00:02:17.230> is<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:19.000> does<00:02:19.240> have<00:02:19.420> some

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
the keyboard itself is it does have some

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.090 
the keyboard itself is it does have some
give<00:02:19.990> in<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.290> chassis<00:02:20.500> there<00:02:20.770> you<00:02:20.830> can<00:02:20.950> feel

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
give in the chassis there you can feel

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.580 
give in the chassis there you can feel
it<00:02:21.250> but<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:22.060> chiclet<00:02:22.420> keys<00:02:22.630> are<00:02:22.840> quite<00:02:23.050> bouncy

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
it but the chiclet keys are quite bouncy

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.670 
it but the chiclet keys are quite bouncy
and<00:02:23.940> feel<00:02:24.940> not<00:02:25.150> so<00:02:25.180> bad<00:02:25.480> I<00:02:25.750> guess<00:02:26.110> this<00:02:26.530> is<00:02:26.650> a

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
and feel not so bad I guess this is a

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.230 
and feel not so bad I guess this is a
nice<00:02:26.830> large<00:02:27.010> trackpad<00:02:27.670> here<00:02:27.880> with<00:02:28.030> two

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
nice large trackpad here with two

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.830 
nice large trackpad here with two
integrated<00:02:28.660> buttons<00:02:28.990> either<00:02:29.110> side

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
integrated buttons either side

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.690 
integrated buttons either side
it's<00:02:31.349> positioned<00:02:31.830> reasonably<00:02:32.190> well<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.400> guess

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
it's positioned reasonably well I guess

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.600 
it's positioned reasonably well I guess
so<00:02:32.910> that<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.150> can<00:02:33.800> its<00:02:34.800> up<00:02:34.950> up<00:02:35.099> that's<00:02:35.370> that's

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
so that you can its up up that's that's

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.580 
so that you can its up up that's that's
quite<00:02:35.910> nice<00:02:36.090> my<00:02:36.630> main<00:02:36.930> issue<00:02:37.170> with<00:02:37.440> this

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
quite nice my main issue with this

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.500 
quite nice my main issue with this
device<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.160> fact<00:02:38.489> family<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:39.060> really<00:02:39.330> think

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
device is the fact family I really think

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.180 
device is the fact family I really think
most<00:02:39.840> laptops<00:02:40.080> today<00:02:40.380> should<00:02:40.530> be<00:02:40.709> touchscreen

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
most laptops today should be touchscreen

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.339 
most laptops today should be touchscreen
this<00:02:41.610> is<00:02:41.790> not<00:02:41.940> touchscreen<00:02:42.239> and<00:02:42.870> this<00:02:43.020> is<00:02:43.170> one

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
this is not touchscreen and this is one

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:44.809 
this is not touchscreen and this is one
area<00:02:43.590> I<00:02:43.800> think<00:02:43.890> kind<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.340> lets<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.730> device

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
area I think kind of lets the device

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.030 
area I think kind of lets the device
down<00:02:45.270> it<00:02:46.020> just<00:02:46.290> lacks<00:02:46.500> any<00:02:46.770> kind<00:02:46.950> of

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
down it just lacks any kind of

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.110 
down it just lacks any kind of
brightness<00:02:47.430> you're<00:02:47.550> going<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.730> be<00:02:47.790> totally

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
brightness you're going to be totally

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.699 
brightness you're going to be totally
screwed<00:02:48.330> outdoors<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.080> viewing<00:02:49.290> angles<00:02:49.590> are

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
screwed outdoors the viewing angles are

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.520 
screwed outdoors the viewing angles are
not<00:02:49.800> great<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.970> be<00:02:51.060> honestly<00:02:51.500> it<00:02:52.500> just

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
not great and to be honestly it just

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.370 
not great and to be honestly it just
really<00:02:53.130> kind<00:02:53.370> of<00:02:53.430> looks<00:02:53.670> quite<00:02:54.450> cheap<00:02:54.720> but<00:02:55.260> hey

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
really kind of looks quite cheap but hey

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.490 
really kind of looks quite cheap but hey
with<00:02:55.819> $249<00:02:56.819> maybe<00:02:57.540> this<00:02:57.750> is<00:02:57.900> what<00:02:58.110> we<00:02:58.200> got<00:02:58.380> it

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
with $249 maybe this is what we got it

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.199 
with $249 maybe this is what we got it
should<00:02:58.800> expect

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
should expect

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.149 
should expect
also<00:03:00.959> I<00:03:00.989> guess<00:03:01.260> one<00:03:01.469> thing<00:03:01.500> which<00:03:01.799> is<00:03:01.829> a<00:03:02.040> little

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
also I guess one thing which is a little

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:03.530 
also I guess one thing which is a little
bit<00:03:02.370> disappointing<00:03:02.609> there's<00:03:03.000> only<00:03:03.090> 16

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
bit disappointing there's only 16

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.209 
bit disappointing there's only 16

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:05.219 
gigabytes of storage which is OK for a

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.569 
gigabytes of storage which is OK for a
