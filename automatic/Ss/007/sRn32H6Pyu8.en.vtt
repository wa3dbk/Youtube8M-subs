purely<00:00:57.449> because<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:57.989> iPad<00:00:58.410> this<00:00:58.530> nine<00:00:58.829> point

purely because this iPad this nine point
seven<00:00:59.370> inch<00:00:59.609> iPad<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.270> just<00:01:00.840> very<00:01:01.230> very<00:01:01.440> thin

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
seven inch iPad is just very very thin

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.359 
seven inch iPad is just very very thin
the<00:01:02.160> same<00:01:02.430> thickness<00:01:03.180> as<00:01:03.660> an<00:01:04.140> iPhone<00:01:04.589> 5s<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.280> be

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
the same thickness as an iPhone 5s to be

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.370 
the same thickness as an iPhone 5s to be
exact<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.970> if<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.299> want<00:01:06.450> more<00:01:06.659> emphasis<00:01:07.140> here

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
exact and if you want more emphasis here

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.410 
exact and if you want more emphasis here
it<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.530> next<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.010> standard<00:01:08.729> HB<00:01:09.240> pencil

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
it is next to a standard HB pencil

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.940 
it is next to a standard HB pencil
probably<00:01:10.020> something<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.409> have<00:01:10.560> lying<00:01:10.860> around

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
probably something you have lying around

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.550 
probably something you have lying around
the<00:01:11.220> house<00:01:11.400> if<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.299> need<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.630> comparison<00:01:13.350> as

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
the house if you need a comparison as

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.740 
the house if you need a comparison as
you<00:01:13.860> can<00:01:13.979> see<00:01:14.159> they're<00:01:14.400> just<00:01:14.430> insanely<00:01:15.360> thin

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
you can see they're just insanely thin

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.570 
you can see they're just insanely thin
so<00:01:16.259> that's<00:01:16.439> definitely<00:01:16.590> one<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:16.950> my<00:01:17.040> top<00:01:17.130> 5

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
so that's definitely one of my top 5

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.149 
so that's definitely one of my top 5
next<00:01:18.299> up<00:01:18.450> just<00:01:18.780> how<00:01:18.900> light<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.500> thing<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.920> it

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
next up just how light this thing is it

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.460 
next up just how light this thing is it
really<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.909> quite<00:01:21.240> exceptional<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:22.110> go<00:01:22.259> from

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
really is quite exceptional to go from

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.940 
really is quite exceptional to go from
the<00:01:22.619> iPad<00:01:23.009> 4<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.180> iPad<00:01:24.630> air<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.229> really

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
the iPad 4 to the iPad air it really

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.830 
the iPad 4 to the iPad air it really
does<00:01:26.130> make<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.369> difference<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:27.150> vast

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
does make a difference the vast

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.319 
does make a difference the vast
reduction<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.530> kind<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.950> thickness<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.820> also

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
reduction in kind of thickness and also

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.060 
reduction in kind of thickness and also
the<00:01:30.450> thinner<00:01:30.750> bezels<00:01:31.259> result<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:31.890> a

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
the thinner bezels result in a

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.700 
the thinner bezels result in a
fantastically<00:01:33.060> light<00:01:33.329> package<00:01:33.750> now<00:01:34.140> it's

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
fantastically light package now it's

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.740 
fantastically light package now it's
about<00:01:34.799> half<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.310> pound<00:01:35.579> less<00:01:36.030> in<00:01:36.240> weight<00:01:36.479> than

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
about half a pound less in weight than

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.480 
about half a pound less in weight than
the<00:01:36.869> old<00:01:37.079> iPad<00:01:37.500> 4<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.280> obviously

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
the old iPad 4 so that is obviously

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.940 
the old iPad 4 so that is obviously
quite<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.150> substantial<00:01:39.439> reduction<00:01:40.439> in<00:01:40.470> weight

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
quite a substantial reduction in weight

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.740 
quite a substantial reduction in weight
this<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.579> now<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.729> viable<00:01:42.030> option<00:01:42.329> just<00:01:42.600> to

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
this is now a viable option just to

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.389
