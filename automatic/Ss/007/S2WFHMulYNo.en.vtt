here<00:00:19.560> which<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:20.520> think<00:00:21.419> it's<00:00:21.599> the<00:00:21.750> weakest<00:00:22.140> from

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:22.829 
here which I think it's the weakest from

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:27.080 
here which I think it's the weakest from
all<00:00:22.980> these<00:00:25.070> personally<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.099> don't<00:00:26.160> think<00:00:26.279> it's

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
all these personally I don't think it's

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.420 
all these personally I don't think it's
a<00:00:27.239> very<00:00:27.360> good<00:00:27.480> computer<00:00:27.779> my<00:00:27.989> friend<00:00:28.199> has<00:00:28.380> it

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.430 
a very good computer my friend has it

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.619 
a very good computer my friend has it
it's<00:00:29.430> very<00:00:29.790> slow<00:00:30.710> probably<00:00:32.030> too<00:00:33.030> slow<00:00:33.360> in<00:00:33.540> my

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 
it's very slow probably too slow in my

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:36.200 
it's very slow probably too slow in my
opinion<00:00:33.960> for<00:00:34.290> what<00:00:34.559> it's<00:00:34.800> worth<00:00:35.090> what<00:00:36.090> the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
opinion for what it's worth what the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.830 
opinion for what it's worth what the
cost<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:37.340> next<00:00:38.340> we<00:00:38.430> have<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.610> macbook<00:00:39.059> pro<00:00:39.539> which

cost is next we have a macbook pro which
is<00:00:40.050> pretty<00:00:40.500> high<00:00:40.800> on<00:00:40.829> there<00:00:41.280> considering<00:00:41.879> that

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
is pretty high on there considering that

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.130 
is pretty high on there considering that
um<00:00:42.500> it's<00:00:43.500> basically<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.920> mac<00:00:44.219> mini<00:00:44.250> in<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:45.660> laptop

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
key keyboard it's perfect it's a

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.070 
key keyboard it's perfect it's a
beautiful<00:02:35.620> computer

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.690 

I<00:02:39.170> would<00:02:39.950> not<00:02:40.340> go<00:02:40.730> with<00:02:41.740> the<00:02:42.740> next<00:02:43.070> model<00:02:43.580> up

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
I would not go with the next model up

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.020 
I would not go with the next model up
sighs<00:02:43.970> I<00:02:44.000> mean<00:02:44.360> it's<00:02:45.170> honestly<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:46.040> only

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
sighs I mean it's honestly the only

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.440 
sighs I mean it's honestly the only
thing<00:02:47.390> differences<00:02:48.430> point<00:02:49.430> 2<00:02:49.640> gigahertz<00:02:49.970> more

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
thing differences point 2 gigahertz more

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.150 
thing differences point 2 gigahertz more
and<00:02:50.720> what's<00:02:51.320> that<00:02:51.380> really<00:02:51.650> going<00:02:51.770> to<00:02:51.830> do<00:02:51.920> right

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
and what's that really going to do right

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.680 
and what's that really going to do right
now<00:02:52.310> I<00:02:52.340> mean<00:02:52.520> my<00:02:52.670> computer<00:02:53.210> right<00:02:53.330> now<00:02:53.390> is<00:02:53.660> a

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
now I mean my computer right now is a

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.980 
now I mean my computer right now is a
point<00:02:54.230> is<00:02:54.940> 2.9<00:02:55.940> gigahertz<00:02:56.240> that's<00:02:56.840> my

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
point is 2.9 gigahertz that's my

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.490 
point is 2.9 gigahertz that's my
computer<00:02:57.350> right<00:02:57.440> now<00:02:57.500> and<00:02:58.210> I<00:02:59.210> think

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
computer right now and I think

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.800 
computer right now and I think
downgrading<00:03:00.880> 2.7<00:03:01.880> is<00:03:02.090> actually<00:03:02.570> going<00:03:02.720> to

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
downgrading 2.7 is actually going to

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.420 
downgrading 2.7 is actually going to
make<00:03:02.930> that<00:03:03.140> much<00:03:03.320> of<00:03:03.350> a<00:03:03.500> difference<00:03:03.530> on<00:03:03.980> say<00:03:04.280> my

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
make that much of a difference on say my

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.940 
make that much of a difference on say my
opinion<00:03:04.990> especially<00:03:05.990> for<00:03:06.470> that<00:03:06.500> much<00:03:06.770> of<00:03:06.920> a

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
opinion especially for that much of a

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.170 
opinion especially for that much of a
difference<00:03:06.980> for<00:03:07.520> the<00:03:07.610> price<00:03:09.730> also<00:03:10.730> give<00:03:11.060> the

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
difference for the price also give the

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.130 
difference for the price also give the
money<00:03:11.360> go<00:03:11.780> for<00:03:11.990> the<00:03:12.110> 27-inch<00:03:12.800> I<00:03:13.070> mean<00:03:13.220> uh<00:03:13.250> it

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
money go for the 27-inch I mean uh it

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.370 
money go for the 27-inch I mean uh it
already<00:03:15.140> comes<00:03:15.290> with<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.680> 2.9<00:03:16.160> gigahertz

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
already comes with the 2.9 gigahertz

already comes with the 2.9 gigahertz
stape<00:03:18.380> same<00:03:18.740> stuff<00:03:19.010> like<00:03:19.190> this<00:03:19.370> except<00:03:19.970> it's

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
stape same stuff like this except it's

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.440 
stape same stuff like this except it's
bigger<00:03:21.800> and<00:03:22.070> I<00:03:22.790> guess<00:03:22.940> a<00:03:22.970> little<00:03:23.150> bit<00:03:23.300> more

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
bigger and I guess a little bit more

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.530 
bigger and I guess a little bit more
expensive<00:03:23.800> I<00:03:24.800> would<00:03:25.670> not<00:03:25.760> go<00:03:25.790> this<00:03:26.090> on<00:03:26.270> go<00:03:26.390> with

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
expensive I would not go this on go with

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.050 
expensive I would not go this on go with
this<00:03:26.660> and<00:03:26.720> actually<00:03:27.400> actually<00:03:28.400> no<00:03:28.490> I<00:03:28.520> would<00:03:28.940> go

this and actually actually no I would go
with<00:03:29.090> this<00:03:29.330> one<00:03:29.390> just<00:03:29.959> because<00:03:30.110> it's<00:03:30.260> a

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
with this one just because it's a

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.480 
with this one just because it's a
three-pointer<00:03:30.920> gigahertz<00:03:31.220> I<00:03:31.670> guess<00:03:33.370> if<00:03:34.370> you

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
three-pointer gigahertz I guess if you

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.160 
three-pointer gigahertz I guess if you
want<00:03:34.700> that<00:03:34.760> if<00:03:35.090> you<00:03:35.209> want<00:03:35.390> the<00:03:35.480> ex<00:03:35.570> I<00:03:35.780> mean<00:03:35.810> I

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
mean I wouldn't go for it I guess just

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.960 
mean I wouldn't go for it I guess just
because<00:03:38.720> it's<00:03:38.959> tattled<00:03:39.459> no<00:03:40.459> its<00:03:40.790> you<00:03:40.820> guys

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
think I'm a gorgeous what I use right

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.670 
think I'm a gorgeous what I use right
now<00:03:53.790> in<00:03:54.330> school<00:03:54.930> for<00:03:55.830> video<00:03:56.730> production<00:03:56.940> i<00:03:57.680> use

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
now in school for video production i use

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.800 
now in school for video production i use
a<00:03:58.710> mac<00:03:59.010> pearl<00:04:00.380> we<00:04:01.380> use<00:04:01.530> in<00:04:01.680> 2010<00:04:02.460> so<00:04:03.300> we<00:04:03.570> get<00:04:03.690> the

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
a mac pearl we use in 2010 so we get the

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.240 
a mac pearl we use in 2010 so we get the
baseline<00:04:05.270> actually<00:04:06.860> either<00:04:07.860> we<00:04:08.040> have<00:04:08.130> the

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
baseline actually either we have the

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.520 
baseline actually either we have the
baseline<00:04:08.790> or<00:04:09.090> we<00:04:09.210> have<00:04:09.420> that<00:04:09.900> excellent<00:04:10.350> up

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
baseline or we have that excellent up

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.790 
baseline or we have that excellent up
because<00:04:11.130> i<00:04:11.280> know<00:04:11.340> we<00:04:11.580> have<00:04:11.610> 12<00:04:12.300> gigs<00:04:12.510> of<00:04:12.660> memory

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
because i know we have 12 gigs of memory

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.470 
because i know we have 12 gigs of memory
12<00:04:13.800> gigs<00:04:14.130> of<00:04:14.250> ram<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:14.670> our<00:04:14.940> computers<00:04:15.330> we

12 gigs of ram and our computers we

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.430 
12 gigs of ram and our computers we
probably<00:04:15.690> just<00:04:15.840> updated<00:04:16.410> ourselves<00:04:17.989> if<00:04:18.989> you

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
probably just updated ourselves if you

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.130 
probably just updated ourselves if you

especially<00:04:44.550> with<00:04:44.670> one<00:04:44.970> terabyte<00:04:45.360> hard<00:04:45.570> drive

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
especially with one terabyte hard drive

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.560 
especially with one terabyte hard drive
I'd<00:04:46.380> get<00:04:46.830> SSD<00:04:47.520> already<00:04:48.150> if<00:04:48.210> you<00:04:48.300> have<00:04:48.420> this

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
I'd get SSD already if you have this

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.990 
I'd get SSD already if you have this
much<00:04:48.810> money<00:04:48.990> to<00:04:49.260> buy<00:04:49.410> a<00:04:49.440> basically<00:04:50.220> $3,000

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
much money to buy a basically $3,000

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.080 
much money to buy a basically $3,000
computer<00:04:51.660> I<00:04:51.870> ESS<00:04:52.680> dee<00:04:52.860> personally<00:04:53.400> because<00:04:53.940> it

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
computer I ESS dee personally because it

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.940 
computer I ESS dee personally because it
makes<00:04:54.240> it<00:04:54.390> that<00:04:54.420> much<00:04:54.780> faster<00:04:55.020> just<00:04:55.800> by

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
makes it that much faster just by

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.450 
makes it that much faster just by
loading<00:04:56.520> everything<00:04:56.880> if<00:04:57.480> you<00:04:58.350> render<00:04:58.740> if<00:04:59.220> you

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
loading everything if you render if you

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.860 
loading everything if you render if you
what<00:05:00.060> do<00:05:00.120> we<00:05:00.150> do<00:05:00.390> um<00:05:02.150> maybe<00:05:03.150> this<00:05:03.390> computer<00:05:03.750> can

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
what do we do um maybe this computer can

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.130 
what do we do um maybe this computer can
even<00:05:04.290> play<00:05:04.530> video<00:05:05.070> games<00:05:05.310> I'm<00:05:05.940> not<00:05:06.240> sure<00:05:06.300> I<00:05:06.840> I

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
even play video games I'm not sure I I

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.890 
even play video games I'm not sure I I
never<00:05:07.590> really<00:05:08.100> played<00:05:08.430> actual<00:05:09.150> hard<00:05:09.570> hard

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
never really played actual hard hard

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.990 
never really played actual hard hard
video<00:05:10.140> games<00:05:10.380> I<00:05:10.590> mean<00:05:10.740> and<00:05:10.980> scribes<00:05:11.820> seen

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
video games I mean and scribes seen

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.400 
video games I mean and scribes seen
people<00:05:12.240> playing<00:05:12.480> like<00:05:12.660> congregate<00:05:13.320> and

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
people playing like congregate and

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.560 
people playing like congregate and
that's<00:05:13.590> like<00:05:13.770> little<00:05:14.040> flash<00:05:14.310> games<00:05:14.669> so<00:05:15.360> yeah

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
that's like little flash games so yeah

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.320 
that's like little flash games so yeah
it<00:05:15.750> can<00:05:15.990> play<00:05:16.260> games<00:05:16.500> just<00:05:17.250> not<00:05:17.490> like<00:05:17.760> let's

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
it can play games just not like let's

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.510 
it can play games just not like let's
say<00:05:18.419> league<00:05:18.750> legends<00:05:19.200> for<00:05:19.830> example<00:05:20.280> if<00:05:20.400> you

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
say league legends for example if you

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.370 
say league legends for example if you
want<00:05:20.700> to<00:05:20.760> go<00:05:20.850> for<00:05:21.060> hard<00:05:21.419> on<00:05:21.630> graphics

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
want to go for hard on graphics

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.950 
want to go for hard on graphics
beautiful<00:05:22.980> it's<00:05:23.669> probably<00:05:24.330> not<00:05:24.570> going<00:05:24.720> to<00:05:24.780> do

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
beautiful it's probably not going to do

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.260 
beautiful it's probably not going to do
it<00:05:25.110> just<00:05:25.650> like<00:05:25.770> maybe<00:05:26.070> a<00:05:26.190> PC<00:05:26.640> or<00:05:26.669> a<00:05:26.850> alienware

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
it just like maybe a PC or a alienware

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.360 
it just like maybe a PC or a alienware
it<00:05:27.480> could<00:05:27.600> do<00:05:27.750> but<00:05:28.740> this<00:05:28.950> computer<00:05:29.520> is

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
it could do but this computer is

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:37.240 
it could do but this computer is
pretty<00:05:32.150> damn<00:05:32.479> good<00:05:34.330> so<00:05:35.330> let's<00:05:35.540> summon<00:05:35.750> up<00:05:36.250> I'm

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
pretty damn good so let's summon up I'm

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.580 
pretty damn good so let's summon up I'm
getting<00:05:37.639> an<00:05:37.850> imac<00:05:38.169> personally<00:05:39.169> just<00:05:39.320> because

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
getting an imac personally just because

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.240 
getting an imac personally just because
I<00:05:40.040> think<00:05:40.370> it's<00:05:40.729> beautiful<00:05:40.940> and<00:05:42.130> what<00:05:43.130> it<00:05:43.220> has

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
I think it's beautiful and what it has

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.520 
I think it's beautiful and what it has
inside<00:05:43.729> of<00:05:43.760> it<00:05:44.000> I<00:05:44.240> really<00:05:45.020> don't<00:05:45.169> know<00:05:45.290> where

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 
inside of it I really don't know where

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
i'd go with the mac mini upgrade it get

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.529 
i'd go with the mac mini upgrade it get
16<00:06:09.260> gigs<00:06:09.470> ram<00:06:09.710> 100<00:06:10.340> bucks<00:06:10.550> or<00:06:10.850> spend<00:06:11.360> like

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:11.539 
16 gigs ram 100 bucks or spend like

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:17.920 
16 gigs ram 100 bucks or spend like
forty<00:06:12.110> dollars<00:06:12.470> and<00:06:12.740> get<00:06:12.860> a<00:06:13.160> gigs<00:06:14.150> ram<00:06:15.910> so<00:06:16.910> i<00:06:17.330> do

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
forty dollars and get a gigs ram so i do

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.300 
forty dollars and get a gigs ram so i do
that<00:06:18.199> actually<00:06:18.740> if<00:06:18.830> you<00:06:18.889> already<00:06:19.010> have<00:06:19.190> four

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
that actually if you already have four

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:20.620 
that actually if you already have four
cousin<00:06:19.610> ram<00:06:19.729> just<00:06:19.970> get<00:06:20.090> like<00:06:20.150> a<00:06:20.240> four<00:06:20.449> gig

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:20.630 
cousin ram just get like a four gig

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.870 
cousin ram just get like a four gig
probably<00:06:21.050> even<00:06:21.139> thirty<00:06:21.470> dollars<00:06:21.830> update<00:06:22.729> that

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 
probably even thirty dollars update that

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.760 
probably even thirty dollars update that
that's<00:06:23.060> all<00:06:23.180> I<00:06:23.240> really<00:06:23.510> need<00:06:23.660> I<00:06:23.900> would<00:06:24.470> not<00:06:24.590> do

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
that's all I really need I would not do

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.330 
that's all I really need I would not do
anything<00:06:24.949> else<00:06:25.250> to<00:06:25.340> that<00:06:25.490> computer<00:06:25.639> um<00:06:26.600> I<00:06:27.340> went

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:28.340 
anything else to that computer um I went

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.650 
anything else to that computer um I went
to<00:06:28.490> Best<00:06:28.729> Buy<00:06:28.880> and<00:06:29.000> I<00:06:29.210> checked<00:06:29.479> it<00:06:29.600> out<00:06:30.039> it<00:06:31.660> was

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:32.660 
to Best Buy and I checked it out it was

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.360 
to Best Buy and I checked it out it was
not<00:06:32.930> to<00:06:33.080> my<00:06:33.199> liking<00:06:33.229> I<00:06:33.740> mean<00:06:34.010> but<00:06:34.130> then<00:06:34.220> again

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:34.370 
not to my liking I mean but then again

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.790 
not to my liking I mean but then again
they<00:06:34.639> had<00:06:34.669> just<00:06:34.850> four<00:06:35.330> gigs<00:06:35.510> ram<00:06:35.780> on<00:06:36.020> it<00:06:36.169> and<00:06:36.349> I

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
they had just four gigs ram on it and I

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.730 
they had just four gigs ram on it and I
checked<00:06:37.220> like<00:06:37.780> internet<00:06:38.780> went<00:06:39.080> like<00:06:39.229> that<00:06:39.470> but

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740 
checked like internet went like that but

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.110 
checked like internet went like that but
then<00:06:39.860> again<00:06:39.979> best<00:06:40.370> buy<00:06:40.520> probably<00:06:40.910> doesn't

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 
then again best buy probably doesn't

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.480 
then again best buy probably doesn't
