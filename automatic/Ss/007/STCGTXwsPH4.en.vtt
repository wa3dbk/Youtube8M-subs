00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
back okay this here is a cutaway that I

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.470 
back okay this here is a cutaway that I
made<00:00:39.920> as<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.219> can<00:00:41.370> see<00:00:41.579> all<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.760> pins<00:00:42.120> are<00:00:42.329> now

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
made as you can see all the pins are now

peak<00:00:46.289> Bogota<00:00:49.700> this<00:00:50.700> cutaway<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:52.050> made<00:00:53.010> by<00:00:53.219> hand

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
peak Bogota this cutaway I made by hand

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.520 
peak Bogota this cutaway I made by hand
I<00:00:54.180> just<00:00:54.840> used<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.170> hacksaw<00:00:55.879> i<00:00:56.879> notched<00:00:57.690> each<00:00:58.199> of

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
I just used a hacksaw i notched each of

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.950 
I just used a hacksaw i notched each of
the<00:00:58.590> chambers<00:00:59.129> with<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.640> file<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.629> give<00:01:00.780> me<00:01:00.930> a

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
the chambers with a file to give me a

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.729 
the chambers with a file to give me a
pilot<00:01:01.440> groove<00:01:01.879> so<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.510> cuts<00:01:03.750> are<00:01:04.260> fairly

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
pilot groove so that the cuts are fairly

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.580 
pilot groove so that the cuts are fairly
straight<00:01:05.250> their<00:01:05.580> little<00:01:05.850> angle<00:01:06.240> but<00:01:06.560> all<00:01:07.560> I

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
straight their little angle but all I

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.280 
straight their little angle but all I
have<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.070> do<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.490> go<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.909> with<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> flat<00:01:09.450> file<00:01:09.810> and

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
have to do is go in with a flat file and

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.250 
have to do is go in with a flat file and
just<00:01:10.770> sort<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.420> straighten<00:01:12.420> them<00:01:12.630> out<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:13.110> a

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
just sort of straighten them out just a

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.120 
just sort of straighten them out just a
little<00:01:13.290> bit<00:01:15.439> so<00:01:16.439> they<00:01:16.590> look<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.799> little<00:01:16.920> bit

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
little bit so they look a little bit

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.249 
little bit so they look a little bit
more<00:01:17.280> like<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.640> first<00:01:17.909> chamber<00:01:18.450> here<00:01:18.689> and

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.700 

the<00:01:22.259> great<00:01:22.500> thing<00:01:22.530> about<00:01:22.799> this<00:01:23.810> cutaway<00:01:24.810> is

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
the great thing about this cutaway is

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.280 
the great thing about this cutaway is
that<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.610> Chamber's<00:01:27.119> can<00:01:27.750> be<00:01:27.900> loaded<00:01:28.110> from

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
that the Chamber's can be loaded from

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.560 
that the Chamber's can be loaded from
the<00:01:28.590> top<00:01:28.829> because<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.610> made<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.090> special

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
the top because I made this special

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.620 
the top because I made this special
little<00:01:30.720> clip<00:01:31.170> here<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:32.549> just<00:01:32.820> can<00:01:33.119> pop<00:01:33.390> off

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
little clip here that just can pop off

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.330 
little clip here that just can pop off
and<00:01:34.020> then<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.100> can<00:01:36.110> you<00:01:37.110> can<00:01:37.290> drop<00:01:37.530> spools<00:01:38.009> in

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
and then you can you can drop spools in

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.190 
and then you can you can drop spools in
there<00:01:38.520> if<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.729> want<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.270> can<00:01:39.390> drop<00:01:39.630> mushrooms

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
there if you want you can drop mushrooms

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.980 
there if you want you can drop mushrooms
in<00:01:40.590> there<00:01:41.060> to<00:01:42.060> give<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.360> practice<00:01:42.810> at

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
in there to give you practice at

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.370 
in there to give you practice at
whatever<00:01:43.200> type<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.649> want<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.689> of<00:01:45.689> course<00:01:45.750> you

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
can you can see you can actually see the

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.700 
can you can see you can actually see the
pins<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.360> what<00:01:52.110> they're<00:01:52.320> doing<00:01:54.320> it's<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.560> good

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
pins and what they're doing it's a good

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.319 
pins and what they're doing it's a good
learning<00:01:55.950> aid<00:01:56.310> it's<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.939> good<00:01:57.119> demonstration

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
learning aid it's a good demonstration

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.840 
learning aid it's a good demonstration

not<00:02:01.850> to<00:02:02.030> mention<00:02:02.210> just<00:02:02.509> a<00:02:02.689> fairly<00:02:03.170> neat<00:02:03.320> toy

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
not to mention just a fairly neat toy

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.309 
not to mention just a fairly neat toy
mmm<00:02:04.750> it<00:02:05.750> is<00:02:06.350> mastered<00:02:07.159> the<00:02:08.149> last<00:02:08.420> three<00:02:09.289> or

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
mmm it is mastered the last three or

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.949 
mmm it is mastered the last three or
four<00:02:09.440> chambers<00:02:10.130> have<00:02:10.390> mastering<00:02:11.390> pins<00:02:11.660> in

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
four chambers have mastering pins in

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.790 
four chambers have mastering pins in
them<00:02:12.970> it<00:02:13.970> works<00:02:14.209> fairly<00:02:14.480> very<00:02:15.020> smoothly<00:02:15.410> with

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
them it works fairly very smoothly with

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.550 
them it works fairly very smoothly with
both<00:02:16.040> keys<00:02:19.270> I'm<00:02:20.270> not<00:02:20.660> really<00:02:20.900> too<00:02:21.170> sure<00:02:21.200> what

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
both keys I'm not really too sure what

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.670 
both keys I'm not really too sure what
I'm<00:02:21.650> going<00:02:21.800> to<00:02:21.830> do<00:02:21.950> with<00:02:22.100> it<00:02:22.130> yet<00:02:22.520> but<00:02:23.330> I<00:02:23.780> guess

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
I'm going to do with it yet but I guess

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.770 
I'm going to do with it yet but I guess
you<00:02:24.860> can<00:02:25.010> consider<00:02:25.160> it<00:02:25.520> up<00:02:25.790> for<00:02:26.000> trade<00:02:26.300> if

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
you can consider it up for trade if

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.960 
you can consider it up for trade if
anybody<00:02:27.140> wants<00:02:27.709> it<00:02:28.420> PM<00:02:29.420> me<00:02:30.910> otherwise<00:02:31.910> I

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
anybody wants it PM me otherwise I

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.960 
anybody wants it PM me otherwise I
really<00:02:32.360> haven't<00:02:32.540> made<00:02:32.750> up<00:02:32.780> my<00:02:32.900> mind<00:02:33.019> yet<00:02:33.970> so

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
really haven't made up my mind yet so

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.000 
really haven't made up my mind yet so
anyways<00:02:35.510> there<00:02:35.900> it<00:02:35.989> is<00:02:36.110> my<00:02:36.860> first<00:02:37.100> cut<00:02:37.430> away<00:02:37.930> so
