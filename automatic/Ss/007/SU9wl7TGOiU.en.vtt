00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 Sea turtles are solitary animals that spend 90% of their lives 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.200
 in the open sea 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.750
 a surprising feat of sea turtles that their ability to migrate and 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.750
 then return to the same beach to nest 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.160
 the turtle's struggle for survival is no longer just against those 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.349
 natural predators will also expose people who steal their games for 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.130
 market them as food 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.110
 for that reason a group of people worried about the Salvadoran fauna 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.860
 They decided to take care of them and prepare their release in one of the 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.000
 this department of peace 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.640
 the climatic conditions 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.960
 depth where the games are 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.380
 the wind and the merino vegetables 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.240
 and some disease that we have problems with the weather the pp that paints 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.409
 too cold 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:51.250
 and just as turtles do not 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.810
 no more in mind 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.670
 Now, thank God, at this time, we did not have any problem so that the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.330
 most of the population 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.330
 we had two 90 98 percent of those born 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.190
 the struggle of these techniques to survive starts from the moment they leave the 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.110
 shell 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.110
 They must travel on their own from the beach to the sea 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.550
 The first 48 hours of his life are critical because they must be safe from 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.550
 their predators and in addition to finding their own food 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.520
 if really efe to get it out 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.880
 they all have their followers 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.420
 I think we should all make goals in it the savior 10 trackpad 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.380
 merkel who rules out a marginal advance 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.380
 that is companies with social responsibility 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.290
 I believe that the candidate or not 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.470
 our message to who will be the guests 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.230
 they will realize that bigger satisfaction 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.550
 what you have 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.310
 it was the opportunity 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.450
 with this type of events is also encouraged in childhood and youth 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.030
 Salvadoran response and water 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.690
 after the words of our country 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.410
 araya and saviors 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.340
 already in the missive
