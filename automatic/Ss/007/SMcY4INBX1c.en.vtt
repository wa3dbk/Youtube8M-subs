00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.639 
pigmented and a colossus from the
drugstore<00:00:55.910> so<00:00:56.360> it's<00:00:56.510> definitely<00:00:57.020> a<00:00:57.230> win-win

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
drugstore so it's definitely a win-win

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
wing on the upper lash line because we

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.990 
wing on the upper lash line because we
didn't<00:01:03.230> use<00:01:03.350> any<00:01:03.559> eyeshadow<00:01:03.710> and<00:01:04.280> I<00:01:04.519> did<00:01:04.729> want

fall dark look without looking too

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.690 
fall dark look without looking too
intense<00:02:49.660> so<00:02:50.050> definitely<00:02:50.590> my<00:02:51.100> go-to<00:02:51.280> blush

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700

after that I took my burgundy lip liner

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.490 
after that I took my burgundy lip liner
from<00:02:54.670> and<00:02:55.030> wax<00:02:55.330> which<00:02:55.630> is<00:02:55.780> also<00:02:56.200> one<00:02:56.350> of<00:02:56.380> my

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
from and wax which is also one of my

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.700 
from and wax which is also one of my
fall<00:02:56.890> staples<00:02:57.490> I<00:02:57.760> used<00:02:58.390> it<00:02:58.600> so<00:02:59.020> much<00:02:59.290> and<00:02:59.350> it

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710

think it would suit so many different
eye<00:03:03.730> colors<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:04.360> it<00:03:04.900> has<00:03:05.050> specially<00:03:05.560> add
