00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
different styles so we're going to start

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.160 
different styles so we're going to start
by<00:00:44.219> drawing<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.149> top<00:00:45.390> part<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.780> uniform

there<00:00:50.059> and<00:00:51.059> he's<00:00:51.870> obviously<00:00:52.020> going<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.500> be<00:00:52.590> in

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
there and he's obviously going to be in

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.770 
there and he's obviously going to be in
the<00:00:53.250> middle<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.610> doing<00:00:53.730> something<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.570> we're

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
the middle of doing something so we're

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.080 
the middle of doing something so we're
going<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.070> kind<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.100> put<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.399> make<00:00:56.579> him<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:56.850> sort

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
going to kind of put it make him in sort

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:06.609 
going to kind of put it make him in sort
of<00:00:57.149> an<00:00:57.329> action<00:00:57.870> pose<00:00:58.640> if<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.850> will

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.230 

so<00:01:07.189> that<00:01:07.369> his<00:01:07.520> jersey<00:01:09.460> comes<00:01:10.460> down<00:01:10.789> to<00:01:11.060> right

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
so that his jersey comes down to right

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.260 
so that his jersey comes down to right
about<00:01:11.479> there<00:01:11.899> and<00:01:12.159> we'll<00:01:13.159> draw<00:01:13.340> his<00:01:13.490> arms<00:01:13.520> sort

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.929 
about there and we'll draw his arms sort
of<00:01:17.710> it's<00:01:18.710> not<00:01:18.829> going<00:01:18.950> to<00:01:19.009> be<00:01:19.069> running<00:01:19.250> too<00:01:19.549> fast

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
of it's not going to be running too fast

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:27.780 
of it's not going to be running too fast
or<00:01:20.119> anything<00:01:20.210> but

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.610 

he<00:01:28.660> will<00:01:28.840> be<00:01:28.990> in<00:01:29.080> the<00:01:29.170> middle<00:01:29.410> of<00:01:29.500> doing

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
he will be in the middle of doing

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.640 
he will be in the middle of doing
something<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:32.380> now<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:32.590> shorts<00:01:33.160> come<00:01:33.820> down

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
something so now the shorts come down

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:52.090 
something so now the shorts come down
draw<00:01:35.650> those

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.220 

so<00:01:53.100> we're<00:01:53.220> just<00:01:53.340> kind<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.520> adding<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:54.230> smaller

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.380 
the socks usually come all the way up to
their<00:02:40.530> knees<00:02:40.680> so<00:02:41.070> you<00:02:41.160> come<00:02:41.310> up<00:02:41.430> here<00:02:41.640> will

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
their knees so you come up here will

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:51.620 
their knees so you come up here will
give<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.750> socks<00:02:43.020> some<00:02:43.850> lines<00:02:50.390> same<00:02:51.390> with<00:02:51.540> the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
give the socks some lines same with the

00:02:51.630 --> 00:03:02.710 
give the socks some lines same with the
other<00:02:51.750> side

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.230 

more<00:03:03.320> spikes<00:03:03.770> there<00:03:06.610> and<00:03:07.610> then<00:03:08.120> of<00:03:08.210> course

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
more spikes there and then of course

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.790 
more spikes there and then of course
it'd<00:03:08.630> be<00:03:08.720> probably<00:03:08.960> good<00:03:09.230> idea<00:03:09.500> to<00:03:09.590> put<00:03:09.770> a

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
it'd be probably good idea to put a

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.830 
it'd be probably good idea to put a
little<00:03:09.830> ball<00:03:10.220> right<00:03:10.580> down<00:03:10.880> here<00:03:11.090> so<00:03:11.150> this<00:03:11.480> just

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
little ball right down here so this just

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:19.960 
little ball right down here so this just
so<00:03:12.020> there's<00:03:12.260> no<00:03:12.410> confusion<00:03:17.410> and<00:03:18.970> that's

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
so there's no confusion and that's

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.590 
so there's no confusion and that's
basically<00:03:20.420> how<00:03:20.540> you<00:03:20.660> draw<00:03:20.930> a<00:03:20.990> soccer<00:03:21.290> player
