00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.970
 hello everyone with you about the news today I 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.020
 would like to tell invisible blocks 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.029
 I plant new minecraft new blocks 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.460
 here which were added 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.380
 through the snow you can safely pass on 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.689
 their place you can not put anything in 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.840
 principle it is very difficult to destroy them if 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:38.610
 only dynamites passing through 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:44.670
 these blocks will put you worth you 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:47.430
 you will be poisoned and these types of poisoning 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.010
 different houses now I would like to you 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.000
 show them to begin with 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.129
 I show here how they look you'll see 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.670
 infection one infection two times three times 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.370
 four basically just let me 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.940
 clean put myself here it is in my hand 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.680
 my invisible hand has become 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.160
 and you need to put anywhere in 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.410
 further on this place is nothing 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.510
 can not be put 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:17.320
 but let's say I want to put blocks now 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:21.360
 Sit here I have an infection 1 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.800
 in the answer i put nothing happens 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.050
 I will now switch to normal mode 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.840
 will not demonstrate against any of these 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.880
 at once help the antidote also have 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:36.490
 various tablets so let's say a game 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:40.390
 whirling but the most effective is 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:43.570
 will come so here is the first infection then I tell me 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.560
 your first infection gives us poisoning and 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.560
 dizziness 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:57.320
 as we see here 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.320
 how did 2 infection 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.460
 2 infection, I do not interfere either 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.979
 let's watch from takstar this contagion 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.560
 gives us also a departure go around and 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.480
 dizziness as you see dizziness 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.320
 live and I didn't understand it at all what 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.720
 need to sell it to them the antidote to the bow 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.680
 same not she gradually starting the longer 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.020
 you have the more poisoning 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.290
 the consequences we also do not speak out 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.390
 later the stronger you start 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:38.720
 feel dizzy i 'm sure it 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.720
 a couple of infection or not let me check 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:48.010
 at times for times two and up to 2 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:52.670
 so here is this infection 3 against we go here 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:55.370
 now basically if you play 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.470
 creative you will also have consequences 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.450
 these but not so strong dizziness 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.880
 will not be absent if you 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:06.860
 enter the block which causes blindness 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:14.840
 then you see it anyway so third 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:19.940
 block is hunger and dizziness what are you 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:22.970
 can you look at these on the icon 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:28.970
 food here in the middle she became like 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:33.920
 as if you ate zombies meat it will 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:39.110
 faster filming so it is 4 infection here 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:42.410
 she is blind you see ahead with you 12 3 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:45.410
 4 blocks ahead of you further you 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.450
 see nothing also it causes was 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.600
 surrounded by nothing more than life 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.459
 could be taken away pretty 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.250
 be considered harmless if it were not 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.769
 fucking dizzy and dark because 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.610
 that in this state to fight off zombies 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:06.739
 It is extremely difficult. I have already tried everything. 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:08.930
 time sdyhal so the fifth kind of infection 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.480
 gives us gives us so that dizziness 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.590
 In principle, then I am infuriated more 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:18.019
 only 4 and because blindness hate 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.600
 blindness plus google whirling there 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.769
 separate block where which causes 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.630
 only blindness 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:29.450
 this block now I spent so 6 block 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:33.180
 causes only poisoning for 13 seconds 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:37.710
 and by the way you listen to the bull's eye 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:41.220
 ok seventh unit poisoning then we have it 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:45.120
 causes only hunger nothing more and 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.720
 here he is 8 block he calls from the last 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:52.020
 notepad calls only if then but 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:55.710
 usually if you say we enter fourth 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:59.370
 block this block causes blindness at 40 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:01.009
 seconds nose + q surroundings same block 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:06.539
 eight 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:11.070
 causes blindness for a minute 20 and pretty 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:13.620
 problematic bye if only blindness without 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.050
 stupid whirling much concerned no if 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.240
 so for you from a bow do not hammer it you 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.960
 do not see who helped shoot here 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:24.840
 this is then problematic but probably 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:28.860
 all today should be long-awaited 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.740
