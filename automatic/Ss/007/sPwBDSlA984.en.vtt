 galvanized by what's back this one rather nice 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:30.249
 at the heart of the matter on November 7 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.649
 seven-islands limit a little cold some people like to see necessarily 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.170
 the three points 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.520
 most are timidly with President dmitry medvedev and me 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.500
 because he's from here 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.270

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.540
 who reacts to the ground 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.230
 educator a little bit everywhere on the fray 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.060
 because of the thickness its function of the recipe 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.270
 wish list 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.990
 many have earned morning at the mans station 2010 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.940
 if a mini usb port 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.100
 to recover photos for example 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.330
 yeah in the kitchen so my little band to light up actually not so much that 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.690
 it 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.680
 you can only wake up by typing in his hands 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.680
 and from there he starts up 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.500
 that's great 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.869
 necessarily the most visible Muslim kiki 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.960
 he tells you 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.960
 in rugby one gets out of the French subsidiary of the group ensures that 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.910
 in a good way to understand the mechanism 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.910
 in short this is the only complaint I make 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.560
 read also vegetable of the bar 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.560
 it's a little embarrassing because of course it's obvious 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.370
 weariness play with him 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.370
 Danze 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.000

 the great lyon 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.010
 Sunday number of Ivorians 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.680
 one on these pictures we share che 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.760
 at the crossroads -1 de michèle fuselier piaf 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.209
 the indicator is pointing upwards 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.209
 here and there can I see you want me to want to do 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:19.379
 but also able to smell the singed and something 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.589
 hashim thaçi extolling a workforce 

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:23.529
 it is indeed fashion 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:27.169
 so I'm happy because the symptoms in the form of filament indicators hand 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:30.359
 left to right for the wireless remembers his room talking about it 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.249
 up to 63 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:35.709
 in general it is better to see the right 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.829
 ok he's happy about come out 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.749
 while here 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:41.829
 that's what you should do 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.029
 He returns 

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:46.029
 this decision 

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:49.990
 what's the point 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.990
 open 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.669
 guillaume garot 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:59.189
 from time to time we must do it this season his hind legs 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:01.729
 while I feel good now it's gone 

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:03.599
 in three seconds 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.709
 that's normally it should make more forget at least three dead 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.489
 Chinese 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.129
 so you're not sure of him 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.609
 but still 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.609
 they must face the cannes 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.319
 then denounced m 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.679
 we played for the children who do not have a solution 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:28.249
 in the fashion world or fewer to have their children 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.319
 christine brouh but not here 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:36.779
 and everyone at the same time to give to his children 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:38.010
 paul kagame the strength 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.979
 at the hour of play 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:42.879
 he has 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:43.839
 tickling 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:45.199
 we would believe on the back 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:46.989
 indeed it appears that men 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.269
 we have fun with their customers 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.719
 sochaux did not do 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:56.719
 perhaps 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:01.219
 during the winter in this case 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:07.949
 daybreakers lose they were ready in time traoré 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.819
 I hope we do not know how far 

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:19.779
 are really not the name who saw it above 

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.249
 it is the highest 

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:26.049
 18 years old this new test more after a while if you do not use it to me 

00:04:26.049 --> 00:04:28.159
 more obvious meaning 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:30.919
 the film hugs 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.919
 the binary system 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.900
 thirty forty long minutes seconds or a minute 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.300
 measures have been taken 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.379
 that is to say, Islamophobia little bit about itself and then it would have to 

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:44.520
 simply preserve the battery 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.639
 there you need something 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.639
 we do not take care of the can 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:55.039
 it reassures me also for him before publishing things that happen in front of 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:57.039
 him 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:04:59.879
 there is one thing that opens up new ways for him 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:03.159
 the nursing home certainly watch this case with drawers 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.699
 be careful not to have done that 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:09.699
 parra is simple 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.490
 3 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.229
 you had to know 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.689

 bestcotes com offers you 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.520
 it is the first human condition 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.439
 the first ones for the 

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:27.800
 fart to fear if seniors 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.800
 if it 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:33.199
 it's not new finally the range
