00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
are universal it's really stupid if

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.030 
are universal it's really stupid if
Nintendo<00:01:59.850> as<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.750> region<00:02:01.200> lock<00:02:01.380> for<00:02:01.619> batteries

for around $30 as well I know my opinion
it's<00:02:26.820> a<00:02:26.940> bit<00:02:27.090> too<00:02:27.270> expensive<00:02:28.550> especially<00:02:29.550> for

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
it's a bit too expensive especially for

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.000 
it's a bit too expensive especially for
one<00:02:30.290> battery<00:02:31.290> pack<00:02:31.500> for<00:02:31.740> one<00:02:32.030> Wii<00:02:33.030> Remote<00:02:34.010> but

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
I did get it anyway just to see what the

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.210 
I did get it anyway just to see what the
official<00:02:36.810> product<00:02:37.320> looks<00:02:37.530> like<00:02:37.620> compared<00:02:38.130> to

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
official product looks like compared to

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.140 
official product looks like compared to
nycos<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:39.150> problem<00:02:39.480> with<00:02:39.600> nycos<00:02:40.020> is<00:02:41.120> with<00:02:42.120> a

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
nycos the problem with nycos is with a

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.120 
nycos the problem with nycos is with a
couple<00:02:42.450> of<00:02:42.510> recharges<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.410> gets<00:02:43.680> less<00:02:44.100> and

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
couple of recharges it gets less and

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.940 
couple of recharges it gets less and
less<00:02:44.370> reliable<00:02:45.290> but<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:46.410> does<00:02:46.530> serve<00:02:46.770> its

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
less reliable but it does serve its

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.620 
less reliable but it does serve its
function<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.460> does<00:02:47.610> give<00:02:47.790> you<00:02:47.970> you<00:02:48.180> could<00:02:48.450> get

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
function and does give you you could get

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.870 
function and does give you you could get
a<00:02:48.660> nice<00:02:49.110> bundle<00:02:49.500> or<00:02:49.950> for<00:02:50.160> work<00:02:50.400> for<00:02:50.670> me

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
a nice bundle or for work for me

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.910 
a nice bundle or for work for me
we-we've<00:02:51.780> remotes<00:02:52.230> or<00:02:52.410> something<00:02:52.740> like<00:02:52.860> that

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
we-we've remotes or something like that

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.490 
we-we've remotes or something like that
so<00:02:53.910> this<00:02:54.480> is<00:02:54.630> what<00:02:54.840> comes<00:02:55.020> in<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.260> box

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
so this is what comes in the box

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.850 
so this is what comes in the box
basically<00:02:56.070> this<00:02:56.850> is<00:02:57.000> where<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.270> lie<00:02:57.450> in<00:02:57.900> this

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
basically this is where you lie in this

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.860 
basically this is where you lie in this
is<00:02:58.980> like<00:02:59.070> the<00:02:59.220> cradle<00:02:59.640> for<00:02:59.910> the<00:02:59.940> Wii<00:03:00.150> Remote

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
is like the cradle for the Wii Remote

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.380 
is like the cradle for the Wii Remote
and<00:03:01.170> here's<00:03:01.950> where<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:02.430> put<00:03:02.460> the<00:03:02.790> charger<00:03:03.240> in

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
and here's where you put the charger in

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.960 
and here's where you put the charger in
which<00:03:03.780> is<00:03:03.960> this<00:03:04.140> this<00:03:04.350> is<00:03:04.560> included<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.310> I

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
which is this this is included and I

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.970 
which is this this is included and I
think<00:03:06.210> it<00:03:06.300> I'm<00:03:06.510> not<00:03:06.720> sure<00:03:06.960> whether<00:03:07.290> or<00:03:07.410> not<00:03:07.590> the

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
think it I'm not sure whether or not the

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.580 
think it I'm not sure whether or not the
it<00:03:08.520> does<00:03:09.120> match<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.390> opening<00:03:10.050> of<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.260> Wii<00:03:10.380> U

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
it does match the opening of the Wii U

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.980 
it does match the opening of the Wii U
charger<00:03:11.130> but<00:03:11.880> if<00:03:12.000> it<00:03:12.150> does<00:03:12.390> that's<00:03:12.720> pretty

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
charger but if it does that's pretty

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.220 
charger but if it does that's pretty
cool<00:03:14.090> this<00:03:15.090> is<00:03:15.180> gonna<00:03:15.270> be<00:03:15.450> 110<00:03:15.840> because<00:03:15.990> it's

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
cool this is gonna be 110 because it's

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.370 
cool this is gonna be 110 because it's
in<00:03:16.350> Japan<00:03:16.650> obviously<00:03:16.830> I<00:03:17.190> think<00:03:17.840> and<00:03:18.840> this<00:03:19.320> is

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
in Japan obviously I think and this is

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.940 
in Japan obviously I think and this is
what<00:03:19.800> you<00:03:19.920> put<00:03:20.130> into<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.870> Wii<00:03:21.870> Remote<00:03:22.530> itself

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
what you put into the Wii Remote itself

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.520 
what you put into the Wii Remote itself
what's<00:03:23.580> cool<00:03:23.820> about<00:03:23.850> this<00:03:24.210> is<00:03:24.270> is<00:03:24.960> the<00:03:25.230> sync

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
what's cool about this is is the sync

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.090 
what's cool about this is is the sync
button<00:03:25.590> is<00:03:25.920> outside<00:03:26.870> what<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:27.900> as<00:03:28.620> you<00:03:28.890> guys

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
button is outside what you as you guys

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.530 
button is outside what you as you guys
know<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:30.270> older<00:03:30.720> we<00:03:31.220> remotes<00:03:32.220> have<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.330> sync

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
know the older we remotes have the sync

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.290 
know the older we remotes have the sync
button<00:03:33.570> inside<00:03:34.230> so<00:03:34.500> you<00:03:34.590> have<00:03:34.770> to<00:03:34.920> remove<00:03:35.300> the

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
button inside so you have to remove the

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.510 
button inside so you have to remove the
battery<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.650> battery<00:03:37.860> cap<00:03:38.220> first

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
battery the the the battery cap first

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.880 
battery the the the battery cap first
and<00:03:38.880> then<00:03:39.060> press<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:39.510> sync<00:03:39.720> button<00:03:39.960> which<00:03:40.740> is

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
and then press the sync button which is

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.470 
and then press the sync button which is
really<00:03:41.190> inconvenient<00:03:41.670> when<00:03:42.240> you<00:03:42.330> have

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
really inconvenient when you have

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.250 
really inconvenient when you have
rechargeable<00:03:43.490> batteries<00:03:44.490> like<00:03:44.640> this<00:03:45.260> the

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
rechargeable batteries like this the

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.770 
rechargeable batteries like this the
micro<00:03:47.190> ones<00:03:47.430> that's<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:48.030> fundamental<00:03:48.600> flaw

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
micro ones that's the fundamental flaw

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.430 
micro ones that's the fundamental flaw
with<00:03:49.020> the<00:03:49.080> nycos<00:03:49.610> battery<00:03:50.610> packs<00:03:50.940> is<00:03:51.320> once<00:03:52.320> you

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
with the nycos battery packs is once you

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.490 
with the nycos battery packs is once you
remove<00:03:52.800> this<00:03:53.430> cap<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:54.150> Wii<00:03:54.690> Remote<00:03:55.050> will<00:03:55.290> turn

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
remove this cap the Wii Remote will turn

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.550 
remove this cap the Wii Remote will turn
off<00:03:55.709> because<00:03:56.430> you<00:03:56.850> can't<00:03:56.880> sync<00:03:57.510> and<00:03:57.780> that's

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
off because you can't sync and that's
