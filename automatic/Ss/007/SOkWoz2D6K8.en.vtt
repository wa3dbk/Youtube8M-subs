 to get off the plane b is at 14:20 the

 coefficient 102 74 sure this descendant 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.079
 rising has strengthened south east ago 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.370
 two to three good sizes the water 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.379
 and crumpled the phases of lasgraines 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.690
 we always have this beautiful or the 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.460
 13 second long periods oriented 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.780
 west has just west northwest a 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.329
 shadow that's own that were stationing 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.520
 retail breaking on the series to a 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.680
 meter fifty from Tanzania a little 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.690
 freaky 7 who hang out not far from a 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.550
 small meter 80 but most of the time 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.229
 it's to put 50 and between the sets he 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.670
 is a meter to put in front of 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.049
 big lull between the series 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.840
 still it does not roll very well 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.760
 oriented that comes from the front that shifts where 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.549
 it makes a right a crazy it's a 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.320
 left an inch to barrel 1 then it goes 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.909
 where does it go well it's random 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.430
 it's not regular but in the pile he 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.689
 are bombs or catch there a little 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.549
 of world to water levac are not 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.900
 particularly selective phases of 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.630
 max in contention with the descendant that 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.500
 becomes a heavier hair is good ago 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.900
 still two points 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.370
 it is nevertheless the see a small fruit 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.570
 who this evolution for the rest of the 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.340
 day see her what kind is at the 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.310
 down to 2 meters 17 seconds we wait 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.810
 at 1:25 pm when some series beyond or 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.520
 the remaining west ham would stay second 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.310
 period by the south is 3 bouffort and at 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.869
 17h to 23h 50 or west to north west 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.880
 west who lose the period 12 seconds 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.650
 of period the south wind is 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.490
 strengthen in the 3 to 4 beaufort to see 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.360
 what is it going to give 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:59.930
 I keep you informed on 08 92 29 78 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.930
 73 to 14h and 16h the good day thank you
