00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.850
 Talk, people are first of all happy 2014. 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.550
 there we start with a doubt that 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.140
 a lot of people have men and women 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.360
 squatting is below 90 degrees is 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.630
 detrimental was no longer the metro fia 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.180
 Finally, let's solve this. 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.369
 scientifically if anyone asks 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.860
 you not only will you know how it goes 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.450
 know how to explain what is most important is 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.200
 find someone who can be done by 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.450
 the floor 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.420
 as long as the musculature is strong or 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.640
 enough is a beginner is 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.280
 temporarily prohibited from doing so 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.670
 this until it strengthens the musculature 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.370
 there he may find it is beyond 90 degrees 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.220
 why reading this because stability 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.650
 in the joint will realize the 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.690
 ligaments through all structures 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.210
 articular but mainly by the 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.860
 muscular part by their muscular strength 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.839
 musicians they are strong 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.790
 enough they will stabilize the 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.200
 inflation then have no overhead 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.720
 have no overload in the 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.759
 ligament which makes squatting valid 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.219
 It's all you need so you 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.619
 strength ligaments capsule capsular slogan - 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:19.899
 this capsule, the lateral meniscus 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.149
 medial meniscus of the meniscus a 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:25.810
 that goes between the femur and the tibia and the femur 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:29.049
 the thigh bone to the tibia and the bone fibula of the 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.090
 cinnamon nef as is popularly 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.100
 it is between these two then 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.689
 You'll find Shenhua shenhua 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.009
 china arrives one hour that the doctor does not 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:38.319
 There's nowhere to run. 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.240
 it gets too much compression and 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:42.909
 this may cause damage to the structure 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.189
 but if you have a strong musculature 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.569
 this compression will be overcompensated 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.069
 and no problem 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.499
 in addition you have the compression 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:52.959
 patellofemoral to patella for those who 

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:53.709
 The priest knows if the priest 

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:56.109
 patella 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:58.590
 or for these pulls the patella to 

00:01:56.109 --> 00:02:01.700
 Up in intelligence but when I go 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.469
 flexing the opinion by pulling 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.890
 her up and this will generate a 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:08.090
 compression of the patella in the femur and 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.160
 people have a problem then if the person 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.500
 have with a patellar splinter 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.150
 the problem in the knee joint this 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.239
 also becomes a problem and 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.519
 squatting is above 90 degrees 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.830
 even with the strong musculature 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.739
 being contraindicated then summarizing the 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.630
 opera people beginners or with 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.069
 knee joint problems 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.630
 depending on this problem of course 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.730
 needs a diagnosis 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.870
 we make a prognosis is not 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.410
 recommended 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.750
 you crouch too deep is one 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.459
 person who has strong muscles that 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.769
 already trained the time has no type 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.290
 problem in the knee can 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.319
 to feel deeply without any kind of 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.910
 fear problem the risk will be better 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.489
 more a little doubt that happens 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:55.190
 quite slow I can put a chock 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:58.819
 just below the calcaneus of the heel 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.920
 to be able to squat without taking off the heel 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.140
 from the ground will you go and see if 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.930
 you put a shimple just below the 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.660
 calcaneus this will move the center of 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.420
 gravity then when you 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:15.709
 squat with this chaos how to make a 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:18.440
 flexing is planting you tend to 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.280
 make a lumbar curvature a hyper 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.069
 dose 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.319
 so it's not very useful if you are 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.959
 with the symbol of bodybuilding is this gives 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.880
 a little help but no matter the center 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.650
 of gravity has been changed look, vai vai vai 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.480
 have to make a hell of a dose 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.250
 It's like the woman who wears a jump. 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.440
 high can notice that the woman who wears 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.660
 high heels she has a tendency to do 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.579
 by the dose that her center of gravity 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.220
 was displaced so the ideal is not to use 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.510
 this jump by reading any solution to 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.480
 it's very simple 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.340
 this is lack of flexibility 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.440
 flexibility you train trained in 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.430
 flexibility you can feel 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.739
 ground field 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.590
 that is enough for you there every day after 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:00.109
 of your workout pulls the tip of your foot back 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.489
 feel the local calf stretch to the 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.480
 Achilles tendon 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.659
 What are you doing there? 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.459
 and serious 60 seconds every day in the 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:09.500
 end of training at the beginning of training 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.909
 I prefer in the end it 's more of a question 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.500
 merely preferably 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:14.420
 You're a man to stretch a lot. 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.190
 Achilles tendon and can find 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.030
 deeply without any kind of leap 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.350
 this would be the smartest solution 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.270
 so students studying species have 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.130
 understood if you like the video by clicking 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.770
 in the times he writes in the channel he writes 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.960
 on the facebook page you want to help with 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.210
 a T-shirt on the line of yours on the dot 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.590
 with br br point the channel of motivation 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.979
 Neither do you need a gas to train 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.430
 beauty gaia brigadÃ£o valeu 2014 being
