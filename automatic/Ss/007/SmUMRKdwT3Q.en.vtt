00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
I'm sure as the battles get bigger it's

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.290 
I'm sure as the battles get bigger it's
really<00:01:45.740> gonna<00:01:46.010> change<00:01:46.280> around<00:01:46.700> I'm<00:01:46.850> sure<00:01:46.880> iron

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
really gonna change around I'm sure iron

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.730 
really gonna change around I'm sure iron
golems<00:01:47.630> as<00:01:47.720> a<00:01:47.750> team<00:01:48.080> are<00:01:48.170> gonna<00:01:48.290> do<00:01:48.440> a<00:01:48.470> little

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
golems as a team are gonna do a little

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.140 
golems as a team are gonna do a little
bit<00:01:48.890> better<00:01:49.100> than<00:01:49.490> they<00:01:49.640> did<00:01:49.700> in<00:01:49.940> that<00:01:50.090> first

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
bit better than they did in that first

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.400 
bit better than they did in that first
round<00:01:50.540> it<00:01:50.750> was<00:01:50.810> horrendous

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
round it was horrendous

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.100 
round it was horrendous
I<00:01:51.440> here<00:01:52.130> we<00:01:52.190> get<00:01:52.310> two<00:01:52.730> of<00:01:52.760> them<00:01:53.090> into<00:01:54.020> the

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
I here we get two of them into the

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.610 
I here we get two of them into the
battle

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
battle

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.530 
battle
that's<00:01:55.070> so<00:01:55.250> cool<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.580> way<00:01:55.670> it<00:01:55.760> works<00:01:55.940> and

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
that's so cool the way it works and

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.240 
that's so cool the way it works and
probably<00:01:57.050> the<00:01:57.170> best<00:01:57.290> way<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:57.560> spawn<00:01:57.920> them<00:01:58.070> in

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
probably the best way to spawn them in

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.300 
probably the best way to spawn them in
just<00:01:58.610> because<00:01:59.060> you<00:01:59.480> know<00:01:59.630> I<00:01:59.980> cannot<00:02:00.980> spoil

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
just because you know I cannot spoil

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.130 
just because you know I cannot spoil
them<00:02:01.430> in<00:02:01.520> that<00:02:01.610> quick<00:02:01.910> with<00:02:02.300> my<00:02:02.480> hands<00:02:02.870> I'll

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.720 
them in that quick with my hands I'll
get<00:02:03.320> carpal<00:02:03.650> tunnel<00:02:03.920> you<00:02:04.190> guys<00:02:04.400> don't<00:02:04.610> want

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
get carpal tunnel you guys don't want

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.910 
get carpal tunnel you guys don't want
that<00:02:04.910> I<00:02:05.150> wouldn't<00:02:05.720> be<00:02:05.810> able<00:02:05.870> to<00:02:05.960> record<00:02:06.230> my
