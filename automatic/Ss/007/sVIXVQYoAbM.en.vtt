00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:06.529
 This time, the story floor 4 of the slow live video of the Lightning stage which has been up to now 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:12.360
 Is the floor 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:18.260
 I recommend that you hear on the radio sense because the new story capture is not at all 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.260
 I 'm going to stream videos to the back for a while but not dogs 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.190
 I forgot to say that the back video is not main 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.890
 First of all, I'm going to return from the comment return everyone sent by this time of video editing 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.200
 Intended for comments 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:47.640
 In addition, I am sorry that there is a comment that is partially omitted due to the relation of 100. 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.829
 So let's get it done- what caused you to make a mistake 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:56.409
 Yeah I was completely off guard about this 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:59.260
 I can not say anything but I accidentally entered the drift key where I was convinced to win 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:04.000
 It is said that I 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.989
 Since this train story of d second episode is around 2000 Namba line, let alone open construction Surashi 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.390
 It is not 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.850
 There N Tokoro properly when there is an entirely by the following similar scene was a blunder 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.680
 Wearing District 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:20.210
 I saw it for the first time on the left cut-in 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:25.360
 I'm driving to aim for all the cut-in events on the story 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:29.600
 I would appreciate your comment if there is something missing 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.580
 I was derailed hitting Keihan 800 with the left guy 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:37.940
 This is news item of 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:40.700
 Please be aware that by train the b series should certainly be about 4 works, but the following story etc. 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:44.420
 Do you give a live show if you buy the next stage 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:49.370
 Of course, I'm going to go Lightning stage 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.570
 Burning stage climax stage Rising stage has already been purchased 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:56.659
 As soon as you can edit the video 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:02:02.100
 But the same is also out of course further new work I feel like you say 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:03.659
 It says that it does not make sense to drift in a straight line after the left , but this 7001 drifts 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.009
 Because 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.629
 Of on the other party was also found to see the videos that do not hear so come to the same thing 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.840
 It was Tsukkomi 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:15.769
 It is completely lacking in expression of the Lord 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:21.010
 I am sorry that a misunderstanding has been born 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:25.870
 It is difficult to understand the progress of the story covered by the explanation and the conversation part 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:32.439
 I don't know what I'm saying at the end, but it was very thankful 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:37.569
 Editing after this time is aiming for the introductory part not to go through the story 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:42.590
 If there are any issues related to the video format, I would like to ask 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:44.250
 Because Takumi has a murder permit, it is not okay to pursue responsibility 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:50.760
 You see the name 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:54.570
 I because it is training to participate in certainly good child-like was not its idea 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:59.730
 It should not amusing even if you have 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:04.270
 Certified c trust from 1955 between 1964 was present 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:08.950
 I examined it I was certainly present in roughly speaking com 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:14.350
 C At that time c Shindai would like to point to a non-cooling bed quality 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:16.300
 Of than the current b bed in the only new Daiwa non-cooling, it called the first class c bed in Naka 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:22.540
 It was a superior facility 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:24.260
 Cooling division that more c bed in the remodeling of the support I was completely disappeared after that b 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:29.330
 Sideways at a location inferior to the bed 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:34.430
 It became popular among railway fans in the sense that it would become 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:39.710
 It is Kintetsu Shinkansen from today Kaneda Aban's speed ah 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.650
 The urban area of Nakazato is 200km per hour with one lap of the meter, and the urban area of Nakasato is less than just before Umeda Station in the dead end 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:45.470
 Abbreviation 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:51.190
 The plane was supposed to be taking off at a speed of several hundred kilometers per hour. 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:55.060
 If there is something like a girl in Urban, it can go away 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:58.690

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.660

 I will end the comment return above 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:19.959
 There are various improvements to the video from now on, including the return of rice 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.889
 Since they will improve continuously, please comment if there is anything in the future 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.870
