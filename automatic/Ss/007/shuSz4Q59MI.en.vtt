and<00:01:59.790> I<00:02:00.000> can<00:02:00.299> make<00:02:00.450> oh<00:02:00.600> yeah<00:02:00.960> oh<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.890> was

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
and I can make oh yeah oh that was

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.889 
and I can make oh yeah oh that was
actually<00:02:02.340> an<00:02:02.430> initial<00:02:02.880> requirement<00:02:03.750> we<00:02:03.840> were

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
actually an initial requirement we were

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.780 
actually an initial requirement we were
wondering<00:02:04.259> how<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.409> get<00:02:04.710> my<00:02:04.920> eyes<00:02:05.130> stretched

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
wondering how to get my eyes stretched

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.229 
wondering how to get my eyes stretched
out<00:02:06.119> but<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:07.789> don't<00:02:08.789> think<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.030> would<00:02:09.149> have

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
out but I don't think I would have

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.940 
out but I don't think I would have
survived<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.869> because<00:02:10.140> for<00:02:10.319> eight<00:02:10.500> hours<00:02:10.530> or

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
survived that because for eight hours or

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.100 
survived that because for eight hours or
12<00:02:11.129> hours<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.430> day<00:02:11.520> when<00:02:11.790> you're

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
12 hours a day when you're

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.110 
12 hours a day when you're
thing<00:02:12.290> to<00:02:12.410> have<00:02:12.530> tapes<00:02:12.800> to<00:02:13.460> stretch<00:02:13.730> your<00:02:13.910> eyes

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
thing to have tapes to stretch your eyes

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.550 
thing to have tapes to stretch your eyes
out<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.630> tape<00:02:14.810> actually<00:02:15.020> goes<00:02:15.350> behind

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
out and the tape actually goes behind

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.110 
out and the tape actually goes behind
your<00:02:15.920> head<00:02:16.100> so<00:02:16.280> it's<00:02:16.400> actually<00:02:16.520> stretching

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
your head so it's actually stretching

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.890 
your head so it's actually stretching
your<00:02:17.240> eyes<00:02:17.450> out<00:02:17.690> completely<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.580> I<00:02:19.900> wasn't
