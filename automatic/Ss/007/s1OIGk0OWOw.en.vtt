block and basically we only today it's a

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.709 
block and basically we only today it's a
way<00:00:59.929> to<00:00:59.989> make<00:01:00.199> that<00:01:00.350> into<00:01:00.589> an<00:01:00.679> ingot<00:01:01.069> and<00:01:01.719> how

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
way to make that into an ingot and how

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.660 
way to make that into an ingot and how
you<00:01:02.780> do<00:01:02.929> that<00:01:03.139> these<00:01:03.889> are<00:01:04.010> ingots<00:01:04.309> by<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:04.550> way

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
you do that these are ingots by the way

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.730 
you do that these are ingots by the way
and<00:01:05.000> how<00:01:05.150> you<00:01:05.210> do<00:01:05.330> that<00:01:05.510> place<00:01:06.500> it<00:01:06.620> in<00:01:06.680> a

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
and how you do that place it in a

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.360 
and how you do that place it in a
furnace<00:01:07.040> obviously<00:01:07.490> and<00:01:07.850> let's<00:01:08.030> not<00:01:09.370> now

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:10.370 
furnace obviously and let's not now

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.840 
furnace obviously and let's not now
basically<00:01:11.330> the<00:01:11.740> the<00:01:12.740> idea<00:01:12.950> of<00:01:13.040> this<00:01:13.130> mod<00:01:13.400> is<00:01:13.430> to

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
basically the the idea of this mod is to

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.670 
basically the the idea of this mod is to
add<00:01:13.940> another<00:01:14.060> resource<00:01:14.900> so<00:01:15.260> you<00:01:15.320> can<00:01:15.560> make

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
add another resource so you can make

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.280 
add another resource so you can make
armor<00:01:16.130> out<00:01:16.490> of<00:01:16.520> it<00:01:16.730> and<00:01:16.880> let's<00:01:17.480> ring<00:01:17.660> it<00:01:17.690> you

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
armor out of it and let's ring it you

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.780 
armor out of it and let's ring it you
can<00:01:18.440> make<00:01:18.530> armor<00:01:18.740> outlet<00:01:19.450> so<00:01:20.450> basically<00:01:21.790> you

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
can make armor outlet so basically you

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.430 
can make armor outlet so basically you
can<00:01:22.940> make<00:01:23.090> just<00:01:23.540> just<00:01:23.870> the<00:01:23.930> same<00:01:24.170> as<00:01:24.290> you<00:01:24.380> would

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
can make just just the same as you would

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.460 
can make just just the same as you would
of<00:01:24.560> diamond<00:01:24.980> door<00:01:25.160> iron<00:01:26.020> so<00:01:27.020> there's<00:01:27.410> your

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
of diamond door iron so there's your

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.310 
of diamond door iron so there's your
chest<00:01:27.770> plate<00:01:28.010> as<00:01:28.840> you<00:01:29.840> can<00:01:29.990> see<00:01:30.140> in<00:01:30.230> the

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
chest plate as you can see in the

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.740 
chest plate as you can see in the
toomanyitems<00:01:30.590> mod<00:01:31.000> these<00:01:32.000> are<00:01:32.150> all<00:01:32.300> the<00:01:32.420> items

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
toomanyitems mod these are all the items

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.060 
toomanyitems mod these are all the items
you<00:01:32.840> can<00:01:33.050> make<00:01:33.280> them<00:01:34.280> so<00:01:34.940> for<00:01:35.360> example<00:01:35.390> I<00:01:36.140> get

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
you can make them so for example I get

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.780 
you can make them so for example I get
stick<00:01:37.570> forget<00:01:38.570> some<00:01:38.720> sticks<00:01:39.490> where<00:01:40.490> are<00:01:40.640> they

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
stick forget some sticks where are they

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.710 
stick forget some sticks where are they
spits<00:01:41.210> there<00:01:42.110> and<00:01:43.690> you<00:01:44.690> can<00:01:44.810> make<00:01:44.960> a<00:01:44.990> sword<00:01:45.350> and

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
spits there and you can make a sword and

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.290 
spits there and you can make a sword and
there<00:01:47.720> you<00:01:47.840> are<00:01:47.870> now<00:01:48.230> because<00:01:48.740> these<00:01:49.300> meteors

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
there you are now because these meteors

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.340 
there you are now because these meteors
so<00:01:50.690> wrap<00:01:50.960> it<00:01:51.830> is<00:01:52.040> stronger<00:01:52.520> than<00:01:52.640> diamond<00:01:53.350> ok

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
so wrap it is stronger than diamond ok

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.490 
so wrap it is stronger than diamond ok
so<00:01:54.410> what<00:01:54.710> I'll<00:01:54.830> do<00:01:55.010> is<00:01:55.040> I'll<00:01:55.360> I'll<00:01:56.380> give<00:01:57.380> you<00:01:57.470> a
