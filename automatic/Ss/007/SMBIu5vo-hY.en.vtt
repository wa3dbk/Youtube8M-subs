00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:08.360
 Hello media festival two cool Ogura everyone of students 

00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:12.320
 I was really tired sama 2 days 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:17.750
 This time, I will do the general account of the satellite 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:26.050
 Every year is 27 points from 26 points even though First is the average of expected 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:27.860
 However, this time the required 7 points in general is a total of 22 points of 15 units . 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.390
 74.8% 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:37.350
 Theory is 49.5% practice is 60.5% 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:40.500
 Compulsory theory decreased by 10% compared to 98 times and 99 times 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:45.540
 The actual battle has fallen 6% 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:48.110
 As a result, it is not so serious and it is a severe examination for the examinees. 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.110
 I'm out 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:56.570
 Next is the feature of each problem 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:01:01.430
 Kedomo first essential is were many issues that question the basic things 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:07.369
 I tended to ask whether I understood the past questions correctly a 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:09.000
 Therefore , in order to accurately understand each and every award more than a year , this is a test that was tried 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:13.320
 We now have 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.740
 The body is Juban to say let's take a look at the distinctive problems 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:21.210
 Which compounds are known as potent oncogenic promoters 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:26.070
 But answer the number 5 will be the correct answer from the also first No. 1 No. 4 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:29.020
 This is a germinated insulator a Considering the knowledge of the past questions 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.369
 Epoxide 2 No. 3 No. 1 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.060
 Initiator action by binding this to the dna 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:40.939
 Cause this 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:41.540
 And in the fourth question, there is a statement that in the past questions there is a manual carcinogenicity on a rampage day . 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.340
 Also 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.030
 Such that is therefore an alkylating agent dna knee Shie Deployment cause by 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:53.270
 From it 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:54.350
 The remaining number 5 will be the correct answer, but many people have chosen numbers 1 and 4 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.080
 Results and become 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.670
 a this 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:06.890
 It became a question asking whether I understood this coverage correctly, but 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:12.950
 The correct answer rate of the forecast is a very low problem of 5.9% . 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:14.240
 Next, general problems here are not an understanding of the past questions, but also fa and the theme 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.080
 It means 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:22.670
 Of course accident rice and a drug for abuse etc. current topics 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:26.910
 So-called current affairs or practical problems 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:31.740
 Of course after the intake of the school pharmacist water of the body liner 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:37.230
 Although there were questions for everyone, there is a tendency for a wide range of such problems 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:43.020
 In that, I think of the best theme in it s 8 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:45.960
 For example, the birth rate, mortality rate, etc. are not simply remembered, but necessary for the funds. 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:49.770
 Or take the neck of the things that material from the graph 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.680
 Is this right from the graph ? 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:59.810
 There was a tendency to ask 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:03:01.489
 And now two pillars such as changes in birthrate disease, illness and illness should be considered after grasping this too 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:06.530
 Whether you can 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:10.960
 This will need to be of having that interested in many things, because such 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:14.950
 It is desirable to improve your thinking ability on a daily basis 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:20.890
 I think this trend will always continue in the future 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:26.090
 Until its contents not only remember your memorial service to be able to firmly explain that of one by one 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:32.150
 Deep understanding I think if you want to be aware of your study 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:39.390
 One characteristic problem is a complex problem but it is a natural and mouth-related problem 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:40.730
 I feel that the text of this question is a bit longer than usual 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:46.250
 Do not 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:48.319
 Accurately read how to read keywords quickly in that limited time 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.480
 This is desired 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:56.909
 For example, go you and numbness in this issue 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:04:00.510
 You will be this is = want to appeal even the most though is the neurological symptoms 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:07.049
 So it is the new continuation and this is the 5th correct answer but 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:11.500
 Since there and the last to the ventricle of the irregular pulse in the text cause not a cowardly here's No. 3 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:15.760
 It is very many people who chose this digitalis 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:22.150
 Please be aware of that Japanese one by one firmly 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:27.750
 a country explanation that it is possible to cope with what you want to be able to do, even if the viewpoint changes 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.750
 You will need to refer to the training on a regular basis to 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.349
 The above is the satellite rating
