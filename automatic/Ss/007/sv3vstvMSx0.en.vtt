00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:19.519 
what it's not that tough to make the

ingredients<00:00:19.640> list<00:00:20.150> is<00:00:20.240> kind<00:00:20.480> of<00:00:20.539> long<00:00:20.720> because

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
ingredients list is kind of long because

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.560 
ingredients list is kind of long because

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
I've kind of spiced it up so instead of

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.230

finding out that barbecue sauce is easy

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.279 
finding out that barbecue sauce is easy
to<00:00:37.699> make<00:00:37.850> it's<00:00:38.149> a<00:00:38.360> heck<00:00:38.539> of<00:00:38.570> a<00:00:38.719> lot<00:00:38.809> better<00:00:39.050> than

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:39.289 
to make it's a heck of a lot better than

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:41.110 
to make it's a heck of a lot better than
the<00:00:39.440> bottle<00:00:39.739> stuff<00:00:40.010> and<00:00:40.489> it's<00:00:40.850> actually

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
the bottle stuff and it's actually

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.150 
the bottle stuff and it's actually
cheaper<00:00:41.300> just<00:00:41.930> a<00:00:42.020> little<00:00:42.199> more<00:00:42.530> time<00:00:42.739> involved

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
cheaper just a little more time involved

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.150 
cheaper just a little more time involved
but<00:00:43.579> again<00:00:43.820> that's<00:00:44.510> not<00:00:44.660> too<00:00:44.840> bad<00:00:45.020> to<00:00:45.440> do<00:00:45.559> so

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
but again that's not too bad to do so

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.630 
but again that's not too bad to do so
here's<00:00:46.550> how<00:00:46.670> to<00:00:46.730> make<00:00:46.879> barbecue<00:00:47.149> sauce<00:00:48.640> all

through some of the recipes I've seen

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.259 
through some of the recipes I've seen
call<00:00:57.530> for<00:00:57.949> just<00:00:58.219> mixing<00:00:58.550> everything<00:00:58.670> up<00:00:59.059> then

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
call for just mixing everything up then

00:00:59.269 --> 00:00:59.889 
call for just mixing everything up then
you're<00:00:59.449> good<00:00:59.629> to<00:00:59.750> go

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
you're good to go

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.770 
you're good to go
but<00:01:00.829> I<00:01:01.160> did<00:01:01.370> like<00:01:01.609> the<00:01:01.789> flavor<00:01:02.059> that<00:01:02.210> comes<00:01:02.510> out

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
but I did like the flavor that comes out

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.750 
but I did like the flavor that comes out
it<00:01:03.019> blends<00:01:03.230> I<00:01:03.410> think<00:01:03.649> better<00:01:03.859> if<00:01:04.070> you<00:01:04.220> heat<00:01:04.640> it

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
it blends I think better if you heat it

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.930 
it blends I think better if you heat it
up<00:01:04.820> so<00:01:05.570> we<00:01:05.900> start<00:01:06.320> with<00:01:06.610> we're<00:01:07.610> gonna<00:01:07.700> start

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100

one<00:02:30.160> of<00:02:30.220> those<00:02:30.340> tricky<00:02:30.700> things<00:02:30.940> you<00:02:31.060> don't

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
one of those tricky things you don't

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.089 
one of those tricky things you don't
pick<00:02:31.660> up<00:02:31.810> all<00:02:32.079> that<00:02:32.230> much<00:02:32.440> don't<00:02:32.680> have<00:02:32.860> laying

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
but again the molasses not only provides

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.660 
but again the molasses not only provides
some<00:02:36.519> sweetness<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:38.099> some<00:02:39.099> fullness<00:02:39.459> the

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
some sweetness and some fullness the

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.740 
some sweetness and some fullness the
flavor<00:02:40.030> but<00:02:41.019> it<00:02:41.379> it<00:02:41.950> also<00:02:42.129> thickens<00:02:42.849> it<00:02:43.180> quite

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
flavor but it it also thickens it quite

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:51.289 
flavor but it it also thickens it quite
a<00:02:43.780> bit<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:45.810> we're<00:02:46.810> gonna<00:02:46.930> add<00:02:47.140> that<00:02:47.379> in<00:02:47.650> there

it's a great little pepper and I'm gonna
throw<00:05:14.590> this<00:05:14.680> back<00:05:14.890> in<00:05:15.070> the<00:05:15.160> freezer<00:05:15.720> we'll

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
throw this back in the freezer we'll

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.290 
throw this back in the freezer we'll
have<00:05:16.870> some<00:05:16.990> outdoors

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.420 

so<00:05:22.900> we've<00:05:23.200> got<00:05:23.350> got<00:05:23.530> everything<00:05:23.890> in<00:05:24.070> our<00:05:24.160> plan

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.120 
so we've got got everything in our plan
and<00:05:25.050> I've<00:05:26.050> got<00:05:26.260> it<00:05:26.380> on<00:05:26.440> low<00:05:26.650> heat<00:05:26.680> right<00:05:27.100> here

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
and I've got it on low heat right here

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:40.500 
and I've got it on low heat right here
and<00:05:27.810> I'm<00:05:28.810> just<00:05:29.020> gonna<00:05:29.170> stir<00:05:29.530> mix<00:05:29.830> it<00:05:39.240> so<00:05:40.240> just

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
and I'm just gonna stir mix it so just

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.730 
and I'm just gonna stir mix it so just
to<00:05:40.600> kind<00:05:40.810> of<00:05:40.870> blend<00:05:41.020> it<00:05:41.170> a<00:05:41.230> little<00:05:41.260> bit<00:05:41.560> I'm

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
to kind of blend it a little bit I'm

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.590 
to kind of blend it a little bit I'm
gonna<00:05:41.920> let<00:05:42.070> it<00:05:42.100> sit<00:05:42.400> and<00:05:42.430> heat<00:05:42.760> up<00:05:42.970> just<00:05:43.210> make

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 
gonna let it sit and heat up just make

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.650 
gonna let it sit and heat up just make
sure<00:05:43.840> it<00:05:44.050> doesn't<00:05:44.290> boil<00:05:45.220> if<00:05:45.670> it<00:05:45.880> boils<00:05:46.060> you'll

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
sure it doesn't boil if it boils you'll

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.370 
sure it doesn't boil if it boils you'll
start<00:05:46.930> caramelizing<00:05:47.560> everything<00:05:48.370> and<00:05:49.380> it

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
start caramelizing everything and it

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.740 
start caramelizing everything and it
won't<00:05:50.590> be<00:05:50.920> the<00:05:50.950> worst<00:05:51.250> of<00:05:51.490> it<00:05:51.760> won't<00:05:52.360> ruin<00:05:52.570> it

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
won't be the worst of it won't ruin it

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.200 
won't be the worst of it won't ruin it
but<00:05:52.900> it<00:05:53.080> has<00:05:53.290> potential<00:05:53.680> to<00:05:53.860> so<00:05:54.730> if<00:05:54.880> it<00:05:54.970> boils

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
but it has potential to so if it boils

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.260 
but it has potential to so if it boils
too<00:05:55.360> long<00:05:55.540> yes<00:05:55.780> that<00:05:56.080> definitely<00:05:56.260> will<00:05:56.620> but

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
too long yes that definitely will but

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.670 
too long yes that definitely will but
just<00:05:58.270> the<00:05:58.360> low<00:05:58.510> heat<00:05:58.750> and<00:05:59.020> keep<00:05:59.200> it<00:05:59.350> on<00:05:59.440> there

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
just the low heat and keep it on there

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.310 
just the low heat and keep it on there
for<00:06:00.510> whatever<00:06:01.510> you<00:06:01.720> feel<00:06:01.870> comfortable<00:06:02.110> with

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
for whatever you feel comfortable with

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.450 
for whatever you feel comfortable with
in<00:06:02.620> 15-20<00:06:03.310> minutes<00:06:03.610> an<00:06:03.760> hour<00:06:04.230> I<00:06:05.230> don't<00:06:06.220> keep<00:06:06.340> it

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
in 15-20 minutes an hour I don't keep it

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.920 
in 15-20 minutes an hour I don't keep it
too<00:06:06.580> long<00:06:06.610> on<00:06:06.850> electric<00:06:07.270> stove<00:06:07.510> because<00:06:07.690> this

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
too long on electric stove because this

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.480 
too long on electric stove because this
heats<00:06:08.140> up<00:06:08.320> too<00:06:08.470> quickly<00:06:08.710> so<00:06:08.920> I'm<00:06:09.310> just<00:06:09.400> gonna

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
heats up too quickly so I'm just gonna

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.130 
heats up too quickly so I'm just gonna
get<00:06:09.790> this<00:06:09.970> warm<00:06:10.210> enough<00:06:10.390> to<00:06:10.480> heat<00:06:10.660> through<00:06:10.930> and

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.140 
get this warm enough to heat through and

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.740 
get this warm enough to heat through and
blend<00:06:11.590> everything<00:06:11.680> together<00:06:12.040> and<00:06:12.490> then<00:06:13.300> we're

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
blend everything together and then we're

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.390 
blend everything together and then we're
gonna<00:06:13.840> pack<00:06:14.080> it<00:06:14.110> it<00:06:14.260> up

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.860 

okay<00:06:18.400> now<00:06:18.580> sure<00:06:19.030> how<00:06:19.240> well<00:06:19.420> it's<00:06:19.540> showing<00:06:19.720> up

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
okay now sure how well it's showing up

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.200 
okay now sure how well it's showing up
on<00:06:20.080> the<00:06:20.230> video<00:06:20.500> but<00:06:20.770> there's<00:06:20.980> just<00:06:21.370> a<00:06:21.670> wisp<00:06:21.970> of

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:22.210 
on the video but there's just a wisp of

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:25.680 
on the video but there's just a wisp of
steam<00:06:22.990> and<00:06:23.350> everything<00:06:24.280> coming<00:06:24.490> up<00:06:24.730> off<00:06:25.030> the

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
steam and everything coming up off the

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.750 
steam and everything coming up off the
sauce<00:06:25.930> which<00:06:26.740> means<00:06:27.010> it's<00:06:27.220> about<00:06:27.310> ready<00:06:27.670> to

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.760 
sauce which means it's about ready to

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:29.790 
sauce which means it's about ready to
boil<00:06:27.970> which<00:06:28.270> means<00:06:28.600> I<00:06:28.960> wanted<00:06:29.500> to<00:06:29.560> go<00:06:29.650> any

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 
boil which means I wanted to go any

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.760 
boil which means I wanted to go any
further<00:06:29.950> so<00:06:30.250> I'm<00:06:30.310> shutting<00:06:30.610> it<00:06:30.700> down<00:06:31.770> it

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:32.770 
further so I'm shutting it down it

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:34.830 
further so I'm shutting it down it
doesn't<00:06:33.130> get<00:06:33.310> that<00:06:33.490> thick<00:06:33.790> it's<00:06:34.330> not<00:06:34.570> a

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 
doesn't get that thick it's not a

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.080 
doesn't get that thick it's not a
commercial<00:06:35.140> sauce<00:06:35.590> that<00:06:36.070> uses<00:06:36.460> thickener<00:06:36.850> so

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 
commercial sauce that uses thickener so

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:38.460 
commercial sauce that uses thickener so
it's<00:06:37.210> gonna<00:06:37.300> be<00:06:37.480> watery<00:06:37.840> like<00:06:38.080> this<00:06:38.260> well

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:38.470 
it's gonna be watery like this well

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:39.840 
it's gonna be watery like this well
thinking<00:06:38.710> a<00:06:38.800> bit<00:06:38.980> more<00:06:39.160> as<00:06:39.280> it<00:06:39.400> stands<00:06:39.760> and

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:39.850 
thinking a bit more as it stands and

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:40.620 
thinking a bit more as it stands and
cools<00:06:40.030> down

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:40.630 
cools down

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:43.890 
cools down
but<00:06:41.380> this<00:06:41.740> is<00:06:41.890> about<00:06:42.160> debt<00:06:42.490> for<00:06:43.360> this<00:06:43.600> type<00:06:43.870> of

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:43.900 
but this is about debt for this type of

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.920 
but this is about debt for this type of
sauce<00:06:44.940> there's<00:06:45.940> other<00:06:46.210> things<00:06:46.300> you<00:06:46.630> can<00:06:46.780> do<00:06:46.840> to

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:46.930 
sauce there's other things you can do to

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:49.080 
sauce there's other things you can do to
thicken<00:06:47.230> it<00:06:47.320> up<00:06:47.440> I<00:06:47.830> can<00:06:48.430> actually<00:06:48.520> use<00:06:48.820> butter

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.090 
thicken it up I can actually use butter

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:50.940 
thicken it up I can actually use butter
as<00:06:49.420> a<00:06:49.480> thickener<00:06:49.930> I'm<00:06:50.440> gonna<00:06:50.620> be<00:06:50.710> playing

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:50.950 
as a thickener I'm gonna be playing

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:51.990 
as a thickener I'm gonna be playing
around<00:06:51.040> with<00:06:51.250> that<00:06:51.370> so<00:06:51.640> I'll<00:06:51.730> let<00:06:51.850> you<00:06:51.970> know

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 
around with that so I'll let you know

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000 
around with that so I'll let you know
how<00:06:52.210> that<00:06:52.360> goes<00:06:52.570> but<00:06:52.930> that's<00:06:53.470> it<00:06:53.710> I'm<00:06:53.890> gonna

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.010 
how that goes but that's it I'm gonna

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.000 
how that goes but that's it I'm gonna
throw<00:06:54.250> it<00:06:54.340> into<00:06:54.520> this<00:06:54.610> bottle<00:06:54.940> now<00:06:55.120> I<00:06:56.010> found
