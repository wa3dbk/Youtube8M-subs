00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
kickflip over the gap where you kind of

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.730

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
hung up in that ditch and made it and I

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.080 
hung up in that ditch and made it and I
was<00:00:28.859> like<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.279> know<00:00:29.369> seeing<00:00:29.670> all<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:29.849> stuff

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
was like you know seeing all that stuff

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.510 
was like you know seeing all that stuff
for<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.269> first<00:00:30.390> time<00:00:30.720> seeing<00:00:31.470> him<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.430> way

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
for the first time seeing him the way

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.030 
for the first time seeing him the way
him<00:00:32.730> not<00:00:32.969> as<00:00:33.090> Aslan<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.230> Saint<00:00:34.410> Street<00:00:34.649> skated

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
him not as Aslan so Saint Street skated

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.630 
him not as Aslan so Saint Street skated
it<00:00:35.100> was<00:00:35.190> totally<00:00:35.550> inspiring<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:37.640> think

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
it was totally inspiring and and I think

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.690 
it was totally inspiring and and I think
when<00:00:39.360> we<00:00:39.510> started<00:00:39.809> I<00:00:40.079> was<00:00:40.770> doing<00:00:40.980> working<00:00:41.579> for

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
when we started I was doing working for

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.580 
when we started I was doing working for
Transworld<00:00:42.239> my<00:00:42.360> shots<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.809> when<00:00:43.050> when<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
Transworld my shots and when when the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.340 
Transworld my shots and when when the
world<00:00:43.770> started<00:00:44.510> Rocco<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.840> know<00:00:45.930> his<00:00:46.050> head<00:00:46.200> I

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
world started Rocco you know his head I

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.139 
world started Rocco you know his head I
think<00:00:46.500> Jesse<00:00:46.950> was<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.129> only<00:00:47.309> pro<00:00:47.789> Jesse

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
think Jesse was the only pro Jesse

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.020 
think Jesse was the only pro Jesse
Martinez<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.899> then<00:00:49.649> Jason<00:00:50.430> Lee<00:00:50.579> was<00:00:50.789> the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
Martinez and then Jason Lee was the

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.090 
Martinez and then Jason Lee was the
amateur<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.750> was<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> whole<00:00:52.050> team<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:53.070> I

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
amateur and that was the whole team so I

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.400 
amateur and that was the whole team so I
did<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.820> first<00:00:53.969> video<00:00:54.329> as<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.930> team<00:00:55.140> built

time it was probably like four or five
months<00:01:07.950> which<00:01:08.100> was<00:01:08.340> nothing<00:01:09.240> compared<00:01:09.540> to

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
months which was nothing compared to

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.350 
months which was nothing compared to
nowadays<00:01:09.720> but<00:01:10.760> probably<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.820> lot<00:01:11.939> longer<00:01:12.090> than

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
nowadays but probably a lot longer than

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.450 
nowadays but probably a lot longer than
then<00:01:12.780> as<00:01:13.140> as<00:01:13.439> Lance<00:01:13.710> was<00:01:13.860> saying<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.250> those

it different than videos before or was
there<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.509> plan<00:02:09.920> I<00:02:10.920> think<00:02:11.310> we<00:02:11.730> just<00:02:11.910> started

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.550 
there a plan I think we just started
filming<00:02:12.480> and

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
filming and

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.230 
filming and

and definitely the opinion with mark
there's<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.510> certain<00:02:15.780> way<00:02:15.870> that<00:02:15.900> he<00:02:16.230> sees<00:02:17.100> the

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
there's a certain way that he sees the

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.120 
there's a certain way that he sees the
world<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:18.000> think<00:02:18.300> I<00:02:18.630> was<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.290> may<00:02:19.710> be<00:02:19.770> trying
