00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
all right this is a warped record if you

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.210 
all right this is a warped record if you
can<00:00:03.780> tell<00:00:04.080> this<00:00:04.290> or<00:00:04.500> not<00:00:04.650> from<00:00:04.830> looking<00:00:05.160> at

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
can tell this or not from looking at

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.370 
can tell this or not from looking at
this<00:00:05.839> but<00:00:06.839> if<00:00:07.170> you<00:00:07.319> push<00:00:07.589> on<00:00:07.770> you<00:00:08.010> can<00:00:08.189> see

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:09.380 
this but if you push on you can see

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.830 
this but if you push on you can see
obviously<00:00:10.380> is<00:00:10.920> very<00:00:11.160> bowed<00:00:11.670> one<00:00:12.030> way<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.630> it

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
obviously is very bowed one way and it

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.070 
obviously is very bowed one way and it
is<00:00:12.990> also<00:00:14.660> warped<00:00:15.920> so<00:00:17.090> good<00:00:18.090> candidate<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.900> see

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
is also warped so good candidate to see

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.340 
is also warped so good candidate to see
if<00:00:19.170> I<00:00:19.289> can<00:00:19.470> fix<00:00:19.680> it<00:00:20.720> okay<00:00:21.720> first<00:00:21.930> thing<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.199> want

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
if I can fix it okay first thing I want

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.070 
if I can fix it okay first thing I want
to<00:00:22.410> do<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.740> because<00:00:23.519> there's<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.789> raised<00:00:24.720> piece

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
to do is because there's a raised piece

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.429 
to do is because there's a raised piece
of<00:00:25.260> paper<00:00:25.529> on<00:00:25.859> this<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.699> want<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.810> compensate

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
of paper on this I want to compensate

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.470 
of paper on this I want to compensate
for<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.680> so<00:00:29.400> I'm<00:00:29.519> going<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.730> cut<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.910> hole<00:00:30.240> out

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
for that so I'm going to cut a hole out

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.350 
for that so I'm going to cut a hole out
of<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.630> piece<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.869> cardboard<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.890> just

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
of a piece of cardboard and this is just

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.240 
of a piece of cardboard and this is just
the<00:00:33.360> backside<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.760> paper<00:00:37.250> thicker

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
the backside of a paper thicker

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.920 
the backside of a paper thicker
cardboard<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.300> should<00:00:39.480> be<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.600> little<00:00:39.840> bit

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
cardboard so it should be a little bit

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:40.639 
cardboard so it should be a little bit
thicker<00:00:40.079> than<00:00:40.200> that

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
thicker than that

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.770 
thicker than that
I<00:00:40.680> was<00:00:41.070> thinking<00:00:41.340> about<00:00:41.399> using<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:42.000> paper

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
I was thinking about using a paper

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.190 
I was thinking about using a paper
sleeve<00:00:43.320> but<00:00:44.070> they're<00:00:44.309> slightly<00:00:44.700> smaller<00:00:45.420> than

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
sleeve but they're slightly smaller than

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.779 
sleeve but they're slightly smaller than
that<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:46.800> you're<00:00:46.950> still<00:00:47.219> going<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.430> have<00:00:47.640> an

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
that so you're still going to have an

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.069 
that so you're still going to have an
edge<00:00:47.969> on<00:00:48.210> there<00:00:48.450> so<00:00:48.629> I'm<00:00:48.719> going<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.899> go<00:00:48.989> ahead

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
edge on there so I'm going to go ahead

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.139 
edge on there so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:00:49.289> cut<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.469> out<00:00:49.649> or<00:00:50.160> we<00:00:50.280> can<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.550> circle<00:00:51.059> I've

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
and cut it out or we can I circle I've

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.029 
and cut it out or we can I circle I've
got<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.360> roll<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.840> tape<00:00:52.050> here<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.710> bigger

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
got a roll of tape here that is bigger

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.029 
got a roll of tape here that is bigger
than<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:53.910> that's<00:00:54.690> what<00:00:54.960> I'm<00:00:55.050> doing<00:00:55.289> okay

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
than that so that's what I'm doing okay

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.250 
than that so that's what I'm doing okay
so<00:00:56.309> now<00:00:56.550> I've<00:00:56.670> used<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.180> masking<00:00:58.020> tape<00:00:58.230> to

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
so now I've used the masking tape to

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.810 
so now I've used the masking tape to
trace<00:00:58.620> circles<00:00:58.829> I'm<00:00:59.190> going<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.399> cut<00:00:59.550> out<00:00:59.670> the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
trace circles I'm going to cut out the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.290 
trace circles I'm going to cut out the
holes

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
holes

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.779 
holes
all<00:01:01.230> right<00:01:01.410> holes<00:01:01.649> are<00:01:01.890> cut<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.309> now<00:01:02.340> I'm<00:01:02.640> going

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
all right holes are cut so now I'm going

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.690 
all right holes are cut so now I'm going
to<00:01:02.879> see<00:01:03.059> if<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.300> can<00:01:03.680> sandwich<00:01:04.680> Alan<00:01:05.129> Jackson's

now there's still a little bit on the
edge<00:02:00.750> but<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:05.710> works<00:02:05.920> so<00:02:06.430> time<00:02:06.820> to<00:02:06.940> get<00:02:07.090> some

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
edge but it works so time to get some

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.389 
edge but it works so time to get some
more<00:02:07.530> records<00:02:08.530> out<00:02:08.679> here<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:09.100> see<00:02:09.250> where<00:02:09.310> the

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
more records out here and see where the

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.520 
more records out here and see where the
Texas<00:02:09.760> Sun<00:02:09.910> can<00:02:10.119> do

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
Texas Sun can do

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.050 
Texas Sun can do
