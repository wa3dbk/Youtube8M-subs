00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:12.649
 the fundamental point of here we spoke before was what it was the year 

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:18.109
 improvisation in this kind of pony approach exactly like 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.109
 all the things of this world cannot be improvised 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:24.669
 I hold courses for the owners 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.199
 and actually if an owner at a junction 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.279
 sufficiently good battleship 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.340
 equalizing the beliefs becomes trivial 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.910
 not really trivial 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.570
 novel but quite simple within the reach of an educated owner 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.290
 the two regions of Rome 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.290
 2 or 4 days you talk rally 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.520
 this if 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.140
 the management conditions are 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.490
 it's very good 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.460
 if the conditions management and cleaning corner horses with the t 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.409
 lead to other types of painting 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.409
 cable also others, spoleto line 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.200
 and you can't improvise 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.330
 Unfortunately 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.380
 seems like a very simple thing 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.270
 in reality 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.060
 precisely because it is made up of so many pieces to do courtesy 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.690
 going out complaining means knowing 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.980
 re deployments flawlessly like making a draw authentically 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.590
 natural thing about farriers if they are not educated they do not know absolutely 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.920
 because it is completely different from that 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.990
 it takes a preparation clearly 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.550
 theme content 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.070
 over 72 hours around Italy for the owners of spiderwick the cd 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.100
 to explain 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.480
 even slightly minimized 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.100
 but between this 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.460
 and go to even the third person's horse 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.120
 passes us 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.780
 very wide sea and this sea must be covered by a profession 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.620
 we who have now in Italy 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.130
 read it next month, get certified 7 May 8, there are people there 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.399
 biase 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.229
 with the in hcp 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:16.229
 the association 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.599
 international run by jimmy jeckson brands takes care of making gods 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:28.040
 all-round professionals on this topic who make a fashion paris 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.599
 impeccable that they know you can change too 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.599
 horse management naturally 

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:47.680
 pass with gigi bages owners of the farmhouse say never testo 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.480
 when you met luca as I said, I met this management method 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.899
 of the horse 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:58.389
 if nothing came of it I met him in 2005 participating in one of his courses 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:05.049
 and I have already started a few years earlier precisely in 2002 to launch the 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.199
 grasshoppers the salton dating we are very interesting for you dd 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.909
 a new parenthesis opens 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.849
 made more of a professional and certainty about the balance of the feet he finds 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:16.999
 layout 

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:21.249
 you are following a training course and you have come to the conclusion it was 

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:25.719
 that final exam week if nothing was the cost of let's say 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:31.340
 keqy nice nice 7 of the necessary code school which is called an hcp 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.049
 it is a very very professional school 

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:40.009
 let us say that he does not know a two-year training course with very much you 

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:44.169
 frankly we have a different Zionist company with us with a mare 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:47.389
 a bit peculiar story of the paranÃ  I want to tell his story 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.909
 if nothing, she's got a mare that 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.249
 he has done endurance competitions since he was young 

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:58.369
 3 years ago where it came from two years 

00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:02.899
 pizzocchi and therefore it is not dry and I keep it for years + almost to finish 

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:04.129
 no tender 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:06.799
 I bought it as a mare 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:12.109
 therefore a common diagnosis of bipolar syndrome could no longer be mounted 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.519
 on the front now of course the state has suffered 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.180
 his new path has begun 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.879
 without taking into account the shoes of course in the beginning 

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:26.669
 it is practically altar years and has retrained for the 120 kilometers 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:31.599
 has just finished a trek and six hundred kilometers of deep ideas 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:34.599
 became first of all a patrol 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:38.659
 stationary 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.779
 so if we had to summarize, I asked you why the saronno 

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:54.639
 this is a difficult question because the sails are actually the reasons 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.029
 many 

00:04:56.029 --> 00:05:00.020
 because the iron is now the easy answer and if they needed it 

00:05:00.019 --> 00:05:02.539
 certainly they would be navigon inflicted 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:04.839
 but this is a bit of a joke 

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:10.229
 there was in reality the iron alters the physiology not only of the foot but of 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:11.539
 the whole leg 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:16.389
 in the horse and then ends up altering his posture the same way 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:17.830
 overall 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.620
 in a way that cannot be controlled by man 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.189
 it is a pious illusion to be able to think of controlling 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:28.379
 a such a complex structure 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:29.620
 then 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.440
 let's say you go a little by trial and error with an art that can also be very powerful 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.540
 but which in any case does not allow the use of iron alters physiology in such a way 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.879
 not to allow a volume control 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:44.879
 precisely because of the very structure of the credem 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.289
 king 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:47.469
 instead 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:52.709
 going barefoot let the horse's foot do that foot it would have 

00:05:52.709 --> 00:05:56.599
 had that specific horse been an ideal horse 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:01.849
 had he lived wild he allows that foot and therefore that act then a 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:05.150
 that animal altogether 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.820
 to develop its full functionality
