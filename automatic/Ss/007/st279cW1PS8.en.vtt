a<00:01:33.200> school<00:01:34.160> is<00:01:34.310> more<00:01:34.580> than<00:01:34.759> a<00:01:34.850> building<00:01:35.210> and<00:01:35.630> I

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
a school is more than a building and I

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.620 
a school is more than a building and I
think<00:01:36.590> that<00:01:36.740> we're<00:01:36.890> still<00:01:37.040> able<00:01:37.190> to<00:01:37.340> maintain

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
think that we're still able to maintain

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.660 
think that we're still able to maintain
our<00:01:38.630> intake<00:01:39.110> because<00:01:39.530> people<00:01:39.950> recognize<00:01:40.430> that

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
our intake because people recognize that

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.820 
our intake because people recognize that
relationships<00:01:41.270> within<00:01:41.479> the<00:01:41.690> school<00:01:41.960> are<00:01:42.259> so

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
relationships within the school are so

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.570 
relationships within the school are so
strong<00:01:43.190> and<00:01:43.580> so<00:01:43.610> positive<00:01:44.740> so<00:01:45.740> relationships

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
strong and so positive so relationships

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.210 
strong and so positive so relationships
are<00:01:46.729> the<00:01:46.759> key<00:01:47.000> thing<00:01:47.270> but<00:01:48.050> I<00:01:48.080> think<00:01:48.410> that<00:01:48.649> if

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
are the key thing but I think that if

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.490 
are the key thing but I think that if
we're<00:01:49.399> to<00:01:49.550> offer<00:01:49.759> an<00:01:50.180> education<00:01:50.810> for<00:01:50.840> an

we've got to have the facilities in the
environment<00:01:55.850> to<00:01:56.180> do<00:01:56.330> it<00:01:56.450> I<00:01:56.630> don't<00:01:57.440> think<00:01:57.530> we

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
environment to do it I don't think we

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.280 
environment to do it I don't think we
can<00:01:58.130> do<00:01:58.430> it<00:01:58.460> on<00:01:58.759> our<00:01:58.910> present<00:01:59.420> site<00:01:59.600> and<00:01:59.870> it

can do it on our present site and it

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.890 
can do it on our present site and it
grieves<00:02:00.560> me<00:02:00.680> to<00:02:00.740> say<00:02:01.040> that<00:02:01.220> but<00:02:02.090> if<00:02:02.360> we<00:02:02.540> want<00:02:02.780> to

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
necessarily new but certainly different

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.979 
necessarily new but certainly different
so<00:02:13.400> in<00:02:13.489> that<00:02:13.610> case<00:02:13.850> as<00:02:14.120> far<00:02:14.390> as<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.570> future<00:02:14.600> the

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
so in that case as far as the future the

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.490 
so in that case as far as the future the
school<00:02:15.230> is<00:02:15.320> concerned<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:16.670> new<00:02:16.850> school<00:02:17.120> is

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
school is concerned the new school is

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.410 
school is concerned the new school is
absolutely<00:02:18.500> crucial<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.250> I<00:02:19.940> don't<00:02:20.180> think

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
absolutely crucial and I don't think

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.539 
absolutely crucial and I don't think
that<00:02:20.600> as<00:02:20.690> a<00:02:20.720> school<00:02:21.049> long<00:02:21.380> term<00:02:21.680> we<00:02:22.370> could

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
that as a school long term we could

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.430 
that as a school long term we could
expect<00:02:22.820> to<00:02:23.000> survive<00:02:23.150> if<00:02:23.630> we<00:02:23.780> remain<00:02:24.200> in<00:02:24.380> the

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
expect to survive if we remain in the

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.470 
expect to survive if we remain in the
present<00:02:24.769> site<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:26.030> new<00:02:26.150> school<00:02:26.330> will<00:02:26.450> be

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
present site the new school will be

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.740 
present site the new school will be
ready<00:02:26.720> within<00:02:27.260> two<00:02:27.709> years<00:02:28.570> approximately<00:02:29.570> and

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
ready within two years approximately and

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.060 
ready within two years approximately and
so<00:02:29.959> a<00:02:29.989> good<00:02:30.170> proportion<00:02:30.470> of<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:30.769> current

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
so a good proportion of the current

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.160 
so a good proportion of the current
population<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.060> school<00:02:32.239> will<00:02:32.420> be<00:02:32.540> able<00:02:32.630> to<00:02:32.840> to

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
population the school will be able to to

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.570 
population the school will be able to to
go<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.320> the<00:02:33.440> new<00:02:33.620> one<00:02:33.799> is<00:02:33.980> that<00:02:34.070> important<00:02:34.489> that

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
go to the new one is that important that

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.910 
go to the new one is that important that
there's<00:02:34.730> that<00:02:34.760> overlap<00:02:35.180> oh<00:02:35.360> very<00:02:35.810> much<00:02:35.870> so<00:02:35.989> in

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
there's that overlap oh very much so in

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.460 
there's that overlap oh very much so in
fact<00:02:36.980> it<00:02:37.340> was<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:38.330> rather<00:02:38.750> strange<00:02:39.019> moment<00:02:39.440> I

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
fact it was a rather strange moment I

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.110 
fact it was a rather strange moment I
was<00:02:39.590> talking<00:02:39.860> to<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.070> senior<00:02:40.340> assembly<00:02:40.580> and<00:02:40.970> I

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
was talking to the senior assembly and I

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.300 
was talking to the senior assembly and I
was<00:02:41.480> saying<00:02:41.660> to<00:02:41.780> them<00:02:42.019> that<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.799> contracts

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
was saying to them that the contracts

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.430 
was saying to them that the contracts
had<00:02:43.400> been<00:02:43.549> signed<00:02:43.760> and<00:02:44.120> at<00:02:44.420> last<00:02:44.750> at<00:02:45.080> long<00:02:45.260> last

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
had been signed and at last at long last

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.710 
had been signed and at last at long last
we<00:02:45.709> could<00:02:45.830> say<00:02:46.010> with<00:02:46.220> with<00:02:46.519> with<00:02:47.060> absolute

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
we could say with with with absolute

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.000 
we could say with with with absolute
certainty<00:02:47.900> but<00:02:48.200> school<00:02:48.500> was<00:02:48.590> going<00:02:48.799> to<00:02:48.890> go

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
certainty but school was going to go

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.060 
certainty but school was going to go
ahead<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:49.340> as<00:02:50.330> I<00:02:50.510> talked<00:02:50.780> them<00:02:50.989> I<00:02:51.140> it<00:02:51.560> was<00:02:51.769> born

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
ahead and as I talked them I it was born

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.910 
ahead and as I talked them I it was born
in<00:02:52.220> on<00:02:52.340> me<00:02:52.519> that<00:02:53.329> looking<00:02:54.049> at<00:02:54.230> that<00:02:54.380> assembly

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
in on me that looking at that assembly

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.220 
in on me that looking at that assembly
only<00:02:55.370> one<00:02:55.579> year<00:02:55.820> group<00:02:56.060> year<00:02:56.269> 11<00:02:56.630> fourth<00:02:56.930> year

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
only one year group year 11 fourth year

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.990 
only one year group year 11 fourth year
would<00:02:57.829> actually<00:02:58.220> be<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.459> year<00:02:58.640> group<00:02:58.850> who

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
would actually be the year group who

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.060 
would actually be the year group who
would<00:02:59.150> move<00:02:59.329> into<00:02:59.660> the<00:02:59.780> school<00:03:00.049> it<00:03:00.860> would<00:03:00.980> have

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
would move into the school it would have

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.800 
would move into the school it would have

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
was that in one sense was sad

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.400 
was that in one sense was sad

in another sense of course you then have

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.229 
in another sense of course you then have
four-year<00:03:08.950> groups<00:03:09.250> who<00:03:09.670> are<00:03:09.700> definitely
