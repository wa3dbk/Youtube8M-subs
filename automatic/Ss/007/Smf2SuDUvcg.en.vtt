00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.900
 Hello everyone, I would like to share 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.660
 small so good news is that 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.550
 Russia post finally deigned 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.640
 not deliver a parcel which I waited another 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:20.730
 February well yes of course we are talking about 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.900
 this turtles comic get away w 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:28.140
 more precisely delax edition yes booklet 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.099
 weighty agree on the size she 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:36.440
 well, except with absolute 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:40.200
 editions of Odessa as you see one to one 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:46.680
 from to find a place on the shelf will be 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:48.480
 complicated but not exactly what 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.630
 This is for the edition so you ask but 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.380
 Naturally it does all the buildings that is 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:58.649
 edition more for collectors such 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:02.070
 as i am today the books are presented first 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.229
 4 numbers wears who do not know the comic strip 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.240
 yes louis is such a restart of the universe 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.520
 turtles in the manner of yes in the manner of marvel sky 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.399
 Ultimate Universe Ie It Is In General That 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.689
 classic stories but subjects like 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:22.590
 a bit new way with more realistic 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:25.380
 the plot more developed character 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.479
 and generally nothing more 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.329
 for that i'm the ultimate universe in general 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.810
 I love and to naturally draw parallels 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.399
 confronts the universe from marvel i know 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.859
 or just can't wait 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:42.869
 whom in the new turtle of the universe are they 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:45.719
 where they do where it is also in general 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.149
 i'm a trick of the ultimate universe from marvel so 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:51.749
 but what if someone does not know Fedorkov there 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.669
 there was a stove colossus and of course weighty 

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:56.520
 the advantage is that creating this 

00:01:53.669 --> 00:02:00.029
 comic had a hand himself kevin eastman a 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.099
 not some left fuck there from the very first 

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:03.959
 pages feel referred to 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:05.250
 original comic book starts 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:07.420
 all the same 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.810
 turtles are pressed to the wall at some 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.950
 stinking alley gang and foe 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.850
 Naturally immediately followed by savory 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.990
 U-turn where they rush into battle what 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.200
 can be said about the visual component 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:23.260
 before drawing perhaps rather rude and 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.420
 does not please us with the details but in general 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.630
 dynamic scenes pro just looks 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.680
 great interesting angles savory 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:36.550
 transitions excellent clear lines well all 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.010
 cool but what's the plot yes opera here 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.860
 worked very thoroughly though something 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.690
 It left out of the classroom such as April 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.120
 which still works some 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.160
 laboratory assistant in the laboratory of the same 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.170
 Baxter Stockman and it is here all the same 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.230
 black actually all kneading 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.480
 It starts here because 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.450
 turtles and splinter by the way this 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.790
 only experimental animals on which 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.489
 These clever conduct their experiments 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.260
 their very first numbers even appear themselves 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.600
 crank but how does he come here 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.150
 represented as such a general 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.790
 mysterious crank we do not show it 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.549
 face he just gives orders deleted 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.980
 Baxter Stockman but would like to 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.780
 pay attention to that yes it is 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:25.290
 trelock creation so naturally 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.290
 there are bonuses here but look 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.650
 This is a comic itself. 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.040
 plot part 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.590
 and here it is bonuses that is naked 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.860
 the eye can see that the poles of the book almost 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.990
 not one and a half times more than the main 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.600
 I still see the first one 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:48.750
 since he is here for bonuses you ask 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:51.550
 well naturally concept art cover 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.070
 alternative cover but everything is standard 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.830
 but the main feature lurked at the end 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:59.260
 This is the original outline of the pages from 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.270
 most kevin from mono and on the bars 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.580
 absolutely all pages of the first four 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:06.220
 numbers even with alternate versions 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.310
 that is, in fact in this booklet 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:13.110
 presented two versions of the first four 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.550
 numbers this is a complete official and 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.700
 cheating full time from kevin istman and 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:21.280
 despite the fact that the bandages again at all 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.310
 red turtles atx you but in the end 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.760
 still had to be abandoned though 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.360
 This picture here miraculously looks like a tail 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.150
 sticks out 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:35.440
 although I do not know in general, even if he 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:37.540
 recognized that tails are not needed okay but 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.350
 generally what i can say is just 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.970
 great buildings and i really hope that their 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.910
 the consequences will come out the same 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.310
 delax and for continuations as you want 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:51.790
 yet create a complete collection of themes 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.890
 more here it is written the first volume when 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.750
 keep as a book like no either 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.330
 especially the desire to return to the banal 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.310
 paper covers well let's wait 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.090
 since the comic really turned out 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.090
 fine
