00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.320
 any of their claims do not 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.210
 tava away you can not hear was a 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.360

 the aggressions that happened inside did not 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.540
 It is very difficult to see what is 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.359
 happening because it's too rude 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.650
