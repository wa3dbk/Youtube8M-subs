like<00:01:22.150> vanillas<00:01:22.690> and<00:01:22.930> such<00:01:24.000> now<00:01:25.000> it<00:01:25.210> is<00:01:26.490> for

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
like vanillas and such now it is for

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.969 
like vanillas and such now it is for

what I've seen arrahman that was
supposed<00:01:30.280> to<00:01:30.370> be<00:01:30.520> an<00:01:30.640> aromatic<00:01:30.970> plant<00:01:31.360> and<00:01:31.600> it

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
supposed to be an aromatic plant and it

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.060 
supposed to be an aromatic plant and it
is<00:01:31.840> an<00:01:31.990> aromatic<00:01:32.229> blend<00:01:32.620> I<00:01:34.920> don't<00:01:35.920> know

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
is an aromatic blend I don't know

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:42.420 
is an aromatic blend I don't know
specifically<00:01:36.820> where<00:01:37.120> to<00:01:37.450> put<00:01:37.960> it<00:01:37.990> as<00:01:38.290> in<00:01:41.430> could

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
specifically where to put it as in could

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.980 
specifically where to put it as in could
be<00:01:42.549> considered<00:01:42.850> an<00:01:43.180> English<00:01:43.570> blend<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:46.810> does

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
be considered an English blend it does

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.320 
be considered an English blend it does
have<00:01:47.170> a<00:01:47.229> significant<00:01:47.799> portion<00:01:47.979> of<00:01:48.330> Virginia's

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
have a significant portion of Virginia's

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:56.070 
have a significant portion of Virginia's
and<00:01:49.830> Latakia<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.780> some<00:01:53.080> Latakia<00:01:53.619> I<00:01:54.720> would<00:01:55.720> say

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
and Latakia and some Latakia I would say

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.780 
and Latakia and some Latakia I would say
that<00:01:56.409> most<00:01:58.200> possibly<00:01:59.200> I<00:01:59.950> would<00:02:00.340> consider<00:02:00.580> it<00:02:00.729> a

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
that most possibly I would consider it a

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.929 
that most possibly I would consider it a
Scottish<00:02:01.270> blend<00:02:02.549> because<00:02:03.549> it<00:02:03.760> has<00:02:03.909> less

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
Scottish blend because it has less

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.040 
Scottish blend because it has less
luckier<00:02:04.689> than<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:05.049> usual<00:02:05.710> English<00:02:06.220> plans

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
luckier than the usual English plans

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.810 
luckier than the usual English plans
the<00:02:08.200> more<00:02:08.530> dominant<00:02:09.750> Virginia's<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:11.820> no

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
the more dominant Virginia's and no

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.060 
the more dominant Virginia's and no
oriental<00:02:13.450> so<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:15.930> would<00:02:16.930> say<00:02:17.110> that<00:02:17.350> it's<00:02:17.620> more

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
oriental so I would say that it's more

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.220 
oriental so I would say that it's more
of<00:02:18.160> a<00:02:18.280> Scottish<00:02:18.760> plant<00:02:19.030> nonetheless<00:02:19.720> it's

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
of a Scottish plant nonetheless it's

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.480 
of a Scottish plant nonetheless it's
part<00:02:21.010> of<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.250> big<00:02:21.760> family<00:02:22.150> of<00:02:22.240> aromatics<00:02:23.490> now

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
part of the big family of aromatics now

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.910 
part of the big family of aromatics now
about<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.510> tobacco<00:02:25.810> itself<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:26.530> how<00:02:26.710> it

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
about the tobacco itself and how it

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.410 
about the tobacco itself and how it
tastes<00:02:28.170> well<00:02:29.280> can<00:02:30.280> be<00:02:30.460> a<00:02:30.490> bit<00:02:30.760> confusing<00:02:30.790> at

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
tastes well can be a bit confusing at

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.270 
tastes well can be a bit confusing at
the<00:02:31.480> beginning<00:02:33.780> all<00:02:34.780> those<00:02:35.110> different<00:02:35.500> tastes

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
the beginning all those different tastes

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.070 
the beginning all those different tastes
that<00:02:36.400> it<00:02:36.640> has<00:02:37.380> overlap<00:02:38.380> one<00:02:39.040> another<00:02:39.960> at<00:02:40.960> the

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
that it has overlap one another at the

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.610 
that it has overlap one another at the
beginning<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:41.890> it<00:02:42.760> takes<00:02:43.350> quite<00:02:44.350> some

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
beginning and it takes quite some

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.970 
beginning and it takes quite some
patience<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.460> quite<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:45.670> few<00:02:45.840> balls<00:02:46.840> in<00:02:47.710> order

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
patience and quite a few balls in order

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.480 
patience and quite a few balls in order
to<00:02:48.130> start<00:02:48.730> figuring<00:02:49.270> out<00:02:49.450> this<00:02:49.870> tobacco<00:02:50.640> and

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
to start figuring out this tobacco and

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.750 
to start figuring out this tobacco and
it<00:02:54.490> does<00:02:54.670> have<00:02:54.880> as<00:02:55.240> I<00:02:55.600> said<00:02:55.750> proper<00:02:56.110> humidity

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
it does have as I said proper humidity

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:04.560 
it does have as I said proper humidity
and<00:03:00.480> it<00:03:01.480> does<00:03:01.870> bring<00:03:02.680> some<00:03:03.550> of<00:03:03.760> that<00:03:03.790> Lakeland

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
and it does bring some of that Lakeland

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.230 
and it does bring some of that Lakeland
flower<00:03:05.230> flower<00:03:05.920> eNOS<00:03:06.430> and<00:03:06.700> nuttiness<00:03:08.820> which<00:03:09.820> I

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
flower flower eNOS and nuttiness which I

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.270 
flower flower eNOS and nuttiness which I
figured<00:03:10.570> out<00:03:11.200> that<00:03:11.800> is<00:03:12.010> there<00:03:12.310> after<00:03:14.160> six<00:03:15.160> or

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
figured out that is there after six or

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.140 
figured out that is there after six or
seven<00:03:15.550> bowls<00:03:17.070> it<00:03:18.070> gives<00:03:18.370> great<00:03:18.760> sweetness

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
seven bowls it gives great sweetness

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
seven bowls it gives great sweetness
from<00:03:19.450> the<00:03:19.540> Virginia's<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:21.810> let<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:22.930> key<00:03:23.110> is

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
definitely there it burns rather warmish

frustrating<00:04:41.810> in<00:04:41.870> the<00:04:41.960> beginning<00:04:42.380> but<00:04:43.340> I<00:04:43.699> think

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
frustrating in the beginning but I think

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.689 
frustrating in the beginning but I think
it's<00:04:44.530> one<00:04:45.530> of<00:04:45.620> those<00:04:45.710> cases<00:04:45.949> that<00:04:46.310> it's<00:04:46.430> worth

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:46.699 
it's one of those cases that it's worth

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:49.240

the<00:04:47.270> effort<00:04:47.510> and<00:04:47.780> it's<00:04:48.110> worth<00:04:48.320> the<00:04:48.590> search<00:04:48.830> and

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
the effort and it's worth the search and

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.610 
the effort and it's worth the search and
it<00:04:49.880> makes<00:04:50.120> a<00:04:50.270> whole<00:04:50.419> thing<00:04:50.660> more<00:04:51.050> interesting

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
it makes a whole thing more interesting

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.340
