00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.400
 hello this is 3dnews.ru today in our 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.460
 test lab powerful graphics card 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.310
 asus reel gtx 780 ti 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.570
 it's as easy to guess 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.720
 modified version and nvidia geforce 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.900
 gtx780 ti with alternative designs 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.400
 PCB reinforced power systems 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.440
 better cooling and elevated 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:38.170
 eye frequencies first 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.480
 directcu 2 cooling system is thrown 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.670
 which consists of two fans with 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.979
 different diameter impeller large 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.440
 radiator and 4 heat pipes 

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:49.210
 back of the board covers 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.089
 massive metal plate with 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.589
 air vents separately 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:56.530
 pay attention to the system 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:58.600
 supply which has as many as 14 phases 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.820
 to power the video card 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.470
 2 8 pins of the connector are provided and 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.470
 even one molex connector 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.170
 asus matrix gtx780 ti 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.079
 based on straightened he now see 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.899
 live her 110 bit version of his base 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:20.539
 frequency increased to 1000 6 megahertz 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:24.140
 average frequency under load boost clock 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:26.960
 is 1000 72 megahertz on the board 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.619
 soldered 3 gigabytes of gddr5 memory 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.329
 effective frequency of 7 gigahertz here 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.170
 get overclocked 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.890
 video adapter 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.240
 up to 1000 36 megahertz path to the core and up to seven 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.000
 thousand 800 megahertz 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.200
 a memory floor it gives visible but not 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.369
 too large increase 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.319
 gaming performance 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.319
 just a few fps 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.170
 in general, asus matrix gtx780 ti 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.630
 this is one of the most powerful 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.240
 video adapters based on gifors gtx 780 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.330
 ti and letting the frequency potential of jikia 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.830
 almost exhausted by factory overclocking 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.840
 but the map compares favorably with 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.600
 competitors low noise and 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.420
 quality cooling g drink finally 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.489
 She just beautiful More about asus 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.410
 matrix gtx 780 ti
