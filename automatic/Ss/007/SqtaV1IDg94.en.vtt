halibut is gonna turn a bright white on

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.860 
halibut is gonna turn a bright white on
you<00:02:10.619> around<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.130> edges<00:02:11.580> when<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.390> happens

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
you around the edges when that happens

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.940 
you around the edges when that happens
that's<00:02:12.989> going<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.349> tell<00:02:13.530> you<00:02:13.620> it's<00:02:13.739> time<00:02:13.890> to

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
that's going to tell you it's time to

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.130 
that's going to tell you it's time to
flip<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.519> over<00:02:14.700> we're<00:02:15.690> going<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.870> go<00:02:15.930> ahead<00:02:15.989> and

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
flip it over we're going to go ahead and

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.490 
flip it over we're going to go ahead and
flip<00:02:16.290> this<00:02:16.470> palette<00:02:16.950> over

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.199 

nice<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.740> caramelize<00:02:23.280> those<00:02:23.580> placement

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
nice and caramelize those placement

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.600 
nice and caramelize those placement
really<00:02:24.450> take<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:24.990> effect<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.980> fish<00:02:26.250> will

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
really take it to effect the fish will

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.670 
really take it to effect the fish will
start<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:27.030> break<00:02:27.239> apart<00:02:27.270> on<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:27.959> on<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.319> that's

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
start to break apart on it on you that's

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.650 
start to break apart on it on you that's
okay<00:02:29.520> you're<00:02:29.670> gonna<00:02:29.760> have<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.060> do<00:02:30.209> that<00:02:30.360> anyway

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
okay you're gonna have to do that anyway

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.180 
okay you're gonna have to do that anyway
so<00:02:30.810> if<00:02:31.050> it<00:02:31.170> starts<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.530> break<00:02:31.680> apart<00:02:31.860> in<00:02:32.130> the

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
so if it starts to break apart in the

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.460 
so if it starts to break apart in the
pan<00:02:32.400> it's<00:02:32.910> just<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.180> little<00:02:33.300> extra<00:02:33.480> help<00:02:33.870> with

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
pan it's just a little extra help with

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.010 
pan it's just a little extra help with
the<00:02:34.590> cooking<00:02:34.800> process<00:02:35.660> while<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.780> fish<00:02:36.989> is

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
the cooking process while the fish is
