00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.950
 you have enough cups for seedlings 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.470
 if not watch this video master class 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.009
 and I will quickly and easily teach you to fold 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.700
 from paper here such cups for 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.940
 seedlings 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.430
 with the size you need how to pick 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.029
 size in more detail I will tell about it 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.650
 description under the video see there and so 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.529
 for such cups we need 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.849
 a rectangular piece of paper can be taken 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.400
 advertising brochures 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.760
 from shops or together with a notebook case 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:40.040
 pupils and so on and they are formed 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:49.980
 very easy to fold in length 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:56.750
 our sheet is half and now every 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.750
 part again bend but now down 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:07.310
 on the one hand addition turned over and 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:11.270
 the second side is exactly the same bend 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.270
 keep a good fold and 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:24.860
 turn these leaves up to 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.860
 top corners we fold to the middle 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.760
 that's how we do it 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:45.090
 we expand our list completely and 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.090
 turn it over to the other side 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:52.320
 and bend our leaf in our corner 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.320
 which we just 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.380
 addition 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.380
 here is our corner 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.600
 unfold and do the same with 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.520
 the second side that is also bend 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.290
 here this corner that we have 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.379
 happened 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:21.510
 charter folded two sides unfold 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:26.760
 and now you need to serve again 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:29.849
 our only in the middle 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:36.150
 workpiece lower corners we bend 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:38.340
 up all the bends are preliminary we 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:44.780
 do not begin to form our 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.780
 the box the upper edge is bent down and 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:55.530
 reveal the detail here so here 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:58.439
 formed corner clamp it here 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.379
 here we have a second corner then 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:04.680
 there is see almost box ready 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:12.739
 now these two corners can be folded 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:12.739
 diagonally like this connect 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:31.290
 and dwell on this squirrel diagonal q 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:36.180
 here so we have one corner turned out 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.180
 do the same with other places 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:49.920
 It turned out two such tail each of 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:53.340
 which need to invest our pocket here 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:59.000
 god we got pockets so 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:04:10.280
 refuel our blog format 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:10.280
 on the one hand on the other hand 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.910
 I hope this video was useful to you and 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:21.599
 now you can do so much said 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.699
 cups as you need and where 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:25.860
 that size you would like 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:29.789
 you just have to experiment 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:33.539
 with sizes and your seedlings will find their 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:35.070
