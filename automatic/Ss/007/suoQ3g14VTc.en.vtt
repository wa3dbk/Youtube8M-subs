00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.760
 hello friends like this year I'm supportive 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.470
 I bring you one more video of gta online and 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.810
 good on this occasion I bring you a 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.689
 new method to get the suit from 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.700
 police with them being the cap the 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.619
 previous method is already parked but 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.329
 with this method, it will work 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.540
 one hundred and it is for all generations 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:36.940
 for all the consoles ok and good we go 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.120
 to begin to explain the trick that is 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.770
 really for only have a 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.260
 small a little thing of difficulty 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.060
 that I really do not think it's something so 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.320
 so difficult but you will be able to 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.700
 do ok 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.160
 good what we need to be able to 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.830
 doing this trick will be the help of a 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.570
 friend and we will have to start 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.340
 what it is still an activity 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.070
 we have to be good ambition let's go 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.890
 to go to be online gta activities 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.500
 and activities play an activity 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.079
 created by rockstar and from there we go 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.549
 to go to the versus mode and let's get 

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:11.890
 in the activity called paul and 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.420
 corrupt ok let's start it 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.250
 I remember that you have to be the 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.770
 host has to be the host of the 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.259
 activity so they can get 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.810
 that is the one that is the host and you will get the 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.609
 friend's costume will simply help and 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.350
 well here where it says clothes versus or if 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:29.679
 another thing comes to him wardrobe 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.110
 we put classic ok and it's the only thing 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:34.149
 let's move everything else we'll leave it 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.069
 exactly the same and nothing else 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.520
 we will wait for our friend to join 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:41.110
 to start the activity normally already 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.840
 that we are in these options what 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.880
 we are going to do is go directly to the 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.799
 option is called set versus 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.989
 and we are going to modify a set that is 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.970
 flame justice of which is the clothes of 

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:54.069
 policeman with the cap ok that's why 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.720
 important that you are the host that 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:58.119
 host this activity for 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.159
 that can move these prices ok and 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.349
 good since we have selected that 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.510
 simply because we already accept and enter 

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:07.460
 what has been the 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.860
 showing what we are going to do is 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.620
 just go to a place in 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.300
 specific that place is the head of 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.430
 I think police quite the 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.320
 you know but as you want here you 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.510
 I leave the location so you can see where 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.620
 is the headquarters and good as we are 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.410
 here we are going to take out our phone 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.430
 let's call mayweather to ask 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.860
 a helicopter extraction ok and in 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.410
 In any case we do not have a Mayweather that is 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.300
 my case because I have a very low level 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.890
 it is not totally unlocked what 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.990
 we want to tell us where we are 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.420
 let's paste your the helicopters what 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.910
 one of these places has been the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.310
 hospital and we're going to go for one that's 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.410
 there ok because it is important to have a 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.600
 good helicopter to do this trick 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.760
 we will need in this part already almost 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.650
 end of the trick we will be parachuted 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.800
 and remember that you every time you 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.450
 they get on a helicopter or an airplane gives them 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.160
 a parachute and this we are going to 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.290
 need for anything that we 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.970
 look for or we get some error then 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.410
 so that we have a parachute again 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.060
 I 'll explain later why 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.680
 let's go back directly to the 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.510
 police headquarters again good already 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.430
 that we have brought a helicopter that 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.440
 have a helicopter in this area in the 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.750
 in what is an invoice we are going to steal 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.220
 a car of preference that is high 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.380
 because we are going to get into a world 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.520
 bridge that you will see below and you 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.200
 let's say not your friends that you 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.940
 they want what that area of 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.190
 where are the helicopters so they do not 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.710
 disappear in case we do not 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.900
 we can do the trick and we can get 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.960
 another parachute that will then go to 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.670
 see why ok ok we will place the 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.050
 truck so in this position I here 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.360
 I have another one because I had already tried 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.010
 do the trick and gave me is not working 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.510
 battled a little and what we will do is 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.420
 enter here and go up 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.129
 so in this back and good what we're going 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.439
 to do is travel below the map to 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:54.209
 what has been this location that 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:56.640
 is where all the garages of 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:00.000
 everyone down the map there is 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.980
 this is going to see why good now 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.930
 that we have marked exactly that area 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.790
 Look who backhand well on video and 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.230
 look for the exact point where I mark 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.819
 because that's where we 're going to be going 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.190
 to go to what is being in the 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.260
 the back to the parachutes and we're going to give 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.019
 Yes, so that we can get what 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.090
 we will do is throw ourselves to the void and go 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.940
 to open the parachute and we're going to go 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.490
 directly to that point marked ok 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.960
 here we will travel with our parachute 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.729
 below the map that's why it's 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.460
 important that if you fail 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.380
 do this trick and they appear above and not 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.080
 under the garage that is our 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.870
 our objective have at hand another 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.490
 helicopter there ok and good here we go to 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.460
 go around look carefully in the minimap 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.979
 let's go around braking ok and 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.770
 here once we have already fallen from the 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:49.139
 everything will enter our garage here and 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.810
 in specifying a probable 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.490
 mistake that you can give them if you have 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.410
 garage you only have two good ones that 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.930
 Sean but you have some cheap garages 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.750
 that they probably do not have a department 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.090
 you will have to repeat Ok 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.250
 what because if you have a garage that does not 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.230
 you have a department you will not be able to use the 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.970
 elevator that is what we need and the 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.130
 reappearance of the garages when we 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.169
 we put below the map is random or 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.020
 we are not going to always appear in 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:18.150
 that is being a garage and 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.550
 good as we have appeared and we 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.139
 we go up to what is being the 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.760
 elevator we are not going to go directly to 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.340
 this part of here where is all the 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.350
 clothes where we are going to store this set 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.910
 with the name we want and that will be 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.220
 we will all have the police suit 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.870
 with a cap for always and good friends 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.710
 because this has been all I hope that this 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:40.110
 trick you serve me without saying goodbye no 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:43.040
 I'm a cell phone and we'll see each other in the sexy 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.040
 future
