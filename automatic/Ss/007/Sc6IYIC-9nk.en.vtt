00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
have wiggled in position you can go

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.450 
have wiggled in position you can go
ahead<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:09.960> slip<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.229> bolt<00:01:10.439> in<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.830> run<00:01:11.340> it

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
ahead and slip the bolt in and run it

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:32.170 
ahead and slip the bolt in and run it
down<00:01:11.549> hand<00:01:11.850> tight
