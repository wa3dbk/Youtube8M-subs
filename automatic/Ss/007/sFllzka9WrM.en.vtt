bothering me at the back of my mind was

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.910 
bothering me at the back of my mind was
how<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.820> showed<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.380> this<00:01:13.380> is<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.710> way

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
how this showed that this is the way

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.940 
how this showed that this is the way
that<00:01:14.340> Fujiko<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.450> Lupin<00:01:16.020> met<00:01:16.350> but<00:01:16.619> really

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
that Fujiko and Lupin met but really

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.100 
that Fujiko and Lupin met but really
that's<00:01:17.189> not<00:01:17.310> how<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:18.000> really<00:01:18.330> happened<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:19.049> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
that's not how it really happened in the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.620 
that's not how it really happened in the
original<00:01:19.740> series<00:01:19.920> they<00:01:20.250> met<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.630> completely

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
original series they met a completely

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.660 
original series they met a completely
different<00:01:21.900> way<00:01:22.259> but<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.009> know<00:01:23.130> it's<00:01:23.340> alright

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
different way but you know it's alright

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.149 
different way but you know it's alright
I'll<00:01:24.000> forgive<00:01:24.659> him<00:01:24.720> on<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.140> part<00:01:25.470> since<00:01:25.950> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
I'll forgive him on that part since the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.240 
I'll forgive him on that part since the
story<00:01:26.520> felt<00:01:27.000> really<00:01:27.600> classic<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:29.009> had

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
story felt really classic and it had

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.480 
story felt really classic and it had
that<00:01:29.759> loop<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.780> third<00:01:31.020> feeling<00:01:31.740> what<00:01:32.280> made

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
that loop on the third feeling what made

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.460 
that loop on the third feeling what made
it<00:01:32.520> even<00:01:32.790> better<00:01:33.119> is<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.840> art<00:01:34.049> style<00:01:34.380> was

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
it even better is that the art style was

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.399 
it even better is that the art style was
actually<00:01:34.979> completely<00:01:35.790> different<00:01:36.450> compared

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
actually completely different compared

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.649 
actually completely different compared
to<00:01:37.530> how<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.130> was<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.060> past

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
to how it was in the past

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.289 
to how it was in the past
in<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.079> movies<00:01:40.439> specials<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.610> other<00:01:41.970> TV

and throughout the whole episode pretty

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.930 
and throughout the whole episode pretty
much<00:02:32.140> so<00:02:32.500> we<00:02:32.650> get<00:02:32.800> to<00:02:32.890> see<00:02:33.040> a<00:02:33.070> lot<00:02:33.220> of<00:02:33.280> tits<00:02:33.640> and

much so we get to see a lot of tits and

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.840 
much so we get to see a lot of tits and
I<00:02:34.540> haven't<00:02:35.050> really<00:02:35.290> seen<00:02:35.530> everything<00:02:36.280> of<00:02:36.490> loop

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
I haven't really seen everything of loop

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.400 
I haven't really seen everything of loop
on<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.150> third<00:02:37.360> but<00:02:37.690> I<00:02:37.720> don't<00:02:38.230> remember

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
on the third but I don't remember

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.500 
on the third but I don't remember
anywhere<00:02:39.100> else<00:02:39.280> where<00:02:39.550> you<00:02:39.640> actually<00:02:39.850> got<00:02:40.480> to

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
anywhere else where you actually got to

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.680 
anywhere else where you actually got to
see<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.140> seductive<00:02:41.830> woman<00:02:42.280> actually<00:02:42.760> nude

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
see the seductive woman actually nude

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.110 
see the seductive woman actually nude
but<00:02:44.170> in<00:02:44.350> this<00:02:44.590> straight<00:02:45.310> up<00:02:45.340> in<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.670> first<00:02:45.880> 10

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
but in this straight up in the first 10

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.520 
but in this straight up in the first 10
seconds<00:02:46.540> you<00:02:46.660> were<00:02:46.720> to<00:02:46.840> get<00:02:46.960> to<00:02:47.050> see<00:02:47.200> your<00:02:47.320> tits

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
seconds you were to get to see your tits

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.650 
seconds you were to get to see your tits
so<00:02:47.950> that's<00:02:48.100> completely<00:02:48.280> something<00:02:49.210> different

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
so that's completely something different

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.480 
so that's completely something different
when<00:02:49.840> it<00:02:49.960> comes<00:02:50.140> to<00:02:50.290> disfranchise<00:02:50.680> but<00:02:51.430> yeah

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
when it comes to disfranchise but yeah

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:52.920 
when it comes to disfranchise but yeah
that's<00:02:51.580> pretty<00:02:51.700> much<00:02:51.970> all<00:02:52.150> I<00:02:52.180> really<00:02:52.600> have<00:02:52.750> to

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
that's pretty much all I really have to

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.750 
that's pretty much all I really have to
say<00:02:53.230> this<00:02:53.470> is<00:02:53.590> my<00:02:53.740> first<00:02:53.980> impression

loop<00:02:56.890> on<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.160> third<00:02:57.340> feel<00:02:57.640> to<00:02:57.820> it<00:02:57.940> but

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180
