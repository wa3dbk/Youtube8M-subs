so this is the second time I've had to

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.290 
so this is the second time I've had to
do<00:02:35.600> this<00:02:36.400> there's<00:02:37.400> a<00:02:37.519> one<00:02:37.940> of<00:02:38.000> these<00:02:38.090> little

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
do this there's a one of these little

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.550 
do this there's a one of these little
wells<00:02:38.450> here<00:02:38.660> after<00:02:38.840> I<00:02:38.900> throw<00:02:39.080> all<00:02:39.110> my<00:02:39.230> parts

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
wells here after I throw all my parts

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.380 
wells here after I throw all my parts
it's<00:02:39.709> a<00:02:39.769> nice<00:02:39.920> little<00:02:40.160> place<00:02:40.310> to<00:02:40.430> keep<00:02:40.550> it<00:02:40.730> and

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
it's a nice little place to keep it and

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.170 
it's a nice little place to keep it and
then<00:02:41.540> we<00:02:41.660> could<00:02:41.780> just<00:02:42.370> slide<00:02:43.370> this<00:02:43.580> oh<00:02:43.730> look<00:02:44.090> at

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
then we could just slide this oh look at

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:52.060 
then we could just slide this oh look at
that<00:02:45.519> look<00:02:46.600> parts<00:02:47.600> are<00:02:47.780> falling<00:02:48.380> out<00:02:49.780> hey<00:02:51.070> yeah

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
that look parts are falling out hey yeah

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.290 
that look parts are falling out hey yeah
I<00:02:52.100> think<00:02:52.250> we<00:02:52.489> found<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:52.880> problem

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
I think we found the problem

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.390 
I think we found the problem
see<00:02:53.540> that's<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.840> gear<00:02:54.110> that's<00:02:55.040> one<00:02:55.280> of<00:02:55.340> the

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
see that's the gear that's one of the

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.309 
see that's the gear that's one of the
gears<00:02:56.620> do<00:02:57.620> a<00:02:57.650> job<00:02:58.010> there<00:02:58.340> so<00:02:59.019> I'm<00:03:00.019> going<00:03:00.140> to<00:03:00.200> get

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
gears do a job there so I'm going to get

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.840 
gears do a job there so I'm going to get
the<00:03:00.410> other<00:03:00.530> side<00:03:00.739> off<00:03:00.950> and<00:03:01.160> then<00:03:01.250> I'll<00:03:01.400> come
