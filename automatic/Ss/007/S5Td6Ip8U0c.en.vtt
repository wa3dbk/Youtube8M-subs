00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.780
 hello, I'm chris, okay, we're here 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:09.200
 in the nba 2k 14 in this time is the 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:12.019
 PC version we will not see anything of 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.880
 games since then on my pc I do not know 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.820
 can play well 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.250
 You already know but let's see 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.980
 to show 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.539
 because what is doing 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.430
 one thing that there are that are the sneakers 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.670
 let's start teaching the sneakers 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.520
 say little things of the nba 2k 14 we go here to 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.860
 my shoes and here we have 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.780
 we have the nike is going to go by if 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.140
 you want to see some as you are throwing 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:43.309
 back to see the names or so 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.980
 and you are giving the break this year because 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.550
 it seems that they are going to bet more on the 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.140
 slippers that other years have called it 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.920
 it is a sneaker simulator 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.500
 It also looks very good. 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.730
 enough shoes this year or nike there 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.329
 An atrocity 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:07.070
 adidas there are also a few now 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:10.580
 you will see them but really yes 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.740
 it shows that this year they have put more and 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:18.869
 more impetus when putting them 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.119
 the shoes and we'll see that throughout 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.659
 of the year will update me I hope not 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.460
 just update the nike shoes as 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.740
 happened last year that is fine because 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.420
 many players call nike but many 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.870
 others carry 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.230
 adidas 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:40.530
 well a lot of other brands that do not 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:43.770
 they updated as much as they went 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.680
 updating the nike that were then 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.140
 when they arrived to be a few in 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.580
 Christmas others enough 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.650
 updates here we see the law order 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.650
 that we have these are quite curious 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.920
 to me jordan shoes do not tend to me 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.100
 like a lot there are some versions that 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.159
 yes 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:10.060
 but others not the last ones that have taken 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:13.150
 I do not like absolutely nothing I 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.600
 they seem like I do not know is to that cover that 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.180
 they put no, they do not just convince me 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.280
 but good for tastes there are people who 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.630
 like all jordan to me there are some 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.910
 yes and others that do not 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.500
 in here for example these are the ones that you 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.810
 I say that I do not like the inn that 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.490
 they did not like me 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.080
 absolutely nothing 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.450
 then there are some then some jordan 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.500
 that are more or less the hand of 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:43.130
 nike in this in this aspect we have 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.810
 also adidas we have enough I think 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.510
 that there may be more 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:52.560
 more shoes than last year in 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:55.800
 adidas and let's hope what I said before 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.020
 that they are updating them since to see 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.420
 if he returns from eris rous of sometime 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:04.200
 we will have these derrick rose are the 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:07.260
 new we also have howard a 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.260
 lot of players who have adidas and 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.980
 that adidas is also taking off shoes 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.959
 new we have here converse 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.959
 22 shoes nothing more 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.120
 reebok 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:28.070
 we have the arrival here, the majority 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.070
 they are retro style 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:36.910
 because the streets of mine are saq 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:40.720
 sneakers a little retro the reebok 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.850
 there are not many current shoes 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.900
 we have here the under armor some 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:49.270
 They are a little showy but 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.720
 example this micro g seems to me the 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:55.540
 You're pretty well have the spain 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.310
 spalding we only have one 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.650
 I do not think there's a lot of player with 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.920
 them one of the novelties that is peak 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:07.569
 this chinese brand as you see we have the 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:11.319
 of Kyle Lowry Silva Tier 1 and models 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:13.480
 already normal and we also have the saint 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:17.229
 by Luis Scola and Kevin Garnett I suppose 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.880
 that will add more depending on what 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.330
 long of the season and we already have here 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.400
 marked here that would be the creations 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.650
 of the people and nothing else these are all 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.500
 the shoes that are in the nba 2k 14 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.979
 by the time of the departure date of the 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:35.680
 game and we'll see when there 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:38.050
 updates so I'll do the 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.810
 other times I will upload then those shoes 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.250
 new so you can see the changes and 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.750

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.690
