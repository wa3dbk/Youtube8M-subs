00:00:00.769 --> 00:00:03.769
 6 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.220
 as usual every year two weeks before its launch and 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:13.110
 they are available we see them of the two deliveries of fifa and product of the shock 

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:17.239
 let's talk about what our first impressions were 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.289
 let's start with fifa ok 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.690
 with the delivery last year electronic resisted rounded and 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.380
 culminated the path of evolution that began to show years ago 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:34.140
 becoming the best soccer simulator not in vain the day that 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.190
 accompanying the title not only made reference to the year of the season 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.680
 if he does not have more it was almost the unanimous note on the part of the critic 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.220
 starting from the very good base of the previous delivery plus the evolutions 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.500
 that were presented at the South Africa World Cup 2010 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.990
 we are facing a point 11 that apparently in the demo 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.610
 going to sweep 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.010
 to his rival production raffle 2011 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.570
 remember that before anything that is planned is about the demos available 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.330
 with what the final product of both mariana are enough 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.810
 In the fifa demo it is possible to act with several teams 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.910
 obviously each one of them shows their own way of playing by varying and 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.370
 modifying the strategic aspects piqueras 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.410
 but there is a new aspect to take into account intopress that finally this guy 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.670
 of simulators 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.570
 the third way 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.830
 each player has his own and now 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.860
 it's not just the team 15 grows according to our good game 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.980
 Every player 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.600
 thus improving its effectiveness 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.960
 It also improves the system of passes and that is much more precise and seen in 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.670
 the game of the world 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.390
 the new derivations and better detail of the visual aspect in general advance a 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.410
 rung plus the overwhelming charity that the last seven are offering us 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.810
 the game is slightly faster in the comments though that 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.890
 these be in English emphasize the emotion of the party 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.350
 we can wrestle with the rival in a more manual and direct way is 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.299
 doing leganese obstructions in any of the 360 ​​grad 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.830
 As news that will be offered a full version we also have the 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.709
 option to be a professional acting only as a goalkeeper 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.489
 to join the posture of playing long full seasons as you should 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.099
 be or as a player 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.999
 as a detail we must indicate that in addition to creating our player we can create 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:26.790
 our chants even play our own music during the 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.279
 match 

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:32.169
 indicate that playing a lot with the demo is rewarding because if we comply 

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:35.789
 the indicated objectives like winning and maybe times for example 

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:39.309
 and that is what we will do this is for completely useful encouragement 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.540
 football party the usual multiplayer modes will follow 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.999
 being present in what is the best tomb picture looming 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:50.299
 both technically and the zetas of lives and competitions 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.300
 at the moment photo very high ribbon 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.300
 let's wait after signing two with the full version 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.959
 pro evolution soccer is bound to radically change if I wanted to make 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:02.890
 versus 5 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.969
 that he has been eating all the land yields winter afternoons 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:07.389
 and what if it has changed 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:11.239
 talking about the see we see that it takes some elements from the previous process and 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:12.069
 the rest 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.299
 he totally discards it 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.680
 from the previous one it takes the idea of ​​being able to give attributes to our player by granting him 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.680
 special skills that we can change from one party to another 

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:25.809
 to be able to compete with watermarks that may be complicated has been improved 

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:27.629
 the system of movements 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.029
 and now they are chaining which with you can have a wide range of new 

00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:33.139
 movements 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:36.049
 never seen before in a product 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.620
 this original way 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.230
 it seems that at least the demo does not just work correctly 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.329
 it continues to be easier rita spectacular plays with tweezers and with 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:47.919
 the new product 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.949
 the mobility of the ball and the players has also been retouched 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:55.119
 the emotions are more credible although somewhat slow 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:59.579
 because everyone moves as if we were playing on a planet with 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.239
 twice as serious 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.569
 perform a quick play walk 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.769
 It takes time 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:09.370
 players do not know how to open as many spaces as in previous installments 

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:13.059
 a bit by fonaes in this aspect 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:16.289
 It's hard to get the hang of the power bar that appears near the 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:17.819
 player that we control 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:21.159
 unwittingly giving away many balls to the rival 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:25.150
 in that sense we prefer to continue playing as always to the forum and 

00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:28.309
 we miss having no measurement bars 

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:29.550
 what they made seem 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.150
 more toned 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.229
 manual passes with the right stick are now more accurate 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:38.400
 at least they go the different address 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.480
 graphically improves considerably by offering what was expected of a product 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.009
 years ago 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.009
 although still far from the quality it treasures 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.990
 in the demo there is no retransmission 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.270
 and there are only two teams to choose 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.699
 it shows us as news of the full version of the possible to create 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:00.440
 our field to our team with your shield if still the two players with 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.460
 delirious objects 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.599
 kosor that we want that has its grace at the beginning 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:08.309
 but what's left over completely 

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:12.599
 the liberators cup swells the list of competitions and the master mode 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:17.749
 online is the most remarkable of the two game modes plus the 

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:21.159
 moment templates are not fully authorized 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:24.249
 possible is no longer in the psoe bar but you put it 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.040
 in short many changes in the pro not entirely successful and lack of quality 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:34.990
 as a proposal in general they make pure again serve the triumph to their rival 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.330
 fifa 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.969
 We hope that the fight will be much closer with the final product hands 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:46.139
 because at the moment it is very far from one another is an unequal struggle
