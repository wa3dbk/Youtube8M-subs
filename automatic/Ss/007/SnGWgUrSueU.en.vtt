00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
now that we've done some playing let's

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.630 
now that we've done some playing let's
talk<00:00:27.930> about<00:00:28.109> some<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.680> rhythms<00:00:28.919> involved

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
talk about some of the rhythms involved

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.130 
talk about some of the rhythms involved
since<00:00:29.820> we've<00:00:30.000> discussed<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.630> little<00:00:30.720> bit<00:00:30.869> of

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
since we've discussed a little bit of

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.500 
since we've discussed a little bit of
the<00:00:31.439> left<00:00:31.800> hand<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.369> melodies<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.030> the

the left hand and the melodies and the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.180 
the left hand and the melodies and the
role<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.899> bass<00:00:34.020> guitar<00:00:34.470> you<00:00:34.860> fall

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
role of the bass guitar you fall

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.710 
role of the bass guitar you fall
somewhere<00:00:35.489> between<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.390> melody

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
somewhere between that of a melody

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.600 
somewhere between that of a melody
instrument<00:00:37.230> with<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.410> guitar<00:00:37.769> and<00:00:38.040> also

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
instrument with the guitar and also

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.189 
instrument with the guitar and also
being<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.300> rhythm<00:00:39.540> instrument<00:00:39.780> with

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
being that of a rhythm instrument with

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:42.290 
being that of a rhythm instrument with
the<00:00:40.320> drums<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.890> always<00:00:41.129> call<00:00:41.339> it<00:00:41.370> like<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.760> bass

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
the drums I always call it like a bass

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.640 
the drums I always call it like a bass
players<00:00:42.570> were<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.930> mortar<00:00:43.260> between<00:00:43.290> the

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
players were the mortar between the

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.259 
players were the mortar between the
bricks<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.280> bricks<00:00:44.519> are<00:00:44.670> important<00:00:45.089> but

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
bricks the bricks are important but

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:46.340 
bricks the bricks are important but
without<00:00:45.360> something<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.930> glue<00:00:46.110> them<00:00:46.290> all

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
without something to glue them all

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.990 
without something to glue them all
together<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.949> doesn't<00:00:47.159> fly<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:47.820> that's

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
together it doesn't fly so that's

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.240 
together it doesn't fly so that's
essentially<00:00:48.390> what<00:00:48.900> I<00:00:48.930> view<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.559> role<00:00:49.769> of<00:00:49.800> a

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
essentially what I view the role of a

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.899 
essentially what I view the role of a
base<00:00:50.400> query<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:51.210> metal<00:00:51.769> as<00:00:52.769> you've<00:00:53.579> heard<00:00:53.760> with

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:53.909 
base query in metal as you've heard with

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:55.910 
base query in metal as you've heard with
the<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.330> previous<00:00:54.720> playing<00:00:55.260> example<00:00:55.799> and

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
the the previous playing example and

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.590 
the the previous playing example and
you'll<00:00:56.010> hear<00:00:56.189> throughout<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.670> program<00:00:57.119> we

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
you'll hear throughout this program we

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.329 
you'll hear throughout this program we
have<00:00:57.629> some<00:00:57.960> tracks<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.379> have<00:00:58.619> guitar<00:00:59.070> and

00:00:59.329 --> 00:00:59.339 
have some tracks that have guitar and

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:02.810 
have some tracks that have guitar and
drums<00:00:59.879> now<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:00.780> most<00:01:01.049> Western<00:01:01.650> culture<00:01:02.339> music

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
drums now in most Western culture music

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.700 
drums now in most Western culture music
most<00:01:03.330> time<00:01:03.570> signatures<00:01:04.049> are<00:01:04.229> what<00:01:04.379> we<00:01:04.500> call

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
most time signatures are what we call

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.370 
most time signatures are what we call
4/4<00:01:05.430> time<00:01:05.540> meaning<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.659> there<00:01:06.869> are<00:01:06.990> four

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
4/4 time meaning that there are four

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.280 
4/4 time meaning that there are four
beats<00:01:08.070> within<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.299> bar<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.900> we<00:01:10.110> have<00:01:10.259> a

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
beats within the bar and we have a

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.200 
beats within the bar and we have a
playing<00:01:10.619> example<00:01:11.189> here<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.549> discuss<00:01:11.939> how<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
playing example here to discuss how the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.510 
playing example here to discuss how the
drums<00:01:12.659> outlined<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.799> simple<00:01:14.250> playing

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
drums outlined this simple playing

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.570 
drums outlined this simple playing
pattern<00:01:15.000> starting<00:01:15.570> with<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.840> hi-hat<00:01:16.580> the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
pattern starting with the hi-hat the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.420 
pattern starting with the hi-hat the
hi-hat<00:01:18.000> always<00:01:18.420> hits<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.710> most<00:01:19.920> amount<00:01:20.280> of

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
hi-hat always hits the most amount of

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.149 
hi-hat always hits the most amount of
notes<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:20.909> this<00:01:21.060> case<00:01:21.299> it's<00:01:21.509> hitting<00:01:21.689> on<00:01:21.869> the

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:26.899 

one-two-three-four<00:01:26.159> with<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.670> bass<00:01:26.880> drum

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
one-two-three-four with the bass drum

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.660 
one-two-three-four with the bass drum
now<00:01:27.750> coming<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.380> which<00:01:28.620> is<00:01:28.650> heating<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.400> 1

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
now coming in which is heating on the 1

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.200 
now coming in which is heating on the 1
and<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.300> 3<00:01:30.980> one<00:01:32.090> two<00:01:33.470> three<00:01:34.610> four<00:01:35.610> then<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
and the 3 one two three four then the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.640 
and the 3 one two three four then the
snare<00:01:36.420> drum<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.690> going<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:36.990> come<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.440> and

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
snare drum is going to come in and

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.260 
snare drum is going to come in and
that's<00:01:38.250> going<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.490> be<00:01:38.610> hitting<00:01:38.790> on<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.090> two

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
that's going to be hitting on the two

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.080 
that's going to be hitting on the two
and<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.540> four<00:01:39.950> so<00:01:40.950> we<00:01:41.100> have<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> one<00:01:41.780> two<00:01:42.780> three

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
and the four so we have a one two three

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.240 
and the four so we have a one two three
four<00:01:45.380> bass<00:01:46.380> drum<00:01:46.979> snare<00:01:47.630> bass<00:01:48.630> drum<00:01:49.320> snare<00:01:49.770> and

this<00:01:50.940> type<00:01:51.150> of<00:01:51.180> pattern<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.780> going<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.020> be<00:01:52.200> in

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
this type of pattern is going to be in

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.620 
this type of pattern is going to be in
synonymous<00:01:53.280> with<00:01:53.430> most<00:01:53.760> types<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.299> heavy

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
synonymous with most types of heavy

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.420 
synonymous with most types of heavy

playing and essentially that's how the

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.649
