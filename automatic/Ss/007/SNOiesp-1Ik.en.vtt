00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
yeah we're in the back you can see how

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.910 
yeah we're in the back you can see how
dark<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.310> discolored<00:02:15.730> that<00:02:15.880> is<00:02:16.030> right<00:02:16.239> there

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
dark and discolored that is right there

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.199 
dark and discolored that is right there
chances<00:02:17.920> are<00:02:18.130> that's<00:02:18.519> you<00:02:18.910> know<00:02:19.000> where<00:02:19.120> the

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
chances are that's you know where the

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.120 
chances are that's you know where the
bacteria<00:02:19.360> is<00:02:19.690> taken<00:02:20.140> over<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:20.829> we've<00:02:20.980> already

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
bacteria is taken over and we've already

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.759 
bacteria is taken over and we've already
got<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.370> cavity<00:02:21.640> there<00:02:22.030> so<00:02:22.450> that's<00:02:23.260> where<00:02:23.680> we

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
got a cavity there so that's where we

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:25.319 
got a cavity there so that's where we
get<00:02:23.890> into<00:02:23.950> kind<00:02:24.370> of<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.519> suspicious<00:02:25.120> areas

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
get into kind of the suspicious areas

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:27.630 
get into kind of the suspicious areas
there<00:02:25.780> that<00:02:25.900> we're<00:02:26.019> talking<00:02:26.170> about<00:02:26.549> let's<00:02:27.549> see

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
there that we're talking about let's see

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.160 
there that we're talking about let's see
this<00:02:27.730> little<00:02:27.970> area<00:02:28.180> of<00:02:28.299> dark<00:02:28.510> discolored

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
this little area of dark discolored

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.350 
this little area of dark discolored
areas<00:02:29.470> that<00:02:30.010> is<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.190> problem<00:02:30.579> the<00:02:31.060> silver

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
areas that is a problem the silver

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.270 
areas that is a problem the silver
Stephanie<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:31.870> know<00:02:32.170> one<00:02:32.829> of<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:32.980> problems

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
Stephanie you know one of the problems

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.530 
Stephanie you know one of the problems
with<00:02:33.310> silver<00:02:33.610> fillings<00:02:34.000> is<00:02:34.150> that<00:02:34.269> they<00:02:34.360> leak

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
with silver fillings is that they leak

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.390 
with silver fillings is that they leak
and<00:02:35.170> so<00:02:35.650> you<00:02:36.190> can<00:02:36.370> get<00:02:36.459> bacteria<00:02:36.819> and<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:38.400> you

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
and so you can get bacteria and and you

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.130 
and so you can get bacteria and and you
know<00:02:39.459> bad<00:02:40.000> stuff<00:02:40.269> you're<00:02:40.510> around<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:40.989> edges

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
know bad stuff you're around the edges

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.630 
know bad stuff you're around the edges
and<00:02:41.349> then<00:02:41.650> little<00:02:41.890> leak<00:02:42.040> and<00:02:42.250> it'll<00:02:42.370> cause<00:02:42.610> a

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
and then little leak and it'll cause a

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.550 
and then little leak and it'll cause a
cavity<00:02:43.209> underneath<00:02:43.810> that<00:02:44.019> old<00:02:44.290> silver

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
cavity underneath that old silver

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.099 
cavity underneath that old silver
fillings<00:02:44.950> so<00:02:45.190> that's<00:02:45.370> one<00:02:45.579> reason<00:02:45.760> that<00:02:46.109> we

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:47.109 
fillings so that's one reason that we

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:48.479 
fillings so that's one reason that we
check<00:02:47.380> the<00:02:47.530> silver<00:02:47.859> fillings<00:02:48.130> really

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
check the silver fillings really

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:49.920 
check the silver fillings really
carefully<00:02:48.850> and<00:02:49.030> that's<00:02:49.420> it<00:02:49.540> also<00:02:49.780> another

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
carefully and that's it also another

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.390 
carefully and that's it also another
reason<00:02:50.049> that<00:02:50.350> sometimes<00:02:50.920> we<00:02:51.040> talk<00:02:51.220> about

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
reason that sometimes we talk about

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.759 
reason that sometimes we talk about
replacing<00:02:52.269> those<00:02:52.420> with<00:02:52.780> a<00:02:52.810> better<00:02:53.260> material

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
replacing those with a better material

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.309 
replacing those with a better material
as<00:02:53.859> an<00:02:54.040> elective<00:02:54.790> option<00:02:55.150> for<00:02:55.329> you<00:02:55.450> I'm<00:02:56.109> a<00:02:56.170> lot

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
as an elective option for you I'm a lot

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.960 
as an elective option for you I'm a lot
of<00:02:56.440> our<00:02:56.500> patients<00:02:56.620> want<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.069> know<00:02:57.160> okay<00:02:57.760> what

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
of our patients want to know okay what

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.400 
of our patients want to know okay what
are<00:02:58.000> my<00:02:58.180> most<00:02:58.359> urgent<00:02:58.810> needs<00:02:58.959> we<00:02:59.170> call<00:02:59.290> those

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
are my most urgent needs we call those

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.349 
are my most urgent needs we call those
needs<00:02:59.650> mandatory<00:03:00.160> mm-hmm<00:03:00.880> and<00:03:01.180> then<00:03:01.269> we<00:03:01.329> also

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
needs mandatory mm-hmm and then we also

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:02.910 
needs mandatory mm-hmm and then we also
talked<00:03:01.660> about<00:03:01.690> elective<00:03:02.200> options<00:03:02.410> which<00:03:02.799> are

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
talked about elective options which are

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.910 
talked about elective options which are

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
something that could potentially save

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
you time and money down the road if we

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.620 
you time and money down the road if we
take<00:03:08.650> care<00:03:08.799> of<00:03:08.859> it<00:03:08.980> now<00:03:09.150> but<00:03:10.150> we<00:03:10.239> like<00:03:10.389> to<00:03:10.510> just

let you know all those options and then

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:13.589 
let you know all those options and then
of<00:03:12.160> course<00:03:12.250> you<00:03:12.489> can<00:03:12.609> let<00:03:12.730> us<00:03:12.760> know<00:03:12.970> what<00:03:13.209> what

you're interested in doing and where you
want<00:03:15.190> to<00:03:15.250> start<00:03:15.430> all<00:03:15.639> that<00:03:15.670> so<00:03:16.090> that's

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
want to start all that so that's

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.809 
want to start all that so that's
probably<00:03:16.959> going<00:03:17.290> to<00:03:17.349> be<00:03:17.410> on<00:03:17.650> there<00:03:17.889> there's

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
probably going to be on there there's

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.129 
probably going to be on there there's
some<00:03:18.940> these<00:03:19.060> older<00:03:19.269> things<00:03:19.450> that<00:03:19.720> don't<00:03:19.959> have

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
some these older things that don't have

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:21.900 
some these older things that don't have
an<00:03:20.260> obvious<00:03:20.680> problem<00:03:20.920> will<00:03:21.220> most<00:03:21.400> likely<00:03:21.579> show

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
an obvious problem will most likely show

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.940 
an obvious problem will most likely show
up<00:03:21.940> on<00:03:22.239> your<00:03:22.269> treatment<00:03:23.049> as<00:03:23.319> an<00:03:23.440> elective

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
up on your treatment as an elective

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.729 
up on your treatment as an elective
option<00:03:24.549> okay

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
today it's probably that teamwork really

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.729 
today it's probably that teamwork really
is<00:03:35.910> absolutely<00:03:36.840> necessary<00:03:36.959> I<00:03:37.410> don't<00:03:37.560> know<00:03:37.650> if

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
is absolutely necessary I don't know if

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.040 
is absolutely necessary I don't know if

you noticed but from time to time there

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.509 
you noticed but from time to time there
was<00:03:40.140> somebody<00:03:40.379> else<00:03:40.650> stepping<00:03:40.860> in<00:03:41.069> helping

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
was somebody else stepping in helping

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.180 
was somebody else stepping in helping
with<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.879> probing<00:03:42.330> depth<00:03:42.599> or<00:03:43.080> the<00:03:43.650> x-rays

with the probing depth or the x-rays

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.640 
with the probing depth or the x-rays
even<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:44.730> impressions<00:03:45.269> you<00:03:45.959> know<00:03:46.080> above<00:03:46.500> and

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
beyond my assistant but with that level

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.180 
beyond my assistant but with that level
of<00:03:50.610> teamwork<00:03:50.940> with<00:03:51.900> 2<00:03:52.140> hygienists<00:03:52.380> and<00:03:52.950> one

of teamwork with 2 hygienists and one
assistant<00:03:53.700> we<00:03:53.849> were<00:03:53.970> able<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.299> produce<00:03:54.480> more

than<00:03:54.989> three<00:03:55.170> thousand<00:03:55.560> dollars<00:03:55.830> today<00:03:56.040> in

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
than three thousand dollars today in

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.430 
than three thousand dollars today in
hygiene<00:03:56.549> in<00:03:56.670> one<00:03:56.819> single<00:03:57.269> solitary<00:03:57.540> day<00:03:57.900> so

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
hygiene in one single solitary day so

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.180 
hygiene in one single solitary day so
the<00:03:59.310> beautiful<00:03:59.880> thing<00:04:00.090> is<00:04:00.319> when<00:04:01.319> you<00:04:01.860> work

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
the beautiful thing is when you work

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.250 
the beautiful thing is when you work
hard<00:04:02.940> enough<00:04:03.000> on<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.390> systems<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:03.840> develop

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
hard enough on the systems and develop

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.220 
hard enough on the systems and develop
the<00:04:04.349> systems<00:04:04.760> ultimately<00:04:05.760> down<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.209> road<00:04:06.390> you

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
the systems ultimately down the road you

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.229 
the systems ultimately down the road you
can<00:04:07.349> just<00:04:07.500> plug<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:07.799> right<00:04:07.920> people<00:04:08.220> in<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:08.760> so

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
can just plug the right people in and so

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.470 
can just plug the right people in and so
I<00:04:09.540> know<00:04:10.019> it<00:04:10.200> seems<00:04:10.410> challenging<00:04:11.480> revising

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
I know it seems challenging revising

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.699 
I know it seems challenging revising
what<00:04:12.510> you're<00:04:12.750> doing<00:04:13.019> if<00:04:13.170> you're<00:04:13.290> if<00:04:13.500> you're

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
what you're doing if you're if you're

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:14.809 
what you're doing if you're if you're
switching<00:04:14.130> to<00:04:14.220> a<00:04:14.250> different<00:04:14.310> model<00:04:14.640> of

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
switching to a different model of

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.879 
switching to a different model of
hygiene<00:04:15.239> hanging<00:04:15.989> there<00:04:16.200> because<00:04:16.709> i<00:04:16.829> think

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
hygiene hanging there because i think

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.530 
hygiene hanging there because i think
it's<00:04:17.130> it's<00:04:17.430> definitely<00:04:17.940> worth<00:04:18.180> it<00:04:18.389> and

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
it's it's definitely worth it and

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.210 
it's it's definitely worth it and
hopefully<00:04:18.720> were<00:04:18.989> able<00:04:19.019> to<00:04:19.260> get<00:04:19.380> again<00:04:20.190> a

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
hopefully were able to get again a

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.060 
hopefully were able to get again a
behind-the-scenes<00:04:20.910> look<00:04:21.269> at<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:22.650> day<00:04:22.830> in<00:04:22.979> the

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
behind-the-scenes look at the day in the

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.659 
behind-the-scenes look at the day in the
life<00:04:23.280> of<00:04:23.520> an<00:04:24.060> assisted<00:04:24.600> hygienist<00:04:25.550> you<00:04:26.550> know

life of an assisted hygienist you know

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.420 
life of an assisted hygienist you know
who's<00:04:26.880> actually<00:04:27.710> helping<00:04:28.710> a<00:04:28.860> lot<00:04:29.100> more

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
who's actually helping a lot more

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.279 
who's actually helping a lot more
patients<00:04:30.180> get<00:04:30.330> the<00:04:30.360> treatment<00:04:30.660> they<00:04:30.840> deserve

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
eight patients a day so hopefully was

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.870 
eight patients a day so hopefully was
helpful<00:04:36.570> and<00:04:36.810> again<00:04:37.650> just<00:04:37.800> keep<00:04:38.340> working<00:04:38.639> hard
