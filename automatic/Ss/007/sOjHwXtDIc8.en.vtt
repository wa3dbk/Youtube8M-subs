is for pc builds two hundred fifty
dollars<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.500> basically<00:00:17.070> nothing<00:00:17.340> in<00:00:18.000> my

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
opinion and it's something that pretty

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.980 
opinion and it's something that pretty
much<00:00:20.250> anybody<00:00:20.580> can<00:00:20.789> afford<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.390> know<00:00:21.510> i<00:00:21.720> mean

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
much anybody can afford you know i mean

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.470 
much anybody can afford you know i mean
not<00:00:22.350> everybody<00:00:22.619> but<00:00:22.980> it's<00:00:23.490> very<00:00:23.789> affordable

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
not everybody but it's very affordable

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.900 
not everybody but it's very affordable
in<00:00:24.720> comparison<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.470> say<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:26.010> regular<00:00:26.430> pc<00:00:26.730> build

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
in comparison to say a regular pc build

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.570 
in comparison to say a regular pc build
that<00:00:27.119> would<00:00:27.300> maybe<00:00:27.449> cost<00:00:27.840> around<00:00:27.990> 800<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:29.189> 250

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
that would maybe cost around 800 so 250

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.600 
that would maybe cost around 800 so 250
is<00:00:29.849> really<00:00:30.420> kind<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:30.869> impressive<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.740> you

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
is really kind of impressive and you

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.370 
is really kind of impressive and you
know<00:00:32.730> it's<00:00:32.910> it's<00:00:33.120> really<00:00:33.329> bare<00:00:33.690> bones<00:00:33.960> but<00:00:34.260> it

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
know it's it's really bare bones but it

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.680 
know it's it's really bare bones but it
does<00:00:34.559> offer<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:35.340> fair<00:00:35.880> amount<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.149> performance

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
does offer a fair amount of performance

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.900 
does offer a fair amount of performance
surprisingly<00:00:37.290> because<00:00:37.829> really<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.640> two

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
surprisingly because really the two

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.000 
surprisingly because really the two
hundred<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.239> fifty<00:00:39.360> dollars<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.930> only<00:00:40.559> going

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
hundred and fifty dollars is only going

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.100 
hundred and fifty dollars is only going
to<00:00:41.160> performance<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.510> know<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> little<00:00:42.899> bit

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
to performance you know a little bit

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.950 
to performance you know a little bit
that<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.440> does<00:00:43.620> offer<00:00:44.480> allowing<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.600> really

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
that it does offer allowing it to really

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.020 
that it does offer allowing it to really
compete<00:00:46.410> i<00:00:46.469> think<00:00:46.829> with<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.520> know<00:00:47.579> it's<00:00:47.910> going

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
compete i think with you know it's going

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.700 
compete i think with you know it's going
to<00:00:48.090> be<00:00:48.180> better<00:00:48.270> than<00:00:48.390> your<00:00:48.690> average<00:00:48.840> laptop<00:00:49.500> or

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
to be better than your average laptop or

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.270 
to be better than your average laptop or
your<00:00:49.910> average<00:00:50.910> pc<00:00:51.780> sorry<00:00:52.620> my<00:00:52.710> phone<00:00:52.860> keeps<00:00:53.070> on

your average pc sorry my phone keeps on

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.029 
your average pc sorry my phone keeps on
vibrating<00:00:53.699> non-stop<00:00:54.590> it's<00:00:55.590> gonna<00:00:55.739> be<00:00:55.860> better

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
vibrating non-stop it's gonna be better

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.330 
vibrating non-stop it's gonna be better
performing<00:00:56.969> than<00:00:57.270> your<00:00:57.570> regular<00:00:58.160> pc<00:00:59.160> that

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
would you say you know best buy for the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.380 
would you say you know best buy for the
most<00:01:01.379> part<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:01.739> will<00:01:02.100> be<00:01:02.309> better<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:03.359> know

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
most part this will be better you know

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.020 
most part this will be better you know
some<00:01:04.199> things<00:01:04.350> i<00:01:04.559> would<00:01:04.710> like<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.040> maybe<00:01:05.369> add<00:01:05.970> a

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
more you can do with this build but

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.340 
more you can do with this build but

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
anyways let's get into it obviously for

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.399 
anyways let's get into it obviously for
a<00:01:13.590> super<00:01:14.549> cheap<00:01:14.909> pc<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.689> really<00:01:16.049> want<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.320> go

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
a super cheap pc you really want to go

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.039 
a super cheap pc you really want to go
with<00:01:16.650> an<00:01:16.860> AMD<00:01:17.220> processor<00:01:17.880> that's<00:01:18.030> an<00:01:18.210> AP<00:01:18.750> you

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
with an AMD processor that's an AP you

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.080 
with an AMD processor that's an AP you
mean<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.920> has<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.130> discrete<00:01:20.820> graphics

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
mean that it has the discrete graphics

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.810 
mean that it has the discrete graphics
on<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:22.320> CPU<00:01:22.770> itself<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.490> don't<00:01:23.640> have<00:01:23.700> to

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
on the CPU itself so you don't have to

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.300 
on the CPU itself so you don't have to
spend<00:01:24.090> money<00:01:24.780> for<00:01:24.930> discrete<00:01:25.500> graphics<00:01:25.740> card

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
spend money for discrete graphics card

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.270 
spend money for discrete graphics card

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
increase what you can do with build but

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.160 
increase what you can do with build but
