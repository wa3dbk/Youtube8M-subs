00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.490
 Jonathan ignored what he said 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.430
 Daisy and hiding from her called 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.760

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.220
 his son was born but he always followed 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.470
 happening the same 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.900
 Jonathan called very little because his 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.689
 Woman did not like it and how she handled it 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.489
 with a finger how many years have already passed 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.280
 my grandson must be great and not even 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.489
 i know that jonathan forgot about me 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.100

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.740
 Very hot people and your father has returned 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.410
 to know something about him 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:54.200
 I did not call again, I already heard 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.540
 he would forget about me if to talk about him 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.490
 Suegrita is someone who does not bring us 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.250
 nothing good just moans 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.130
 if you're right margarita frames is very 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.560
 rough drawer meanwhile frames are 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:09.200
 I was dying of sadness and this 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.230
 I was carrying health breakdowns a 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.900
 friend of his work he went to visit 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:17.240
 frames because you have not returned to work 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.970
 you are sick I see you very bad there is Jorge 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.740
 I want to die my son forgot about me 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.170
 there are definitely very children 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.180
 ungrateful must be triumphing by 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.369
 back in Mexico, let it be rather 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.340
 Worry about you, look at how you are doing 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.920
 bad if maybe but the truth without me 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:38.320
 son my life does not make sense I'm going to 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.320
 call the doctor the doctor soon arrived 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.310
 as this doctor sees him this man is 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.370
 dying of the moral penalty is seen that makes 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.350
 He does not eat if he keeps going like that he's going to die 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.720
 and what can we do 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.480
 I can apply serum but if he does not 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.090
 he wants to continue living what I gamper me 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.720
 it is likely that it will soon be consumed and 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.780
 finish with your life you know why it is 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.540
 rate is for your child who is in Mexico and 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.300
 he did not remember him again because I 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.940
 I advise you to call the son now 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.610
 because if this poor man is not going away 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.620
 to die of moral pain my god I will have 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.570
 to call my friend's son or not 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.140
 the poor frame is going to die what you 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.240
 Jonathan, I see you, I 'm worried 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.250
 to call a friend from dad says he's 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.840
 very sick and you can do 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.420
 we are far away 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.790
 surely the friend will help him 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.250
 to go see it but you can not leave your 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.920
 work in the hospital they need 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.570
 I do not know how much but I'm leaving 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.570
 father is like that because I did not return it 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.700
 double foolish jonathan I do not think that 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.069
 has sickened your fault 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.290
 friend told me and if not the dad is going to 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.170
 to die of moral grief in these times 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.420
 nobody dies of moral pain do not do it 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.790
 case I do not want to burden my conscience 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.610

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.580

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.800
 we need you how can it be 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.470
 so unconscious dad is wrong for me 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.630
 blame you are well and jonathan 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.060
 I returned to Colombia to see his father 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.890
 despite the disgust of his wife boy 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.080
 if you want the poor guy from you 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.209
 father is very weak he did not want to go back to 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.489
 try the only thing he says is that 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.950
 he wants to die poor dad I see him very 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.650
 wrong and everything because of me will be that 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.470

 It's not your grandfather but it's my dad 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.000
 Dad has to be my grandfather but I do not 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.090
 I want you to have relations with that man 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.520

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.470

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.090

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.650
 my dad because I'm not the one to 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.810
 tell you nothing forgive me to get me but 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.090
 when you marry someone you should 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.490
 accept the whole family or if not that 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.800
 relationship will never work if you have 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.840
 reason don jorge she was always the one 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.180
 he pressed to call us all and 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.860
 I say let me influence what happens 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.620
 is that we have always been of stratum 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.570
 different social she saw that I poor not 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.940
 I was me I noticed her thought 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.750
 I was going to change mom always wanted her 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.700
 because Juan has money 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.070
 what do you think do son remember that if 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.320
 You're leaving, your father gives himself to me 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:30.020
 cost the marriage I will not leave 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.600
 to my old man what worries me army and 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.310
 that was how Jonathan stayed with his father and 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.900
 separated from daisy 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.990
 little by little frame was recovering 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:41.030
 thank you son for staying with me but 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.070
 that has cost you the marriage 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.560
 matter dad I should never have married 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:48.860
 with that woman I never accept my origin 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.720
 humble soon met another colleague of 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.630
 humble origin and they fell in love 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.970
 deeply and they got married but this time 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.669
 they went to live with their father that was 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:01.100
 jonathan's condition to his dinner his 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:03.770
 new girlfriend accepted and got along very well 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.330
 with his father-in-law they soon had a girl 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.490
 Marcos was very happy with his family 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.800
 although jonathan and marco always 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.320
 they remembered Luis and they were going to see him 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.570
 mexico and then the child continued to live in 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.730
 that country with his mother and stepfather 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.070
 which he had much silver as 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:21.080
 Margarida liked it even though Luisito 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.419
 he seemed very much like his mother 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.700
 remembered and loved his father and 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:27.390
 his grandfather inherited the good heart of 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:30.630
 jonathan and his grandfather frame 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:32.730
 Jonathan learned a lesson that love 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.710
 parents is fundamental and that sometimes 

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:36.960
 social differences separate us 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.890
 when we do not have enough maturity 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.890
 to adapt
