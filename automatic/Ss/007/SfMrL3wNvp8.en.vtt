probably want to run like the magazine
size<00:01:50.009> prefix<00:01:50.520> for<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.060> could<00:01:51.299> make

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
size prefix for this so you could make

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.600 
size prefix for this so you could make
full<00:01:52.079> use<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.590> continuous<00:01:53.070> damage<00:01:53.280> bonus

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
full use of that continuous damage bonus

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.660 
full use of that continuous damage bonus
cuz<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:55.170> know<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.920> know<00:01:56.009> just<00:01:56.280> make<00:01:56.430> sense

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
cuz you know you know just make sense

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.399 
cuz you know you know just make sense
the<00:01:57.540> longer<00:01:57.719> holding<00:01:58.049> down<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.290> trigger

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
the longer holding down the trigger

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.740 
the longer holding down the trigger
means<00:01:59.159> like<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.490> bigger<00:01:59.759> your<00:02:00.329> magazine

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
means like the bigger your magazine

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.490 
means like the bigger your magazine
sizes<00:02:01.670> so<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.509> more<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.960> chance<00:02:04.200> you're

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
sizes so the more of a chance you're

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.350 
sizes so the more of a chance you're
gonna<00:02:04.560> have<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.490> get<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:05.790> 100%

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
gonna have to get to that 100%

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.359 
gonna have to get to that 100%
continuous<00:02:06.960> damage<00:02:07.140> bonus<00:02:07.439> so<00:02:08.220> it's

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
continuous damage bonus so it's

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.240 
continuous damage bonus so it's
basically<00:02:08.789> like<00:02:08.989> the<00:02:09.989> e<00:02:10.020> gun<00:02:10.379> or<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.709> rosey<00:02:11.099> or

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
basically like the e gun or the rosey or

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.890 
basically like the e gun or the rosey or
the<00:02:11.340> vibra-pulse<00:02:11.640> where<00:02:12.510> they<00:02:12.569> have<00:02:12.720> that

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
the vibra-pulse where they have that

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.670 
the vibra-pulse where they have that
continues

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
continues

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.490 
continues
bonus<00:02:14.250> now<00:02:14.730> laser<00:02:15.000> it's<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.689> it's<00:02:15.959> a<00:02:16.049> lot<00:02:16.230> bigger

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
bonus now laser it's a it's a lot bigger

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.880 
bonus now laser it's a it's a lot bigger
but<00:02:16.769> lasers<00:02:17.040> have<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.400> lot<00:02:17.640> less<00:02:18.260> damage<00:02:19.260> on<00:02:19.680> the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
but lasers have a lot less damage on the

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.380 
but lasers have a lot less damage on the
card<00:02:20.159> then<00:02:20.459> a<00:02:20.549> sniper<00:02:20.760> rifle<00:02:20.909> does<00:02:21.239> obviously

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
card then a sniper rifle does obviously

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.410 
card then a sniper rifle does obviously
now<00:02:22.019> with<00:02:22.140> this<00:02:22.260> sniper<00:02:22.469> rifle<00:02:22.980> it's<00:02:23.969> really

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
now with this sniper rifle it's really

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.339 
now with this sniper rifle it's really
really<00:02:24.659> good<00:02:24.900> but<00:02:25.790> it<00:02:26.790> shines<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.870> most<00:02:28.079> when

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
really good but it shines the most when

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.879 
really good but it shines the most when
fighting<00:02:28.590> bosses<00:02:29.129> this<00:02:29.430> is<00:02:29.609> a<00:02:29.640> boss<00:02:29.969> killer

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:30.889 
fighting bosses this is a boss killer

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:33.199 
fighting bosses this is a boss killer
because<00:02:31.889> you<00:02:32.129> don't<00:02:32.310> normally<00:02:32.519> just<00:02:32.790> hold

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
because you don't normally just hold

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.089 
because you don't normally just hold
down<00:02:33.389> the<00:02:33.569> trigger<00:02:33.810> against<00:02:34.530> normal<00:02:34.799> enemies

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
down the trigger against normal enemies

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.080 
down the trigger against normal enemies
because<00:02:35.340> they're<00:02:35.489> not<00:02:35.609> gonna<00:02:35.700> take<00:02:35.879> too<00:02:36.000> many

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
because they're not gonna take too many

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.089 
because they're not gonna take too many
bullets<00:02:36.359> they'll<00:02:36.689> take<00:02:36.870> like<00:02:37.079> a<00:02:37.230> few<00:02:37.739> crits

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
bullets they'll take like a few crits

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.399 
bullets they'll take like a few crits
and<00:02:38.340> this<00:02:38.819> one<00:02:39.060> isn't<00:02:39.420> really<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:39.629> good<00:02:40.079> for

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
and this one isn't really that good for

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.830 
and this one isn't really that good for
using<00:02:40.560> against<00:02:41.129> um<00:02:41.359> just<00:02:42.359> regular<00:02:42.689> enemies

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
using against um just regular enemies

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.110 
using against um just regular enemies
anyway<00:02:43.349> if<00:02:43.590> you<00:02:43.950> want<00:02:44.219> like<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.459> vlados<00:02:44.879> sniper

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
anyway if you want like a vlados sniper

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.789 
anyway if you want like a vlados sniper
rifle<00:02:45.450> that's<00:02:45.629> good<00:02:45.780> for<00:02:45.959> just<00:02:46.139> regular<00:02:46.290> mobs

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
rifle that's good for just regular mobs

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.339 
rifle that's good for just regular mobs
for<00:02:47.609> just<00:02:47.790> mobbing<00:02:48.299> you<00:02:48.599> probably<00:02:48.989> want<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.230> go

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
for just mobbing you probably want to go

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.470 
for just mobbing you probably want to go
with<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.590> long<00:02:49.829> nail<00:02:50.129> get<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:50.939> over<00:02:51.209> from

the raid boss

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.629 
the raid boss

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
so if we ever would I imagine we would

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.990 
so if we ever would I imagine we would
get<00:04:31.360> more<00:04:31.510> MOS<00:04:32.050> to<00:04:32.230> use<00:04:32.410> it<00:04:33.310> would<00:04:33.490> be<00:04:33.640> great

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
get more MOS to use it would be great

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.580 
get more MOS to use it would be great
this<00:04:34.180> come<00:04:34.390> would<00:04:34.540> be<00:04:34.660> great<00:04:34.990> with<00:04:35.170> more<00:04:35.350> mo

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
this come would be great with more mo
