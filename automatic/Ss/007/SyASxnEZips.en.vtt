mean it's just gonna take a little bit
of<00:01:42.960> adjusting<00:01:43.590> but<00:01:43.829> I'm<00:01:44.040> sure<00:01:44.220> once<00:01:44.460> we<00:01:44.549> all

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
of adjusting but I'm sure once we all

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.859 
of adjusting but I'm sure once we all
get<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.939> hang<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.270> will<00:01:45.479> have<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> blast

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
get the hang of it will have a blast

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.929 
get the hang of it will have a blast
with<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.470> didn't<00:01:47.310> get<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.460> go<00:01:47.909> anywhere

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
with it I didn't get to go anywhere

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.969 
with it I didn't get to go anywhere
because<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.689> was<00:01:48.840> terrible<00:01:49.229> with<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.380> game<00:01:49.619> at

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
because I was terrible with the game at

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.830 
because I was terrible with the game at
the<00:01:50.040> time<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:50.759> couldn't<00:01:51.060> figure<00:01:51.570> out<00:01:51.720> I

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
the time and I couldn't figure out I

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.499 
the time and I couldn't figure out I

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
and he whipped my butt he's 24 I think

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.790 
and he whipped my butt he's 24 I think
um<00:02:42.580> he<00:02:43.580> hadn't<00:02:44.540> played<00:02:44.660> smash<00:02:44.930> bros<00:02:45.230> for<00:02:45.500> quite

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
um he hadn't played smash bros for quite

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.650 
um he hadn't played smash bros for quite
a<00:02:45.830> while<00:02:46.190> and<00:02:46.610> I'm<00:02:46.760> very<00:02:47.000> surprised<00:02:47.300> he<00:02:47.480> won

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
a while and I'm very surprised he won

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.170 
a while and I'm very surprised he won
but<00:02:48.500> he's<00:02:48.709> actually<00:02:48.980> thinking<00:02:49.310> about<00:02:49.700> getting

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
but he's actually thinking about getting

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.949 
but he's actually thinking about getting
a<00:02:50.390> wii<00:02:50.570> u<00:02:50.780> now<00:02:50.990> because<00:02:51.440> of<00:02:51.470> this<00:02:51.680> game<00:02:51.950> which

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
a wii u now because of this game which

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.360 
a wii u now because of this game which
automatically<00:02:53.959> makes<00:02:54.170> me<00:02:54.350> think<00:02:54.620> this<00:02:55.100> could

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
automatically makes me think this could

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.800 
automatically makes me think this could
be<00:02:55.459> a<00:02:55.490> system<00:02:55.820> seller<00:02:56.030> obviously<00:02:56.660> because

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
be a system seller obviously because

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.050 
be a system seller obviously because
it's<00:02:56.990> smash<00:02:57.230> bros<00:02:57.560> but<00:02:58.340> in<00:02:58.490> this<00:02:58.640> match<00:02:58.850> for
