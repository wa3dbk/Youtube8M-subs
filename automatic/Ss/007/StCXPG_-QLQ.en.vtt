00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.010
 hello and welcome to this second video 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.750
 of chords let's continue with the 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.990
 explanation of the chords with 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.029
 fundamentals in different strings 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.029
 following the previous video we are going to 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.490
 continue with the rope 3 we were 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.440
 we had made the chord on the rope 4 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.260
 base on the rope 4 and now we go 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.660
 to agreement 3 good this chord has 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.239
 several this position has several 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.730
 options but let's see the most logical 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:40.430
 the fundamental one we have it in the third 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.430
 rope up we have the fifth 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:49.040
 down we have the third and the eighth 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:52.100
 for we can put here but we are not going to 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.550
 put this would be like the position of 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.550
 sodium 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.650
 so we had 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.650
 third 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.700
 if we follow the pattern that we have made 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.330
 before now we will find the max 7 that 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.330
 we have it here 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.240
 it's a thing that sounds weird about this 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.240
 way it sounds nicer 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.990
 third second fundamental rope the 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.520
 third fifth fourth and above the sixth 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.469
 or the seventh major 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.060
 and now it comes in seventh chords 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:34.060
 lowering a semitone greater meaning 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.990
 it sounds nicer 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.990
 in this case 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.920
 also 7 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:58.350
 to make the seventh minor we have to 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.350
 drop a semitone its third 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.640
 here we have the fifth one we do this 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.710
 - 7 emotion 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.300
 we have the seventh flat if we go down 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.300
 accent we do not have the diminished 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.840
 come back before 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.840
 fundamental 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.700
 Y 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.870
 from New York 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:33.769
 7a 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.769
 - 75 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.110
 no no 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.810
 from the most complex to understand 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.340
 now we are going to base the second 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.420
 here we have two possibilities 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.720
 fundamental the second string we have it 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.720
 here 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:03:01.060
 fifth fifth tonic and we can put 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:05.349
 now the fifth one here up 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.349
 this would be transition of two 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.860
 higher 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.400
 we have 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.400
 the fifth that up 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.290
 and we can put the seventh major here 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.290
 down 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.459
 see what 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:35.060
 before we had here the eighth and the 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.750
 seventh largest 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:42.660
 fifth third 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.660
 tonic and seventh 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.530
 - 7 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.379
 75 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.530
 yes 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.220
 we repeat 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.220
 higher 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.350
 greater 7 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.350
 do not 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:14.110
 and me 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:14.110
 - 77 51 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:22.750
 we have already left the fundamental 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.060
 now let's see a position that goes 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.580
 linked to this with fundamental to the 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.520
 second 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.950
 but using only the strings 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:38.330
 interiors 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:41.200
 we have a greater greater 7 clear is that 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:44.150
 Here the key is kept here 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.830
 we continue with the fifth here is the 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:50.650
 third is now the seventh largest 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.650
 team that is the eighth now seventh 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.750
 we have the eighth here we have the 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.080
 third if we lower it a semitone less 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.080
 7 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:09.730
 tonic position 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:13.290
 we see 37 if we go down to the fifth 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.290
 we have the lowest 75 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.590
 and we work we have 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.870
 ok let's recap this position 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.260
 greater greater 7 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.800
 75 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.800
 Y 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.229
 we already have the fundamental in the first 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.569
 basically the sixth is as fundamental 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:52.250
 here what is going to happen is that all 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:56.710
 the voice and all the voices are going to be 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.710
 down here we have the biggest here 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:15.139
 it is the fifth major seventh 7th - 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:15.139
 seventh minus 5 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:29.210
 for me 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.210
 if not 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.990
 and that's all that concerns 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:39.160
 chords with fundamentals in sixth 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:41.500
 fifth fourth third second 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.570
 we can find any chord to 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.100
 from any rope that wants 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.730
 say that if we are clear about where they are 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:51.310
 the octaves we can find any 

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:53.380
 chord without having to be moving 

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:56.410
 of position in clear position that stops 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:58.840
 the guitarists one of those from the 

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:02.890
 problems that you have at the beginning is 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:05.170
 understand the fundamentals in the fourth 

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:07.540
 third and second but good is a 

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:10.210
 work that needs to be done and so we are 

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:12.250
 to work and learn so I hope 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:14.800
 that this video of 

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:17.170
 chords are not chords menus we will pass to 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.730
 the major chords in other videos is worth 

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:21.910
 but I did see that it was interesting 

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:23.800
 explain this type of chord work 

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:26.530
 so that we could accompany any 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:30.010
 thing so remember to subscribe to 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:32.200
 our channel visit our facebook and 

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:36.600
 nothing I hope you like what we're going 

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.600
 doing and see you in the next video
