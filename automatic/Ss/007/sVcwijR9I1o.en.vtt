00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello I am olive tree I am 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.649
 escaladian teacher I'm going to you 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.880
 show the different types of 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.429
 descender so what is a 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.340
 descender is a metal object 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.690
 mostly aluminum 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.690
 simply allows you to brake the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.050
 rope and thus preserve the life of the 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.689
 rapper 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.350
 there are several kinds of 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.650
 old and the most widespread is classic 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:30.779
 it's 8 so as its name indicates 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.590
 is like the shape the dike rather that to 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.170
 8 how to use the 8 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.700
 take your rope loops 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.100
 okay that you spend in the most 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.230
 big diameter and then this same 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.629
 loop where to pass underneath as 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.969
 those below and you will see the place 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.940
 on the smallest diameter 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.340
 then you come to fix your 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.469
 descender on the shoulder belt and more 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.559
 precisely here on the bridge you life 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.559
 it's always to avoid an incident 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.150
 and there you have your belay system 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:11.120
 so we saw the most basic 8 the 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.170
 older this is part of the tubes 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.420
 tubes or pads 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.720
 it's very basic or so very light 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.460
 when you see there is throat both 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.830
 actually allow us to make 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.850
 abseiling or supposed right-handed 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.870
 pike or put it right or 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.550
 left but then we have the reverse one 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.450
 little more complicated there are always some and 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.560
 of throats here we put the rope like 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.080
 two ropes when rappelling 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.660
 so there are holes that's normal and we have 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.850
 additional holes to make 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.540
 additional manipulations this is one 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:49.680
 the most complete models that exists 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:52.950
 and finally the model we use 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.960
 often to be self-assured it's 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.990
 when working in a room 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.210
 of scaled to fit sees one puts 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.560
 takes so to prevent that a 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.479
 second person who assures you 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.760
 take this tool and it allows us 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.520
 ensure all by yourself a little lever here 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.640
 which allows us to go down and 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.540
 and block the rope as soon as you let go 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.920
 this is called a self-locking 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.160
 know as soon as you let go and shifters 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.739
 Lacan makes fun of it's the most 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.180
 expensive the most expensive and the heaviest one 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.879
 take him away, take him in a big voice 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.379
 only if we really use this 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.190
 we're going to prefer in a big voice it's 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.849
 lighter models 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.010
 ie the tube the wafer or the 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.980
 reverso which are the most 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.019
 used personally I prefer 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.790
 this one the reverse is more complete 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.930
 I hear the leads two in the big 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.000
 voice the difference between all 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.500
 it is 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.910
 belay system it's also the weight 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.370
 so when you leave you see is worth 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.110
 better be light so these two models 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.860
 are very light the 8 starts to be a 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:03:00.959
 little heavier the other disadvantage of 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:03.750
 8000 apart from the weight it is because 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.970
 the rope makes several loops in fact 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.350
 that's not bad February and that 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.120
 so we had to go we're going 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.540
 give up more and more use 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.770
 from 8 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.720
 we will use in special cases 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.250
 really isolated or or nostalgic 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.470
 simply to finish with the 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.420
 pollsters whether you are outdoors or 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.739
 indoors 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.160
 I advise you the models is more 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:31.760
 used and the simplest ones that are the 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.760
 tube or the reverso have fun well
