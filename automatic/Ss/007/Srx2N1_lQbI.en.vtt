00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.429
 poured over our site smartphone s.v 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:17.580
 Immediately answer about the idea 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.679
 such released is to blame 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.519
 we don't pretend to be a bit short 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:24.509
 how does the topic publish reviews of different 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:26.369
 an offer that would be nice to rot 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.769
 such is her eye 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:29.630
 but maybe you get something your 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.630
 original 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.180
 so, let's begin 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.530
 today's first sentence 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.440
 range this smartly brands 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.790

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.730
 it's all over 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.660
 produced by category 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.370

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.670
 in each bet 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.360
 and we will be delayed we will come to the capital 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.320
 the hero 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.090
 it had one children 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.640
 I think everyone knows what it is like 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.309
 applications exist and for 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.450
 Other Russia such details brought up 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.310

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.050

 which we will talk about 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.710
 other issues 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.710
 those vasilyeva 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.400
 only when often this program 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.110

 quite popular lately class 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.000
 applications allowing remotely 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.880
 manage opportunities 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.130
 computer 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.619
 in Syria can work through their files or 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:51.440
 work 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.900
 our need to download and install 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.430
 on the computer you control 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.200
 looking for repair server 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.270
 it can be downloaded from the link from the application 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.660
 after return it is possible that assimilation 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.660
 we allow applications on the computer 

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:10.719
 add one of them 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:13.499
 connects 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:16.159
 rain a couple of seconds and getting to the main 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:17.369
 direction 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:18.689
 here we can manage 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:21.459
 Kiev prosecutor's office mouse 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:22.799
 but they 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.540
 working a little late then 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.649
 annual file 

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:28.289
 so for me personally, they are special 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:30.089
 no interest 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:32.209
 more interesting with the possibility 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.929
 total dioxin 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:36.179
 she allows to manage valor 

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:37.579
 multimedia applications such 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.399
 how between the media mayor 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:41.919
 chalk on the names of the zoom 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:43.289
 other 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:44.949
 I'll show you now 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:46.619
 how does she work on an example in mind 

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:47.749
 laughs 

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:49.709
 for example we want to listen to music 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.489
 Yes, I am a police station 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.999
 now we see how it starts 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:56.059
 It is conducted on the computer 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:58.099
 can be removed with the help of 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.229
 buttons navigation 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:02.459
 choose the one you like 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.319
 album 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.109
 can be like a horse question 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:08.889
 can be controlled as well 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:10.979
 man will hit the player 

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:13.419
 click play 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:16.389
 then how to match all work 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:17.979
 here you can 

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:19.199
 look 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.599
 films manage 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:22.529
 see photos 

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:25.279
 listen to the discs 

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:27.569
 much more 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.119
 another play in the arrangement is 

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:31.619
 rush remembers 

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:34.579
 we can control this function 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.489
 slide show 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.119
 remotely so dangerous aside 

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:42.529
 and also we can exclude computer 

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:45.529
 adjust the system volume 

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:49.899
 yet this proposal is promising 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:52.579
 she is online 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:54.469
 television 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:57.329
 and includes about a hundred channels 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:58.899
 18 of which 

00:03:58.899 --> 00:04:00.149
 Russians 

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:02.469
 among them there is not yet a threat to the same 

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:05.329
 popular channels but still ahead 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.749
 there is a TV program here 

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:09.739
 like 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.599
 channel leaves 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.079
 the work of the villages rather quickly mechanization 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.759
 happens in just seconds 

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:18.779
 we are preparing now 1 

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:23.209
 concerns year earn it we 

00:04:23.209 --> 00:04:25.219
 so we can forbid to view others 

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:27.719
 tass channels 

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:30.719
 all rather long 

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:34.749
 nice and functional 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:37.999
 continue our graduates go to 

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:38.879
 the next 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:40.740
 attachment 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:41.809
 the last 

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:43.779
 almighty boards but not last 

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:44.610
 meaning 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.249
 this offer went around 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:48.879
 it is essentially an alternative 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:51.349
 application directory for windows phone 7 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:53.939
 but tell me they are bought anyway 

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:54.979
 marketplace 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.599
 but there are more opportunities here. 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:00.050
 first tab 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.349
 empty by itself 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:03.689
 Interesting clause 3 selection proposals 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:05.740
 for example, I like it here a to b 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.059

 where to go games 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:37.809

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:39.300
 popular 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.740
