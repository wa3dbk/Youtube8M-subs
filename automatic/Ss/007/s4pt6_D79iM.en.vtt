for<00:02:36.840> this<00:02:37.049> to<00:02:37.110> get<00:02:37.260> confusing<00:02:37.680> now<00:02:38.130> as<00:02:38.519> we<00:02:38.849> all

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
for this to get confusing now as we all

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.210 
for this to get confusing now as we all
know<00:02:39.239> if<00:02:39.690> we<00:02:39.840> take<00:02:40.019> 11<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.620> subtract<00:02:40.980> five

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
know if we take 11 and subtract five

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.370 
know if we take 11 and subtract five
from<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.610> we<00:02:41.730> get<00:02:41.910> six<00:02:42.180> that's<00:02:42.840> how<00:02:43.170> we'll

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380

did<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.349> subtract<00:02:46.709> five<00:02:46.920> because<00:02:47.340> this<00:02:47.519> is

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
did you subtract five because this is

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.380 
did you subtract five because this is
halo<00:02:47.970> 4<00:02:48.239> which<00:02:48.959> is<00:02:49.140> one<00:02:49.380> less<00:02:49.769> than<00:02:50.010> 5<00:02:50.250> 11<00:02:51.180> less

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
halo 4 which is one less than 5 11 less

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.750 
halo 4 which is one less than 5 11 less
five<00:02:51.660> or<00:02:51.870> six<00:02:52.170> come<00:02:52.650> on<00:02:52.739> seven<00:02:53.190> keep<00:02:53.400> up<00:02:53.579> I

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
five or six come on seven keep up I

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.600 
five or six come on seven keep up I
think<00:02:54.090> my<00:02:54.360> brain<00:02:55.319> just<00:02:55.349> broke<00:02:55.799> of<00:02:56.129> course<00:02:56.190> to

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
think my brain just broke of course to

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.640 
think my brain just broke of course to
calculate<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.060> air<00:02:57.360> we<00:02:57.540> simply<00:02:57.840> multiply<00:02:57.989> 11
