scary<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.140> then<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.500> put<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.890> dark<00:01:26.100> color<00:01:26.400> and

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
scary and then I put the dark color and

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.420 
scary and then I put the dark color and
on<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:28.110> underside<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.770> my<00:01:28.860> cheap<00:01:29.100> ways<00:01:29.130> to

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
on the underside of my cheap ways to

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.010 
on the underside of my cheap ways to
actually<00:01:29.549> create<00:01:30.000> cheap<00:01:30.270> rates<00:01:30.479> if<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.780> feel

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
actually create cheap rates if you feel

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.080 
actually create cheap rates if you feel
you<00:01:31.710> can<00:01:31.860> feel<00:01:32.040> where<00:01:32.280> they<00:01:32.400> are<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.820> want<00:01:33.000> to

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
you can feel where they are you want to

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.030 
you can feel where they are you want to
pop<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.509> underneath<00:01:34.049> your<00:01:34.200> cheekbone<00:01:34.829> there

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
pop it underneath your cheekbone there

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.039 
pop it underneath your cheekbone there
and<00:01:35.280> then<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.820> also<00:01:35.850> pop<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.479> around<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
and then I also pop it around the

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.780 
and then I also pop it around the
outside<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.560> my<00:01:37.710> face<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.159> underneath<00:01:38.579> my

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
outside of my face and underneath my

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.149 
outside of my face and underneath my
chin<00:01:39.000> as<00:01:39.240> well<00:01:39.570> so<00:01:39.960> let's<00:01:40.560> see<00:01:40.680> if<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.829> can<00:01:40.860> show

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
chin as well so let's see if I can show

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.100 
chin as well so let's see if I can show
you<00:01:41.220> how<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.460> do<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.210> might<00:01:42.600> have<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.960> go<00:01:43.079> a

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
you how to do this I might have to go a

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.139 
you how to do this I might have to go a
little<00:01:43.320> bit<00:01:43.500> overboard<00:01:44.040> with<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.460> goddess<00:01:44.850> to

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
little bit overboard with the goddess to

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.740 
little bit overboard with the goddess to
make<00:01:45.360> sure<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.689> they<00:01:45.810> show<00:01:46.049> up<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:47.570> but<00:01:48.570> yeah

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
make sure that they show up and but yeah

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.139 
make sure that they show up and but yeah
it's<00:01:49.049> quite<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.380> simple<00:01:49.710> technique<00:01:50.430> loads<00:01:50.970> of

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
it's quite a simple technique loads of

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.940 
it's quite a simple technique loads of
you'll<00:01:51.479> probably<00:01:51.810> seen<00:01:52.049> online<00:01:52.320> loads<00:01:52.860> of

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
you'll probably seen online loads of

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.770 
you'll probably seen online loads of
people<00:01:53.070> doing<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.970> three<00:01:54.329> shave

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
people doing the the three shave

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.660 
people doing the the three shave
technique<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.500> really<00:01:55.860> works<00:01:56.040> as<00:01:56.250> well<00:01:56.280> and

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
technique that really works as well and

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.600 
technique that really works as well and
but<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.479> just<00:01:57.719> tend<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:57.990> kind<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.469> go<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:58.890> under

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
but I just tend to kind of go in under

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.700 
but I just tend to kind of go in under
the<00:01:59.729> cheekbone<00:02:00.119> first<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.810> then<00:02:01.049> go<00:02:01.079> around

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
the cheekbone first and then go around

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:16.430 
the cheekbone first and then go around
the<00:02:02.490> side<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:03.180> my<00:02:03.270> face

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.600 

you<00:02:17.440> can<00:02:17.590> see<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:17.830> difference<00:02:18.129> that's<00:02:18.340> made

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
you can see the difference that's made

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.400 
you can see the difference that's made
already<00:02:18.879> basically<00:02:19.480> with<00:02:19.780> contouring<00:02:20.260> you

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
already basically with contouring you

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.170 
already basically with contouring you
want<00:02:20.620> to<00:02:20.769> be<00:02:20.920> pushing<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:21.670> bits<00:02:21.849> you<00:02:21.970> don't

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
want to be pushing the bits you don't

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.330 
want to be pushing the bits you don't
want<00:02:22.330> to<00:02:22.420> see<00:02:22.569> back<00:02:23.019> with<00:02:23.440> a<00:02:23.470> dark<00:02:23.799> color<00:02:24.099> and

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
want to see back with a dark color and

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.650 
want to see back with a dark color and
bringing<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.790> bits<00:02:24.940> that<00:02:25.030> you<00:02:25.150> really<00:02:25.480> want

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
bringing the bits that you really want

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.600 
bringing the bits that you really want
to<00:02:25.750> highlight<00:02:25.959> forward<00:02:26.830> with<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.310> lighter

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
to highlight forward with a lighter

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.880 
to highlight forward with a lighter
color<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:28.599> you<00:02:28.690> can<00:02:28.870> automatically<00:02:29.470> see<00:02:29.650> that

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
color and you can automatically see that

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.410 
color and you can automatically see that
this<00:02:29.980> mate<00:02:30.190> this<00:02:30.400> is<00:02:30.459> my<00:02:30.670> face<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.030> little<00:02:31.330> bit

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
this mate this is my face a little bit

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.630 
this mate this is my face a little bit
thinner<00:02:31.720> hooray<00:02:32.290> and<00:02:32.950> it's<00:02:33.069> also<00:02:33.220> really

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
thinner hooray and it's also really

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.270 
thinner hooray and it's also really
helped<00:02:34.000> to<00:02:34.090> define<00:02:34.239> my<00:02:35.049> giant<00:02:35.530> forehead<00:02:35.860> as

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
helped to define my giant forehead as

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.250 
helped to define my giant forehead as
well<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.640> take<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:36.849> little<00:02:37.120> bit<00:02:37.330> of<00:02:37.390> that<00:02:37.660> to

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
well and take a little bit of that to

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.569 
well and take a little bit of that to
the<00:02:38.379> background<00:02:38.530> because<00:02:39.190> there's<00:02:39.340> too<00:02:39.430> much

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
the background because there's too much

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:41.789 
the background because there's too much
of<00:02:39.700> it<00:02:39.760> in<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.000> front<00:02:40.150> anyway<00:02:40.690> so<00:02:41.349> next<00:02:41.530> I'm

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
of it in the front anyway so next I'm

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.619 
of it in the front anyway so next I'm
going<00:02:42.040> to<00:02:42.160> take<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.579> middle<00:02:42.940> shade<00:02:43.239> which

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
going to take the middle shade which

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.270 
going to take the middle shade which
looks<00:02:43.930> like<00:02:43.989> this<00:02:44.110> it's<00:02:44.560> kind<00:02:44.709> of<00:02:44.739> like<00:02:44.860> a<00:02:44.920> clay

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
looks like this it's kind of like a clay

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.949 
looks like this it's kind of like a clay
color<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:45.970> for<00:02:46.180> this<00:02:46.269> one<00:02:46.450> I'm<00:02:46.599> just<00:02:46.810> going<00:02:46.930> to

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
color and for this one I'm just going to

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.530 
color and for this one I'm just going to
be<00:02:47.049> popping<00:02:47.349> this<00:02:47.500> wherever<00:02:48.099> the<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:49.239> Sun

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
be popping this wherever the the Sun

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.630 
be popping this wherever the the Sun
maybe<00:02:49.930> would<00:02:50.319> catch<00:02:50.590> your<00:02:50.829> face<00:02:51.010> if<00:02:51.370> you're<00:02:51.489> on

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
maybe would catch your face if you're on

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.300 
maybe would catch your face if you're on
holiday<00:02:51.760> for<00:02:52.060> example<00:02:52.780> on<00:02:52.930> maybe<00:02:53.860> on<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.160> top

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
holiday for example on maybe on the top

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.100 
holiday for example on maybe on the top
of<00:02:54.430> your<00:02:54.519> forehead<00:02:54.760> just<00:02:55.060> there<00:02:55.299> maybe<00:02:55.720> a<00:02:55.870> tiny

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
of your forehead just there maybe a tiny

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.140 
of your forehead just there maybe a tiny
bit<00:02:56.260> on<00:02:56.470> your<00:02:56.500> nose<00:02:56.769> and<00:02:57.069> a<00:02:57.549> little<00:02:57.970> bit<00:02:58.030> on

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
bit on your nose and a little bit on

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.130 
bit on your nose and a little bit on
your<00:02:58.180> cheeks<00:02:58.480> where<00:02:58.660> brush<00:02:58.870> it<00:02:59.019> would

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
your cheeks where brush it would

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:10.369 
your cheeks where brush it would
normally<00:02:59.440> again

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.110 

okay<00:03:11.379> so<00:03:11.439> I've<00:03:11.799> gone<00:03:11.950> a<00:03:12.010> little<00:03:12.189> bit<00:03:12.459> over<00:03:12.849> the

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
okay so I've gone a little bit over the

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.640 
okay so I've gone a little bit over the
top<00:03:13.150> with<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:13.629> color<00:03:13.810> so<00:03:14.019> you<00:03:14.110> can<00:03:14.260> see<00:03:14.470> it<00:03:14.560> on

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
top with the color so you can see it on

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.710 
top with the color so you can see it on
the<00:03:14.769> camera<00:03:14.799> and<00:03:15.310> but<00:03:15.939> i<00:03:15.970> just<00:03:16.239> want<00:03:16.390> to<00:03:16.450> show

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
the camera and but i just want to show

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.000 
the camera and but i just want to show
you<00:03:16.780> exactly<00:03:17.019> where<00:03:17.470> I'm<00:03:17.650> putting<00:03:17.799> the

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
you exactly where I'm putting the

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.429 
you exactly where I'm putting the
products<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:19.360> then<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:19.659> can<00:03:19.870> just<00:03:20.019> tone<00:03:20.260> them

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:20.439 
products and then you can just tone them

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:21.960 
products and then you can just tone them
down<00:03:20.470> for<00:03:20.860> your<00:03:20.980> skin<00:03:21.189> tone<00:03:21.340> I<00:03:21.519> need<00:03:21.670> to<00:03:21.790> tone

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
down for your skin tone I need to tone

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.610 
down for your skin tone I need to tone
this<00:03:22.090> down<00:03:22.150> a<00:03:22.360> little<00:03:22.510> bit<00:03:22.870> more<00:03:23.109> I<00:03:23.140> think<00:03:23.319> for

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
this down a little bit more I think for

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.559 
this down a little bit more I think for
my<00:03:23.769> skin<00:03:24.430> tone<00:03:24.609> because<00:03:24.700> I'm<00:03:24.879> super<00:03:25.420> super

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
my skin tone because I'm super super

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.420 
my skin tone because I'm super super
pale<00:03:25.870> so<00:03:26.319> just<00:03:26.530> be<00:03:26.620> aware<00:03:26.650> of<00:03:27.010> that<00:03:27.129> if<00:03:27.250> you're

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
pale so just be aware of that if you're

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.030 
pale so just be aware of that if you're
using<00:03:27.810> bronzer<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:28.959> you<00:03:29.079> are<00:03:29.260> as<00:03:29.470> pale<00:03:29.680> as<00:03:29.709> me

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
using bronzer and you are as pale as me

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.770 
using bronzer and you are as pale as me
just<00:03:30.489> use<00:03:30.609> a<00:03:30.640> little<00:03:30.760> bit<00:03:31.030> at<00:03:31.120> first<00:03:31.180> and<00:03:31.659> then

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
just use a little bit at first and then

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.869 
just use a little bit at first and then
sort<00:03:31.989> of<00:03:32.049> build<00:03:32.290> it<00:03:32.439> up<00:03:32.560> and<00:03:32.859> until<00:03:33.549> you<00:03:33.670> get

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 
sort of build it up and until you get

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.369 
sort of build it up and until you get
the<00:03:34.000> shade<00:03:34.239> that<00:03:34.599> you<00:03:34.720> want<00:03:34.900> so<00:03:35.019> it<00:03:35.140> doesn't

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
the shade that you want so it doesn't

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.770 
the shade that you want so it doesn't
look<00:03:35.530> too<00:03:35.920> obvious<00:03:36.489> but<00:03:36.730> hopefully<00:03:37.150> this<00:03:37.599> will

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
look too obvious but hopefully this will

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.030 
look too obvious but hopefully this will
show<00:03:37.930> up<00:03:38.019> on<00:03:38.109> the<00:03:38.200> camera<00:03:38.530> and<00:03:38.709> then<00:03:38.829> you<00:03:38.920> can

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
show up on the camera and then you can

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.740 
show up on the camera and then you can
see<00:03:39.190> exactly<00:03:39.489> where<00:03:39.790> I'm<00:03:39.909> putting<00:03:40.090> each<00:03:40.450> of<00:03:40.629> it

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
see exactly where I'm putting each of it

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.330 
see exactly where I'm putting each of it
so<00:03:41.170> last<00:03:41.379> bit<00:03:41.530> now<00:03:41.650> then<00:03:41.829> and<00:03:42.010> that's<00:03:42.159> the

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
so last bit now then and that's the

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.699 
so last bit now then and that's the
lightest<00:03:42.940> color<00:03:43.120> here<00:03:43.510> and<00:03:43.540> I'm<00:03:43.900> just<00:03:44.139> using<00:03:44.409> a

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
lightest color here and I'm just using a

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.399 
lightest color here and I'm just using a
brush<00:03:45.010> from<00:03:45.819> Ecotools<00:03:46.060> it's<00:03:46.780> like<00:03:47.170> a<00:03:47.200> big

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:47.409 
brush from Ecotools it's like a big

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.720 
brush from Ecotools it's like a big
brush<00:03:48.190> all<00:03:48.430> before<00:03:49.000> I<00:03:49.030> was<00:03:49.420> using<00:03:49.629> the<00:03:49.959> Barry<00:03:50.260> M

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
brush all before I was using the Barry M

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.309 
brush all before I was using the Barry M
buffing<00:03:51.730> brush<00:03:51.939> they're<00:03:52.389> just<00:03:52.840> another<00:03:53.019> kind

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
buffing brush they're just another kind

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:54.509 
buffing brush they're just another kind
of<00:03:53.409> big<00:03:53.590> brushing<00:03:53.920> brush<00:03:54.069> and<00:03:54.189> that<00:03:54.280> was<00:03:54.400> for

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
of big brushing brush and that was for

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:55.830 
of big brushing brush and that was for
the<00:03:54.549> medium<00:03:54.939> color<00:03:55.150> I've<00:03:55.329> got<00:03:55.540> to<00:03:55.659> tell<00:03:55.780> you

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
the medium color I've got to tell you

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.539 
the medium color I've got to tell you
that<00:03:56.019> before<00:03:56.109> so<00:03:56.769> for<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:56.980> light<00:03:57.099> color<00:03:57.340> then

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
that before so for the light color then

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.550 
that before so for the light color then
are<00:03:57.790> you<00:03:58.090> just<00:03:58.329> basically<00:03:58.480> pop<00:03:58.930> this<00:03:59.109> anywhere

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
are you just basically pop this anywhere

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.379 
are you just basically pop this anywhere

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
forward from the face so for me I'm

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.770 
forward from the face so for me I'm
going<00:04:03.519> to<00:04:03.609> pop<00:04:03.730> it<00:04:03.819> on<00:04:03.909> my<00:04:04.030> chin<00:04:04.060> I'm<00:04:04.540> going<00:04:04.689> to

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
in the triangular bits here because I

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.170 
in the triangular bits here because I
the<00:04:09.099> bits<00:04:09.340> that<00:04:09.400> you<00:04:09.519> want<00:04:09.700> to<00:04:09.760> bring<00:04:09.909> forward

the bits that you want to bring forward
their<00:04:10.359> the<00:04:10.510> bits<00:04:10.660> that<00:04:10.720> you<00:04:10.870> want<00:04:11.049> to<00:04:11.079> enhance

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:13.379 
their the bits that you want to enhance
and<00:04:11.709> hopefully<00:04:12.160> by<00:04:12.609> using<00:04:12.819> the<00:04:13.030> right<00:04:13.209> of

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:13.389 
and hopefully by using the right of

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:15.750 
and hopefully by using the right of
color<00:04:13.599> in<00:04:14.410> contrast<00:04:14.889> to<00:04:14.949> the<00:04:15.129> dark<00:04:15.370> ones<00:04:15.639> that

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
color in contrast to the dark ones that

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.159 
color in contrast to the dark ones that
we've<00:04:15.849> already<00:04:15.970> put<00:04:16.209> on<00:04:16.239> there<00:04:16.539> that<00:04:16.720> will

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
we've already put on there that will

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:32.320 
we've already put on there that will
give<00:04:17.320> you<00:04:17.500> the<00:04:17.799> look<00:04:17.919> that<00:04:17.979> you're<00:04:18.400> after

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.740 
so let me go guys that is it three
simple<00:04:35.250> steps<00:04:35.310> do<00:04:35.700> contouring<00:04:36.030> your<00:04:36.300> face<00:04:36.540> as

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
a beginner and as you can see I think

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.400 
a beginner and as you can see I think
it's<00:04:39.030> kind<00:04:39.270> of<00:04:39.390> slim<00:04:39.660> down<00:04:39.840> my<00:04:39.990> face<00:04:40.170> a<00:04:40.200> little

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
it's kind of slim down my face a little

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.470 
it's kind of slim down my face a little
bit<00:04:40.530> and<00:04:40.770> taken<00:04:41.370> the<00:04:41.550> edge<00:04:41.760> off<00:04:42.030> my<00:04:42.090> joint

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
bit and taken the edge off my joint

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.750 
bit and taken the edge off my joint
forehead<00:04:43.140> as<00:04:43.710> well<00:04:43.950> as<00:04:44.100> kind<00:04:44.310> of<00:04:44.430> bringing

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
forehead as well as kind of bringing

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.520 
forehead as well as kind of bringing
everything<00:04:45.000> else<00:04:45.270> forward<00:04:45.720> and<00:04:46.170> I<00:04:46.260> just

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
everything else forward and I just

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.870 
everything else forward and I just
really<00:04:46.740> like<00:04:46.860> the<00:04:47.010> look<00:04:47.130> of<00:04:47.250> a<00:04:47.340> contoured<00:04:47.700> face

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
really like the look of a contoured face

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.610 
really like the look of a contoured face
but<00:04:48.150> to<00:04:48.300> be<00:04:48.390> honest<00:04:48.630> I'm<00:04:48.960> in<00:04:49.200> so<00:04:49.320> much<00:04:49.380> of<00:04:49.500> a

but to be honest I'm in so much of a

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.590 
but to be honest I'm in so much of a
rush<00:04:49.800> from<00:04:49.920> most<00:04:50.130> days<00:04:50.340> I<00:04:50.550> can't<00:04:50.940> sit<00:04:51.570> there

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
rush from most days I can't sit there

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
and I have 50 million products

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.490 
and I have 50 million products
surrounding<00:04:54.240> me<00:04:54.360> to<00:04:54.780> actually<00:04:54.930> try<00:04:55.260> and<00:04:55.290> get

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
surrounding me to actually try and get

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.260 
surrounding me to actually try and get
the<00:04:55.620> look<00:04:55.770> that<00:04:55.800> I<00:04:56.010> want<00:04:56.100> and<00:04:57.060> I<00:04:57.210> don't

unfortunately<00:04:57.870> have<00:04:58.350> the<00:04:58.440> privilege<00:04:58.740> of<00:04:58.890> a

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
unfortunately have the privilege of a

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.920 
unfortunately have the privilege of a
makeup<00:04:59.310> artist<00:04:59.400> like<00:04:59.910> Kim<00:05:00.210> Kardashian<00:05:00.540> does

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
makeup artist like Kim Kardashian does

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.590 
makeup artist like Kim Kardashian does
so<00:05:01.260> I'm<00:05:01.590> afraid<00:05:01.890> the<00:05:02.010> barium<00:05:02.430> contour<00:05:03.090> kit<00:05:03.330> is

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
so I'm afraid the barium contour kit is

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.540 
so I'm afraid the barium contour kit is
just<00:05:03.840> gonna<00:05:03.930> have<00:05:04.200> to<00:05:04.440> do<00:05:04.560> for<00:05:04.830> me<00:05:04.950> but<00:05:05.430> you
