00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
like a dry where you just get like a

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.050 
like a dry where you just get like a
graph<00:03:30.380> on<00:03:30.590> field<00:03:30.920> or<00:03:31.250> a<00:03:31.280> malefic<00:03:31.609> with<00:03:31.850> gates

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
graph on field or a malefic with gates

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.030 
graph on field or a malefic with gates
on<00:03:32.239> field<00:03:32.480> and<00:03:32.780> you<00:03:33.410> don't<00:03:33.560> really<00:03:33.709> draw

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
on field and you don't really draw

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.590 
on field and you don't really draw
through<00:03:34.370> half<00:03:34.519> your<00:03:34.549> deck<00:03:34.880> or<00:03:35.120> more<00:03:35.329> than<00:03:35.480> half

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
through half your deck or more than half

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.569 
through half your deck or more than half
your<00:03:35.630> deck<00:03:35.930> so<00:03:36.140> I<00:03:36.380> kind<00:03:37.310> of<00:03:37.340> one<00:03:37.459> of<00:03:37.519> the

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
your deck so I kind of one of the

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:38.680 
your deck so I kind of one of the
chances<00:03:37.760> me<00:03:37.970> drawing<00:03:38.150> into<00:03:38.329> a<00:03:38.359> school<00:03:38.510> down<00:03:38.630> a

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
chances me drawing into a school down a

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:39.849 
chances me drawing into a school down a
little<00:03:38.780> bit<00:03:38.900> more<00:03:39.049> because<00:03:39.200> Google<00:03:39.620> skilled

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
little bit more because Google skilled

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:40.990 
little bit more because Google skilled
rank<00:03:40.040> can<00:03:40.190> be<00:03:40.280> really<00:03:40.519> really<00:03:40.640> really

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
rank can be really really really

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.080 
rank can be really really really
powerful<00:03:41.269> against<00:03:42.609> inferring<00:03:43.609> these<00:03:43.790> because

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
powerful against inferring these because

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.699 
powerful against inferring these because
game<00:03:44.600> ones<00:03:44.840> they<00:03:45.049> don't<00:03:45.200> really<00:03:45.440> play<00:03:45.650> too

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
game ones they don't really play too

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.560 
game ones they don't really play too

many back row removal so if you can stop

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
many back row removal so if you can stop
there<00:03:47.720> are<00:03:47.840> chain<00:03:48.109> you<00:03:48.200> can<00:03:48.260> south<00:03:48.470> or

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
there are chain you can south or

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.190 
there are chain you can south or
