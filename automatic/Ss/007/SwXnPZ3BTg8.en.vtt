a spread stick butter

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.040 
a spread stick butter
it's<00:00:15.480> definitely<00:00:15.690> richer<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:17.039> more<00:00:17.250> savory

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
it's definitely richer and more savory

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
already been softened you can just put

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.650 
already been softened you can just put
it<00:00:22.890> in<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.130> microwave<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:24.240> know<00:00:24.359> every

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
it in the microwave you know every

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.570

microwave<00:00:25.140> has<00:00:25.289> different<00:00:25.680> wattage<00:00:26.070> so<00:00:26.369> be

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
microwave has different wattage so be

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.359 
microwave has different wattage so be
careful<00:00:27.090> start<00:00:27.750> with<00:00:27.869> them<00:00:28.109> maybe<00:00:28.439> five<00:00:29.160> to

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
careful start with them maybe five to

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.640 
careful start with them maybe five to
ten<00:00:29.609> seconds<00:00:30.090> at<00:00:30.269> first<00:00:30.570> or<00:00:31.109> maybe<00:00:31.289> just<00:00:31.529> go

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
ten seconds at first or maybe just go

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.590 
ten seconds at first or maybe just go
down<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:32.040> medium<00:00:32.399> power<00:00:32.610> if<00:00:33.000> your<00:00:33.270> microwave

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
down to medium power if your microwave

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.200 
down to medium power if your microwave
has<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.079> kind<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.350> capacity<00:00:34.880> just<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.000> soften

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
has that kind of capacity just to soften

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.180 
has that kind of capacity just to soften
up<00:00:36.510> your<00:00:36.540> butter<00:00:39.050> spread<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:40.379> much<00:00:40.440> nicer<00:00:40.980> from

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
up your butter spread so much nicer from

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.160 
up your butter spread so much nicer from
the<00:00:41.309> stick<00:00:41.610> I'm<00:00:42.149> actually<00:00:42.300> chose<00:00:42.719> just<00:00:43.079> a

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
the stick I'm actually chose just a

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.229 
the stick I'm actually chose just a
regular<00:00:43.739> butter<00:00:44.010> that's<00:00:44.370> actually<00:00:44.820> I'm<00:00:45.000> from

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
regular butter that's actually I'm from

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.790 
regular butter that's actually I'm from
Sunnyside<00:00:45.690> Farms<00:00:46.050> it's<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.320> sweet<00:00:46.559> cream

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
Sunnyside Farms it's a sweet cream

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.069 
Sunnyside Farms it's a sweet cream
butter<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.399> why<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.239> use<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.629> sweet<00:00:48.870> cream

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
butter and why I use the sweet cream

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.690 
butter and why I use the sweet cream
butter<00:00:49.110> opposed<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.890> an<00:00:49.980> unsalted

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
butter opposed to an unsalted

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.470 
butter opposed to an unsalted
I<00:00:50.879> think<00:00:51.239> unsalted<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.230> mostly<00:00:52.739> for<00:00:53.640> when

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
I think unsalted is mostly for when

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.630 
I think unsalted is mostly for when
you're<00:00:54.629> baking<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:55.230> would<00:00:55.680> say<00:00:55.920> because<00:00:56.489> there

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
you're baking I would say because there

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.490 
you're baking I would say because there
were<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.789> specific<00:00:57.300> recipe<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.899> calls<00:00:58.050> for<00:00:58.410> it

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
were a specific recipe that calls for it

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.340 
were a specific recipe that calls for it
otherwise<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.250> has<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.430> very<00:00:59.699> bland<00:01:00.059> and

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
otherwise it has a very bland and

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.229 
otherwise it has a very bland and
unflavored<00:01:01.350> full<00:01:01.500> taste<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.820> also<00:01:02.969> have

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
unflavored full taste so I also have

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.120 
unflavored full taste so I also have
some<00:01:03.420> American<00:01:03.989> cheese<00:01:06.619> place<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.770> right<00:01:07.950> in

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
some American cheese place it right in

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.700 
some American cheese place it right in
there<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.659> can<00:01:09.780> also<00:01:09.960> use<00:01:10.229> margarine

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
there and you can also use margarine

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.380 
there and you can also use margarine
again<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.280> like<00:01:11.520> using<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.939> stick<00:01:12.180> butter

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
again but I like using the stick butter

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.390 
again but I like using the stick butter
because<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.780> has<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> much<00:01:13.200> better<00:01:13.409> flavor<00:01:13.770> it's

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
because it has a much better flavor it's

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.499 
because it has a much better flavor it's
actually<00:01:14.939> richer<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.840> texture<00:01:16.290> too<00:01:17.270> so<00:01:18.270> I've

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
actually richer and texture too so I've

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.020 
actually richer and texture too so I've
prepared<00:01:18.869> most<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.650> recipe<00:01:20.159> ready<00:01:20.850> to

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
prepared most of the recipe ready to

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.999 
prepared most of the recipe ready to
take<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.360> over<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.900> cooktop<00:01:22.259> where<00:01:22.799> my
