00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.930
 I could have my doors and only 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.539
 after I started using the products 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.119

 have the same really beautiful ones the way 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.079
 that I've always dreamed 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.260
 only that after I made these videos 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.910
 many girls talk I find these 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.489
 products in my city 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.820
 that makes a video of teaching to do 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.340
 a home-made product that leaves sport and 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.350
 I've been researching people on the internet one 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.660
 product that runs a thing that 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.289
 worked for me and I have been 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.449
 several things and I found 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.289
 finally one thing that got super right 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.270
 I've been testing this for three months and 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.199
 in this period that I am leaving this 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.600
 product 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.810
 I stopped using the cubes will produce a 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.119
 ditch and people is not that the bug gave 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.790
 It 's very easy, the people. 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.430
 you will only need a base that 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.369
 Do you have that one from here in the box? 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.250
 horse in hard stiffening is a base 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.619
 harder friend I've used it alone 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.380
 before the naval overflow and she did not 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.439
 It worked for me, you do not know. 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.420
 alone then after I used the 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.979
 brand products there is that really the 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.740
 stay strong 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.259
 So I took advantage of this as a good base. 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.689
 and merited and mixed with the second 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:47.040
 product that you have within your 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:49.500
 That house is called ayo ayo de cocina 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.079
 Even that air and you make rice 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.520
 and leave your food but only after that 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.100
 I lost a clove of garlic well 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.280
 I bit into small pieces 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.719
 to get inside the bottle of the 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.880
 Enamel and I left this weak here 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:07.890
 rest for 24 hours 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.129
 During this 24-hour period, I 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.300
 stirring so that the garlic and the base 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.670
 would mix 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.890
 and every time I'm going to use it once in the 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.170
 week when I make my nails 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.630
 I'm very well and so it was with the 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.480
 football shaking it up here and base paste 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.930

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.940

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.040
 I'm not using the products of a ditch 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.580

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.019
