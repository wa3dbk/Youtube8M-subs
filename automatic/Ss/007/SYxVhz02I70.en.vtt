00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
anyways the host decided that he wanted

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.760 
anyways the host decided that he wanted
to<00:01:08.909> migrate<00:01:09.330> right<00:01:09.479> here<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:09.900> that's<00:01:10.619> why

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
we skipped a few seconds that's because

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.420

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
slower Newsline machine guns so you

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.660 
slower Newsline machine guns so you
can't<00:02:33.720> run<00:02:33.930> around<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:34.350> just<00:02:34.530> turn<00:02:35.160> on<00:02:35.190> people

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
can't run around and just turn on people

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.550 
can't run around and just turn on people
and<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:36.240> aim<00:02:36.390> down<00:02:36.570> sight<00:02:36.840> time<00:02:37.050> especially

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
and the aim down sight time especially

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.100 
and the aim down sight time especially
since<00:02:38.010> I'm<00:02:38.130> not<00:02:38.220> using<00:02:38.280> sleight<00:02:38.790> of<00:02:38.820> hand<00:02:39.110> it's

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
since I'm not using sleight of hand it's

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.750 
since I'm not using sleight of hand it's
also<00:02:40.620> increased<00:02:41.250> because<00:02:41.340> it's<00:02:41.550> a<00:02:41.610> light

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
also increased because it's a light

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.130 
also increased because it's a light
machine<00:02:42.090> gun<00:02:42.240> but<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.480> takes<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.720> while<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:43.020> aim

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
machine gun but it takes a while to aim

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.350 
machine gun but it takes a while to aim
down<00:02:43.290> sight<00:02:43.650> so<00:02:43.980> it's<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.730> lot<00:02:44.820> harder<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.210> run

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
down sight so it's a lot harder to run

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.060 
down sight so it's a lot harder to run
around<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.600> gun<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:45.930> just<00:02:46.140> like<00:02:46.290> quickly<00:02:46.860> aim

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
around a gun and just like quickly aim

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.590 
around a gun and just like quickly aim
on<00:02:47.310> top<00:02:47.490> of<00:02:47.670> people<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.060> just<00:02:48.150> get<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.360> shot

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
on top of people and just get the shot

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.220 
on top of people and just get the shot
off<00:02:48.630> so<00:02:49.520> it's<00:02:50.520> it's<00:02:50.820> a<00:02:50.970> great<00:02:51.510> idea<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.840> be

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
off so it's it's a great idea to be

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.900 
off so it's it's a great idea to be
defensive<00:02:52.650> with<00:02:52.680> a<00:02:52.980> light<00:02:53.220> machine<00:02:53.550> gun<00:02:53.700> kids

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
defensive with a light machine gun kids

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.670 
defensive with a light machine gun kids
that's<00:02:54.210> actually<00:02:54.990> how<00:02:55.080> light<00:02:55.260> machine<00:02:55.530> guns

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
that's actually how light machine guns

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.930 
that's actually how light machine guns
are<00:02:55.770> supposed<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.070> be<00:02:56.160> played<00:02:56.400> there<00:02:56.700> I

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
the m60 because there's a contract

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
n 60 so i was like what a what a great

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.160 
n 60 so i was like what a what a great
idea<00:04:01.560> contract<00:04:02.250> i<00:04:02.370> will<00:04:03.330> accept<00:04:03.840> that<00:04:03.990> offer

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
idea contract i will accept that offer

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.860 
idea contract i will accept that offer
and<00:04:04.620> take<00:04:04.770> that<00:04:04.920> as<00:04:05.070> a<00:04:05.100> challenge<00:04:05.660> so<00:04:06.660> yeah

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
and take that as a challenge so yeah

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.810 
and take that as a challenge so yeah
that's<00:04:07.200> basically<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.980> only<00:04:08.220> reason<00:04:08.640> i<00:04:08.700> was

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
that's basically the only reason i was

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.900 
that's basically the only reason i was
using<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.150> m60<00:04:10.220> there<00:04:11.220> really<00:04:11.550> wasn't<00:04:11.790> a

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
using the m60 there really wasn't a

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.360 
using the m60 there really wasn't a
reason<00:04:12.060> besides<00:04:12.450> that<00:04:12.690> it's<00:04:12.930> it<00:04:13.739> seems<00:04:14.280> like

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
reason besides that it's it seems like

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.430 
reason besides that it's it seems like
it's<00:04:14.610> a<00:04:14.730> lot<00:04:14.910> more<00:04:14.940> effective<00:04:15.480> to<00:04:15.510> i<00:04:15.720> use<00:04:16.140> just

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
it's a lot more effective to i use just

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.330 
it's a lot more effective to i use just
a<00:04:16.650> famas<00:04:17.190> because<00:04:18.080> famosos<00:04:19.080> are<00:04:19.470> kind<00:04:20.280> of

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
a famas because famosos are kind of

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.360 
a famas because famosos are kind of
overpowered<00:04:20.970> and<00:04:21.150> em<00:04:21.780> 60s<00:04:22.260> are<00:04:22.500> not<00:04:22.740> so

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
overpowered and em 60s are not so

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.280 
overpowered and em 60s are not so
overpowered<00:04:24.060> it<00:04:24.180> has<00:04:24.330> kind<00:04:24.600> of<00:04:24.690> a<00:04:24.780> slow<00:04:25.020> fire

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
overpowered it has kind of a slow fire

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.740 
overpowered it has kind of a slow fire
rate<00:04:25.350> and

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
rate and

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.750 
rate and
it's<00:04:27.750> recalls<00:04:28.139> kind<00:04:28.440> of<00:04:28.530> a<00:04:28.740> lot<00:04:29.130> compared<00:04:29.669> to

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
it's recalls kind of a lot compared to

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.840 
it's recalls kind of a lot compared to
the<00:04:29.850> famas<00:04:30.830> it<00:04:31.830> seems<00:04:32.040> like<00:04:32.220> with<00:04:32.460> a<00:04:32.490> gun<00:04:32.820> that

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
the famas it seems like with a gun that

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.850 
the famas it seems like with a gun that
sighs<00:04:33.510> I<00:04:33.780> think<00:04:33.990> in<00:04:34.050> real<00:04:34.200> life<00:04:34.410> guns<00:04:34.680> like

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
sighs I think in real life guns like

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.140 
sighs I think in real life guns like
that<00:04:35.010> really<00:04:35.250> don't<00:04:35.310> have<00:04:35.490> that<00:04:35.550> much<00:04:35.760> recoil

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
that really don't have that much recoil

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.000 
that really don't have that much recoil
because<00:04:36.300> they're<00:04:36.540> so<00:04:36.720> heavy<00:04:36.930> and<00:04:37.169> just<00:04:37.380> when

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
because they're so heavy and just when

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.159 
because they're so heavy and just when
it<00:04:38.130> shoots<00:04:38.340> it<00:04:38.550> doesn't<00:04:38.820> move<00:04:38.940> at<00:04:39.120> all<00:04:39.210> but

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
it shoots it doesn't move at all but

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:41.120 
it shoots it doesn't move at all but
we're<00:04:40.260> not<00:04:40.350> going<00:04:40.500> to<00:04:40.560> talk<00:04:40.650> about<00:04:40.770> real<00:04:40.980> life

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
we're not going to talk about real life

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.700 
we're not going to talk about real life
this<00:04:41.340> is<00:04:41.550> obviously<00:04:41.700> gameplay<00:04:42.570> and<00:04:42.810> made<00:04:43.560> for

this is obviously gameplay and made for

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.470 
this is obviously gameplay and made for
balance<00:04:44.100> reasons<00:04:44.490> but<00:04:44.880> having<00:04:45.120> two<00:04:45.270> hundred

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
balance reasons but having two hundred

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.379 
balance reasons but having two hundred
bullets<00:04:45.600> and<00:04:45.990> a<00:04:46.110> magazine<00:04:47.010> is<00:04:47.389> definitely
