going to demonstrate to these of core

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.120 
going to demonstrate to these of core
principles<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:24.990> so<00:00:25.410> it's<00:00:25.890> going<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.070> look

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
principles of it so it's going to look

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.490 
principles of it so it's going to look
quite<00:00:26.460> ugly<00:00:26.900> okay<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:27.960> what<00:00:28.230> we're<00:00:28.320> going<00:00:28.410> to

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
quite ugly okay so what we're going to

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.099 
quite ugly okay so what we're going to
be<00:00:28.529> creating<00:00:28.710> are<00:00:29.220> these<00:00:29.429> three<00:00:29.760> pages<00:00:30.109> use

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
be creating are these three pages use

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.709 
be creating are these three pages use
the<00:00:31.260> list<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:32.219> list<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.579> users<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.329> at<00:00:33.630> the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
the list is a list of users so at the

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.690 
the list is a list of users so at the
moment<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.230> database<00:00:34.649> contains<00:00:35.070> two<00:00:35.309> users

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
moment the database contains two users

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.360 
moment the database contains two users
and<00:00:35.940> these<00:00:36.329> are<00:00:36.510> these<00:00:37.170> two<00:00:37.350> users<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.100> then

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
and these are these two users and then

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.060 
and these are these two users and then
when<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.700> click<00:00:38.879> on<00:00:38.969> one<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.270> these<00:00:39.420> users<00:00:40.070> get

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
when you click on one of these users get

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.000 
when you click on one of these users get
redirected<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.760> their<00:00:41.969> profile<00:00:42.780> page<00:00:43.079> profile

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
redirected to their profile page profile

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.819 
redirected to their profile page profile
dot<00:00:44.160> PHP<00:00:44.309> serves<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.149> up<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.320> just<00:00:46.500> tells

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
dot PHP serves that up and it just tells

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.069 
dot PHP serves that up and it just tells
you<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.980> bit<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.160> information<00:00:47.340> about<00:00:47.670> them<00:00:48.079> as

you<00:00:49.230> can<00:00:49.320> see<00:00:49.500> here<00:00:50.449> so<00:00:51.449> if<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.600> just<00:00:51.690> go<00:00:51.809> back

and click on me see there is like

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.380 
and click on me see there is like
different<00:00:56.309> information<00:00:56.489> basically<00:00:56.940> using

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
different information basically using

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.299 
different information basically using
the<00:00:57.449> same<00:00:57.629> template<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.230> probably<00:00:59.070> should<00:00:59.280> have

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
the same template I probably should have

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.010 
the same template I probably should have
designed<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.789> little<00:00:59.910> bit<00:01:00.090> nicer<00:01:00.210> but<00:01:00.719> just

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
designed it a little bit nicer but just

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.060 
designed it a little bit nicer but just
for<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.230> we're<00:01:01.440> going<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.590> be<00:01:01.680> leaving<00:01:01.800> it

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
for this we're going to be leaving it

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:09.530 
for this we're going to be leaving it
using<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:02.969> horrible<00:01:03.480> sort<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:05.900> old<00:01:06.900> style<00:01:08.540> so

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
using that horrible sort of old style so

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.020 
using that horrible sort of old style so
yeah<00:01:09.659> that's<00:01:09.780> pretty<00:01:09.960> much<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.560> really<00:01:11.030> there

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
yeah that's pretty much it really there

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.780 
yeah that's pretty much it really there
is<00:01:12.119> also<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.450> edit<00:01:13.320> page<00:01:13.640> which<00:01:14.640> I've<00:01:14.760> just

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
is also a edit page which I've just

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.429 
is also a edit page which I've just
included<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.630> show<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.869> how<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.110> can<00:01:16.200> edit

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
included to show you how you can edit

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.420 
included to show you how you can edit
profile<00:01:17.220> information<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:18.299> for<00:01:18.450> example<00:01:18.479> if

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
profile information so for example if

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.920 
profile information so for example if
you<00:01:20.430> go<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.909> get<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.180> page<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.780> it

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
you go to it you get this page and it

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.590 
you go to it you get this page and it
shows<00:01:22.140> your<00:01:22.530> information<00:01:23.250> here<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.420> can't

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
shows your information here so you can't

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.080 
shows your information here so you can't
access<00:01:24.780> any<00:01:25.049> one<00:01:25.170> else's<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.610> sort

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
access any one else's and this is sort

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.760 
access any one else's and this is sort
of<00:01:27.180> determined<00:01:27.689> what<00:01:27.930> appears<00:01:28.259> on<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.560> page

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
of determined what appears on this page

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.149 
of determined what appears on this page
by<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:30.390> user<00:01:31.020> ID<00:01:31.259> which<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.770> stored<00:01:31.979> in<00:01:32.100> a

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
by the user ID which is stored in a

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.640 
by the user ID which is stored in a
session<00:01:32.450> so<00:01:33.450> obviously<00:01:33.689> when<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:34.049> or<00:01:34.380> use

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
session so obviously when you or use

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.980 
session so obviously when you or use
this<00:01:34.799> with<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.979> login<00:01:35.310> system<00:01:35.540> just<00:01:36.540> at<00:01:36.720> login

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
this with a login system just at login

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.050 
this with a login system just at login
you<00:01:37.380> just<00:01:37.530> need<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.740> store<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.189> user<00:01:38.490> ID<00:01:38.700> in

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
you just need to store the user ID in

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.690 
you just need to store the user ID in
the<00:01:39.299> session<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:40.290> it's<00:01:40.470> fairly<00:01:40.650> simple<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.400> I

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
the session so it's fairly simple and I

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.190 
the session so it's fairly simple and I
think<00:01:41.880> we<00:01:41.939> did<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.450> my<00:01:42.570> login<00:01:42.869> series

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
think we did that in my login series

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.870 
think we did that in my login series
anyway<00:01:43.530> if<00:01:43.740> not<00:01:44.009> then<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.430> just<00:01:44.549> need<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.759> add

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
anyway if not then you just need to add

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.950 
anyway if not then you just need to add
it<00:01:45.030> not<00:01:45.450> very<00:01:45.479> difficult<00:01:47.659> so<00:01:48.659> that's<00:01:48.810> pretty

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
it not very difficult so that's pretty

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.899 
it not very difficult so that's pretty
much<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.470> for<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.070> we're<00:01:50.430> just<00:01:50.549> we're
