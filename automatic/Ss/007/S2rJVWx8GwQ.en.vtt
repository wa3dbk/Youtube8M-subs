00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.970
 a little workout how i play 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.360
 this is dna 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.980
 shorter head can kill 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:25.890
 some noobs below even here typical 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.070
 opponent special so the trip you see 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.980
 lower right so what about 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.530
 lag mentality can this question 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:40.140
 don't even ask because things right away 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:42.270
 yes fuck lag yet like and know 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.469
 more like it did not kill okay it happens 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.870
 lets you happen does not fly literally 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.660
 a couple of minutes for the guys that such 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.199
 benefits more heavy denied test not 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.530
 playable believe in CFF in general in the cross 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:03.690
 I need at least a hundred of fps but I have a hundred 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.880
 There is work not fucking boat and not seen 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.000
 yourself on your computer 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:14.970
 like that yes so it probably should video 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.520
 will be a little sorry to podlagivaet husband 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.390
 They were close well, in general, I decided 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.520
 just shoot 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.650
 Yes, I myself am trying to play 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.200
 pistols although there is a weapon here 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.080
 collage all things but must sing this 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.030
 a brothel from tobacco to this what if you can 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.030
 go generally yes played out on 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.130
 a pistol seems to me that if you 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.979
 played on a gun then you can both 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.270
 would weigh all weapons practically 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.350
 yes and especially the first round and 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.770
 pistol round they are very important 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.500
 believe is much more important than round if 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.970
 you will play v. 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.549
 because the pistol round if you 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.210
 try you then strengthen 2 rounds a 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.370
 then go through but in general 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:04.460
 train gun guys 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:06.530
 advice so well and especially since the list 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.220
 you can give on the go they are such an amateur 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.970
 to run 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.960
 friskyly that I can even 100 it is impossible 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.810
 check 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.420
 click on 0 3 servers where no 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.700
 radar there is no tab download you 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.640
 not upset well I can assure you 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.600
 that one to one go for sure it even with 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.810
 a gun against some server 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.470
 probably cool if you killed a tipati 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.040
 custody 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.320
 patrons turned for should on no 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:41.020
 one to one, this almost more well something 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:44.440
 customers and skin types and loved to roll off 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:47.990
 till play one minute there already and water 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.460
 so I hope everything is fine with me 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.950
 600 resolution by 600 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:55.730
 all on Nevsky well, of course not 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:59.720
 understands if trimmed and 30 fps records 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.430
 60 sometimes less accounted for 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.760
 donate for now on me don't care how I 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.530
 would be 800 by 600 by 600 used in my opinion 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.170
 very well except a little bit 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:13.430
 more to be and detail but to 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:16.270
 it was more clearly visible and all as well as me personally 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:21.200
 I'm satisfied with the signal when this 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:23.350
 800 by 600 so nothing new and vkf 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.959
 also 800 800 played 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.239
 by the way about the gun goes a lot 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.320
 dispute which singing is better with what was 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.380
 better play on 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.700
 I don’t know exactly by her claim it’s definitely for 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.160
 Glock still possible so 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.850
 shoot plus a cool grid by 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:44.480
 my not really though of course flies but 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:48.560
 This is with good fps probably when you have 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:52.910
 everything smoothly does not twitch hard in 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.930
 overall on this all friends thanks yaya 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.930
 further welcome
