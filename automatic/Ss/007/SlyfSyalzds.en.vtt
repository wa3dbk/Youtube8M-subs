00:03:52.340 --> 00:04:01.680
 good there were some small problems 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:04.650
 to the intro so also in the mashal blur 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:09.630
 has good and the styles also his 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:19.890
 scenes with didier really have that it's 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:24.450
 of hip hop and good luck is to have 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:27.180
 to mada yes there were gestures 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:31.260
 extremely violent that went with the 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:33.780
 heavy starting beat that i have bonded 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.150
 it was in principle even at the 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:40.760
 rick ross hall at the american rapper 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:42.540
 I understand the gestures were good and 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.370
 abandoned there has been a change of 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:48.060
 beats I was sensitive to that too a 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:50.910
 beat more festive the bit more festive 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.460
 you made movements of this kind and 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.790
 you also at one time it was 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:05:01.710
 welcoming at the same time it's a 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:04.200
 other night the elite so has our 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.419
 more desires to share this night in 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.610
 this sense where the ges should in the 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:11.040
 second part be less in the 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.479
 rhythm than what the beat of the first 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.580
 part I think it's my opinion 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.419
 now the artist is better by 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.020
 relation to his music 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.490
 otherwise there is also the history of the micro g 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.139
 I found that not only for you 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.520
 for what they were before the story 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:24.319
 of the microphone that was often in a hand 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.599
 you're right-handed or kill left and in 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:28.610
 same time that you keep the same 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:30.770
 pace in terms of cadences or 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:34.940
 body movements from beginning to end 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:36.560
 from first base to second base and that's 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.060
 presence on stage and she's good at 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.560
 manage the space well but it could 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:46.879
 to be further improved to make it more 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:50.270
 con more optimal in fact bravo on ad 

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:52.970
 tech in the hand of giza where charles 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:06:02.530

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:23.000
 level of the other the quiche anti that 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:26.120
 did not go so much but other than that 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.479
 rhythmically it's going to give you well 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.610
 on stage and it's also good to do 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:34.560
 participate the public I think it's 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.880
 good to do it quite often 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.199
