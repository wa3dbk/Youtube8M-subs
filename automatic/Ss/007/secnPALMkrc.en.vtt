one quick point I wanted to make out and
I<00:00:38.989> I<00:00:39.910> noticed<00:00:41.140> more<00:00:42.140> so<00:00:42.440> when<00:00:42.770> I<00:00:42.800> started<00:00:43.070> doing

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
I I noticed more so when I started doing

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.750 
I I noticed more so when I started doing
the<00:00:43.670> YouTube<00:00:43.850> lessons<00:00:44.510> that<00:00:45.230> uh<00:00:45.760> because

the YouTube lessons that uh because

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.610

sometimes<00:00:47.090> I'm<00:00:47.270> looking<00:00:47.720> at<00:00:47.840> live<00:00:48.020> versions

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.100 
sometimes I'm looking at live versions
and<00:00:48.980> I<00:00:49.940> try<00:00:50.150> to<00:00:50.210> go<00:00:50.360> to<00:00:50.420> the<00:00:50.570> studio<00:00:50.870> version

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
and I try to go to the studio version

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.650 
and I try to go to the studio version
though<00:00:51.440> to<00:00:51.500> give<00:00:51.739> you<00:00:51.830> the<00:00:51.920> original<00:00:52.660> actually

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
though to give you the original actually

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.970 
though to give you the original actually
that<00:00:53.750> is<00:00:53.870> what<00:00:53.989> I<00:00:54.020> do<00:00:54.140> but<00:00:54.470> occasionally<00:00:54.830> I'll

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
that is what I do but occasionally I'll

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.350 
that is what I do but occasionally I'll
come<00:00:55.129> across<00:00:55.370> the<00:00:55.489> live<00:00:55.670> and<00:00:55.970> I'll<00:00:56.030> check<00:00:56.210> it

come across the live and I'll check it
out<00:00:56.420> and<00:00:56.600> I<00:00:56.629> noticed<00:00:57.019> and<00:00:57.800> I<00:00:57.890> know<00:00:57.949> why<00:00:58.220> they<00:00:58.400> do

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
out and I noticed and I know why they do

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.810 
out and I noticed and I know why they do
this<00:00:58.729> they'll<00:00:59.269> change<00:00:59.479> the<00:00:59.720> keys<00:01:00.489> the<00:01:01.489> tuning

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
this they'll change the keys the tuning

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.170 
this they'll change the keys the tuning
I<00:01:01.909> mean<00:01:02.089> so<00:01:02.710> the<00:01:03.710> reason<00:01:04.089> just<00:01:05.089> some

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
I mean so the reason just some

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.460 
I mean so the reason just some
information<00:01:05.600> I<00:01:05.690> want<00:01:05.840> to<00:01:05.900> throw<00:01:06.050> out<00:01:06.140> there<00:01:06.320> at

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
information I want to throw out there at

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.270 
information I want to throw out there at
you<00:01:06.590> like<00:01:07.220> for<00:01:07.820> example<00:01:08.210> in<00:01:08.900> 2001<00:01:09.530> which<00:01:10.130> I

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
you like for example in 2001 which I

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.910 
you like for example in 2001 which I
just<00:01:10.729> scanned<00:01:11.180> it<00:01:11.299> on<00:01:11.390> YouTube<00:01:11.750> and<00:01:11.960> in

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
just scanned it on YouTube and in

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.410 
just scanned it on YouTube and in
listened<00:01:15.340> they<00:01:16.340> tuned<00:01:16.580> down<00:01:16.700> pat<00:01:17.299> benatar

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
listened they tuned down pat benatar

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.450 
historical er needle drawl to turn tuned
down<00:01:19.940> a<00:01:20.000> half<00:01:20.150> step<00:01:20.450> and<00:01:20.870> what<00:01:21.560> happens<00:01:21.920> is<00:01:22.130> the

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
down a half step and what happens is the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.010 
down a half step and what happens is the
most<00:01:22.820> most<00:01:23.240> the<00:01:23.390> time<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:23.659> reason<00:01:23.930> that's

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
most most the time the reason that's

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.100 
most most the time the reason that's
going<00:01:24.320> on<00:01:24.409> is<00:01:24.560> for<00:01:24.710> the<00:01:24.830> singer<00:01:25.990> they've<00:01:26.990> been

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
going on is for the singer they've been

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.480 
going on is for the singer they've been
doing<00:01:27.350> they've<00:01:27.680> been<00:01:27.770> singing<00:01:27.979> a<00:01:28.070> long<00:01:28.220> time

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
doing they've been singing a long time

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.220 
doing they've been singing a long time
and<00:01:28.820> it<00:01:28.910> saves<00:01:29.150> their<00:01:29.660> voice<00:01:29.870> a<00:01:30.020> little<00:01:30.080> bit

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
and it saves their voice a little bit

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.660 
and it saves their voice a little bit
from<00:01:30.440> having<00:01:30.680> to<00:01:30.740> sing<00:01:30.920> as<00:01:31.070> high<00:01:31.100> so<00:01:31.490> if<00:01:31.580> the

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
from having to sing as high so if the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:32.980 
from having to sing as high so if the
guitar<00:01:31.940> player<00:01:32.090> tunes<00:01:32.360> down<00:01:32.600> and<00:01:32.840> plays

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
guitar player tunes down and plays

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.200 
guitar player tunes down and plays
everything<00:01:33.350> in<00:01:33.440> the<00:01:33.530> same<00:01:33.680> spot<00:01:34.010> the<00:01:34.880> singer

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
everything in the same spot the singer

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.880 
everything in the same spot the singer
doesn't<00:01:35.390> have<00:01:35.570> to<00:01:35.690> sing<00:01:35.870> quite<00:01:36.170> as<00:01:36.380> high<00:01:36.560> they

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
doesn't have to sing quite as high they

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.770 
doesn't have to sing quite as high they
could<00:01:36.950> sing<00:01:37.160> a<00:01:37.250> half<00:01:37.430> step<00:01:37.670> lower<00:01:37.700> and<00:01:38.240> I

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
could sing a half step lower and I

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.610 
could sing a half step lower and I
notice<00:01:39.050> that's<00:01:39.230> what's<00:01:39.410> going<00:01:39.680> on<00:01:41.620> most

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
notice that's what's going on most

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.050 
notice that's what's going on most
people<00:01:42.980> would<00:01:43.100> do<00:01:43.190> that<00:01:43.340> I<00:01:43.370> doubt<00:01:43.520> if<00:01:43.820> Steve

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
people would do that I doubt if Steve

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.120 
people would do that I doubt if Steve
Perry<00:01:44.360> would<00:01:44.600> he's<00:01:45.200> kind<00:01:45.440> of<00:01:45.500> an<00:01:45.620> exception

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
Perry would he's kind of an exception

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.830 
Perry would he's kind of an exception
journey<00:01:46.550> because<00:01:46.790> he<00:01:46.970> just<00:01:47.180> got<00:01:47.240> a<00:01:47.390> super<00:01:47.720> high

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
journey because he just got a super high

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.380 
journey because he just got a super high
voice<00:01:48.110> and<00:01:48.350> a<00:01:48.440> big<00:01:48.650> range<00:01:48.860> but<00:01:49.370> Pat<00:01:49.910> Benatar<00:01:50.300> is

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
voice and a big range but Pat Benatar is

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.390 
voice and a big range but Pat Benatar is
an<00:01:50.480> amazing<00:01:51.050> singer<00:01:51.320> but<00:01:52.010> it<00:01:52.100> just<00:01:52.220> goes<00:01:52.340> to

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
an amazing singer but it just goes to

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.190 
an amazing singer but it just goes to
show<00:01:52.730> you<00:01:52.790> for<00:01:53.390> whatever<00:01:53.540> reason<00:01:54.050> but<00:01:54.140> I

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
show you for whatever reason but I

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.190 
show you for whatever reason but I
guarantee<00:01:54.410> you<00:01:54.800> it<00:01:54.950> had<00:01:55.100> to<00:01:55.250> do<00:01:55.430> with<00:01:56.200> vocals

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
guarantee you it had to do with vocals

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.660 
guarantee you it had to do with vocals
and<00:01:57.380> hitting<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.710> notes<00:01:57.920> or<00:01:58.190> maybe<00:01:58.220> you<00:01:58.580> know

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
and hitting the notes or maybe you know

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.220 
and hitting the notes or maybe you know
you're<00:01:58.820> doing<00:01:58.940> a<00:01:59.150> hour<00:01:59.480> and<00:01:59.600> a<00:01:59.690> half<00:01:59.840> two<00:02:00.050> hour

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
you're doing a hour and a half two hour

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.440 
you're doing a hour and a half two hour
concert<00:02:00.770> maybe<00:02:01.460> if<00:02:01.820> you<00:02:01.940> were<00:02:02.030> doing<00:02:02.150> it<00:02:02.300> at

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
concert maybe if you were doing it at

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
concert maybe if you were doing it at
the<00:02:02.510> beginning<00:02:02.600> of<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:02.990> standard<00:02:03.290> would<00:02:03.380> be

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
the beginning of the standard would be

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.200 
the beginning of the standard would be
fine<00:02:03.680> but<00:02:03.830> at<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.040> end<00:02:04.070> if<00:02:04.520> it's<00:02:04.670> a<00:02:04.760> song<00:02:04.970> with

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
fine but at the end if it's a song with

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.380
