00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.370
 many kids and welcome to a new 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.740
 half more today we are here in a 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.410
 tutorial what you are going but many of how 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.190
 open the ports of play 4 and up and 3 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.379
 and good how to basically do not at 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.600
 movistar router without the portal 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:21.080
 moving away directly with the address 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.980
 ip that is usually always 122,200 the 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.750
 done 1.1 and as you can see here it highlights 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.060
 that this web page is not available 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:33.050
 not because insufficient that puts error of 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.940
 ssl file version permach same not worth 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.250
 then I will explain what happens 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.870
 not for you to have to access by a 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.890
 site that we report Alejandra as in 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.390
 this case that you have to do here 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.219
 you have very limited options not in 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.670
 the configuration that you can not open the 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:51.230
 mz ports worth to access 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.079
 as you can see here you jump this error of 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.210
 What happens is that the router 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:00.350
 router firmware has a version of 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.090
 ssl pretty old no thing that was very 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.370
 vulnerable in some web pages and 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.750
 browsers like google chrome and mozilla 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.810
 firefox 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.040
 they have blocked us have withdrawn if 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.020
 ssl 3.0 services so I do not know 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.229
 can do or is backpacking or from 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.240
 google chrome we have to go to the internet 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.400
 explorer is worth trying these 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.250
 problems and you also put us 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.119
 the error will skip but there is a solution 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.090
 ok can not be shown by the ssl 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.800
 vouchers to critics can be displayed 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.470
 it's worth the solution is that we have to 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.570
 go to the tools that is here 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.120
 up is ok we give options to 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.010
 Internet 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:48.120
 now here we would go to advanced options 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:52.950
 we will go down all the way 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:55.080
 and enable the ssl 3.0 will be of 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.140
 selected and you mark it you give to 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.990
 apply and accept once this is done 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.000
 we put the ip address again and do not 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.340
 skips this error does not exists 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.600
 This website's security tells you that 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.820
 It can be unsafe because it's a 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.950
 old certificate and so we are here 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.900
 go this the website not recommended no 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.700
 nothing will happen since it is a place 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.740
 vulnerable because it's a security 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.870
 but of course vulnerable are local to 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.390
 there is no risk to the team 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.460
 to these action is worth a router 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.630
 Once done, we are already here although you have 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.560
 to put the router password that 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.940
 by default be 1234 but to jose you have 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.260
 modified from the portal alejandra 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.120
 then you have to change me instead 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.510
 he has not modified it then I'm going to 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.900
 put 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.459
 and the is then start up inside 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.900
 of the telephone rite then already 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.299
 set up 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.540
 the model here the router that comes out a 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:48.099
 model while you are 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.260
 this is the old man I do not know if you can 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.610
 update I think that's not why you have to 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.079
 do this to be able to do the router to 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.430
 through the ip address the 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.540
 basic configuration that you can 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.200
 find the ports if you want to know 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.189
 others but I 'm going to this and what 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.459
 you know 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:08.250
 language in Spanish the conformation of the 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:10.390
 port and other modify what you want 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.530
 open the plateau ports of the 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.250
 playstation vale 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:19.430
 now let's go to playstation 4 that 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.200
 I have here ready to put you for 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.959
 assign an ip address 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.379
 fixed so we can open all the 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:31.379
 ports with the ports of plateau is worth 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:33.959
 we're going to adjustments in our 43 we're going to 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:35.150
 network settings we are going to configure 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.769
 Internet connection 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.700
 I in case I have it connected by cable 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.739
 but by wifi 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.920
 it's the same then we're going to connect 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.989
 By cable we give customized 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.739
 we come to the manual and here I for example 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:52.500
 I have the same movistar dns because 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:55.049
 you can put that you want the ip system 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.470
 that you want a fixed I have put to the 4 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:02.010
 clueless and they are 4 the subnet mask is 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.510
 it has to be stable because if not the 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.000
 router but of normal it will be this one so 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.459
 put is the default gateway is 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.870
 that is the address of the router and the 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.700
 primary dns of the secondary that these 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.900
 are from movistar, then you owe to the 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:17.609
 next this automatic do not use the 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.100
 next and we would give you to try 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:23.720
 connections to him we can of the going towards 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:26.510
 back which we have already put the 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.090
 the ip that we wanted to give in the fixed ep 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.850
 therefore now we can return 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.950
 here to the computer and we would give 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.190
 advanced configuration now remove to 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.680
 a warning sign that this is a 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.910
 more advanced confirmation and more 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.540
 then we are going to apply and we 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.940
 will load this web what now here we will have 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.920
 what to go 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.550
 network setting 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.550
 more 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:59.320
 Now we wait for him to charge a little 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:01.960
 and here we give mz voucher for these are 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.780
 the plateau ports and now here the 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.479
 will put or guano voice or image or not and 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.789
 you have to essential internet and put the 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:11.860
 ip that you exposed to playstation 3 or 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:14.229
 to playstation 4 what I've done to 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.630
 have it as I have the two consoles what 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:18.880
 what I have done has been to put the same ip to 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.520
 the playstation 4 of the pri station 3 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.720
 There is a pro that is that I will not have to 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.490
 change this every time you started the 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.030
 console or the other to have the ports 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.340
 open that is what 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.740
 well always have them open and there is a 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.090
 against what is that if I have the movie 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.160
 turned on I can not have the track it 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.080
 teaches connected to the internet therefore 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.200
 is where you can hoist one of the two to the 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.210
 time that is what is good as it does not 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:48.660
 I think you 're playing the same thing 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:50.700
 the time but this has been all when 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.150
 you just put the ip address you should 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.430
 apply loading 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.410
 and a failure to restart the router with 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.090
 to restart the console you will have the 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:02.600
 Open goal for you to see the test 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:04.249
 I'm going to go to the official channel farc so that 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.629
 you see 

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:08.289
 I hope you have not configured me 

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:12.309
 now what 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:13.659
 but fuck now that I have put it I hope 

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:15.430
 that I have not configured the one that 

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:19.740
 will apply if you do not have to restart 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.740
 the movie 4 and will return 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:26.220
 restart the application in a 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:29.660
 territory but nothing would happen yes 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:32.350
 that we go to the X and we would enter 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.090
 newton 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.650
 then with the plateau ports more 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:39.409
 false that there will be more ports of the 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:42.369
 playstation 3 playstation 4 

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:42.369
 let's put like 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.100
 this I always have to have a 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.330
 work as a military director a little 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.800
 of the movie 4 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:57.199
 and as you can see we have open 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.340
 I hope we are the one in the video I hope 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:02.310
 that it has resolved all 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:04.560
 doubts that you had and other 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.270
 I used to not subscribe for games and so on 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.430
 of example 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.810
 guys but they have served any 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.950
 doubt in the comments 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.950
 until next time
