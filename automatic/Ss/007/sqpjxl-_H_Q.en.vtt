00:00:01.379 --> 00:00:04.770
 reuters how do you feel on the human level we already have too many 

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:06.400
 late 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.680
 I feel good 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.939
 but until now I arrived Monday a month 

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:14.169
 from north america not going far enough 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:17.099
 the outstandings under the facade very very hot here before it was still necessary 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:19.070
 all accustomed to the ccpl 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.909
 francis gillot 6% in america 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:23.720
 now rebounds 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.310
 everything goes well a small dot just behind the last 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.359
 weeks but still 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.160
 I will try to do well here and especially paid entry orange has 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:32.830
 the most important is 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.270
 I think especially the next day when nothing players who would all have the cm2 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.630
 not necessarily happy 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.100
 recently brushed 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.040
 he is light 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.240
 the opening I'm the flag bearer so for me it's something 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.390
 it's a bit of a sweet dream that finally comes true 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.640
 it's a great week so far in the age jubile is turning out well 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.640
 remains worrying 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.160
 listed on the road segment to forget it had a difficult start 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.160
 against nadal no because the goal 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.310
 a victory and a difficult defeat is barbarism and the other nights 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.800
 living with hiv 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.030
 Anne Geddes but I played the drama well 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.830
 we do not take it with the belief that I can play well and lose 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.960
 France fought back 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.480
 they played well on the circuit 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.390
 braafheid I had a little trouble the last few weeks I lost some 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.580
 matches that we should not lose is a little it has happened to me a few 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.560
 time already this session for the first time in his associative life 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.690
 wrong next door 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.170
 on the other side I still have a good level of play needed 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.130
 christophe saclet hope for them 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.170
 once what makes the match turn was called running water points not 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.940
 favor and trust mint 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.690
 that it was possible again and that is why 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.330
 q as very confident 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.640
 it's a special approach with the musel pikes it's a child's dream 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.640
 to realize because someone can my different state of mind 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.820
 for a sales increase this dream for me because in this sector 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.350
 like every year 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.119
 miller and tennis still had little to do with games games 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.119
 vancouver olympics after course to mark event 32 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.790
 see the gold medal cited as simple create also in less than I do 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.560
 for the Olympics 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.590
 but I still have good but already thinking about the work for flags to 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.699
 windows the players for a gold medal 

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:13.349
 now that I'm here and I like it for theme that I I'm involved 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:14.149
 with its 

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:16.739
 it's still something phenomenal enough 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.569
 these immense couple who organized it is absent it is magnificent and if we 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.019
 see everywhere on all the pictures 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.389
 for organizations with five advanced points 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:27.399
 very special thing 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:29.389
 wireless loans of the Olympic spirit 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:32.389
 because precisely here is the opportunity to find the pleasure of the game 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.980
 do not see how it's going to be like that for me over 60 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.920
 vote is suffocating in 16 it's not going to france that i want that i chase that 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.200
 I wish fortunately for the Olympic games c corresponding rises the 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.349
 opportunity to participate in games because before that amateurs 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:49.399
 less than three months 

00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:52.319
 its harness front for us is for me something that holds me 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.399
 also why at heart 

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:58.359
 aam we do not attach to the villages in Savoy on one side it hurts because 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:02:59.839
 that three years of absence and 

00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:03.039
 % with the whole team that is worth every day all the time in May 

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:06.939
 jean village lodging is just impossible for me so like that I 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:07.689
 a little 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:09.259
 with over 

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:12.979
 the two sakho techno frames end about the same if I want to go 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:15.859
 to the village assad several times if I want 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:17.259
 it's the ferment 

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:20.369
 but bringing on a% focus model on the Tour de France 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:22.749
 wealth management 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:25.279
 he falsified the robot 

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:27.539
 still is it the gold medal 

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:29.149
 here we are 

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:33.329
 libertine a percent match after the withdrawal at the stop because that 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:33.669
 made
