00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
wowhead or something like that and there

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.029 
wowhead or something like that and there
was<00:00:46.289> not<00:00:46.500> really<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.770> lot<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.890> information

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
was not really a lot of information

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.610 
was not really a lot of information
about<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:49.079> know<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.230> figured<00:00:49.559> I

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
about it and so you know I figured I

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.979 
about it and so you know I figured I
might<00:00:49.649> show<00:00:50.340> everybody<00:00:50.670> what<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.750> so

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
might show everybody what that is and so

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.920 
might show everybody what that is and so
anyway<00:00:52.350> um<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:53.039> terms<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.510> know<00:00:54.600> going

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
anyway um in terms of the you know going

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.830
