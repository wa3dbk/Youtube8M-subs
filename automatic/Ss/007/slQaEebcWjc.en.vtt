00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
walking animation to add the realism so

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.370

you can hunt over 15 types of animals
which<00:02:36.709> is<00:02:36.890> pretty<00:02:37.100> cool<00:02:37.370> we<00:02:37.640> saw<00:02:38.140> you<00:02:39.140> know<00:02:39.520> all

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
which is pretty cool we saw you know all

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.480 
which is pretty cool we saw you know all
kinds<00:02:41.060> of<00:02:41.360> stuff<00:02:41.959> in<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.620> trailers<00:02:43.040> as<00:02:43.220> well

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
kinds of stuff in the trailers as well

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.600 
kinds of stuff in the trailers as well
and<00:02:43.790> if<00:02:44.420> you<00:02:44.600> see<00:02:44.890> like<00:02:45.890> a<00:02:45.920> screen<00:02:46.400> with

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
and if you see like a screen with

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.310 
and if you see like a screen with
Bigfoot<00:02:47.180> on<00:02:47.330> it<00:02:47.480> don't<00:02:47.630> believe<00:02:47.959> it<00:02:48.170> is

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
Bigfoot on it don't believe it is

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.130 
Bigfoot on it don't believe it is
Photoshop<00:02:48.980> and<00:02:49.250> pretty<00:02:49.550> bad<00:02:49.850> done<00:02:50.180> too<00:02:50.780> but

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
Photoshop and pretty bad done too but

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.790 
Photoshop and pretty bad done too but
yeah<00:02:51.890> and<00:02:52.220> a<00:02:52.850> softy<00:02:53.330> movement<00:02:53.930> of<00:02:54.140> the

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
yeah and a softy movement of the

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.040 
yeah and a softy movement of the
protagonist<00:02:55.370> it's<00:02:56.000> pretty<00:02:56.209> cool<00:02:56.480> really<00:02:56.840> and

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
protagonist it's pretty cool really and

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.199 
protagonist it's pretty cool really and
actually<00:02:57.590> also<00:02:58.190> makes<00:02:58.700> a<00:02:58.850> lot<00:02:59.000> of<00:02:59.030> sense

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
actually also makes a lot of sense

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.400 
actually also makes a lot of sense
because<00:02:59.840> if<00:03:00.019> Franklin<00:03:00.709> walks<00:03:01.519> like<00:03:01.820> a<00:03:01.850> Trevor

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
because if Franklin walks like a Trevor

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.740 
because if Franklin walks like a Trevor
and<00:03:03.410> you<00:03:04.220> know<00:03:04.370> a<00:03:04.610> Trevor<00:03:05.030> walks<00:03:05.420> like<00:03:05.720> a

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
and you know a Trevor walks like a

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.080 
and you know a Trevor walks like a
Michael<00:03:06.170> it's<00:03:06.590> kind<00:03:07.070> of<00:03:07.130> odd<00:03:07.340> so<00:03:07.730> it's<00:03:07.910> pretty

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
Michael it's kind of odd so it's pretty

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.920 
Michael it's kind of odd so it's pretty
cool<00:03:08.360> I<00:03:08.600> mean<00:03:09.170> Michael<00:03:10.040> as<00:03:10.390> what<00:03:11.390> how<00:03:11.720> old

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
cool I mean Michael as what how old

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.449 
cool I mean Michael as what how old
would<00:03:12.080> it<00:03:12.230> be<00:03:12.320> I<00:03:12.350> think<00:03:12.590> we're<00:03:13.010> going<00:03:13.190> to<00:03:13.280> say

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
would it be I think we're going to say

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.430 
would it be I think we're going to say
that<00:03:13.640> he's<00:03:13.790> at<00:03:14.030> least<00:03:14.180> 40<00:03:14.660> years<00:03:14.840> old<00:03:15.080> I<00:03:15.260> mean

Trevor to travel to a location using jet

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.839 
Trevor to travel to a location using jet
skis<00:03:53.450> so<00:03:54.440> that's<00:03:54.799> probably<00:03:55.069> something<00:03:55.459> we've

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
skis so that's probably something we've

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.940 
skis so that's probably something we've
already<00:03:56.090> seen<00:03:56.629> in<00:03:57.549> you<00:03:58.549> know<00:03:58.730> in<00:03:59.409> a<00:04:00.409> trailer<00:04:00.799> or

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
already seen in you know in a trailer or

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.670 
already seen in you know in a trailer or
a<00:04:01.099> screenshot<00:04:01.519> I<00:04:02.030> think<00:04:02.660> you<00:04:03.200> remember<00:04:03.590> the

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
a screenshot I think you remember the

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.550 
a screenshot I think you remember the
screenshot<00:04:04.310> where<00:04:04.519> Trevor<00:04:04.819> put<00:04:05.780> pulls<00:04:06.319> out

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
screenshot where Trevor put pulls out

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.640 
screenshot where Trevor put pulls out
the<00:04:06.890> nosey<00:04:07.730> on<00:04:07.879> a<00:04:07.910> jet<00:04:08.239> ski<00:04:08.269> I<00:04:08.750> think<00:04:09.349> that<00:04:09.530> this

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
the nosey on a jet ski I think that this

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.369 
the nosey on a jet ski I think that this
the<00:04:09.859> mission<00:04:10.120> so<00:04:11.120> once<00:04:11.420> again<00:04:11.660> they<00:04:12.109> base

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:12.379 
the mission so once again they base

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:16.240 
the mission so once again they base
around<00:04:13.120> three<00:04:14.120> or<00:04:14.150> four<00:04:14.599> missions<00:04:15.140> all<00:04:15.859> the

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
around three or four missions all the

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.129 
around three or four missions all the
screens<00:04:16.609> and<00:04:16.820> trailers<00:04:17.269> and<00:04:17.479> information

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
screens and trailers and information

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:19.779 
screens and trailers and information
they're<00:04:18.350> giving<00:04:18.680> out<00:04:18.799> which<00:04:19.310> is<00:04:19.340> of<00:04:19.760> course

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
they're giving out which is of course

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:22.330 
they're giving out which is of course
pretty<00:04:20.720> cool<00:04:20.959> so<00:04:21.289> we<00:04:21.440> don't<00:04:21.650> get<00:04:21.799> spoiled<00:04:22.280> a

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
pretty cool so we don't get spoiled a

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.379 
pretty cool so we don't get spoiled a
lot<00:04:23.199> yeah<00:04:24.199> I<00:04:24.440> think<00:04:24.560> that<00:04:25.370> is<00:04:25.520> pretty<00:04:26.090> much<00:04:26.330> it

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389
