00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.100
 a 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.720
 a home and cafÃ© business and 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.299
 cafeteria 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:14.529
 when the cow rings and and the customers 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:18.580
 so they are in the pub 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:20.789
 yes they go to work then I go in 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.580
 my one since I am an only child 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:30.839
 I then go to study in and around it 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:30.839
 house to fly we have or they play 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.540
 that were goh when I was six especially the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.230
 dogs and chickens that yes yes the girls 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.370
 the peace and the pluses your guests yes nice 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.910
 to get through the day 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.920
 in her horse farms 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.909
 training I did an internship in 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.070
 all kinds of branches and yes including the 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:59.190
 look like sports shop I actually thought that 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.649
 it easily as commercial off 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.300
 need to have one and actually that was 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.030
 not as easy as me at all 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.270
 it thoughts and yes we came back then 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.369
 sometimes one to hide behind the de 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.710
 or behind the shawls 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.110
 attributes that are in the shopping cart 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.500
 to not actually help you that customer 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.030
 and hoping that the staff of mine 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.030
 internship company that would help the customer 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.630
 I had contact with internship company and there 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.750
 so gave up like you should have good 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.369
 and then I came to ohra 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.409
 the first must be the quran tour 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.890
 I also kept the intercom behind that 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:42.180
 that it was n't going well and cold at that time 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.840
 we talked and I think on it 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.009
 an item came with a light 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:52.100
 this actually had to do with the past 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:54.170
 because I actually go into the plants 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.840
 the pub with us who actually had it 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.289
 I sometimes feel like my parents 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.289
 stolen 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:09.440
 that has been a one point at which i 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:11.649
 actually not as cheerful as with 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.649
 myself 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.650
 then I actually started looking and 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.170
 another internship that less 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.930
 being confronting with customers 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.540
 to me and that's how I am right 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.160
 come to a pet shop 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.590
 at some point I am one step ahead 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.690
 help the plants 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.540
 I have more confidence in that 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.610
 gained in customers and also trust 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.709
 in myself that I could do it 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.079
 and then I actually chose to 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.730
 to take on a challenge 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.410
 then I went to an internship in 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.280
 went to America 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:48.040
 that is you are not a tribe 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.530
 I am in my rush through horse breeding 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.900
 increasingly self-assured and I dare 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.700
 more and more for the puddles my opinion 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.190
 testing 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.260
 I started teaching our school I do 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.340
 have given information or scholarships and 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:07.200
 I persuaded old ones to have their child 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.200
 or keep the father from doing driving training 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.140
 This training has brought me where I am 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.140
 am sweet but i will still jump many 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.660
 to become a teacher 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.480
 I would like to be a teacher who 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.230
 can pass on the knowledge about horses to 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.630
 The students 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.880
 but also help the students in that 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.450
 have been in the same situation as that 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.450
 I've been sitting
