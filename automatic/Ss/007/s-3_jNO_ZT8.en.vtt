00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:12.000
 ok what we have to do now 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.000
 is to open another page 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.380
 which is 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.659
 afp that point of voice and dotcom of a 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.399

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.840
 the page now here between us 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.180
 then they would practically stay like that 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.300
 in the regular I do not know about the 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.240

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:43.310
 what you have to do is copy the 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.310
 direction of the game 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.969
 in this case it is an instagram application 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.969
 we copy it 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.970
 and we go to this page and here where 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.580
 He says 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:01.600
 so that neymar google play wii 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.600
 let's paste 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.539
 So then what we do is 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.490

 and then we give it save and it starts 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.210
 download the application 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.840

 and we paste it in this part 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.750
 let's see 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.730
 the links 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.860
 where 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.910

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.120
 if the application will be and we can use 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.650
 I hope that 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.290
 they have served mainly one of 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:38.720
 the advantages of this is that 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.580
 the rural page has more games 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.280

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.690
