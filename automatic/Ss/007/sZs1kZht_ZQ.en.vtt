hi<00:00:07.980> my<00:00:08.370> name<00:00:08.580> is<00:00:08.610> Matt<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.360> I'm<00:00:09.510> going<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.929> talk

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
hi my name is Matt and I'm going to talk

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.990 
hi my name is Matt and I'm going to talk
to<00:00:10.380> you<00:00:10.679> today<00:00:10.889> about<00:00:11.870> metabolic<00:00:12.870> typing

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 
to you today about metabolic typing

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.410 
to you today about metabolic typing
metabolic<00:00:15.000> typing<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:15.809> concept<00:00:16.590> that

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
metabolic typing is a concept that

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.070 
metabolic typing is a concept that
enables<00:00:18.420> us<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:19.010> customize<00:00:20.010> our<00:00:20.930> diets<00:00:21.930> and

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
enables us to customize our diets and

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.570 
enables us to customize our diets and
our<00:00:22.199> nutrition<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:23.310> our<00:00:23.550> bodies<00:00:25.070> it's<00:00:26.070> based

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
our nutrition to our bodies it's based

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.720 
our nutrition to our bodies it's based
on<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:26.970> idea<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:28.130> none<00:00:29.130> of<00:00:29.160> us<00:00:29.400> are<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.699> same

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
on the idea that none of us are the same

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.810 
on the idea that none of us are the same
and<00:00:30.410> so<00:00:31.410> just<00:00:31.710> like<00:00:31.859> we're<00:00:32.399> all<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:32.790> different

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
and so just like we're all so different

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.049 
and so just like we're all so different
on<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.630> outside<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:34.260> how<00:00:35.070> we<00:00:35.130> activate

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
on the outside and how we activate

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.569 
on the outside and how we activate
differently<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.950> we're<00:00:37.950> also<00:00:38.040> very<00:00:38.460> very

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
differently and we're also very very

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.720 
differently and we're also very very
different<00:00:39.180> on<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.420> inside<00:00:39.920> so<00:00:40.920> for<00:00:41.700> example

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
different on the inside so for example

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.260 
different on the inside so for example
we<00:00:42.270> have<00:00:42.780> very<00:00:43.230> different<00:00:43.489> varying<00:00:44.489> sizes<00:00:44.789> of

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
we have very different varying sizes of

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.310 
we have very different varying sizes of
organs<00:00:46.670> we<00:00:47.670> have<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:47.969> different<00:00:48.660> levels<00:00:49.140> of

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
organs we have a different levels of

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.290 
organs we have a different levels of
hormones<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.980> enzymes<00:00:50.070> which<00:00:50.610> can<00:00:50.940> fluctuate

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
hormones and enzymes which can fluctuate

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.720 
hormones and enzymes which can fluctuate
up<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:52.079> several<00:00:52.350> thousand<00:00:53.100> percent<00:00:53.460> in

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
up to several thousand percent in

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.540 
up to several thousand percent in
variation<00:00:55.550> we<00:00:56.550> also<00:00:56.899> have<00:00:57.899> different<00:00:58.680> states

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
variation we also have different states

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.819 
variation we also have different states
of<00:00:59.699> health<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.329> function<00:01:00.840> within<00:01:01.109> our<00:01:01.260> organs

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
of health and function within our organs

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.490 
of health and function within our organs
within<00:01:02.219> our<00:01:02.370> glands<00:01:02.699> within<00:01:03.210> our<00:01:03.510> cells<00:01:04.080> of

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
within our glands within our cells of

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.920 
within our glands within our cells of
the<00:01:04.650> body<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.670> all<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.030> these<00:01:06.180> things<00:01:06.240> really

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
the body and all of these things really

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.649 
the body and all of these things really
make<00:01:07.350> us<00:01:07.560> all<00:01:07.770> very<00:01:07.830> different<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.360> unique

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
make us all very different and unique

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.460 
make us all very different and unique
and<00:01:10.880> an<00:01:11.880> internal<00:01:12.600> level<00:01:14.030> so<00:01:15.030> what<00:01:15.900> we<00:01:16.049> find

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
and an internal level so what we find

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.780 
and an internal level so what we find
that<00:01:17.040> because<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:17.850> these<00:01:18.380> differences<00:01:19.380> and

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
that because of these differences and

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.570 
that because of these differences and
that<00:01:20.790> no<00:01:21.000> two<00:01:21.060> people<00:01:21.659> are<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.810> same<00:01:21.930> and

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
that no two people are the same and

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.340 
that no two people are the same and
therefore<00:01:23.580> our<00:01:23.880> nutritional<00:01:24.600> requirements

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
therefore our nutritional requirements

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.140 
therefore our nutritional requirements
are<00:01:25.439> also<00:01:25.619> very<00:01:26.130> different<00:01:27.590> so<00:01:29.150> metabolic

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
are also very different so metabolic

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.830 
are also very different so metabolic
typing<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.960> really<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.470> nutritional<00:01:32.220> science

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
typing is really a nutritional science

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.310 
typing is really a nutritional science
that<00:01:33.840> really<00:01:34.200> enables<00:01:34.799> us<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:36.320> understand

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
that really enables us to understand

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.950 
that really enables us to understand
these<00:01:37.590> differences<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:39.979> and<00:01:41.960> customize

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
these differences and to and customize

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.149 
these differences and to and customize
our<00:01:43.729> nutrition<00:01:44.729> our<00:01:44.970> diets<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:46.439> our<00:01:46.649> metabolic

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
our nutrition our diets to our metabolic

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.780 
our nutrition our diets to our metabolic
makeup<00:01:47.930> and<00:01:48.930> what<00:01:49.140> I'll<00:01:49.320> metabolic<00:01:50.009> makeup<00:01:50.460> is

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
makeup and what I'll metabolic makeup is

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.330 
makeup and what I'll metabolic makeup is
what<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.149> mean<00:01:51.450> by<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:52.079> simply<00:01:53.009> our

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
what I mean by that is simply our

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.060 
what I mean by that is simply our
physiology<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.509> biochemistry<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.890> body

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
physiology and biochemistry of the body

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.270 
physiology and biochemistry of the body
or<00:01:56.490> another<00:01:57.180> way<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.509> looking<00:01:57.719> at<00:01:58.170> what<00:01:58.950> what

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
or another way of looking at what what

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.149 
or another way of looking at what what
I'm<00:01:59.399> afraid<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.969> hear<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.630> just<00:02:01.439> really<00:02:01.829> up

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
I'm afraid to hear is just really up

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.870 
I'm afraid to hear is just really up
sells<00:02:02.520> or<00:02:02.909> organs<00:02:03.450> or<00:02:03.719> glands<00:02:04.530> are<00:02:04.710> systems<00:02:05.670> of

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
sells or organs or glands are systems of

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.300 
sells or organs or glands are systems of
the<00:02:05.969> body<00:02:06.000> this<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:07.140> basically<00:02:08.009> what<00:02:08.190> I'm

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
the body this is basically what I'm

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.229 
the body this is basically what I'm
referring<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.700> when<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:08.940> talk<00:02:09.209> about

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
referring to when I talk about

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.640 
referring to when I talk about
metabolism<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:10.349> or<00:02:10.649> metabolic<00:02:11.160> makeup<00:02:12.349> so<00:02:13.349> the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
metabolism of or metabolic makeup so the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.710 
metabolism of or metabolic makeup so the
concept<00:02:14.129> of<00:02:14.250> metabolic<00:02:14.849> typing<00:02:15.239> isn't

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
concept of metabolic typing isn't

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.100 
concept of metabolic typing isn't
actually<00:02:16.550> new<00:02:17.550> or<00:02:17.819> certainly<00:02:18.239> the<00:02:18.390> idea<00:02:18.810> of

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
actually new or certainly the idea of

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.170 
actually new or certainly the idea of
individualized<00:02:19.980> nutrition<00:02:20.580> isn't<00:02:20.910> anything

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
individualized nutrition isn't anything

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.570 
individualized nutrition isn't anything

Australia<00:02:43.290> would<00:02:44.069> have<00:02:44.220> lived<00:02:44.459> in<00:02:44.840> the

Australia would have lived in the

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.020 
Australia would have lived in the
northern<00:02:46.140> European<00:02:46.769> heritage<00:02:46.980> would<00:02:47.940> have

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
northern European heritage would have

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.790 
northern European heritage would have
lived<00:02:48.269> in<00:02:48.450> an<00:02:48.599> environment<00:02:48.900> that<00:02:49.349> would<00:02:49.620> be

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
lived in an environment that would be

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.449 
lived in an environment that would be
very<00:02:50.010> much<00:02:51.140> call<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.319> cooler<00:02:52.860> temperatures

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
very much call it cooler temperatures

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.570 
very much call it cooler temperatures
and<00:02:54.560> for<00:02:55.560> that<00:02:55.680> reason<00:02:56.120> plan<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.360> vegetation

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
and for that reason plan and vegetation

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.170 
and for that reason plan and vegetation
would<00:02:59.580> not<00:02:59.790> have<00:02:59.940> been<00:03:00.180> so<00:03:00.989> abundant<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:02.180> we

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
would not have been so abundant and we

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.750 
would not have been so abundant and we
would<00:03:03.330> have<00:03:03.450> survived<00:03:03.900> on<00:03:04.230> diets<00:03:05.099> much<00:03:05.400> higher

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
would have survived on diets much higher

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.759 
would have survived on diets much higher
in<00:03:05.790> animal<00:03:06.659> sources<00:03:07.019> of<00:03:07.909> food<00:03:08.909> and<00:03:09.650> what<00:03:10.650> we

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
in animal sources of food and what we

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.479 
in animal sources of food and what we
can<00:03:10.800> say<00:03:11.099> from<00:03:11.250> that<00:03:11.459> then<00:03:11.700> is<00:03:11.940> that<00:03:12.950> our<00:03:13.950> diets

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
can say from that then is that our diets

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.309 
can say from that then is that our diets
would<00:03:14.730> have<00:03:14.849> been<00:03:15.060> much<00:03:15.209> higher<00:03:15.269> in<00:03:15.780> fat<00:03:16.019> and

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
would have been much higher in fat and

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.250 
would have been much higher in fat and
protein<00:03:16.909> but<00:03:17.909> in<00:03:18.120> contrast<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:18.840> other

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
protein but in contrast to other

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.320 
protein but in contrast to other
populations<00:03:20.129> that<00:03:20.340> may<00:03:20.519> have<00:03:20.640> been<00:03:20.819> around<00:03:21.150> at

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
populations that may have been around at

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.790 
populations that may have been around at
the<00:03:21.420> time<00:03:21.659> that<00:03:21.989> lived<00:03:22.200> much<00:03:22.349> near<00:03:22.620> the

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
the time that lived much near the

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.100 
the time that lived much near the
equator<00:03:23.099> where<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.330> climate<00:03:24.659> would<00:03:24.989> have

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
equator where the climate would have

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.600 
equator where the climate would have
been<00:03:25.230> much<00:03:25.379> warmer<00:03:25.890> we<00:03:26.099> would<00:03:26.250> have<00:03:26.370> found

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
been much warmer we would have found

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.259 
been much warmer we would have found
that<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:29.280> diets<00:03:29.670> would<00:03:29.909> have<00:03:30.000> been<00:03:30.120> much

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
that the diets would have been much

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.430 
that the diets would have been much
higher<00:03:30.330> and<00:03:30.930> plan<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.769> vegetation<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:33.440> also

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
higher and plan and vegetation and also

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.530 
higher and plan and vegetation and also
for<00:03:35.129> that<00:03:35.280> reason<00:03:35.489> much<00:03:36.239> higher<00:03:36.510> in

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
for that reason much higher in

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.500 
for that reason much higher in
carbohydrates<00:03:37.519> so<00:03:38.519> that<00:03:39.000> really

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
carbohydrates so that really

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.640 
carbohydrates so that really
demonstrates<00:03:40.220> the<00:03:41.220> huge<00:03:42.000> variation<00:03:42.780> has

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
demonstrates the huge variation has

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.940 
demonstrates the huge variation has
always<00:03:44.040> existed<00:03:44.340> and<00:03:45.230> within<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.500> human<00:03:46.650> race

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
always existed and within the human race

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.500 
always existed and within the human race
in<00:03:47.159> terms<00:03:47.430> of<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:48.480> food<00:03:48.720> that<00:03:48.870> we'd<00:03:49.019> eaten<00:03:49.200> and

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
in terms of the food that we'd eaten and

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.420 
in terms of the food that we'd eaten and
and<00:03:51.510> then<00:03:52.379> you<00:03:52.500> know<00:03:52.620> this<00:03:52.890> isn't<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.370> only

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
and then you know this isn't the only

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.880 
and then you know this isn't the only
factor<00:03:53.640> that<00:03:54.060> really<00:03:54.450> again

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
factor that really again

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.980 
factor that really again
fluence<00:03:55.340> what<00:03:56.090> foods<00:03:56.390> are<00:03:56.540> right<00:03:56.720> for<00:03:56.960> us

this day going to have a big factor our

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.690 
this day going to have a big factor our
whole<00:04:08.000> psychology<00:04:08.450> or<00:04:08.959> as<00:04:09.140> a<00:04:09.170> real<00:04:10.069> big<00:04:10.310> factor

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
whole psychology or as a real big factor

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.020 
whole psychology or as a real big factor
on<00:04:10.910> our<00:04:11.090> in<00:04:11.330> internal<00:04:12.140> environment<00:04:13.030> and

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
on our in internal environment and

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.599 
on our in internal environment and
obviously<00:04:14.480> there<00:04:14.690> for<00:04:14.720> our<00:04:15.170> nutrition<00:04:15.770> and

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
obviously there for our nutrition and

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.030 
obviously there for our nutrition and
all<00:04:16.820> our<00:04:16.940> nutritional<00:04:17.570> requirements<00:04:18.260> so

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
all our nutritional requirements so

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.740 
all our nutritional requirements so
another<00:04:19.430> way<00:04:19.669> of<00:04:19.700> looking<00:04:19.850> at<00:04:20.150> this<00:04:20.329> as<00:04:20.540> well

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
another way of looking at this as well

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.590 
another way of looking at this as well
is<00:04:21.079> actually<00:04:21.980> if<00:04:22.850> we<00:04:23.000> look<00:04:23.180> at<00:04:23.300> all<00:04:23.480> the

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
is actually if we look at all the

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.980 
is actually if we look at all the
different<00:04:23.720> diets<00:04:24.320> around<00:04:24.919> today<00:04:25.450> we<00:04:26.450> can<00:04:26.690> see

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
different diets around today we can see

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.740 
different diets around today we can see
that<00:04:27.350> there's<00:04:27.940> everything<00:04:28.940> from<00:04:29.120> the<00:04:29.390> Atkins

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
that there's everything from the Atkins

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.020 
that there's everything from the Atkins
diet<00:04:29.840> which<00:04:30.290> is<00:04:30.320> very<00:04:30.710> high<00:04:30.980> in<00:04:31.340> fats<00:04:31.700> and

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
diet which is very high in fats and

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.870 
diet which is very high in fats and
proteins<00:04:32.480> to<00:04:33.230> other<00:04:33.740> types<00:04:34.220> of<00:04:34.370> diets<00:04:34.610> are

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
proteins to other types of diets are

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.460 
proteins to other types of diets are
much<00:04:35.120> lower<00:04:35.480> in<00:04:35.840> fat<00:04:36.080> and<00:04:36.880> you<00:04:37.880> these<00:04:38.330> so<00:04:38.750> diets

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
much lower in fat and you these so diets

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.590 
much lower in fat and you these so diets
going<00:04:39.650> to<00:04:39.710> be<00:04:39.800> specific<00:04:40.340> to<00:04:40.390> weight<00:04:41.390> loss

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
going to be specific to weight loss

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.690 
going to be specific to weight loss
obviously<00:04:42.560> there's<00:04:42.770> lots<00:04:42.980> of<00:04:43.100> other<00:04:43.190> types<00:04:43.520> of

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
obviously there's lots of other types of

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.330 
obviously there's lots of other types of
diets<00:04:43.880> out<00:04:44.120> there<00:04:44.180> too<00:04:44.540> but<00:04:45.230> what<00:04:45.860> you'll<00:04:46.100> find

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
diets out there too but what you'll find

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.070 
diets out there too but what you'll find
is<00:04:46.640> that<00:04:46.669> there<00:04:47.090> be<00:04:47.210> some<00:04:47.450> people<00:04:47.870> that

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
is that there be some people that

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.770 
is that there be some people that
experience<00:04:48.680> success<00:04:48.890> losing<00:04:49.640> weight<00:04:49.850> when

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
experience success losing weight when

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.930 
experience success losing weight when
they<00:04:50.930> consume<00:04:51.500> a<00:04:51.650> high-fat<00:04:52.220> diet<00:04:52.520> and<00:04:52.730> some

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
they consume a high-fat diet and some

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.520 
they consume a high-fat diet and some
people<00:04:53.300> when<00:04:53.510> they<00:04:53.630> consume<00:04:54.050> a<00:04:54.140> low-fat<00:04:54.470> diet

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
people when they consume a low-fat diet

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.830 
people when they consume a low-fat diet
and<00:04:55.010> this<00:04:55.100> is<00:04:55.250> just<00:04:55.460> another<00:04:56.950> another<00:04:57.950> example

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
and this is just another another example

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.360 
and this is just another another example
at<00:04:59.840> the<00:04:59.900> huge<00:05:00.410> diversity<00:05:00.740> that<00:05:01.430> exists<00:05:03.070> so<00:05:04.070> for

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
at the huge diversity that exists so for

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.770 
at the huge diversity that exists so for
new<00:05:05.080> again<00:05:06.080> you<00:05:06.560> know<00:05:06.970> tells<00:05:07.970> us<00:05:08.240> just<00:05:08.600> how

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
new again you know tells us just how

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.230 
new again you know tells us just how
different<00:05:09.290> we<00:05:09.410> all<00:05:09.440> are<00:05:09.800> if<00:05:10.490> you<00:05:10.700> can<00:05:10.910> relate

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
different we all are if you can relate

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.580 
different we all are if you can relate
to<00:05:11.300> what<00:05:11.660> we've<00:05:12.140> talked<00:05:12.680> about<00:05:12.830> so<00:05:13.190> far<00:05:13.250> and

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
to what we've talked about so far and

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.960 
to what we've talked about so far and
interest<00:05:15.590> in<00:05:15.710> running<00:05:15.860> a<00:05:16.130> bit<00:05:16.280> more<00:05:16.430> about<00:05:16.490> it

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
interest in running a bit more about it

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.120 
interest in running a bit more about it
I'm<00:05:17.540> actually<00:05:17.780> going<00:05:18.110> to<00:05:18.229> be<00:05:18.260> holding<00:05:18.650> a

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
I'm actually going to be holding a

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.260 
I'm actually going to be holding a
teleseminar<00:05:20.000> fairly<00:05:20.720> soon<00:05:20.990> on<00:05:21.760> in<00:05:22.760> which<00:05:23.030> I'll

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
teleseminar fairly soon on in which I'll

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.780 
teleseminar fairly soon on in which I'll
cover<00:05:23.300> much<00:05:23.990> of<00:05:24.020> this<00:05:24.680> subject<00:05:25.220> a<00:05:25.400> lot<00:05:25.550> more

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.570 
cover much of this subject a lot more
about<00:05:25.910> metabolic<00:05:26.390> typing<00:05:26.870> what<00:05:27.680> it<00:05:27.800> is<00:05:28.010> the

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
about metabolic typing what it is the

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.850 
about metabolic typing what it is the
science<00:05:29.000> behind<00:05:29.150> it<00:05:29.570> how<00:05:29.900> it<00:05:30.020> can<00:05:30.169> benefit<00:05:30.620> you

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
science behind it how it can benefit you

science behind it how it can benefit you
and<00:05:31.070> also<00:05:31.580> really<00:05:32.240> you<00:05:32.660> how<00:05:33.050> you<00:05:33.110> can<00:05:33.380> identify

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
and also really you how you can identify

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.080 
and also really you how you can identify
using<00:05:35.360> this<00:05:35.479> this<00:05:35.900> technology<00:05:36.820> what<00:05:37.820> what

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
using this this technology what what

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.920 
using this this technology what what
foods<00:05:38.419> are<00:05:38.630> like<00:05:38.930> for<00:05:39.260> you<00:05:39.440> so<00:05:40.250> it<00:05:41.120> i'll<00:05:41.720> also

look lots of other factors which can

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:46.750 
look lots of other factors which can
have<00:05:44.690> a<00:05:44.720> big<00:05:45.020> impact<00:05:45.050> on<00:05:45.680> the<00:05:45.800> foods<00:05:46.100> really

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
have a big impact on the foods really

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.360
