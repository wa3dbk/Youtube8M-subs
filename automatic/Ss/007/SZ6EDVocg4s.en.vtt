00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
difference

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.830 
difference
then<00:02:05.220> from<00:02:05.430> there<00:02:05.670> I've<00:02:05.970> gone<00:02:06.210> right<00:02:06.480> up<00:02:06.510> to

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
then from there I've gone right up to

then from there I've gone right up to
the<00:02:06.960> five<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:08.610> mean<00:02:09.119> sometimes<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:10.050> get<00:02:10.170> a

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
the five and I mean sometimes you get a

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.720 
the five and I mean sometimes you get a
little<00:02:10.500> zinger<00:02:10.800> here<00:02:11.039> or<00:02:11.130> there<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.310> think<00:02:11.640> if

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730
