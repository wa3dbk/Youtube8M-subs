00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.779 
fine without taking huge amount of
damage<00:00:45.170> hey<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.200> saw<00:00:46.710> with<00:00:46.860> lantern<00:00:47.250> he<00:00:47.489> starts

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.000 
damage hey I saw with lantern he starts
with<00:00:47.879> jolteon<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.960> that's<00:00:49.260> kind<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.500> perfect

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
with jolteon and that's kind of perfect

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.119 
with jolteon and that's kind of perfect
for<00:00:50.070> me<00:00:50.280> really<00:00:50.550> because<00:00:52.010> because<00:00:53.010> of

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
for me really because because of

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.689 
for me really because because of
lanterns<00:00:53.730> ability<00:00:54.420> volt<00:00:54.660> absorb<00:00:55.699> Joseon

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
lanterns ability volt absorb Joseon

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.000 
lanterns ability volt absorb Joseon
can't<00:00:56.910> really<00:00:57.120> do<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.300> huge<00:00:57.539> amount<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.829> it

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
can't really do a huge amount of to it

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.270 
can't really do a huge amount of to it
because<00:00:59.250> obviously<00:00:59.370> stab<00:00:59.850> Thunderbolt<00:01:00.449> will

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
because obviously stab Thunderbolt will

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.399 
because obviously stab Thunderbolt will
just<00:01:02.280> heal<00:01:02.520> Lantern<00:01:03.059> instead<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:04.229> that's

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
just heal Lantern instead so that's

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.550 
just heal Lantern instead so that's
great<00:01:05.040> for<00:01:05.339> me<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.790> predicted<00:01:06.510> us<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.900> printed

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
great for me I I predicted us I printed

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.039 
great for me I I predicted us I printed
predicted<00:01:08.400> he<00:01:08.490> probably<00:01:08.729> switch<00:01:09.180> but<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.840> went

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
predicted he probably switch but I went

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.719 
predicted he probably switch but I went
with<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.200> surf<00:01:10.439> anyway<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.890> get<00:01:11.040> some<00:01:11.220> damage<00:01:11.580> on

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729

with a surf anyway to get some damage on
whatever<00:01:11.909> he<00:01:12.380> switched<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.060> he<00:01:15.060> ends<00:01:15.330> up

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
whatever he switched in and he ends up

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.350 
whatever he switched in and he ends up
switching<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:15.900> heracross<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:17.030> Hera<00:01:18.030> process

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
switching in heracross and Hera process

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.990 
switching in heracross and Hera process
can<00:01:18.509> be<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.630> big<00:01:18.840> pain<00:01:19.110> it's<00:01:19.830> kind<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.070> like<00:01:20.189> it's

unfortunate for lambert would have done
a<00:02:48.970> huge<00:02:49.209> amount<00:02:49.239> of<00:02:49.450> wheezing<00:02:49.810> I<00:02:50.069> use<00:02:51.069> Fire

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
a huge amount of wheezing I use Fire

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.610 
a huge amount of wheezing I use Fire
Blast<00:02:51.370> I<00:02:52.030> was<00:02:52.329> thinking<00:02:52.480> might<00:02:52.870> have<00:02:52.989> KO<00:02:53.200> dudes

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
Blast I was thinking might have KO dudes

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.569 
Blast I was thinking might have KO dudes
but<00:02:53.980> I<00:02:54.250> guess<00:02:54.849> I<00:02:54.970> underestimated<00:02:55.209> like<00:02:56.579> her

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
but I guess I underestimated like her

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.190 
but I guess I underestimated like her
across<00:02:57.970> his<00:02:58.180> special<00:02:58.450> defense<00:02:58.690> and<00:02:58.900> obviously

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
across his special defense and obviously

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.229 
across his special defense and obviously
wheezing<00:02:59.650> special<00:02:59.980> tax<00:03:00.190> not<00:03:00.430> that<00:03:00.670> high<00:03:00.940> but

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
wheezing special tax not that high but

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.369 
wheezing special tax not that high but
oh<00:03:01.780> well<00:03:02.530> this<00:03:03.459> turn<00:03:03.730> I<00:03:04.109> instead<00:03:05.109> of<00:03:05.200> like

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
oh well this turn I instead of like

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.170 
oh well this turn I instead of like
risking<00:03:05.799> a<00:03:05.889> fireblast<00:03:06.340> I<00:03:06.670> figure<00:03:06.940> I'll<00:03:07.150> go

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
risking a fireblast I figure I'll go

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.960 
risking a fireblast I figure I'll go
with<00:03:07.510> a<00:03:07.540> Thunderbolts<00:03:08.349> but<00:03:09.250> he<00:03:09.400> switches<00:03:09.730> out

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
with a Thunderbolts but he switches out

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.920 
with a Thunderbolts but he switches out
heracross<00:03:10.540> and<00:03:11.370> so<00:03:12.370> which<00:03:12.519> is<00:03:12.730> jolteon<00:03:13.359> back

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
heracross and so which is jolteon back

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.619 
heracross and so which is jolteon back
end<00:03:14.549> which<00:03:15.549> is<00:03:15.699> a<00:03:15.730> pain<00:03:16.030> because<00:03:16.299> obviously

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
end which is a pain because obviously

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.699 
end which is a pain because obviously
Thunderbolt<00:03:17.410> does<00:03:17.680> nothing<00:03:18.129> to<00:03:18.160> it<00:03:19.709> because

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
Thunderbolt does nothing to it because

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.000 
Thunderbolt does nothing to it because
of<00:03:20.739> its<00:03:21.129> own<00:03:21.340> volt<00:03:21.669> absorb<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:23.470> wheezing

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
of its own volt absorb so wheezing

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.900 
of its own volt absorb so wheezing
restores<00:03:24.430> its<00:03:24.609> health<00:03:24.819> with<00:03:25.030> black<00:03:25.239> sludge

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
restores its health with black sludge

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.300 
restores its health with black sludge
this<00:03:27.910> turn<00:03:28.209> I<00:03:28.419> figure<00:03:28.989> he's<00:03:29.560> going<00:03:29.590> to<00:03:29.949> go<00:03:30.099> with

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
this turn I figure he's going to go with

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.920 
this turn I figure he's going to go with
the<00:03:30.400> substitute<00:03:31.090> just<00:03:31.449> because<00:03:31.599> that's<00:03:31.720> what

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
the substitute just because that's what

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.369 
the substitute just because that's what
your<00:03:32.139> chance<00:03:32.440> do<00:03:32.739> so<00:03:33.609> I<00:03:33.940> keep<00:03:34.540> wheezing<00:03:35.049> in<00:03:35.199> and

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
your chance do so I keep wheezing in and

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:38.339 
your chance do so I keep wheezing in and
use<00:03:35.500> Fire<00:03:35.739> Blast<00:03:35.769> and<00:03:36.609> I<00:03:37.449> was<00:03:37.599> correct<00:03:37.780> and

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
use Fire Blast and I was correct and

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:44.339 
use Fire Blast and I was correct and
substitute<00:03:39.220> goes<00:03:39.400> up<00:03:39.639> and<00:03:41.099> I<00:03:42.419> then<00:03:43.419> Fire<00:03:44.199> Blast

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
substitute goes up and I then Fire Blast

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.250 
substitute goes up and I then Fire Blast
thankfully<00:03:44.889> connects<00:03:45.250> and<00:03:45.549> it<00:03:46.150> manages<00:03:47.079> to

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
thankfully connects and it manages to

to<00:04:15.430> keep<00:04:15.579> wheezing<00:04:15.940> in<00:04:16.090> but<00:04:16.329> I<00:04:16.359> wasn't<00:04:17.049> so<00:04:17.229> a

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
to keep wheezing in but I wasn't so a

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.180 
to keep wheezing in but I wasn't so a
switching<00:04:18.250> lantern

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
switching lantern

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.300 
switching lantern
and<00:04:19.430> he<00:04:20.180> goes<00:04:20.570> for<00:04:20.930> Thunderbolt<00:04:21.500> astern<00:04:21.890> so

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
and he goes for Thunderbolt astern so

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.100 
and he goes for Thunderbolt astern so
that<00:04:22.880> was<00:04:23.030> some<00:04:23.210> good<00:04:23.360> prediction<00:04:23.840> on<00:04:23.930> my

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
that was some good prediction on my

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.310 
that was some good prediction on my
parts<00:04:25.510> which<00:04:26.510> means<00:04:26.780> he's<00:04:26.930> not<00:04:27.050> in<00:04:27.140> a<00:04:27.200> good

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
parts which means he's not in a good

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.090 
parts which means he's not in a good
situation<00:04:27.500> now<00:04:28.190> I<00:04:29.650> decide<00:04:30.650> to<00:04:30.680> go<00:04:30.830> in<00:04:30.950> another

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
situation now I decide to go in another

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.300 
situation now I decide to go in another

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.970 
surf just because so far I don't know if
he's<00:04:34.400> got<00:04:34.520> anything<00:04:34.670> in<00:04:34.820> his<00:04:34.940> team<00:04:35.180> resists

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
he's got anything in his team resists

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.620 
he's got anything in his team resists
its<00:04:37.030> but<00:04:38.030> he<00:04:38.270> switches<00:04:38.540> out<00:04:38.750> jolteon<00:04:39.350> and

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
its but he switches out jolteon and

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.630 
its but he switches out jolteon and
instead<00:04:41.800> switches<00:04:42.800> in<00:04:42.920> his<00:04:43.070> last<00:04:43.280> pokemon

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
instead switches in his last pokemon

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.220 
instead switches in his last pokemon
which<00:04:44.120> is<00:04:44.270> a<00:04:44.420> gyarados<00:04:46.750> kind<00:04:47.750> of<00:04:47.810> an<00:04:47.870> odd<00:04:47.990> move

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
which is a gyarados kind of an odd move

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.360 
which is a gyarados kind of an odd move

electric<00:04:52.820> type<00:04:53.030> but<00:04:53.510> i<00:04:53.810> guess<00:04:54.110> he<00:04:54.230> was

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
electric type but i guess he was

but<00:05:29.350> people<00:05:30.350> can<00:05:30.470> see<00:05:30.650> right<00:05:30.919> through<00:05:31.250> that

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
but people can see right through that

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.190 
but people can see right through that
and<00:05:31.960> thankfully<00:05:32.960> I<00:05:33.169> did<00:05:33.620> so<00:05:34.690> jolteon<00:05:35.690> comes<00:05:35.960> in

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
and thankfully I did so jolteon comes in

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:42.820 
and thankfully I did so jolteon comes in
and<00:05:36.760> I<00:05:37.760> use<00:05:38.410> confuse<00:05:39.410> ray<00:05:39.680> and<00:05:41.320> yeah<00:05:42.320> so<00:05:42.620> I

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
and I use confuse ray and yeah so I

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.350 
and I use confuse ray and yeah so I
jolteon<00:05:43.370> turn<00:05:43.550> are<00:05:43.640> confused<00:05:44.000> when<00:05:44.120> it<00:05:44.210> comes

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
jolteon turn are confused when it comes

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.220 
jolteon turn are confused when it comes
in<00:05:44.540> but<00:05:45.320> I<00:05:45.740> guess<00:05:46.250> now<00:05:46.810> what<00:05:47.810> my<00:05:48.020> opponent

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:48.230 
in but I guess now what my opponent

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:49.780 
in but I guess now what my opponent
actually<00:05:48.560> does<00:05:48.710> this<00:05:48.890> turn<00:05:49.040> is<00:05:49.250> that<00:05:49.430> he<00:05:49.580> gives

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:49.790 
actually does this turn is that he gives

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.450 
actually does this turn is that he gives
up<00:05:50.000> so<00:05:50.390> I<00:05:50.690> was<00:05:51.530> kind<00:05:51.710> of<00:05:51.740> surprised<00:05:52.130> because

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
up so I was kind of surprised because

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.950 
up so I was kind of surprised because
like<00:05:52.730> me<00:05:52.880> he<00:05:52.940> still<00:05:53.210> had<00:05:53.360> three<00:05:53.600> pokemon

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
like me he still had three pokemon

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.340 
like me he still had three pokemon
remaining<00:05:54.740> but<00:05:55.010> he<00:05:55.760> she<00:05:56.030> whatever<00:05:56.210> I<00:05:56.810> had

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:57.350 
remaining but he she whatever I had

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.020 
remaining but he she whatever I had
three<00:05:57.560> pokémon<00:05:57.740> remaining<00:05:58.190> so<00:05:58.520> I<00:05:58.550> guess<00:05:58.820> I

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
three pokémon remaining so I guess I

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.520 
three pokémon remaining so I guess I
just<00:05:59.060> out<00:05:59.419> predicted<00:05:59.990> him<00:06:00.110> well<00:06:00.230> enough<00:06:00.470> that

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
just out predicted him well enough that

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.170 
just out predicted him well enough that
he<00:06:00.950> got<00:06:01.130> into<00:06:01.490> a<00:06:01.520> corner<00:06:01.820> he<00:06:01.880> thought<00:06:02.090> he

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
he got into a corner he thought he

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.870 
he got into a corner he thought he
couldn't<00:06:02.390> do<00:06:02.540> anything<00:06:02.780> about<00:06:03.050> it<00:06:03.230> so<00:06:03.880> there
