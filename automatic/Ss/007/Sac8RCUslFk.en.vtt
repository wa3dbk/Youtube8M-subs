look<00:00:07.840> at<00:00:08.019> the<00:00:08.350> reaction<00:00:08.620> time<00:00:09.070> that<00:00:09.370> wild

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
look at the reaction time that wild

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.000 
look at the reaction time that wild
turtle<00:00:09.880> had<00:00:10.150> on<00:00:10.330> that<00:00:10.390> Calista<00:00:11.290> game<00:00:11.440> dodging

the flash ult from Malphite that

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.630 
the flash ult from Malphite that
smoothie<00:00:15.160> was<00:00:15.309> playing<00:00:17.070> even<00:00:18.070> if<00:00:18.220> they<00:00:18.460> have

oh<00:00:21.539> what<00:00:22.539> a<00:00:22.810> reaction<00:00:23.050> time<00:00:23.710> holy<00:00:24.369> crap<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:26.320> we

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
oh what a reaction time holy crap so we

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.019 
oh what a reaction time holy crap so we
had<00:00:26.529> the<00:00:26.650> observers<00:00:27.100> go<00:00:27.279> back<00:00:27.520> over<00:00:27.910> the

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029

point three and point four seconds so if

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.310 
point three and point four seconds so if
you<00:00:58.210> blink<00:00:58.420> during<00:00:58.600> that<00:00:58.690> play<00:00:58.899> then<00:00:59.170> you

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
you blink during that play then you

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.319 
you blink during that play then you
missed<00:00:59.530> it<00:00:59.680> now<00:01:00.250> there<00:01:00.730> are<00:01:00.910> a<00:01:00.940> couple<00:01:01.180> of

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
missed it now there are a couple of

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.090 
missed it now there are a couple of
things<00:01:01.629> that<00:01:01.750> you<00:01:01.960> can<00:01:02.079> do<00:01:02.320> to<00:01:02.469> make<00:01:02.590> reactions

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
things that you can do to make reactions

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.129 
things that you can do to make reactions
like<00:01:03.219> this<00:01:03.460> easier<00:01:03.850> to<00:01:03.910> pull<00:01:04.180> off<00:01:04.329> one<00:01:04.929> thing

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:05.139 
like this easier to pull off one thing

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:06.870 
like this easier to pull off one thing
that<00:01:05.259> while<00:01:05.379> turtle<00:01:05.740> is<00:01:05.859> constantly<00:01:06.490> thinking

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
that while turtle is constantly thinking

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.999 
that while turtle is constantly thinking
about<00:01:06.999> our<00:01:07.359> possible<00:01:08.289> moves<00:01:08.619> that<00:01:08.889> his

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
about our possible moves that his

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:11.219 
about our possible moves that his
opponents<00:01:09.520> can<00:01:09.729> take<00:01:10.060> now<00:01:10.509> from<00:01:10.810> the<00:01:10.929> moment

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
opponents can take now from the moment

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:12.749 
opponents can take now from the moment
that<00:01:11.259> Malphite<00:01:11.709> enters<00:01:12.009> the<00:01:12.159> brush<00:01:12.369> he's

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
that Malphite enters the brush he's

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.099 
that Malphite enters the brush he's
thinking<00:01:12.909> this<00:01:13.149> guy's<00:01:13.299> going<00:01:13.569> to<00:01:13.600> ult<00:01:13.779> me<00:01:13.899> and

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:14.109 
thinking this guy's going to ult me and

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:16.649 
thinking this guy's going to ult me and
he's<00:01:14.289> expecting<00:01:15.039> to<00:01:15.219> flash<00:01:15.549> it<00:01:15.579> so<00:01:16.209> he's

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
he's expecting to flash it so he's

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.300 
he's expecting to flash it so he's
already<00:01:16.929> decided<00:01:17.469> on<00:01:17.619> what<00:01:17.889> his<00:01:18.069> response

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
already decided on what his response

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.089 
already decided on what his response
will<00:01:18.849> be<00:01:18.880> and<00:01:19.240> he<00:01:19.810> doesn't<00:01:20.289> have<00:01:20.319> to<00:01:20.649> take<00:01:20.889> time

00:01:21.089 --> 00:01:21.099 
will be and he doesn't have to take time

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:23.219 
will be and he doesn't have to take time
after<00:01:21.639> he<00:01:21.729> sees<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:22.029> visual<00:01:22.299> cue<00:01:22.509> to<00:01:22.779> this<00:01:22.929> sad

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
after he sees the visual cue to this sad

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:24.719 
after he sees the visual cue to this sad
little<00:01:23.259> will<00:01:23.619> be<00:01:23.770> now<00:01:24.219> when<00:01:24.429> we<00:01:24.549> perform

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
little will be now when we perform

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.399 
little will be now when we perform
experiments<00:01:25.149> we<00:01:25.479> call<00:01:25.659> things<00:01:25.899> like<00:01:26.049> this<00:01:26.229> a

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
experiments we call things like this a

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.739 
experiments we call things like this a
simple<00:01:26.709> reaction<00:01:27.279> because<00:01:27.789> it<00:01:28.029> is<00:01:28.270> considered

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:28.749 
simple reaction because it is considered

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:30.569 
simple reaction because it is considered
to<00:01:28.810> be<00:01:28.899> pre-defined<00:01:29.499> so<00:01:29.859> always<00:01:30.099> think<00:01:30.490> about

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
to be pre-defined so always think about

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:32.399 
to be pre-defined so always think about
the<00:01:31.029> possible<00:01:31.479> moves<00:01:31.659> that<00:01:31.810> your<00:01:31.990> opponent's

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
the possible moves that your opponent's

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.469 
the possible moves that your opponent's
can<00:01:32.529> take<00:01:32.740> and<00:01:33.429> that<00:01:33.700> can<00:01:33.849> actually<00:01:34.209> speed<00:01:34.450> up

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
can take and that can actually speed up

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:35.999 
can take and that can actually speed up
your<00:01:34.689> reactions<00:01:35.200> now<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.679> other<00:01:35.770> thing<00:01:35.859> that

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
your reactions now the other thing that

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:37.889 
your reactions now the other thing that
you<00:01:36.159> can<00:01:36.219> do<00:01:36.340> is<00:01:36.520> turn<00:01:36.669> up<00:01:36.819> your<00:01:36.909> sound<00:01:37.209> because

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
you can do is turn up your sound because

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.080 
you can do is turn up your sound because
auditory<00:01:38.590> cues<00:01:38.950> are<00:01:39.099> actually<00:01:39.549> process

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
auditory cues are actually process

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.839 
auditory cues are actually process
quicker<00:01:40.689> than<00:01:41.139> visual<00:01:41.499> ones<00:01:41.979> because<00:01:42.669> the

00:01:42.839 --> 00:01:42.849 
quicker than visual ones because the

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
processing a visual cue you would have

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.250 
processing a visual cue you would have
to<00:02:11.709> say<00:02:11.829> like<00:02:11.860> 25<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:12.969> 30<00:02:13.180> meters<00:02:13.450> away<00:02:13.810> from

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
to say like 25 to 30 meters away from

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.679 
to say like 25 to 30 meters away from
computer<00:02:14.830> for<00:02:15.310> that<00:02:15.489> to<00:02:15.670> actually<00:02:15.849> even<00:02:16.540> out

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:16.689 
computer for that to actually even out

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:18.660 
computer for that to actually even out
so<00:02:16.959> I<00:02:16.989> would<00:02:17.349> definitely<00:02:17.590> say<00:02:17.890> after<00:02:18.370> looking

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
so I would definitely say after looking

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.940 
so I would definitely say after looking
at<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:19.000> numbers<00:02:19.329> that<00:02:19.510> wild<00:02:20.079> turtle<00:02:20.260> deserves

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
at the numbers that wild turtle deserves

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.860 
at the numbers that wild turtle deserves
credit<00:02:21.340> for<00:02:21.519> his<00:02:21.790> reaction<00:02:22.299> time<00:02:22.480> very

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
credit for his reaction time very

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.079 
credit for his reaction time very
impressive
