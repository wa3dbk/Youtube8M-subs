because I don't know if you know this
but<00:02:46.730> on<00:02:47.000> average<00:02:47.210> we<00:02:48.050> check<00:02:48.650> our<00:02:48.800> phone<00:02:49.070> a

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
but on average we check our phone a

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.970 
but on average we check our phone a
hundred<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:50.060> fifty<00:02:50.300> times<00:02:50.540> a<00:02:50.720> day<00:02:50.930> so<00:02:51.710> that's

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
hundred and fifty times a day so that's

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.200 
hundred and fifty times a day so that's
going<00:02:52.160> to<00:02:52.220> just<00:02:52.460> waste<00:02:52.640> battery<00:02:53.090> because

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
going to just waste battery because

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.820 
going to just waste battery because
every<00:02:53.450> time<00:02:53.480> you<00:02:53.690> keep<00:02:53.960> pressing<00:02:54.440> this<00:02:54.590> to

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
unlock the device and turning it on it's

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.410 
unlock the device and turning it on it's
just<00:02:57.170> battery<00:02:57.650> drained<00:02:57.950> so<00:02:58.250> this<00:02:59.030> is<00:02:59.209> a<00:02:59.240> really
