00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.420
 hello today plays will tell 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.299
 you about the board game corporation 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.300
 goblins these creatures gathered on 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.369
 regular competition of engineers to them 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.410
 to build several martial 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.350
 robots and arrange between them 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.260
 merciless battles for possession 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.060
 title of boss 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.700
 on the number of different components 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.290
 in a rectangular box just dazzled in 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.850
 eyes 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.129
 the wonders of goblin engineering not 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.230
 limited to cats and chips 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.710
 diced well and presented a few 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.960
 truly unusual mechanisms each 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.930
 player chooses color and takes all 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.970
 corresponding cards and two figures a 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.230
 3 sends to the field for scoring 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.710
 shuffled and laid out on the field 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.530
 all other cards and tokens are finally 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.350
 the first command card is opened which 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.159
 will indicate which goblins will be in this round 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.399
 cooperate 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.299
 and which rival according to this 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:14.290
 purchased are placed on assembly shops 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:17.360
 considering the limitation of the drawing map 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.790
 Each player receives 7 cards from his 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:24.500
 decks of hidden goals and you can start 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:27.500
 to build from each goblin team 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.320
 one collector is assigned which takes 5 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.700
 construction tokens of them are needed 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.820
 keep three 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.549
 and the other two to give the enemy such 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.070
 each collector will have 5 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:43.400
 tokens symbolizing the parts 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.500
 fighting robot is now worth doing 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.869
 installation and at this time for the same 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.430
 principle will take away 5 tokens and two 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.369
 remaining player 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.369
 there are four construction tokens 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.890
 basic type of weapon allows you to hurt 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.770
 beat so goblins really like 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.140
 each arrow on the robot chips will allow 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.840
 further make one attack in 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.780
 this direction engine tokens 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.689
 allow to feed the robot with energy tokens 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.330
 armor helps protect the robot each 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:16.790
 metal protection symbol 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.420
 adjacent token allows you to set 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.690
 defensive plate 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.819
 waiting for them protecting both tokens well and finally 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.489
 there are all-metal tokens 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.950
 jewelry that are important 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.170
 role because the robot does not fall apart in 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.410
 During the battle, all parts must be 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.510
 connected as tightly as possible 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.030
 metal parts when all 10 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.760
 parts are fitted and the robot is assembled the most 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.130
 time to start the fight all goblins 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.370
 go to the cockpit and every player 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.550
 selects from his 7 cards 4 pieces which 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.010
 he will keep these each divided by 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.930
 three types indicating which details to the player 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.390
 will need to save on your 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.880
 robot or destroy on the robot 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.489
 the opponent also each player has 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.780
 one bet card with which 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.290
 You can try to guess the winner of the battle. 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.630
 every round 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.880
 players of one team must choose who 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.569
 of them will be robot drivers, and who 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.000
 combat tactics driver disposes 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.569
 movement of the robot using a special 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.940
 remote control 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.280
 he can put the robot to stand on 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.970
 a place having lost one combat die in mind 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.769
 overheat rotate it 90 degrees 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:32.549
 engaging on this one engine or 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:34.950
 turn around for two also it stands for 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.690
 direction of attack of the robot pointing with 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.209
 which side will be hit 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.380
 to the enemy that sometimes also requires 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:46.230
 activation engines toxic disposes 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.290
 special combat cards at the beginning 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.730
 their fight reports 12 pieces and each 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.579
 round used three 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.530
 they open up and tactics from both 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:58.739
 teams choose a card with 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:01.440
 special remote if both tactics 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.410
 indicated the same card will receive it 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.670
 that robot who has more left 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:09.269
 unused engines avtovo 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:11.190
 will be left with nothing tactic card 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.100
 allows you to strengthen the armor of the robot 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.690
 make an extra shot 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.590
 throw combat cubes or even 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:21.419
 launch a homing missile and 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:24.030
 finally every robot makes an attack 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.610
 the enemy how many gunners 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.039
 points to a robot about 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.430
 nick as many combat cubes and throws 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:34.789
 tactics these cubes determine where and 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.810
 how many times were damaged in 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:38.680
 that direction 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:41.930
 what is indicated on the swivel mechanism 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.800
 each hit robs the robot 1 tiles 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.169
 constructions 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.930
 if the player does not give the defense token 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:50.090
 lying on this secret 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.610
 this tile falls off and goes to 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:56.629
 player dump and with it all 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:59.000
 Other tiles that have lost attachments if 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:02.599
 the attack falls on the cockpit then from 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.210
 one goblin falls out now drivers 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:07.909
 tactics change roles and the process of combat 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.919
 continues on the same principle of battle 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:11.599
 ends at the end of the fourth round 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:14.150
 or early 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:19.400
 if the player's robot has lost all the guns 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:21.349
 or his cabin is empty wins. 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.800
 the command that you managed to send to 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:26.930
 dump more details of the enemy robot 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.569
 the winner gets 2 points for each 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.430
 his goblin in the cockpit and one at 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:34.310
 each goblin mate 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:37.009
 then all players open selected 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.879
 Goal Flow and check whether made 

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:40.789
 conditions 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:42.860
 if so, the players add themselves 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:45.379
 required number of points 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.560
 but for failing to comply with the penalty conditions 

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:50.089
 does not rely once all the victorious 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.849
