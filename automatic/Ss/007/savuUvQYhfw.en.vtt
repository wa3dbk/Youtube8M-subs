00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:14.610
 so i seriously we decided to do the 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.529
 south face is short on skis we left 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.990
 including big montets this morning for 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.520
 go up the glacier d'argentiÃ¨re and 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.470
 to get a foothold on the ring remains 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.470
 course that is about 800 meters 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:49.800
 glaciers sides to see we had 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.949
 put 4 5 hours and a lot of snow 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.660
 fresh followed by a ridge and spun 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.660
 to the top of the costs 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.100
 at the top we were a little tired 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.499
 especially for stone that comes to us all 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.929
 right of the Pyrenees and where the word mountain 

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:18.659
 does not exist I think I was joking 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:20.280
 that it is but then we have to put the 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.640
 skis and attack the descent that 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.329
 seemed pretty good and they 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.929
 were not mistaken 

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:29.929
 it was pretty good spring match and 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:29.929
 here 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.679
 we say 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.230
 more 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.210
 voice 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.240
 m 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.840
 m 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.900
 I 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.370
 at 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:07.720

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:10.709
