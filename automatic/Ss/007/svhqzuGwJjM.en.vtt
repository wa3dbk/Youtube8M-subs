00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
put a roll cage didn't slap it looks

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.940 
put a roll cage didn't slap it looks
pretty<00:00:47.700> good<00:00:47.910> slammed<00:00:48.379> looks<00:00:49.379> pretty<00:00:49.469> good<00:00:49.739> I

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
pretty good slammed looks pretty good I

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.729 
pretty good slammed looks pretty good I
could<00:00:50.850> probably<00:00:51.149> ink<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:52.110> could<00:00:52.320> go<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.500> lot

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
could probably ink it could go a lot

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.040 
could probably ink it could go a lot
lower<00:00:52.920> but<00:00:53.250> how<00:00:53.550> much<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.699> away<00:00:54.050> probably

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
lower but how much is away probably

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.430 
lower but how much is away probably
quite<00:00:55.350> light<00:00:55.559> yet<00:00:56.840> 2,400<00:00:57.840> let's<00:00:58.050> say<00:00:59.030> 450<00:01:00.030> 500

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
quite light yet 2,400 let's say 450 500

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.049 
quite light yet 2,400 let's say 450 500
215<00:01:01.440> horsepower<00:01:01.710> stock<00:01:02.070> all<00:01:02.309> right<00:01:02.460> all<00:01:03.000> right

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
215 horsepower stock all right all right

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.479 
215 horsepower stock all right all right
so<00:01:03.390> it's<00:01:03.449> not<00:01:03.600> bad<00:01:03.860> it's<00:01:04.860> not<00:01:05.010> bad<00:01:05.189> it's<00:01:05.309> quite

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
so it's not bad it's not bad it's quite

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.310 
so it's not bad it's not bad it's quite
light<00:01:05.729> too<00:01:05.939> because<00:01:06.180> all<00:01:06.630> these<00:01:06.780> new<00:01:06.960> cars<00:01:07.200> are

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
light too because all these new cars are

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.590 
light too because all these new cars are
super<00:01:07.830> super<00:01:07.979> light<00:01:08.280> cuz<00:01:08.610> emissions<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.330> and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
super super light cuz emissions and and

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.710 
super super light cuz emissions and and
stuff<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:10.830> yeah<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:11.729> guess<00:01:12.210> that's<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.479> really

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
stuff so yeah I guess that's a really

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.390 
stuff so yeah I guess that's a really
good<00:01:13.140> i<00:01:13.170> guess<00:01:13.560> it's<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> good<00:01:13.860> thing<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.100> cars

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
good i guess it's a good thing that cars

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.460 
good i guess it's a good thing that cars
are<00:01:14.490> starting<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.060> get<00:01:15.150> much<00:01:15.509> lighter<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.439> i

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
are starting to get much lighter so i

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.429 
are starting to get much lighter so i
think<00:01:16.590> that's<00:01:16.920> gonna<00:01:17.100> be<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> pretty<00:01:17.580> good<00:01:17.759> base

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
think that's gonna be a pretty good base

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:20.450 
think that's gonna be a pretty good base
pretty<00:01:19.439> good<00:01:19.590> base<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:20.070> looks<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.430> looks

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
pretty good base it looks it looks

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.719 
pretty good base it looks it looks
pretty<00:01:20.729> cool<00:01:20.880> with<00:01:21.420> those<00:01:21.540> rims<00:01:21.780> but<00:01:22.590> let's<00:01:23.580> go

I<00:01:52.180> don't<00:01:52.390> know<00:01:52.450> this<00:01:53.290> is<00:01:53.410> the<00:01:53.500> i8<00:01:53.830> it<00:01:54.430> has<00:01:54.580> those

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
I don't know this is the i8 it has those

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.820 
I don't know this is the i8 it has those
those<00:01:55.120> types<00:01:55.330> of<00:01:55.420> lights<00:01:55.630> I<00:01:55.870> think<00:01:56.320> it<00:01:56.380> is<00:01:56.440> too

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
those types of lights I think it is too

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.380 
those types of lights I think it is too
black<00:01:57.100> covers<00:01:57.610> just<00:01:57.820> driving<00:01:58.300> around

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
black covers just driving around

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.610 
black covers just driving around
together<00:01:58.780> that's<00:01:59.650> not<00:01:59.800> sketchy<00:02:00.160> at<00:02:00.430> all<00:02:01.620> I'm

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
together that's not sketchy at all I'm

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.100 
together that's not sketchy at all I'm
surprised<00:02:03.190> though<00:02:03.430> it<00:02:03.880> seems<00:02:04.300> to<00:02:04.480> be<00:02:04.570> drifting

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
surprised though it seems to be drifting

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.190 
surprised though it seems to be drifting
rather<00:02:05.500> well<00:02:05.800> I<00:02:06.540> seriously<00:02:07.540> wasn't<00:02:07.840> expecting

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
rather well I seriously wasn't expecting

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.900 
rather well I seriously wasn't expecting
that<00:02:08.229> I<00:02:08.500> guess<00:02:08.860> I<00:02:09.010> should<00:02:09.280> have<00:02:09.369> considered

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
that I guess I should have considered

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
that I guess I should have considered
one<00:02:10.320> it's<00:02:11.320> miss<00:02:11.560> end<00:02:11.800> if<00:02:11.950> you<00:02:12.190> ask<00:02:12.400> me<00:02:12.520> the

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
one it's miss end if you ask me the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.600 
one it's miss end if you ask me the
makers<00:02:13.930> of<00:02:13.960> the<00:02:14.110> best<00:02:14.290> drift<00:02:14.530> cars<00:02:14.740> I<00:02:15.010> would

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
makers of the best drift cars I would

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.910 
makers of the best drift cars I would
say<00:02:15.760> so<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:16.150> then<00:02:16.720> it's<00:02:17.050> it's<00:02:17.380> already<00:02:17.740> quite

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
say so and then it's it's already quite

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.860 
say so and then it's it's already quite
light<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.430> stuff<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:19.180> it's<00:02:19.360> also<00:02:19.480> small

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
light and stuff and it's also small

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.450 
light and stuff and it's also small
that's<00:02:20.470> another<00:02:20.680> thing<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:21.010> like<00:02:21.130> drifting

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
that's another thing I like drifting

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.050 
that's another thing I like drifting
smaller<00:02:21.700> cars<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:22.240> don't<00:02:22.570> know<00:02:22.630> why<00:02:22.810> I<00:02:23.050> just<00:02:23.320> do

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
smaller cars I don't know why I just do

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.460 
smaller cars I don't know why I just do
it's<00:02:25.060> not<00:02:25.480> bad<00:02:25.660> I<00:02:25.690> guess<00:02:26.020> I<00:02:26.260> should<00:02:26.410> have

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
it's not bad I guess I should have

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.080 
it's not bad I guess I should have
expected<00:02:26.560> it<00:02:26.950> to<00:02:27.070> be<00:02:27.100> a<00:02:27.190> little<00:02:27.220> bit<00:02:27.400> oh<00:02:27.640> I

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
expected it to be a little bit oh I

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.000 
expected it to be a little bit oh I
guess<00:02:28.330> I<00:02:28.450> yeah<00:02:28.840> should<00:02:29.500> have<00:02:29.590> been<00:02:29.680> good<00:02:29.830> I

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
guess I yeah should have been good I

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.220 
guess I yeah should have been good I

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
design lead designer and they went with

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.440 
design lead designer and they went with
like<00:02:57.670> an<00:02:57.880> older<00:02:58.870> style<00:02:59.700> main<00:03:00.700> look<00:03:01.120> for<00:03:01.330> I

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
like an older style main look for I

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.210 
like an older style main look for I
don't<00:03:01.600> really<00:03:01.690> know<00:03:01.840> how<00:03:01.900> to<00:03:02.290> describe<00:03:02.500> it<00:03:02.770> but

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
don't really know how to describe it but

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.890 
don't really know how to describe it but
if<00:03:03.310> you<00:03:03.340> look<00:03:03.430> at<00:03:03.550> the<00:03:03.580> body<00:03:03.790> like<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.660> styling

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
if you look at the body like the styling

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.280 
if you look at the body like the styling
of<00:03:05.140> it<00:03:05.230> is<00:03:05.380> sort<00:03:05.890> of<00:03:05.980> like<00:03:06.510> 70s<00:03:07.510> ish<00:03:07.720> like<00:03:08.200> you

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
of it is sort of like 70s ish like you

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.860 
of it is sort of like 70s ish like you
remember<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.709> old<00:03:09.660> for<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:10.900> RS<00:03:12.450> 1,800<00:03:13.450> I

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
remember the old for the RS 1,800 I

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.630 
remember the old for the RS 1,800 I
think<00:03:14.230> i<00:03:14.260> put<00:03:14.500> it<00:03:14.590> is<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:15.220> one<00:03:15.340> from<00:03:15.430> The<00:03:15.520> Fast

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
think i put it is the one from The Fast

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.220 
think i put it is the one from The Fast
and<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.850> Furious<00:03:15.910> movie<00:03:16.300> it's<00:03:16.840> sort<00:03:17.020> of<00:03:17.170> like

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
and the Furious movie it's sort of like

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.590 
and the Furious movie it's sort of like
this<00:03:17.440> this<00:03:17.860> similar<00:03:18.310> style<00:03:18.670> to<00:03:18.790> this<00:03:19.030> it's

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
this this similar style to this it's

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.830 
this this similar style to this it's
like<00:03:20.190> it's<00:03:21.190> three<00:03:21.790> boxes<00:03:22.030> I<00:03:22.300> think<00:03:22.480> this<00:03:22.660> is

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
like it's three boxes I think this is

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.260 
like it's three boxes I think this is
how<00:03:23.050> they<00:03:23.230> is<00:03:23.980> how<00:03:24.130> they<00:03:24.250> described<00:03:24.610> it<00:03:24.760> they

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
how they is how they described it they

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.580 
how they is how they described it they
have<00:03:25.390> the<00:03:25.600> one<00:03:25.780> box<00:03:26.020> in<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.230> front<00:03:26.440> for<00:03:26.560> the

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
have the one box in the front for the

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.380 
have the one box in the front for the
engine<00:03:26.920> they<00:03:27.459> have<00:03:27.580> the<00:03:27.670> bigger<00:03:27.880> box<00:03:28.180> the

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
engine they have the bigger box the

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.970 
engine they have the bigger box the
taller<00:03:28.600> box<00:03:28.870> where<00:03:29.050> you<00:03:29.140> sit<00:03:29.350> and<00:03:29.530> they<00:03:29.830> have<00:03:29.950> a

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
taller box where you sit and they have a

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.340 
taller box where you sit and they have a
smaller<00:03:30.220> box<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.580> the<00:03:30.640> back<00:03:30.820> I<00:03:31.230> think<00:03:32.230> that's

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
smaller box to the back I think that's

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.410 
smaller box to the back I think that's
how<00:03:32.470> they<00:03:32.650> designed<00:03:33.160> it<00:03:33.250> and<00:03:33.400> then<00:03:33.489> for

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
how they designed it and then for

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.360 
how they designed it and then for
whatever<00:03:34.540> reason<00:03:34.989> they<00:03:35.650> threw<00:03:35.950> on<00:03:36.100> a<00:03:36.130> whole

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370
