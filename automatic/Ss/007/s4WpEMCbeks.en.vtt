00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.630
 Hi all, you Vogel 42 and today 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:18.810
 we will build a skyscraper 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:22.850
 settled all the problems so for the skyscrapers 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.850
 we need iron of course 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:31.109
 emerald and hellish brick and the rest 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.980
 extended to life as garbage well here 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:43.770
 great pad these are starting to build 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:47.309
 Immediately begin to build immediately skeleton face 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.340
 here a little bit divides so much 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.010
 for so many she has enough the best 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:01:01.980
 the dress 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:01:12.790
 minutes everything is so such a frame the whole frame 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:17.130
 there will be iron like this 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.130
 hundreds seems to be minutes of shapes sides 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:42.770
 do completely frame 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:48.920
 which will only skyscraper skeleton 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:50.900
 this one will probably be around this 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.250
 emeralds wall 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.330
 and the frame itself will be exactly it will be 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:07.190
 I can see iron 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:11.649
 what will be the glass so far at the entrance 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.649
 maybe as anchik design will change 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:35.099
 Well, the frame we have turned out 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.290
 first box 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:40.430
 oh yeah forgot to say but will be soon 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.560
 consist of a few like that 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.980
 cubes that will be folded up so 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.409
 I will build 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:54.319
 so what's next window will be given 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:54.319
 Here is such a thing emerald blocks 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:06.859
 so means here again the strings and 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:16.669
 in the middle of this edge will be the entrance 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:20.159
 the first three are the entrance to the 3 cube passage and 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:25.340
 here is the skyscraper itself so far leave without 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:25.340
 changes so here 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.560
 need to build such definitions for 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.560
 windows 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:44.440
 so here is the front plate is ready 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:47.400
 the front of the skyscraper is so glazed 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.750
 you will be warm 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.510
 glass blocks because I sew 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.910
 inclined seems to me not very suitable 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.080
 for this 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.080
 specifically for skyscrapers 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:28.510
 grand to lag terribly 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:31.810
 I really like how so here in 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:36.700
 principle seems nothing got it 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:39.670
 food so turned and so do with all 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:44.230
 the parties here in an instant everything is ready 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:47.230
 it remains all to glaze and about glass took 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.780
 your right place and 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:54.210
 the facial image and the skyscraper is already a bit 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:58.420
 he will be ready about this 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:01.720
 beautiful my view now will need 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:04.140
 make the input itself the input is very 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:08.530
 no easy task 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:15.810
 what to do very nice tank for 1 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:15.810
 so what happened 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:26.240
 here and on the sides will hang 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:30.020
 hang ingul he creeps probably 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.020
 the pain was credit 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:46.069
 like that and what about the lamps 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:46.879
 there was always lighting so it's time to do 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:52.879
 floor 

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:57.229
 oh i think i will make from wool 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:06:00.979
 yes, and wool, and so we will begin 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:04.699
 Well, immediately finish the floor is ready or 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:07.909
 pretty beautiful color turquoise so here 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:10.279
 this from this side must also be put 

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:15.110
 steps and at the exit 

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:23.589
 Anything such a superfood is so beautiful 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:27.289
 it is unavailable so much 

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:29.560
 something medieval a little bit like that 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:35.029
 style 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:37.629
 here is the first part of the skyscraper ready and so 

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:37.629
