00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.500
 Hello everyone, the situation is getting out of here. 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.980
 talent and dedication to speak of a piece was expected I was kindly 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.400
 invited by ours and stayed 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.990
 and the forum going to make a video reveals that in the store on a 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.859
 person I had interest I liked 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.750
 go for a little change but this is not enough about employers 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:33.160
 itself and rather a quiet person a character who appears the first movie 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.160
 who is the predator's scalpel with 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.150
 There are those who want to hurry. 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.610
 itself a piece 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.090
 it's a protest today 8 very good because 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.410
 compared to these new ones and with the own pickers who would use corfu 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.890
 we can jump 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.079
 so this is not it 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.870
 those courteous works that we usually see in others 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.050
 other parts 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.190
 good advisers of them people have 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.820
 knife with the hem 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.790
 skaf to get married 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.890
 a machete a dark ax 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.720
 if you want to understand like this 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.720
 she did not want to talk 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:14.600
 guaranteed 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.520
 it's two months 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.020
 the tico-tico 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.310
 a little pocket to keep something in your pocket 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.310
 and a grenade 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.289
 What can we tell him about a character? 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:30.870
 Most of this kind of movie 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.359
 is a character that the first child at last 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:37.190
 is in doubt if there really is any creature 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.990
 in the forest beyond the soldiers themselves along with charles medeiros others 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.300
 movie themes 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.700
 the only thing to quattor them 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.310
 6 d different / p next 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.620
 in the double of the character of the movie for the piece 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.190
 is that this clue the images six months in the power to accompany 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.310
 italian gold 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.930
 and in the movie he is not blond he is a descendant Indian of American Indian 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.580
 politician in the ex-vice litigation 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.380
 that heat 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.700
 so it looked very different and it looks like a German this market face 

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:14.429
 the size 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:15.699
 what's up 

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:18.100

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.950

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:28.979
 d 

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:31.979
 1 inch 6 inches 

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:35.669
 is a 6-inch piece that we see the size of it less than a span 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:40.309
 and our billion friend is almost a span and a half we put on the field 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:47.419
 good despite having a good legal vote for those who have one with the character with 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:48.439
 one year 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:52.870

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:54.309
 certain movement relief 

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:55.489

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.039
 the box said 

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:19.129
 It's this I think is a little behind. 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:20.689
 the box 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:22.519

 there were also victims before the first film 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.439
