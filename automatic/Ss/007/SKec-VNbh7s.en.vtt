them in the same order they're not
mix-match<00:01:40.650> them<00:01:41.210> it's<00:01:42.210> no<00:01:42.390> reason<00:01:42.659> for<00:01:43.140> that

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.499 

and<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.649> can<00:01:46.890> lift<00:01:47.100> up<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.340> harness<00:01:47.700> as<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.299> can

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
and I can lift up the harness as you can

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.679 
and I can lift up the harness as you can
see<00:01:48.780> moving<00:01:49.110> these<00:01:49.500> two<00:01:49.979> middle<00:01:50.790> bolts<00:01:51.479> which

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
see moving these two middle bolts which

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.100 
see moving these two middle bolts which
are<00:01:51.899> right<00:01:52.200> here<00:01:53.689> unhooking<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.750> wire

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
are right here unhooking the wire

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
are right here unhooking the wire
harness<00:01:55.770> on<00:01:55.799> few<00:01:56.759> spots<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.259> can<00:01:58.469> remove<00:01:58.860> the

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
harness on few spots so I can remove the

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.670 
harness on few spots so I can remove the
brackets<00:01:59.909> which<00:02:00.210> are<00:02:00.450> mounted

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
brackets which are mounted

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.610 
brackets which are mounted
on<00:02:01.830> top<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.700> but<00:02:03.120> and<00:02:03.420> basically<00:02:04.050> following

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
on top of it but and basically following

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.370 
on top of it but and basically following
just<00:02:05.160> the<00:02:05.340> valve<00:02:05.580> cover<00:02:05.910> gasket<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.780> removing

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
just the valve cover gasket and removing

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.800 
just the valve cover gasket and removing
all<00:02:07.620> these<00:02:07.980> bolts<00:02:08.670> which<00:02:08.850> are<00:02:09.090> around<00:02:09.450> here

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
all these bolts which are around here

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.640 
all these bolts which are around here
right<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:10.560> there<00:02:10.740> are<00:02:10.830> three<00:02:11.220> behind<00:02:11.670> one<00:02:12.650> two

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
right so there are three behind one two

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.230 
right so there are three behind one two
three<00:02:14.370> four<00:02:15.240> five<00:02:16.170> six<00:02:16.830> after<00:02:17.490> I<00:02:17.790> have<00:02:17.970> removed

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
three four five six after I have removed

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.750 
three four five six after I have removed
all<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.840> bolts<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.620> nuts<00:02:19.800> which<00:02:20.130> were<00:02:20.340> around

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
all the bolts and nuts which were around

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.260 
all the bolts and nuts which were around
now<00:02:21.300> it's<00:02:21.510> time<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:22.110> remove<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:23.160> valve<00:02:23.910> cover

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
now it's time to remove the valve cover

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.050 
now it's time to remove the valve cover
but<00:02:24.600> it's<00:02:24.720> always<00:02:24.900> kind<00:02:25.320> of<00:02:25.380> glued<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:26.100> it<00:02:26.250> so

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
but it's always kind of glued to it so

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.690 
but it's always kind of glued to it so
you<00:02:27.150> have<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:27.570> find<00:02:27.990> a<00:02:28.230> safe<00:02:28.560> spot<00:02:29.130> where<00:02:29.580> you

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
you have to find a safe spot where you

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.890 
you have to find a safe spot where you
can<00:02:29.840> carefully<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.310> gently<00:02:32.310> pry<00:02:33.210> it<00:02:33.270> off<00:02:33.480> and

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
can carefully and gently pry it off and

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.310 
can carefully and gently pry it off and
it<00:02:34.410> cannot<00:02:35.010> be<00:02:35.220> on<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.750> surfaces<00:02:36.750> where<00:02:37.170> the

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
it cannot be on the surfaces where the

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.290 
it cannot be on the surfaces where the
gasket<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.250> has<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.610> be<00:02:38.640> somewhere<00:02:39.090> outside

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
gasket is it has to be somewhere outside

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.290 
gasket is it has to be somewhere outside
and<00:02:40.080> here<00:02:40.800> we<00:02:40.980> go<00:02:41.190> once<00:02:41.850> again<00:02:42.390> use<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:43.230> caution

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
and here we go once again use a caution

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.180 
and here we go once again use a caution
be<00:02:45.300> patient<00:02:45.960> you<00:02:46.560> don't<00:02:46.710> want<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:46.950> drop
