lost me on TV and that will be great
this<00:01:43.940> is<00:01:44.120> the<00:01:44.180> interesting<00:01:44.360> design<00:01:44.750> right

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
this is the interesting design right

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.080 
this is the interesting design right
here<00:01:44.960> yeah<00:01:45.470> so<00:01:45.740> this<00:01:45.860> is<00:01:45.920> called<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.430> slider<00:01:46.790> s

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
here yeah so this is called the slider s

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.320 
here yeah so this is called the slider s
ly<00:01:47.300> dr<00:01:48.220> so<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:49.340> idea<00:01:49.460> here<00:01:49.670> is<00:01:49.940> we<00:01:50.060> have<00:01:50.240> a

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
ly dr so the idea here is we have a

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.180 
ly dr so the idea here is we have a
blade<00:01:50.660> of<00:01:50.690> course<00:01:51.020> with<00:01:51.170> a<00:01:51.260> USA<00:01:51.710> carbon

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
blade of course with a USA carbon

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.550 
blade of course with a USA carbon
nitride<00:01:52.430> titanium<00:01:52.640> if<00:01:53.210> it<00:01:53.720> has<00:01:53.960> a<00:01:53.990> serration

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
nitride titanium if it has a serration

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.750 
nitride titanium if it has a serration
of<00:01:54.680> course<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:55.040> straight<00:01:55.310> edge<00:01:55.430> as<00:01:55.580> well

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
of course the straight edge as well

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.760 
of course the straight edge as well
what's<00:01:56.420> cool<00:01:56.690> about<00:01:56.720> this<00:01:57.140> is<00:01:57.200> it's<00:01:57.470> a<00:01:57.560> one

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
what's cool about this is it's a one

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.560 
what's cool about this is it's a one
hand<00:01:58.009> steel<00:01:58.340> night<00:01:58.610> and<00:01:58.910> it<00:01:59.119> locks<00:01:59.360> in<00:01:59.540> the

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
hand steel night and it locks in the

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.969 
hand steel night and it locks in the
cutting<00:01:59.930> position<00:02:00.320> when<00:02:00.590> you're<00:02:00.710> done<00:02:00.950> you

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
cutting position when you're done you

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.040 
cutting position when you're done you
want<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:01.369> put<00:02:01.460> it<00:02:01.550> away<00:02:01.640> he<00:02:02.300> simply<00:02:02.509> just<00:02:02.840> lock

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
want to put it away he simply just lock

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.200 
want to put it away he simply just lock
it<00:02:03.080> back<00:02:03.410> and<00:02:04.100> now<00:02:04.310> it's<00:02:04.580> in<00:02:04.820> a<00:02:04.880> safe<00:02:05.060> position

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
it back and now it's in a safe position

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.979 
it back and now it's in a safe position
you<00:02:05.690> have<00:02:05.810> pays<00:02:06.430> it<00:02:07.430> will<00:02:07.580> have<00:02:07.729> a<00:02:07.780> double<00:02:08.780> clip

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
you have pays it will have a double clip

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.479 
you have pays it will have a double clip
point<00:02:09.560> here<00:02:09.770> so<00:02:09.890> we<00:02:09.979> could<00:02:10.070> actually<00:02:10.250> have

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
point here so we could actually have

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.100 
point here so we could actually have
pockets<00:02:10.880> in<00:02:11.000> love<00:02:11.180> tip<00:02:11.390> down<00:02:11.540> this<00:02:11.720> is<00:02:11.870> called

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
pockets in love tip down this is called

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.860 
pockets in love tip down this is called

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
continuation of our food a line which is

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.580 
continuation of our food a line which is
started<00:02:17.300> from<00:02:17.330> camillus<00:02:17.870> we<00:02:18.050> came<00:02:18.260> out<00:02:18.410> where

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
started from camillus we came out where

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.930 
started from camillus we came out where
the<00:02:18.680> original<00:02:19.040> fidelis<00:02:19.400> modified<00:02:19.820> a<00:02:19.850> little

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
the original fidelis modified a little

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.970 
the original fidelis modified a little
bit<00:02:20.239> and<00:02:20.660> now<00:02:20.810> we<00:02:20.870> have<00:02:20.989> both<00:02:21.200> improved<00:02:21.320> sarkis

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
bit and now we have both improved sarkis

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.890 
bit and now we have both improved sarkis
included<00:02:22.430> bolt<00:02:22.700> we<00:02:23.090> both<00:02:23.270> will<00:02:23.450> have<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.690> same

the<00:03:14.820> idea<00:03:14.850> about<00:03:15.270> this<00:03:15.450> thing<00:03:15.720> this<00:03:16.140> night

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
the idea about this thing this night

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.440 
the idea about this thing this night
comes<00:03:16.740> right<00:03:16.890> from<00:03:16.920> its<00:03:17.160> name<00:03:17.340> level<00:03:17.730> off<00:03:17.850> so

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
comes right from its name level off so

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.150 
comes right from its name level off so
you<00:03:18.540> simply<00:03:18.720> push<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.200> lever<00:03:19.470> and<00:03:19.740> it<00:03:19.860> fires

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
you simply push the lever and it fires

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.610 
you simply push the lever and it fires
so<00:03:20.880> it's<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.090> really<00:03:21.270> cool<00:03:21.510> knife<00:03:21.720> it<00:03:22.170> comes<00:03:22.410> in

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
so it's a really cool knife it comes in

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.340 
so it's a really cool knife it comes in
a<00:03:22.800> duel<00:03:23.130> traded<00:03:23.730> straight<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.330> tanto<00:03:25.050> and<00:03:25.290> a

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
a duel traded straight a tanto and a

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.930 
a duel traded straight a tanto and a
drop<00:03:25.560> point<00:03:25.590> very<00:03:26.130> nice<00:03:26.340> what's<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:26.760> price

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
drop point very nice what's the price

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
drop point very nice what's the price
point<00:03:26.970> this<00:03:27.270> will<00:03:27.390> go<00:03:27.570> 3999<00:03:28.470> very<00:03:29.220> nice

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:30.960 
point this will go 3999 very nice

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.840 
point this will go 3999 very nice

this my dear is called the chameleon
it's<00:03:33.210> called<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.510> chameleon<00:03:33.900> simply<00:03:34.170> because

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
it's called the chameleon simply because

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.100 
it's called the chameleon simply because
we<00:03:34.440> can<00:03:34.710> take<00:03:34.890> out<00:03:35.100> these<00:03:35.300> carbon<00:03:36.300> 5<00:03:36.540> carbon

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
we can take out these carbon 5 carbon

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.010 
we can take out these carbon 5 carbon
fiber<00:03:37.320> panels<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.760> we're<00:03:38.910> in<00:03:39.150> time<00:03:39.690> on<00:03:39.960> a

some<00:03:47.490> of<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.700> Camille's<00:03:48.180> fans<00:03:48.450> out<00:03:48.630> there

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
some of the Camille's fans out there

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.820 
some of the Camille's fans out there
will<00:03:48.870> probably<00:03:49.020> do<00:03:49.170> their<00:03:49.320> own<00:03:49.350> stuff<00:03:49.710> and

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
will probably do their own stuff and

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.290 
will probably do their own stuff and
throw<00:03:50.010> in<00:03:50.100> there<00:03:50.250> as<00:03:50.370> well<00:03:50.550> they<00:03:50.820> always<00:03:51.000> do

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
throw in there as well they always do

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.750 
throw in there as well they always do
yeah<00:03:51.570> yeah<00:03:52.290> they<00:03:52.530> always<00:03:52.680> do<00:03:52.950> to<00:03:53.220> get<00:03:53.550> moving

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
yeah yeah they always do to get moving

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.920 
yeah yeah they always do to get moving
on<00:03:53.820> a<00:03:53.880> little<00:03:54.030> bit<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.210> our<00:03:54.240> fixed<00:03:54.540> blades<00:03:54.750> now

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
on a little bit to our fixed blades now

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.290 
on a little bit to our fixed blades now
so<00:03:55.350> this<00:03:55.470> is<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.740> fixed<00:03:55.950> blades<00:03:56.250> this<00:03:57.000> is<00:03:57.150> one

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
so this is the fixed blades this is one

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.820 
so this is the fixed blades this is one
of<00:03:57.330> the<00:03:57.450> most<00:03:57.570> ergonomic<00:03:57.900> knives<00:03:58.380> we've<00:03:58.650> ever

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
of the most ergonomic knives we've ever

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.710 
of the most ergonomic knives we've ever
built<00:03:59.040> and<00:03:59.280> I<00:03:59.520> think<00:03:59.760> probably<00:03:59.940> on<00:04:00.240> the<00:04:00.330> market

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
built and I think probably on the market

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.570 
built and I think probably on the market
now<00:04:00.750> we're<00:04:01.440> really<00:04:01.650> concentrating<00:04:01.980> on<00:04:02.550> the

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
now we're really concentrating on the

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.190 
now we're really concentrating on the
ergonomics<00:04:03.210> we<00:04:03.330> do<00:04:03.420> a<00:04:03.450> lot<00:04:03.600> of<00:04:03.660> studies<00:04:04.050> when

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
ergonomics we do a lot of studies when

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.500 
ergonomics we do a lot of studies when
people<00:04:04.530> are<00:04:04.680> you<00:04:05.190> know<00:04:05.280> dressing<00:04:05.610> animals<00:04:06.000> or

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
people are you know dressing animals or

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.420 
people are you know dressing animals or
hands<00:04:06.810> are<00:04:06.960> sweating<00:04:07.230> and<00:04:07.530> you<00:04:07.590> can<00:04:08.040> see<00:04:08.250> with

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
hands are sweating and you can see with

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.190 
hands are sweating and you can see with
a<00:04:08.460> propensity<00:04:08.790> to<00:04:09.120> your<00:04:09.240> hand<00:04:09.510> slip<00:04:09.900> onto<00:04:10.080> the

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
a propensity to your hand slip onto the

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.660 
a propensity to your hand slip onto the
blade<00:04:10.380> yeah<00:04:10.710> so<00:04:10.980> we<00:04:11.070> want<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:11.310> make<00:04:11.430> something

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
blade yeah so we want to make something

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.310 
blade yeah so we want to make something
that<00:04:11.880> you<00:04:11.940> can<00:04:12.060> give<00:04:12.210> pressure<00:04:12.540> power<00:04:12.960> to<00:04:13.230> the

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
that you can give pressure power to the

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.080 
that you can give pressure power to the
blade<00:04:13.530> but<00:04:13.950> also<00:04:14.160> again<00:04:14.670> have<00:04:15.060> the

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
blade but also again have the

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.540 
blade but also again have the
indentation<00:04:15.990> and<00:04:16.110> the<00:04:16.230> curve<00:04:16.470> ergonomic<00:04:17.430> to

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:17.550 
indentation and the curve ergonomic to

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.040 
indentation and the curve ergonomic to
fit<00:04:17.760> just<00:04:17.790> like<00:04:17.970> a<00:04:18.120> glove<00:04:18.360> hearing<00:04:18.660> noise<00:04:18.780> just

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.050 
fit just like a glove hearing noise just

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.660 
fit just like a glove hearing noise just
that<00:04:19.320> now<00:04:19.770> what<00:04:19.920> steel<00:04:20.130> were<00:04:20.280> using<00:04:20.489> on<00:04:20.550> this

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
that now what steel were using on this

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.570 
that now what steel were using on this
guy<00:04:20.850> that<00:04:21.510> is<00:04:21.660> a<00:04:21.810> OS<00:04:22.050> 8<00:04:22.230> sealed<00:04:22.530> okay

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
guy that is a OS 8 sealed okay

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.619 
guy that is a OS 8 sealed okay

super<00:04:47.430> lightweight<00:04:47.780> and<00:04:48.780> I<00:04:48.900> think<00:04:49.139> a

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:49.259 
super lightweight and I think a
