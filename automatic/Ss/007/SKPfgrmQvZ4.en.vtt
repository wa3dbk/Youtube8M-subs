but<00:04:56.680> when<00:04:56.889> Cole<00:04:57.099> passes<00:04:57.550> this<00:04:58.479> is<00:04:58.630> obviously

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
but when Cole passes this is obviously

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.890 
but when Cole passes this is obviously
am<00:04:59.620> I<00:05:00.099> get<00:05:00.460> an<00:05:00.550> exception<00:05:00.880> but<00:05:01.180> sometime<00:05:01.630> Cole

am I get an exception but sometime Cole

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.779 
am I get an exception but sometime Cole
just<00:05:02.080> passes<00:05:02.500> in<00:05:02.620> teammates<00:05:03.039> kind<00:05:03.550> of<00:05:03.610> look

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:03.789 
just passes in teammates kind of look

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:06.089 
just passes in teammates kind of look
for<00:05:04.030> cole<00:05:04.240> and<00:05:04.479> they<00:05:04.599> just<00:05:04.810> lose<00:05:05.740> the<00:05:05.919> ball

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:06.099 
for cole and they just lose the ball

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:07.860 
for cole and they just lose the ball
without<00:05:06.310> even<00:05:06.940> though<00:05:07.090> they<00:05:07.210> have<00:05:07.360> like<00:05:07.539> clear

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
without even though they have like clear

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.540

shooting<00:05:08.590> space<00:05:08.860> in<00:05:09.009> front<00:05:09.130> of<00:05:09.250> them<00:05:09.370> they

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
shooting space in front of them they

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.249 
shooting space in front of them they
just<00:05:09.759> kind<00:05:09.940> of<00:05:10.000> don't<00:05:10.210> take<00:05:10.389> the<00:05:10.509> shots<00:05:10.750> so

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
just kind of don't take the shots so

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:12.600 
just kind of don't take the shots so
that's<00:05:11.470> why<00:05:11.620> I<00:05:11.650> just<00:05:12.070> don't<00:05:12.250> see<00:05:12.370> it<00:05:12.400> in<00:05:12.520> the

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
that's why I just don't see it in the

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.129 
that's why I just don't see it in the

you<00:07:18.440> train<00:07:18.710> something<00:07:19.360> apparently<00:07:20.360> it<00:07:20.659> like

00:07:21.159 --> 00:07:21.169 
you train something apparently it like

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:22.959 
you train something apparently it like
affected<00:07:22.039> the<00:07:22.370> stuff<00:07:22.580> that<00:07:22.699> you're<00:07:22.819> not

00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:22.969 
affected the stuff that you're not

00:07:22.969 --> 00:07:24.249 
affected the stuff that you're not
training<00:07:23.270> if<00:07:23.449> that<00:07:23.569> makes<00:07:23.750> sense<00:07:23.900> I<00:07:24.050> just

00:07:24.249 --> 00:07:24.259 
training if that makes sense I just

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:26.110 
training if that makes sense I just
maybe<00:07:24.500> it's<00:07:24.710> a<00:07:24.860> psychological<00:07:25.340> thing<00:07:25.669> for<00:07:25.879> me

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:26.120 
maybe it's a psychological thing for me

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.330 
maybe it's a psychological thing for me
but<00:07:26.330> that<00:07:26.690> always<00:07:26.870> happen<00:07:27.289> is<00:07:27.379> for<00:07:27.409> my<00:07:27.830> cap<00:07:28.099> s
