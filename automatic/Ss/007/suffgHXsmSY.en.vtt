00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.030

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.170
 do not be wrong on twitter I answer 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.640
 to the coolest questions so 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.800
 we started with the questions the first 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.660
 question does not blood or king says you 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.399
 I would like it with gta snap matic 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.170
 could record videos greetings from 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.000
 argentina well, a health from 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.680
 alicante from Spain speaks yes 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.690
 It would be very cool and with the snap matic 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.370
 could they make videos let's say what to do 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.809
 as shorts as if they were bynes not from 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.610
 a few seconds and then later 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.780
 go up to social club in such a way so 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.309
 then people could share them 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.750
 as if it were a mini youtube I would not be 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.340
 pretty cool and that people could 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.350
 point these clips would be pretty 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.090
 cool because there are so many things and dgt 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.890
 that they become very cool and that people 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.420
 do not know if it would be a way not to say 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.750
 that to share it with everyone would be very 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.280
 cool 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.780
 the next question is link to bus it 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.240
 cure and ask us flow you have time 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.620
 free and what do you do in being true that 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.870
 if I have free time good indeed 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.910
 all day is my free time what do I do 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.380
 with him would be the most correct answer 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.660
 that is to say all day I have free time 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.970
 but there are times that I dedicate myself to playing 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.770
 games he recorded he did not record them many of 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.080
 let's say that of the hours that I shot 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.760
 playing I do not record them so the time 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.140
 free I have is to play and then 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.700
 also to meet my girlfriend my 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.619
 friends is to say I always have the time 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.540
 free but I dedicate it more let's say that 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.180
 would aggravate play and my girlfriend my friends 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.320
 I divide it in that way I for me 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.360
 let's say that from my point of view 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.040
 I always have free time so let's go 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.530
 with the next question that the 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.420
 aceb and funk and it tells us if you were going to 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.310
 live in a flat that would live alone or with 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.960
 someone would live with someone 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.250
 obviously they answer us then we 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.720
 asks another question better said that is 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.729
 that if it's with someone who would be 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.710
 obviously if it was with someone 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.210
 It would be with my girlfriend but I am bea 'funk 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.640
 and that what you want to know is with what 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.070
 Youtuber would not be the safest thing 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.259
 if I'm going to live with someone with some 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.570
 youtuber would already be worth it would be to combine already 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.549
 it's worth pressure off a good I had it would be 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.900
 or with stratus or with rubén and I do not 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:14.370
 They are like the most 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.409
 ends to me the closest ones the most 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.060
 friends would not be with stands or with rubén and 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.140
 I think so, that's the answer for 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.760
 that question the next question 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.560

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.689

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.450
 is that yes I would love to go to

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.680

 the races you have some ritual before 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.840
 to begin to see first of all is 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.909
 I'm not good at racing 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.560
 if I do not have no ritual, that is to say no 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.750
 I do nothing before playing or it's not me 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.040
 I play and sometimes I still get nfs 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.790
 sometimes I get more races 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.430
 cool 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.109
 I do not know how to explain society you do not want 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.400

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:22.230
 is normal or 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.180
 there are times that you win sometimes 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.350
 you lose there are times that you do not hit a 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.450
 beating and times that you stick 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.220
 that is to say that is always random is not 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.660

 I have two projects that are leading 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.060
 a lot of time and they will continue to carry 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.430
 time because they are very projects 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.960
 difficult very complicated and good I hope 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.940

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.100
 that I can not tell you anything if I 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.630

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.250

 I have kisses and I have two projects very 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.100
 pimps and for the secondary channel then 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.380
 The truth is that I do have a channel 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.390
 secondary I have prepared something very very 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.920
 cool not only me but with more people 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.330
 but it is very cool what we have 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.800
 prepared so I can not either 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.790
 say anything because I would not disclose everything 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.790
 the world what this already what we are 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.989
 preparing but yes very very very cool well 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.690
 Stay tuned to the channels because 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.760
 cool things are coming eustachian 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.230
 sensual tells us flow dance dembow 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.090
 while you smoke wifi 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.650
 we move on to the next question because 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.200
 there is no sense 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.810
 asks us what I would do if they told you that 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.030
 you can only play in the world at gta 6 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:41.320
 but paying five thousand euros for the 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:44.170
 game then if it were the only one in the world 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.270
 and if they were 5 that is, it was a 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.490
 million, well, it's worth saying, it's impossible, 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.660
 but if they were 5,000 you will be notified 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.880
 time to give you time to 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.170
 squeeze a theft steal from all 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.970
 banks that are in your city and to all 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.010
 the houses and get five thousand euros from 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.270
 some possible way if you would pay them to 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.220
 You pay if they had the all you can 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.450
 would pay to play gta 6 the truth that 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.040
 if it would be a true last but I think 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.960
 I do believe that everyone who has 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.730
 five thousand turkeys and they told him that he 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.770
 would spend on that is to say me at least 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.350
 or that is a game that nobody has the 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.490
 thinking and that is a gta or that nobody 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.960
 he will see it for a long time 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.280
 after thinking guys thinking what I 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.930
 would I do that it would chip and we 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.600
 ask what the person was doing 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:22.780
 who discovered the milk because if you ask for 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.130
 please forgive me for telling you that 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.540
 man or the woman who was 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:27.160
 discovering the milk sure was there 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.860
 doing something very strange with an animal 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.410
 that is to say that you do touching her tits to 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.360
 a cow or something strange had or is not 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.700
 do not tell me that something strange was not 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.410
 there or let's see you were playing 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.180
 the nipples to a cow and squeezing 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.770
 strong something you wanted to do we 're going to see 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.000
 so well I do not want to go into more 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.260
 details because everyone knows what 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.060
 I 'm talking about the last question 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.710
