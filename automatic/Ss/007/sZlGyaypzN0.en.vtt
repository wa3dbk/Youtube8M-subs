color<00:03:58.220> options<00:03:58.310> for<00:03:58.760> children<00:03:59.420> would<00:03:59.600> pretty

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
color options for children would pretty

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.780 
color options for children would pretty
much<00:03:59.959> ensure<00:04:00.410> that<00:04:00.620> so<00:04:01.040> i<00:04:01.070> think<00:04:01.430> this<00:04:01.519> makes<00:04:01.730> a

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
much ensure that so i think this makes a

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.759 
much ensure that so i think this makes a
lot<00:04:01.820> of<00:04:01.940> sense<00:04:02.030> what<00:04:02.690> do<00:04:02.750> you<00:04:02.840> guys<00:04:02.989> think<00:04:03.049> will

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
lot of sense what do you guys think will

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:05.289 
lot of sense what do you guys think will
there<00:04:03.950> be<00:04:03.980> a<00:04:04.100> candy-colored<00:04:04.609> assortment<00:04:05.239> of

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
there be a candy-colored assortment of

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.180 
there be a candy-colored assortment of
minis<00:04:05.630> don't<00:04:06.230> forget<00:04:06.500> to<00:04:06.620> vote<00:04:06.739> in<00:04:06.950> the<00:04:07.010> poll

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
minis don't forget to vote in the poll

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.650 
minis don't forget to vote in the poll
while<00:04:07.489> we<00:04:07.700> go<00:04:07.880> ask<00:04:08.060> the<00:04:08.180> people<00:04:08.420> of<00:04:08.510> San

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
while we go ask the people of San

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.600 
while we go ask the people of San
Francisco<00:04:09.109> what<00:04:09.260> they<00:04:09.410> think

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.830 

do<00:04:15.610> you<00:04:15.700> think<00:04:15.909> that's<00:04:16.180> a<00:04:16.239> possibility<00:04:16.419> that

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
do you think that's a possibility that

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.090 
do you think that's a possibility that
they'll<00:04:17.079> release<00:04:17.320> it<00:04:17.500> in<00:04:17.590> different<00:04:17.709> colors

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
they'll release it in different colors

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.400 
they'll release it in different colors
ah<00:04:18.660> well<00:04:19.660> that<00:04:19.900> might<00:04:20.109> be<00:04:20.139> a<00:04:20.259> possibility

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
ah well that might be a possibility

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.100 
ah well that might be a possibility
because<00:04:21.370> they<00:04:21.549> are<00:04:21.729> very<00:04:21.789> creative<00:04:22.270> in<00:04:22.810> many

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
because they are very creative in many

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.409 
because they are very creative in many
ways<00:04:23.500> so<00:04:23.860> I<00:04:23.889> think<00:04:24.039> that<00:04:24.280> there<00:04:24.729> is<00:04:25.150> an

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
ways so I think that there is an

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.499 
ways so I think that there is an
innovation<00:04:25.960> in<00:04:26.289> this<00:04:26.470> way<00:04:26.620> also<00:04:27.180> that<00:04:28.180> doesn't

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:28.509 
innovation in this way also that doesn't

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:30.540 
innovation in this way also that doesn't
make<00:04:28.600> that<00:04:28.750> much<00:04:28.810> difference<00:04:29.020> to<00:04:29.470> me<00:04:29.620> I<00:04:29.889> think

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
make that much difference to me I think

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.010 
make that much difference to me I think
that's<00:04:30.669> a<00:04:30.729> great<00:04:30.850> possibility<00:04:31.090> i<00:04:31.630> think<00:04:31.900> it's

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
that's a great possibility i think it's

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.200 
that's a great possibility i think it's
a<00:04:32.110> trend<00:04:32.350> that's<00:04:32.500> their<00:04:33.310> continuing<00:04:33.820> with<00:04:33.970> and

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
a trend that's their continuing with and

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.060 
a trend that's their continuing with and
i<00:04:34.240> think<00:04:34.419> people<00:04:34.570> will<00:04:35.139> be<00:04:35.289> excited<00:04:35.770> to<00:04:35.919> have

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
i think people will be excited to have

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.129 
i think people will be excited to have
an<00:04:36.190> option<00:04:36.340> in<00:04:36.580> colors<00:04:36.910> sure<00:04:37.720> they<00:04:37.900> probably

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139
