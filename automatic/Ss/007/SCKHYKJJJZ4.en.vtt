00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:11.519
 b 4 minutes 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:15.389
 Today is a railway fan of the JNR era 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:20.279
 Arima of Hokuriku Main Line beats and is useful 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:25.610
 Although there we went to the November 30, 2013 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.610
 I want to make a little rain here 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.400
 Here is Arimagawa Station 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.550
 It is right next to this time 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:44.030
 I entered the waiting room in Arimagawa Station 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:47.370
 Inside is such a feeling that there is ticket sale burger 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.460
 Of things in place which is down the left 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.610
 You were about to treat it 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.900
 There is no more inside 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.120
 There is nothing 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.660
 There is a large space 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.660
 Just 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:07.880
 It seems that there are surveillance cameras on such places 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:11.710
 Somehow old of the real national railway era 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.710
 Should be a little taste 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.539
 A surveillance camera is on her 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.539
 It is on 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.950
 And the other side is the sea, but it is the Sea of ​​Japan 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.509
 It's really something like change 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.509
 It is such a role 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:37.520
 Yes had been doing I'm suits of such Enka station 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.680
 Pine is a rope postscript I usually train 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.760
 Beppu 413 series 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.480
 This one now white 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:49.750
 I have a blue line in the body though 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:57.520
 That say the entire surface of the blue 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:59.790
 Today, I did not see so much in front of it. Most of this painted vehicle 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.790
 Gao 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.860
 It would be cheaper if I made this one color 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.750
 In that 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.750
 Though it seems to be one meal 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:25.610
 It is opposite direction next time It is glad that wind to Toyama from Naoetsu is only battle 455 kana 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.610
 In the back two cars are 413 series 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:39.290
 The road over there is National highway No. 8 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.750
 Once upon a time Hokuriku Main Line I was running along this No. 8 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.710
 Electrification 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:47.940
 To do 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:54.590
 Because there is a small member of the tunnel to the west , there is also a need to speed it up 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.590
 In such a way, he enters the tunnel and connects with a straight line 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:08.020
 It's a freight train that came next time, but this one 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.950
 The right side of the skirt 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:15.440
 I'm drawing 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.370
 I was gotten once Hey message by it 's such a or that 27 Unit with little 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.650
 But 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:24.880
 So I took a little care and tried copying 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:28.000
 And then of I er ef 81 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.590
 Was it 600627? 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.459
 I think 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:38.910
 Now it's a little still image and it's up there, but it's all over there, right? 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.910
 627 you 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:47.760
 Yes there is also an ending af 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:54.530
 The ending song has ended though 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:57.580
 Well there is of yet sitting in the station of the bench will be this kind of feeling and looking at the form 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.760
 Train from the other side have been doing 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.209
 Parent's first no se e 537 m 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.209

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.960
 Well, is not really better a little Yari Nde weather was terrible it this time 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.880
 The day before this day 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:26.330
 November 28 and 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:26.330
 20 clause is it is seems to have out something really delay the wind is blowing in Hokurikusen 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.110
 The technique was too strong, but the wind was strong . 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:39.710
 In it who here is not a softening videos semi-automatic of 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:43.270
 It sounds like an automatic door 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:49.280
 Then I open it by hand 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:52.060
 It's all about opening automatically with Char and then pressing the button to open the vehicle and the national strength 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.289
 I vehicle is running 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.619
 This one feels like something all automatic 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.619
 Right 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:06.289
 It means that the vehicle of the age is running here 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:15.470
 Well that's why this time there is good from the station of manners 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.470
