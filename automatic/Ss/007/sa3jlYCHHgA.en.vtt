 speedart 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.580
 here the main goal primack to 9 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.500
 centimeters 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.180
 3 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.920
 that is, no questions will be there 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:31.400
 for sure can cut out too 61 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.200
 box 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.600
 for tariff focus ask consider 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.530
 our cold steel answer is that it is necessary 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.530
 transfer delicious 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.810
 I love him better 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.770
 what's easy 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.060
 insidious break and many 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.010
 then logic 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.710
 but there is such an account technician very cool 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.570
 ears and still need you so much 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.770
 a man a letter expert Kurds ceramics 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.720
 become what he does from the bottom. 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.130
 that is, we can additionally admit 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.130
 something in order to make it 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.220
 so that 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.590
 or any other so that you can 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.340
 place let's say cut sticks 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.079
 knockdown crimp 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.890
 and the way come you will just be on 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:13.890
 ledge for sure 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.390
 tell me this 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.680
 well here these here 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:29.210
 this is our answer flattered practically 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.800
 can say almost to 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.200
 and what to make that 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.320
 three kinds of dark steel 63 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.850
 from the right of me you will 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:46.450
 i am 18 merge answer to 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:49.030
 this one and why they and a half 95 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.619
 four and a half and three and a half 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.080
 hour handles 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.670
 actually want to be all one tail 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.670
 one piece exactly 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.950
 if everything is split and 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.870
 there is someone started that blanks later 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.220
 grow up 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.220
 I like to look unlikely 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.890
 close 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.810
 never seen specifically to 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.520
 powerful enough strong and 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.180
 I would advise taking stainless steel 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:30.760
 because the possibility of minimal care 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.760
 what yes and minimum care a lot of flour 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.989
 but you need to go what 4 skin music 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.989
 shook 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.989
 as 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.790
 seems very cool 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.420
 together with the necessary longing three and a half 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.870
 thousand 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.870
 principle 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.900
 sleep ours and understand the rest of something 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.440
 Well, there in general our opponent all our 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.440
 builders 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.980
 well, that is, not 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.230
 young powder 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.940
 need and powder paint i have it 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.760
 then the card firms are not quenched 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:22.650
 yes then what ate with pisa meaning kiss 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.650
 fool before the product 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:38.319
 but you can watch this dancing here 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.319
 links so here it is yes 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.890
 which is also not 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.890
 I want to quit and 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.310
 name you just 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:54.590
 everyone did not get enough sleep and I did not get enough sleep 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:57.140
 I listened to three o'clock for the first time later in 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.500
 45 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.420
 shallow okay shallow 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.190
 whistled demanded that the tummy 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.190
 stroked their ill live 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.010
 in honor of owls last woke up 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.380

 I didnâ€™t want to sleep any more 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.109
 So
