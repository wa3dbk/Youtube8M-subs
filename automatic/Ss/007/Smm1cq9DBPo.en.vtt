 a video on it so not at home but 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.120

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.930
 start with a very horrible make up a 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.910
 you do not need that to scare 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.910
 now no longer worry for tat 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.299
 so I'm going that a creepy doll 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.040
 as it is surely one of the things that 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.509
 scares me the most right now for 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.130
 do that I'm going to use glue in 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.899
 stick worry with a little 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.850
 cleansing agent and its part without 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.320
 problem I first start by erasing 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.090
 my eyebrows to be able to draw 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.380
 others more to people there in great 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.729
 amount on my eyebrows with 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.960
 circular motions for well into 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.280
 put everywhere and then I put powder 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.020
 to the books confides that this is the first 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.039
 layer during his dry I'm going to go 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.509
 put blue lenses that me 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:33.500
 gave a less human look as if 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.420
 I had no soul 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.979
 I redo the eyebrow step with the 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.479
 glue and powder then i'm going to put 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.860
 foam foundation on top for 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.909
 to cover them well I will then 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.229
 to make my doll complexion so I'm going 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.729
 use a lighter foundation than 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.679
 usually thinking well in master on 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.209
 the eyebrows then I powder there I take 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:48.140
 a highly pigmented blusher to make 

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:49.610
 cheeks all red 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.080
 I'll add freckles 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.759
 using a red lip pencil 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.770
 clear by making a few small dots 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.880
 there it starts to have a joke 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.009
 we will now draw some 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.689
 naughty eyebrows with a black collar and I 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.149
 I will give them a slightly venerated shape 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.799
 so low at the very high base on the 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.509
 mid low hero on the tip 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.369
 now I apply them and makeup to 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.660
 eyelids in a hyper- grotesque way like 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.489
 on the dolls actually so I'm going 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.030
 take pink and I'm going to make a bow 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.920
 circle 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.870
 above my eyelid it's up to 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.829
 pink pacsÃ©s it's ugly but it's not 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.420
 me who decided that the dolls 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:19.010
 had no sense of makeup 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.660
 I'm going to grow my eyes with collar 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.040
 white that I'm going to put on the inside 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.200
 of the eye is a little below the 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.850
 eyelid also covering my eyelashes and 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.530
 I go in addition to that adds and makeup 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.760
 white eyeshadow over there I'm going 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.829
 to take care of the eyelashes or rather 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.329
 fossils by applying them above 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.950
 the eye but also below the eye 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:35.900
 just where we made the limit of 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.459
 white pencil and now the mouth I 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.930
 take a lip pencil a little bottom 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.269
 it is that I will apply on the lip 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.709
 superior by brimming over widely 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.660
 the ends to lengthen my mouth 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.030
 then with a white make-up pencil 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.109
 to cover my lower lip 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.239
 always with this white pencil I'm going 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:51.980
 leave a little space on the mouth and 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.420
 I'm going to draw a curve that will serve 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.340
 to make the bottom teeth with a 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.900
 black makeup pencil or a neck I 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.980
 I'm going to draw the teeth on the parts 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.750
 white by making vertical strokes 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.700
 more in its shadow over them are 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.889

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.389

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:08.420
 and all that with the lip pencil of 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.340
 departure with a black pencil 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.170

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.520
 lower lashes I 'm going to redraw 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.989
 on the ends with lines 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.550

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.030
 big enough to cover a balloon 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.710

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.270

 with the black marker ace using a 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.840
 needle makes you pass a pretty thread 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.970
 long in the center of the fabric then you place 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.830
 a tape on it to fix it to the balloon 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.389

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.710
 small patterns in paper we will 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.030
 spread out on a long thread and we're going 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.949

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.380
 orange depending on the pattern you 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.699

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.360

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.069
 then you cover the paper to 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.719
 the inside of the box by putting 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:44.159
