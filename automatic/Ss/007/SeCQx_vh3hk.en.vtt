00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.310 

map<00:01:48.030> right<00:01:49.030> now<00:01:49.210> please

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.490 

the<00:01:54.320> one<00:01:54.950> of<00:01:55.040> the<00:01:55.130> key<00:01:55.310> differences<00:01:55.520> is<00:01:56.120> there

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.260 

switch<00:01:59.800> on<00:01:59.980> the<00:02:00.010> device<00:02:00.370> you<00:02:00.970> can<00:02:01.090> actually

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
switch on the device you can actually

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.350 
switch on the device you can actually
skip<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:02.020> signing<00:02:02.350> process<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.880> then<00:02:04.120> it's

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
skip the signing process and then it's

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.690 
skip the signing process and then it's
only<00:02:04.570> use<00:02:05.320> of<00:02:05.470> google<00:02:05.800> services<00:02:06.280> are<00:02:06.580> you

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
only use of google services are you

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.490 
only use of google services are you
recognize<00:02:07.090> it<00:02:07.450> then<00:02:08.460> so<00:02:09.460> that<00:02:09.490> includes<00:02:09.729> gmail

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
recognize it then so that includes gmail

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.080 
recognize it then so that includes gmail
it's<00:02:11.500> those<00:02:11.860> services<00:02:12.400> then<00:02:12.640> you<00:02:12.760> have<00:02:12.940> to

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
it's those services then you have to

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.150 
it's those services then you have to
sign<00:02:13.240> into<00:02:13.480> gmail<00:02:13.720> otherwise<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:14.860> could<00:02:15.010> use

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
sign into gmail otherwise you could use

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.410 
sign into gmail otherwise you could use
the<00:02:15.310> breath

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
the breath

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
the breath
so<00:02:17.110> that's<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:18.640> slight<00:02:18.940> difference<00:02:19.300> so<00:02:19.630> good<00:02:20.319> to

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
so that's a slight difference so good to

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.610 
so that's a slight difference so good to
be<00:02:20.560> honest<00:02:20.860> my<00:02:21.580> honest<00:02:21.849> feeling<00:02:22.209> is<00:02:22.620> you

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
be honest my honest feeling is you

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.610 
be honest my honest feeling is you
really<00:02:23.890> want<00:02:24.069> to<00:02:24.130> sign

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.810 

one<00:02:27.620> of<00:02:27.710> the<00:02:27.770> key<00:02:27.950> values<00:02:28.310> is<00:02:28.460> definitely

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
one of the key values is definitely

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.170 
one of the key values is definitely
marketplace<00:02:29.420> so<00:02:30.140> I<00:02:30.440> Cameron<00:02:31.400> seen<00:02:31.670> using<00:02:31.910> this

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
marketplace so I Cameron seen using this

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.620 
marketplace so I Cameron seen using this
device<00:02:32.360> without

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630

the<00:02:35.840> soft<00:02:36.230> keyboard

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.400 

so<00:02:40.250> you
