I I would have taken the job if I

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.299 
I I would have taken the job if I
thought<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.059> was<00:01:00.120> destined<00:01:00.710> for<00:01:01.710> failure<00:01:01.920> I

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
thought it was destined for failure I

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.329 
thought it was destined for failure I
think<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:03.379> there<00:01:04.379> are<00:01:04.409> 30<00:01:04.769> teams<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.220> NHL

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
think that there are 30 teams in the NHL

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.039 
think that there are 30 teams in the NHL
that<00:01:05.790> all<00:01:06.000> have<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.330> same<00:01:06.510> goal<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.900> they're

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
that all have the same goal and they're

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.380 
that all have the same goal and they're
all<00:01:07.170> run<00:01:07.470> by<00:01:07.500> smart<00:01:08.070> people<00:01:08.119> dedicated<00:01:09.119> people

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
all run by smart people dedicated people

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.020 
all run by smart people dedicated people
and<00:01:09.810> that's<00:01:10.260> what<00:01:10.439> makes<00:01:10.619> winning<00:01:11.030> so

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
and that's what makes winning so

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.940 
and that's what makes winning so
difficult<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.689> it's<00:01:12.780> what<00:01:13.020> makes<00:01:13.200> winning<00:01:13.619> so

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
difficult and it's what makes winning so

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.249 
difficult and it's what makes winning so
rewarding<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.700> think<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.750> they<00:01:15.869> all<00:01:15.990> know<00:01:16.200> to

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
rewarding I think that they all know to

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.249 
rewarding I think that they all know to
a<00:01:16.439> man<00:01:16.710> what<00:01:16.890> would<00:01:17.009> be<00:01:17.310> like<00:01:17.520> here<00:01:18.049> but<00:01:19.049> at<00:01:19.140> the

a man what would be like here but at the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.140 
a man what would be like here but at the
same<00:01:19.500> time<00:01:19.740> that's<00:01:20.070> not<00:01:20.820> what's<00:01:21.060> most

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
same time that's not what's most

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.700 
same time that's not what's most
important<00:01:21.810> what's<00:01:21.960> most<00:01:22.170> important<00:01:22.590> is

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
important what's most important is

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.679 
important what's most important is

such<00:01:57.450> as<00:01:57.479> those<00:01:57.810> three<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.259> get<00:01:58.380> these<00:01:58.560> this

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
such as those three to get these this

well there are a lot of things that all

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.010 
well there are a lot of things that all
teams<00:02:04.170> strive<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.770> do<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.670> think<00:02:06.090> star

players<00:02:07.320> are<00:02:07.530> important<00:02:07.950> but<00:02:08.099> like<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.060> said

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
players are important but like you said

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.839 
players are important but like you said
role<00:02:09.509> players<00:02:09.750> are<00:02:09.929> also<00:02:10.020> very<00:02:10.379> important<00:02:10.860> so

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
role players are also very important so

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.640 
role players are also very important so
you<00:02:12.849> know<00:02:12.939> having<00:02:13.689> players<00:02:13.930> constantly

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
you know having players constantly

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.039 
you know having players constantly
coming<00:02:14.860> up<00:02:15.069> through<00:02:15.189> your<00:02:15.280> system<00:02:15.900> that<00:02:16.900> you

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
coming up through your system that you

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.770 
coming up through your system that you
can<00:02:17.430> build<00:02:18.430> that<00:02:18.760> sort<00:02:19.090> of<00:02:19.180> feeling<00:02:19.599> where

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
can build that sort of feeling where

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.679 
can build that sort of feeling where
we've<00:02:20.739> got<00:02:20.920> them<00:02:21.099> in<00:02:21.250> in<00:02:21.970> Toronto<00:02:22.510> whether

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:22.689 
we've got them in in Toronto whether

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:25.380 
we've got them in in Toronto whether
with<00:02:23.019> the<00:02:23.110> marlboros<00:02:23.680> or<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:25.030> Marley's

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
with the marlboros or and the Marley's

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.750 
with the marlboros or and the Marley's
and<00:02:25.510> they're<00:02:25.599> coming<00:02:25.870> up<00:02:25.989> here<00:02:26.349> I<00:02:27.189> think<00:02:27.670> is

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
and they're coming up here I think is

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.080 
and they're coming up here I think is
important<00:02:28.299> but<00:02:29.200> I<00:02:29.260> think<00:02:29.530> that<00:02:29.680> any<00:02:30.519> team<00:02:30.940> is

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
important but I think that any team is

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.699 
important but I think that any team is
sort<00:02:31.269> of<00:02:31.299> a<00:02:31.420> mosaic<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.230> they're<00:02:32.590> all

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
sort of a mosaic and they're all

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.240 
sort of a mosaic and they're all
different<00:02:33.540> when<00:02:34.540> one<00:02:34.780> team<00:02:35.019> wins<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.950> stanley

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
different when one team wins the stanley

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.130 
different when one team wins the stanley
cup<00:02:36.430> everybody<00:02:36.940> tries<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.180> copy<00:02:37.480> them<00:02:37.780> say<00:02:38.109> oh

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
cup everybody tries to copy them say oh

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.649 
cup everybody tries to copy them say oh
it's<00:02:38.470> all<00:02:38.680> about<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:39.609> know<00:02:39.670> speed<00:02:40.209> and<00:02:40.420> skill

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:40.659 
it's all about you know speed and skill

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.979 
it's all about you know speed and skill
and<00:02:40.900> then<00:02:41.019> a<00:02:41.049> big<00:02:41.799> bruising<00:02:42.220> team<00:02:42.870> wins<00:02:43.870> the

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
and then a big bruising team wins the

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.020 
and then a big bruising team wins the
cup<00:02:44.170> and<00:02:44.379> it's<00:02:44.560> about<00:02:44.829> being<00:02:45.340> a<00:02:45.489> heavy<00:02:45.700> team

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
cup and it's about being a heavy team

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.640 
cup and it's about being a heavy team
and<00:02:46.329> I<00:02:46.540> think<00:02:46.959> you<00:02:47.049> have<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.260> find<00:02:47.440> your<00:02:47.560> own

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
and I think you have to find your own

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.470 
and I think you have to find your own
identity<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:48.250> what<00:02:48.459> works<00:02:48.640> for<00:02:48.849> you<00:02:48.940> and<00:02:49.180> you

identity and what works for you and you
have<00:02:49.569> to<00:02:49.659> stick<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:49.989> it<00:02:50.109> you're<00:02:50.620> just<00:02:50.799> four

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
have to stick to it you're just four

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.649 
have to stick to it you're just four
years<00:02:51.220> removed<00:02:51.670> from<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:52.000> game<00:02:52.180> as<00:02:52.389> a<00:02:52.420> player

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:52.659 
years removed from the game as a player

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:54.750 
years removed from the game as a player
is<00:02:53.049> that<00:02:53.379> an<00:02:53.560> asset<00:02:53.950> moving<00:02:54.250> forward<00:02:54.609> as<00:02:54.730> you

is that an asset moving forward as you

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.300 
is that an asset moving forward as you
move<00:02:55.269> into<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.599> executive<00:02:56.170> role<00:02:56.379> you<00:02:57.250> know

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
it's funny when I when I retired I

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.379 
it's funny when I when I retired I
wasn't<00:02:59.440> ready<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.980> to<00:03:00.459> be<00:03:00.639> an<00:03:00.849> executive<00:03:01.120> with

the team certainly not not in this role

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.949 
the team certainly not not in this role
I<00:03:05.530> could<00:03:06.370> have<00:03:06.459> taken<00:03:06.609> on<00:03:06.849> a<00:03:06.879> smaller<00:03:07.239> role<00:03:07.480> and

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
I could have taken on a smaller role and

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.599 
I could have taken on a smaller role and
learn<00:03:08.319> and<00:03:08.530> it's<00:03:08.680> a<00:03:08.739> great<00:03:08.920> route<00:03:09.250> that<00:03:09.430> a<00:03:09.459> lot
