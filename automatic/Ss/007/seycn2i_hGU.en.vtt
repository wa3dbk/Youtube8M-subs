to<00:01:35.369> show<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:36.090> breadth<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.229> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
to show the breadth of the of the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.260 
to show the breadth of the of the
platform<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.310> types<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.729> applications

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
platform and the types of applications

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.760 
platform and the types of applications
that<00:01:39.329> are<00:01:39.450> our<00:01:39.780> customers<00:01:40.020> our<00:01:40.500> core

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
that are our customers our core

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.980 
that are our customers our core
customers<00:01:41.250> can<00:01:41.700> create

customers can create

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.840 
customers can create
really<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.530> sky's<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.799> limit<00:01:43.979> with<00:01:44.670> our

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
really the sky's the limit with our

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.260 
really the sky's the limit with our
application<00:01:45.420> our<00:01:45.570> body<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:46.820> we<00:01:47.820> hope<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.119> is
