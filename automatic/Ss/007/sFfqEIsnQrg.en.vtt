fantastic it really suited my style a
feature<00:04:31.020> we<00:04:31.170> liked<00:04:31.380> with<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:31.620> kenneth<00:04:31.890> blade

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
feature we liked with the kenneth blade

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.430 
feature we liked with the kenneth blade
is<00:04:32.460> that<00:04:32.970> although<00:04:33.120> it's<00:04:33.390> very<00:04:33.420> quick<00:04:33.870> we<00:04:34.410> can

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
is that although it's very quick we can

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.960 
is that although it's very quick we can
still<00:04:34.740> throw<00:04:34.890> the<00:04:35.040> ball<00:04:35.160> sink<00:04:35.460> into<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:35.760> core

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
still throw the ball sink into the core

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.910 
still throw the ball sink into the core
of<00:04:36.000> the<00:04:36.090> blade<00:04:36.360> choose<00:04:36.960> it<00:04:37.050> a<00:04:37.140> soft<00:04:37.380> outer<00:04:37.650> wood

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
of the blade choose it a soft outer wood

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.920 
of the blade choose it a soft outer wood
which<00:04:38.700> helped<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:39.060> balance<00:04:39.360> between<00:04:39.450> speed

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
which helped the balance between speed

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:49.710 
which helped the balance between speed
and<00:04:39.990> control

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.360 

both<00:04:50.720> planes<00:04:51.050> were<00:04:51.260> very<00:04:51.470> effective<00:04:51.950> when
