was<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.860> say<00:02:04.860> measured<00:02:05.370> probably<00:02:06.360> about<00:02:06.480> nine

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
was I say measured probably about nine

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.920 
was I say measured probably about nine
feet<00:02:06.810> long<00:02:09.619> maybe<00:02:10.670> six<00:02:11.670> feet<00:02:11.790> high<00:02:12.210> little

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
feet long maybe six feet high little

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.140 
feet long maybe six feet high little
higher<00:02:13.140> me<00:02:13.560> maybe<00:02:13.860> six<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.310> half<00:02:14.400> feet<00:02:14.760> the

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
higher me maybe six and a half feet the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.300 
higher me maybe six and a half feet the
lighting<00:02:15.540> emanated<00:02:16.080> from<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.320> fabric<00:02:16.920> of<00:02:17.070> the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
lighting emanated from the fabric of the

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.460 
lighting emanated from the fabric of the
craft<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.910> it<00:02:18.480> would<00:02:18.660> actually<00:02:19.020> move<00:02:19.170> around

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
craft and it would actually move around

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.170 
craft and it would actually move around
and<00:02:19.770> it<00:02:19.950> would<00:02:20.100> move<00:02:20.310> we'd<00:02:20.610> have<00:02:20.790> different

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
and it would move we'd have different

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.270 
and it would move we'd have different
locations<00:02:21.900> where<00:02:22.170> maybe<00:02:22.770> a<00:02:22.920> little<00:02:23.070> blue

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
locations where maybe a little blue

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.970 
locations where maybe a little blue
lighting<00:02:23.550> was<00:02:23.880> going<00:02:24.180> into<00:02:24.330> or<00:02:25.050> maybe<00:02:25.350> lower

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
lighting was going into or maybe lower

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.670 
lighting was going into or maybe lower
red<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.580> then<00:02:27.480> there<00:02:27.959> must<00:02:28.140> have<00:02:28.260> been<00:02:28.350> some

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
red and then there must have been some

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.290 
red and then there must have been some
type<00:02:28.890> of<00:02:28.920> lighting<00:02:29.340> underneath<00:02:29.640> of<00:02:30.180> it

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
type of lighting underneath of it

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.870 
type of lighting underneath of it
because<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.620> silhouette<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.340> aircraft

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
because the silhouette the aircraft

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.800 
because the silhouette the aircraft
itself<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:34.610> went<00:02:35.610> around<00:02:35.820> and<00:02:36.150> started<00:02:36.480> doing<00:02:36.720> a

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
itself I went around and started doing a

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.780 
itself I went around and started doing a
360<00:02:37.350> walk<00:02:37.680> around<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.160> area<00:02:38.459> taking

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
360 walk around the area taking

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.540 
360 walk around the area taking
recording<00:02:39.480> my<00:02:40.020> observations<00:02:40.890> i<00:02:41.070> was<00:02:41.220> looking

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
recording my observations i was looking

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.550 
recording my observations i was looking
underneath<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:42.150> craft<00:02:42.480> like<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:42.990> i<00:02:43.260> had

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
underneath the craft like that i had

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.460 
underneath the craft like that i had
taken<00:02:43.950> quite<00:02:44.220> detailed<00:02:44.700> notes<00:02:45.030> on<00:02:45.300> that<00:02:45.510> type

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
taken quite detailed notes on that type

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.770 
taken quite detailed notes on that type
of<00:02:46.500> aircraft<00:02:46.860> still<00:02:47.430> unknown<00:02:50.240> no<00:02:51.240> apparent

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
of aircraft still unknown no apparent

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.300 
of aircraft still unknown no apparent
landing<00:02:52.260> gear<00:02:52.940> no<00:02:53.940> sound<00:02:54.330> but<00:02:54.950> appears<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.160> be

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
landing gear no sound but appears to be

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.910 
landing gear no sound but appears to be
pulsating<00:02:56.910> somehow<00:02:57.390> yeah<00:02:58.200> it<00:02:58.470> was<00:02:58.620> pretty

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
pulsating somehow yeah it was pretty

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.640 
pulsating somehow yeah it was pretty
nerve-wracking<00:02:59.459> I<00:02:59.940> mean<00:03:00.150> when<00:03:00.930> you're<00:03:01.350> there

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
nerve-wracking I mean when you're there

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.960 
nerve-wracking I mean when you're there
something<00:03:02.130> there<00:03:02.250> right<00:03:02.459> in<00:03:02.550> front<00:03:02.730> of<00:03:02.820> you

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
something there right in front of you

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.850 
something there right in front of you
don't<00:03:03.150> know<00:03:03.209> what<00:03:03.450> it<00:03:03.540> is<00:03:03.570> I<00:03:03.959> would<00:03:04.560> go<00:03:04.739> ahead

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
don't know what it is I would go ahead

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.470 
don't know what it is I would go ahead
and<00:03:05.300> feel<00:03:06.300> the<00:03:06.480> craft<00:03:06.780> which<00:03:07.230> was<00:03:07.500> warm<00:03:08.480> there

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
and feel the craft which was warm there

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.860 
and feel the craft which was warm there
was<00:03:09.510> static<00:03:09.840> electricity<00:03:10.410> in<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:10.830> air<00:03:11.870> very

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
was static electricity in the air very

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.380 
was static electricity in the air very
warm<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.410> touch<00:03:13.580> identifying<00:03:14.580> markings<00:03:15.090> are

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
warm to touch identifying markings are

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.020 
warm to touch identifying markings are
in<00:03:15.570> left<00:03:15.840> front<00:03:16.140> side<00:03:16.440> as<00:03:16.980> I<00:03:17.310> came<00:03:17.519> around<00:03:17.580> to

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
in left front side as I came around to

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.650 
in left front side as I came around to
the<00:03:18.360> one<00:03:18.570> side<00:03:18.840> of<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.430> craft<00:03:20.510> there<00:03:21.510> was

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
the one side of the craft there was

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.390 
the one side of the craft there was
itching<00:03:22.140> on<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:24.410> face<00:03:25.410> me<00:03:25.650> just<00:03:25.890> above<00:03:26.130> the

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
itching on the face me just above the

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.030 
itching on the face me just above the
center<00:03:26.970> part<00:03:27.239> of<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:27.570> craft<00:03:27.810> itself<00:03:28.049> of

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
center part of the craft itself of

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.680 
center part of the craft itself of
course<00:03:29.310> this<00:03:29.489> is<00:03:29.640> done<00:03:29.760> all<00:03:29.910> free<00:03:30.239> hand<00:03:30.510> as<00:03:30.660> I

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
course this is done all free hand as I

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.199 
course this is done all free hand as I
was<00:03:30.900> walking<00:03:31.080> around<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.680> craft<00:03:32.000> but<00:03:33.000> these

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
was walking around the craft but these

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.870 
was walking around the craft but these
symbols<00:03:33.600> trans<00:03:33.810> from<00:03:34.019> left<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.320> right<00:03:34.410> across

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
symbols trans from left to right across

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.970 
symbols trans from left to right across
and<00:03:35.880> then<00:03:36.030> underneath<00:03:36.360> the<00:03:36.810> those<00:03:37.380> that<00:03:37.769> line

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
and then underneath the those that line

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.350 
and then underneath the those that line
of<00:03:38.010> symbols<00:03:38.519> was<00:03:38.880> this<00:03:39.500> which<00:03:40.500> is<00:03:40.680> triangular

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
of symbols was this which is triangular

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.940 
of symbols was this which is triangular
and<00:03:42.360> some<00:03:42.630> type<00:03:42.780> of<00:03:42.810> circle<00:03:43.290> here<00:03:43.500> some<00:03:43.799> type

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
and some type of circle here some type

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.550 
and some type of circle here some type
of<00:03:43.980> circle<00:03:44.430> here<00:03:44.760> in<00:03:45.299> a<00:03:45.450> larger<00:03:45.900> circle<00:03:46.320> here

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
of circle here in a larger circle here

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.430 
of circle here in a larger circle here
and<00:03:46.769> of<00:03:46.890> course<00:03:47.160> all<00:03:47.370> this<00:03:47.580> was<00:03:47.820> filled<00:03:48.150> in

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
and of course all this was filled in

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.170 
and of course all this was filled in
with<00:03:49.440> the<00:03:49.650> like<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:50.040> etching<00:03:50.519> part<00:03:51.239> of<00:03:51.360> it

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
with the like the etching part of it

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.860 
with the like the etching part of it
I<00:03:53.349> knew<00:03:54.349> that<00:03:55.069> that<00:03:55.819> craft<00:03:56.180> could<00:03:56.450> not<00:03:56.659> have

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
I knew that that craft could not have

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:03.340 
I knew that that craft could not have
been<00:03:57.019> made<00:03:57.230> by<00:03:57.670> man

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.230 

and<00:04:03.920> then<00:04:04.580> they<00:04:04.790> started<00:04:05.180> moving<00:04:05.510> back<00:04:05.800> in

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
and then they started moving back in

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.870 
and then they started moving back in
between<00:04:08.240> the<00:04:08.330> trees<00:04:09.070> with<00:04:10.070> absolutely<00:04:10.670> no

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
between the trees with absolutely no

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.400 
between the trees with absolutely no
sound<00:04:11.210> no<00:04:11.840> air<00:04:12.110> disturbance<00:04:12.650> at<00:04:13.040> all<00:04:13.190> take<00:04:14.030> off

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
sound no air disturbance at all take off

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.510 
sound no air disturbance at all take off
unknown<00:04:15.410> speed<00:04:15.860> and<00:04:16.190> I<00:04:16.520> right<00:04:17.110> impossible<00:04:18.110> I

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:18.520 
unknown speed and I right impossible I

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.979 
unknown speed and I right impossible I
mean<00:04:19.520> it<00:04:19.730> was<00:04:19.940> threatening<00:04:20.390> to<00:04:20.450> me<00:04:20.750> here<00:04:20.840> but

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
mean it was threatening to me here but

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.930 
mean it was threatening to me here but
it<00:04:21.110> wasn't<00:04:21.470> the<00:04:21.560> type<00:04:21.770> that<00:04:22.550> you<00:04:22.580> were<00:04:22.790> going

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
it wasn't the type that you were going
