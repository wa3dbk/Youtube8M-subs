00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.010
 good then Gilles is a new job 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.709
 that of making baptisms of track bah 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.980
 it's a first for me actually at the 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:20.510
 request for claude 14 we mounted a motorcycle 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.520
 identical to our race bikes with a 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.530
 motor a little bit more standard and 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.340
 then we put a tandem saddle 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:30.710
 we're just going to share this 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.649
 we feel on the track there small 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.940
 advice to give to yes yes everything to 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.440
 done there is a handle on the back of the 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.210
 saddle so you have to stand with one hand 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.650
 on the saddle and then they can place 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.320
 the other hand on the front of the tank 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:46.780
 just in front of me and stick to me and 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.780
 especially follow the movement of the motorcycle 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.420
 need them if they oppose 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.430
 st 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.000
 I 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.650
 a great lot of sensations and we 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.860
 really feel safe behind 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.240
 gilles fits 11 years ago German 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.280
 the wind pressure when it accelerates 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.590
 on the straight line is really apcom 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.590
 it's a first time really top 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.030
 hamon 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.030
 finally 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.400
 ah good 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.550
 you 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.750
 just got off the bike what 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.930
 impression with good feelings 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.490
 speed a little bit of apprehension 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.390
 on the first turns a little trouble to 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.500
 to let go but that's 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.760
 the habit when we are when we have 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.820
 used to be handlebars and not behind 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.530
 and then finally the tips were 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.150
 good coup bah I'll let me 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.770
 to go then we feel that even if it is 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.860
 an old machine that pushes anyway 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.090
 very very strong and we feel that we feel 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.430
 whether there are horses or not it's a 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.470
 first of other passengers ah yes it's 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.150

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.459
 yes especially with a champion all that and 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.450
 in addition to a year + on a circuit 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.520

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.860

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.570
 go anyway and thoroughly good ben we get 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.959
