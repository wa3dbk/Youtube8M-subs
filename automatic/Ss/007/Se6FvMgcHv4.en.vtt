00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.580
 very good all guys here master no 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.259
 I bring you the review of the episode of 635 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.779
 One- Piece Anime Like All 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:22.390
 Sundays I wanted to say that about this 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.460
 episode that I liked but not 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.890
 he knew whether to say what the previous one but 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.560
 it shows that the episodes are now from 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.680
 much higher quality and bring new 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.070
 surprises characters new new voices 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.680
 I did not like this episode very much 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.989
 that with respect to the previous ones especially 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.280
 in the appearance of new characters 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.500
 introduction of them as is the 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.530
 I find that they have had grief mini lutfi 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.750
 but with a little light and the flashback 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.000
 that he had of the saga of the island of cane 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.800
 not of the brown head but not without 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.140
 However, he has remembered his name but 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.989
 well it was funny but I think that 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.540
 now you will see me will have applied a 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.610
 different paper will not be the typical 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.340
 villain that is loaded lutfi and we 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.560
 we forget about it so you will not have a greater 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.050
 transcendence especially at the end of the 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.119
 saga and says that he admires too many 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.880
 the flamingos with which I believe that 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.890
 we can lose our focus on 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.290
 see the mitation I think it's a character 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.149
 important and within the censorship that has 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.530
 made in the company of all 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.410
 animation that is in charge of 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.240
 create the compiz anime is not the super 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.250
 especially with the supervision of oda to 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.560
 part of that censorship is 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.060
 constantly there eliminating everyone 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.729
 the impossible studs that appear on the 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.009
 manga is pretty good and very similar 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.479
 what we have seen yesterday all sleeves 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.570
 the points that I liked most about this 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.820
 episode and that stood out a lot is 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.010
 the structure of the scenes something that a 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.490
 demand always happens but in the anime 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.620
 the scenes do not usually work 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.110
 not in fact they are the sound of a keyboard 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.729
 and it looks very professional comes out in the 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.770
 scene the bonus is lucy against the loop and 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.880
 with candle I see the one of quine mont that 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.280
 we will have forgotten completely 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.720
 of him has been docked with some 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.560
 flamingo subordinates that emit that 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.560
 if you do not go with them 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.480
 and I do not expect to find anymore not 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.700
 Fox also appears finally finds 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.100
 the sword takes it but has had a 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.100
 I find the wings with a voice 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.620
 the legend of three pink resistance 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.620
 the wings that steal people things and 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.630
 Well, it just seems like he has found 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.090
 one of those fairies and on the ship is very 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.740
 We were able to observe the super monkey 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.510
 your routine me having a situation something 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:43.170
 comical and especially because the monster 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.000
 that takes advantage of who is a child and who 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.590
 can always be next to enami that 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.300
 she is a pretty attractive woman 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.030
 behave very guardian and for many 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.750
 people and brooke and spike but when 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.880
 above all brook repents there is no 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.920
 complains about not being able to do the same thing 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.630
 a child but more explain everything is 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.580
 that is in a voice within the 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.740
 Men's bedroom no 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.600
 from the door and they find a 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.550
 image as a kind of mosaic of 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.790
 colors that everyone seems to have 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.250
 smoked or whatever it is not and it's amazing 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.900
 but good as those we have seen the 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.080
 manga we already know what this has not 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.840
 impressed a lot but it is true that 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.300
 it's quite mysterious it's not the surprise 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.130
 of this episode and finally what more 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.260
 highlighted from this episode is the appearance 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.360
 good and the character that I mentioned in 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.850
 the last the last review that says that 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.350
 it's March I do not or is honestly one of 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.630
 the characters that I like most about these 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.300
 sagas I would not know if from the series of 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.430
 one piece but I liked it very much 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.810
 especially because of the personality that is already 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.250
 is showing a bit like the last 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.890
 message that repairing the episode that 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.490
 I will send you all hell is a 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.380
 very rebellious character whose voice has 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.150
 liked it but I liked it 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.830
 impressed because I understood that 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.780
 who was going to interpret or what is 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.810
 the 6 the bender the character of 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.670
 bartolomeo was if it was calculated that it is the 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.470
 father of jésica manu in the series 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.720
 Naruto Shippuden 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.640
 and considering that is the voice 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.230
 it did not fit me but I still 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.760
 I really liked the voice because it's a 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.010
 character that is also based on the 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.920
 joker we can also observe that the 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:23.000
 Censorship has affected him a lot especially 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:24.950
 in the final images that says instead 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.160
 to say it was the pirate impaler 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.380
 or the killing of civilians not as it says in 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.360
 the manga says he threw a bomb at the 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.490
 civilians do not camouflage it a bit 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.980
 attitude that this character has but in 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.480
 definitively I liked it a lot in 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.190
 general then the colors that you have 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.010
 used the hair I did not know if it's going to 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.720
 being blue blond green does not paint where 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.940
 all colors but good green is 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.610
 pretty good and then it's part that's 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.310
 based on the joker since it uses the 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.220
 same clothes green hair jacket 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.260
 gilt is the typical no and then yes laughs 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.940
 Well, it 's perfect, I think the nickname 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.190
 cannibal lived people are going to 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.260
 misinterpret in fact I did it myself 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.580
 we will think that people ate not 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.200
 let's kill civilians if 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.760
 it was so cruel because he was not going to put them on 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.060
 and other than the fangs once 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.580
 has vampire dracula 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.800
 what are you waiting for, not really cannibal 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.639
 it means troll in Japanese culture 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.200
 if someone tells you cannibal it's not that 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:22.510
 because I'm going to start a person or 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.460
 you have your same species but you are very 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.680
 annoying you're not a troll the scene 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.919
 against main à I liked it a lot since 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.330
 mainar vivo very much did not believe that 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.060
 I had everything under control 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.169
 and Bartolomeo has avenged his partner and 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.510
 I think he has done everything right and 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:39.310
 this is the review of episode 635 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:41.919
 I hope you liked it if you want 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.979
 more reviews give light or leave them 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:46.479
 comments on work we do not have a 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:48.070
 description my social networks that has 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:50.139
 like this episode or if it has not 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.940
 liked that you think has been missing and 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:53.940
 saying this we see ourselves in another base
