00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
pasteurized so first we're going to just

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.490 
pasteurized so first we're going to just
start<00:03:37.850> by<00:03:38.000> putting<00:03:38.270> the<00:03:39.200> sesame<00:03:40.040> seeds<00:03:40.340> into

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
start by putting the sesame seeds into

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.920 
start by putting the sesame seeds into
the<00:03:42.500> grinder<00:03:42.980> okay<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.550> most<00:03:43.700> important<00:03:44.180> part

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
the grinder okay the most important part

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.340 
the grinder okay the most important part
of<00:03:45.200> this<00:03:45.500> whole<00:03:46.100> cookie<00:03:46.820> making<00:03:47.350> experience

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
of this whole cookie making experience

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.150 
of this whole cookie making experience
is<00:03:48.650> is<00:03:49.220> that<00:03:49.370> you<00:03:49.460> gotta<00:03:49.670> grind<00:03:50.410> the<00:03:51.410> sesame

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
is is that you gotta grind the sesame

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.150 
is is that you gotta grind the sesame
seeds<00:03:52.430> down<00:03:52.960> before<00:03:53.960> you<00:03:54.050> add<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.230> honey<00:03:54.530> okay

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
seeds down before you add the honey okay

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.910 
seeds down before you add the honey okay
and<00:03:55.370> we're<00:03:55.730> grinding<00:03:55.910> it<00:03:56.300> down<00:03:56.410> into<00:03:57.410> a<00:03:57.440> powder

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.220 

so<00:04:00.920> here<00:04:01.370> you<00:04:01.490> can<00:04:01.520> see<00:04:01.940> it's<00:04:02.420> a<00:04:02.540> powder<00:04:02.750> so

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
so here you can see it's a powder so

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.540 
so here you can see it's a powder so
it's<00:04:03.560> kind<00:04:03.860> of<00:04:03.920> like<00:04:04.160> our<00:04:04.550> flour<00:04:05.350> okay<00:04:06.350> and<00:04:06.680> you

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.550 
it's kind of like our flour okay and you

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.520 
it's kind of like our flour okay and you
might<00:04:07.760> want<00:04:07.970> to<00:04:08.120> like<00:04:08.270> just<00:04:08.540> get<00:04:09.020> it<00:04:09.140> off<00:04:09.260> the

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
might want to like just get it off the

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.000 
might want to like just get it off the
sides<00:04:09.830> if<00:04:10.220> it's<00:04:10.400> sticking<00:04:10.730> to<00:04:11.030> the<00:04:11.120> sides<00:04:11.330> of

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
sides if it's sticking to the sides of

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:19.670 
sides if it's sticking to the sides of
the<00:04:15.489> of<00:04:16.489> the<00:04:16.609> container

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.110 

then<00:04:20.680> we're<00:04:20.920> going<00:04:21.010> to<00:04:21.070> just<00:04:21.370> add<00:04:21.550> in<00:04:21.820> our

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
then we're going to just add in our

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:33.920 
then we're going to just add in our
honey

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.620 

and<00:04:35.280> trick<00:04:36.280> with<00:04:36.430> this<00:04:36.610> is<00:04:36.910> to<00:04:37.090> actually<00:04:37.150> pulse

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
and trick with this is to actually pulse

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.300 
and trick with this is to actually pulse
it<00:04:37.840> okay<00:04:40.500> reason<00:04:41.500> why<00:04:41.590> we<00:04:41.770> pulse<00:04:41.980> it<00:04:42.190> is

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
it okay reason why we pulse it is

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.520 
it okay reason why we pulse it is
because<00:04:42.610> the<00:04:42.730> honey<00:04:42.910> since<00:04:43.540> it's<00:04:43.720> raw<00:04:43.930> it's<00:04:44.320> a

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
because the honey since it's raw it's a

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.350 
because the honey since it's raw it's a
little<00:04:44.740> bit<00:04:44.890> hard<00:04:45.250> it's<00:04:45.520> more<00:04:45.790> solid<00:04:46.330> than

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
little bit hard it's more solid than

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.740 
little bit hard it's more solid than
other<00:04:46.840> honeys<00:04:47.230> so<00:04:48.040> this<00:04:48.760> way<00:04:49.000> it<00:04:49.330> gets<00:04:49.420> broken

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
other honeys so this way it gets broken

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.460 
other honeys so this way it gets broken
up<00:04:50.050> into<00:04:50.520> the<00:04:51.520> sesame<00:04:52.210> seed<00:04:52.420> powder<00:04:52.630> and<00:04:53.080> as

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
up into the sesame seed powder and as

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.650 
up into the sesame seed powder and as
you<00:04:53.680> post<00:04:53.980> it<00:04:54.280> you're<00:04:54.700> actually<00:04:54.880> pulsing<00:04:55.540> it

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
you post it you're actually pulsing it

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.060 
you post it you're actually pulsing it
for<00:04:55.840> longer<00:04:56.020> intervals<00:04:56.650> so<00:04:56.860> in<00:04:56.920> the<00:04:56.980> beginning

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
for longer intervals so in the beginning

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.280 
for longer intervals so in the beginning
i'll<00:04:57.430> be<00:04:57.580> like<00:04:57.790> every<00:04:58.090> two<00:04:58.390> seconds<00:04:58.840> and<00:04:59.200> then

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
i'll be like every two seconds and then

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.130 
i'll be like every two seconds and then
later<00:04:59.590> on<00:04:59.710> you<00:04:59.950> hold<00:05:00.160> it<00:05:00.310> down<00:05:00.430> for<00:05:00.760> like<00:05:00.940> ten

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
later on you hold it down for like ten

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.840 
later on you hold it down for like ten
seconds<00:05:02.140> straight<00:05:02.400> so<00:05:03.400> you're<00:05:03.430> going<00:05:03.640> to<00:05:03.700> do

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
seconds straight so you're going to do

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.300 
seconds straight so you're going to do
it<00:05:04.000> firm<00:05:04.240> I'd<00:05:04.570> say<00:05:04.840> about<00:05:04.870> 40<00:05:05.830> seconds

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
it firm I'd say about 40 seconds

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.190 
it firm I'd say about 40 seconds
something<00:05:07.210> like<00:05:07.360> that<00:05:07.390> depending<00:05:07.960> on<00:05:08.080> your

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
something like that depending on your

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.640 
something like that depending on your
grinder<00:05:09.330> okay<00:05:10.330> so<00:05:10.390> when<00:05:10.840> it's<00:05:11.020> done<00:05:11.320> you're

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
grinder okay so when it's done you're

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.490 
grinder okay so when it's done you're
going<00:05:11.770> to<00:05:11.860> see<00:05:12.070> it's<00:05:12.220> it<00:05:12.550> gets<00:05:12.610> into<00:05:13.330> like<00:05:13.510> like

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
going to see it's it gets into like like

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
going to see it's it gets into like like
a<00:05:14.680> moist<00:05:15.510> dough<00:05:16.510> and<00:05:17.040> so<00:05:18.040> then<00:05:18.220> we're<00:05:18.340> going<00:05:18.430> to

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
a moist dough and so then we're going to

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.380 
a moist dough and so then we're going to
make<00:05:18.810> cookies<00:05:19.810> out<00:05:20.020> of<00:05:20.050> this<00:05:20.290> a<00:05:21.210> spoon<00:05:22.210> and

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
make cookies out of this a spoon and

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:23.910 
make cookies out of this a spoon and
you're<00:05:22.540> going<00:05:22.660> to<00:05:22.720> take<00:05:22.990> like<00:05:23.110> a<00:05:23.170> ball<00:05:23.440> out<00:05:23.680> and
