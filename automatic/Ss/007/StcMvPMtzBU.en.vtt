00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 Woman confuses eye drops by 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.560
 nail glue paula griffin 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.960
 originally from burning good confused the 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.990
 glue for false nails with the 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.690
 drops for the eyes when getting up by the 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.150
 morning and have the blurred view I look 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.210
 the eye drops and instead of this 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.880
 glue was applied this painful mistake 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.980
 he was followed completely by the right eye 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.289
 relief arrived eight hours later when 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.779
 the doctors cut her eyelashes and 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.270
 they kept the eye open the glue 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.120
 could have caused permanent damage to the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.190
 vision of the lady to griffin this guy 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.110
 of glue for nails contains a 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.559
 warning that indicates the glue 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.090
 Adheres to the skin in seconds 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.309
 imagine that it could have happened to 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.070
 This woman's eye if she had adhered 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.110
 completely to the eye paula commented 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.719
 that she was very tired and could not 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.879
 see well when he entered the bathroom and took the 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.859
 bottle when tightening it and 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.649
 apply it to the eye he knew that something was 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.760
 bad was very thick and it did not seem to 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.909
 nothing drops for the eyes 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.520
 immediately his father was 55 years old 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.220
 years took her to the hospital wall in dorset 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.080
 the doctors applied paraffin 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.840
 kerosene to help dissolve the 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.119
 glue when you do not see results and feel 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.770
 a lot of pain went directly to the 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.330
 ophthalmologist at the hospital 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.210
 Bournemouth and there they gave him three 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.280
 options I could follow with the eye closed 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.220
 until it will take off naturally but 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.649
 this would cause more damage another option was 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.479
 continue to apply paraffin or finally 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.940
 that will cut off the tabs for 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.950
 force the eye to open the 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.479
 doctor simón vélez specialist in 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.030
 emergency medicine in the hospital 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.340
 pole commented that while the glue 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.470
 be out of the eye will be extremely 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.200
 painful but it will cause damage 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.210
 superficial but if the glue arrives 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.909
 in the middle of the eyeball the damage is 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.190
 permanent so he said in a report 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.500
 the daily mail 'the medical problem is not 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.899
 cause greater inconveniences and paula 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.950
 griffin is now well but the 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:04.950
 scare was awesome
