00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.300
 ah 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.690
 good between your fingers still did not live 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.820
 background element a game of four 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.860
 I took it out the other day with jose 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.889
 we were playing the game for a while 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.180
 and the rest with the golden shotgun the truth 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.009
 that they are a lot of putting me shotguns 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.800
 but good in this on this map and 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:23.599
 mythical put yourself put this type of weapons 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.309
 Well, I had to talk a little about 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.500
 How many good things that I did 

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:29.630
 when was when I was a little younger 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.119
 not in this in this game and finish 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.790
 leave the sea where we had it dominated 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.590
 and then I came up with a game 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.780
 pretty cool now I will explain a 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.980
 some tiny little flaw I stick the 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.859
 shotgun 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.269
 Well good game and when and 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:46.910
 you have the game dominated no one day and 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.019
 software remove the game and other there is a 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.590
 thing that you can do with our 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:53.600
 pretty friends 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.610
 that I can fly enough what 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.590
 basically when I was already 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.180
 we could say because we were bored of 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.710
 May you already know that he played a lot looking and 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.030
 destroy the mode the only way that 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.460
 I played 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.290
 now it is no longer played to search and 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.420
 destroy but cool because the people 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.700
 look up again and were is 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.740
 really the way where are the 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.570
 people who play perfect so 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.850
 least before was where the people were 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.649
 what better game was he to search and destroy in 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.570
 times of four and so on now 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:25.270
 are the most campero boats in the 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.530
 multiverse not all obviously but yes 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.040
 How true that you find yourself every time 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.450
 very tall but he met they were 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.909
 here the best ones basically because it was 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.950
 the way that more point taba not why it 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.360
 they found in the best players 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.850
 because I did not want to be on top of the 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.560
 of the ranking now it was more before it was more 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.229
 as I say you can be among the first 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.090
 of the ranking were low or were already 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.850
 points and other one basically what 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.740
 we played were the game of the classes not 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.289
 we called it now, there are websites that 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.729
 they do it and other randomly and others but 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:56.830
 good basically for his stories like 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.810
 I did it basically because we put on 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.550
 a group of friends and one said a class 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.380
 to see who kills more not in search and 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.840
 well always to look premiere great way 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.340
 for more added we could say vote what 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.509
 you can do in the way that only the 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:14.530
 miserable balls is not really good 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:17.260
 with the titan and look how it has to be 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.209
 the ridiculous and very very fucking belief of 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.640
 handle sometimes you discover things pretty 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.200
 cool the curia versions as I say 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.180
 as weapons and patient combinations 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.620
 chulas that then end up going well 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.890
 for example I discovered that in with four 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.440
 for example if you abbas titan with the dragon 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.150
 or killed many times from a single shot 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.890
 But if you call it behaves 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.799
 forward is more to almost always finish 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.200
 two will be something quite strange to discover 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:42.640
 this kind of this kind of thing then 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.250
 also with five for example with that 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.109
 game we discover that with a weapon if you 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.290
 He put his telescopic sight because he was trying 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:52.629
 of a shot and it was the n-1 ear in fact 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.340
 was that I have some marked with shots and 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:57.099
 you put them with good telescopic sight 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.349
 very extravagant things and the truth that 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.359
 it's one thing that could prove that it's going 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.790
 to like pretty basically for good 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.620
 as I say why one of moto2 made one 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.329
 class and everything else they have to put and 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.430
 to see who gets more points with her 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.230
 more points or lower or what you want 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.239
 is the next one the same and so on and 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.409
 well already basically so you can 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.110
 play is what you have to have almost 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:19.900
 everything unlocked is not perhaps as 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.060
 harder you have it as a group 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.290
 of friends who play a lot of heat 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.510
 of wheat what you have is almost everything 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.420
 unlocked so you can try it myself 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.430
 I think what you're going to go pretty bad 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.780
 would do a lot if I do a live and 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.940
 we play that game of the game of 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.930
 classes because I could quite though 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.520
 that it is true that I would look for this 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.190
 it could be because here already to find 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.540
 people because a little bit crappy and difficult 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.390
 but yes it would be pretty good not 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.160
 playing that game mode would not be 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.510
 pretty funny or even that what 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.860
 put in something to hide it or that 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.390
 someone had to create a class and 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.090
 that everyone had is predetermined 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.830
 the age would be pretty cool the truth 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.180
 and good until here my striped and smoked 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.590
 today, guys 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.390
 I hope you liked it and as I say 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.970
 also on websites that make you a class 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.440
 randomly that already has a long time since 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.690
 to be the black ops and you can also 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.739
 prove I do not know right now any that 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.010
 put it people 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.540
 in the in the comments which page 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.180
 they have them to randomly but 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.770
 there are pages that do it to you so 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.540
 well nothing more guys see you in the 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.540
 next video until next time 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.780
 yes
