00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.940 
for you guys
I'll<00:02:36.600> to<00:02:37.020> show<00:02:37.230> you<00:02:37.290> how<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:37.650> looks

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.150 

there's<00:02:40.950> weapon<00:02:41.489> stats<00:02:42.260> on<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.680> stats<00:02:43.980> that

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
there's weapon stats on the stats that

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.770 
there's weapon stats on the stats that
should<00:02:44.310> say<00:02:44.870> say

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.449 

I'd<00:02:50.780> smooth<00:02:51.170> them<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.440> light<00:02:51.680> right<00:02:53.319> so<00:02:54.459> this

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
I'd smooth them to light right so this

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.390 
I'd smooth them to light right so this
is<00:02:55.610> why<00:02:55.790> it<00:02:55.849> looks<00:02:55.940> like<00:02:59.920> not<00:03:00.920> a<00:03:00.950> sort<00:03:01.280> of

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
is why it looks like not a sort of

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.070 
is why it looks like not a sort of
stealth<00:03:02.239> style<00:03:03.200> but<00:03:04.330> if<00:03:05.330> you<00:03:05.450> like<00:03:05.629> archery

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
stealth style but if you like archery

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.259 
stealth style but if you like archery
then<00:03:06.319> I'd<00:03:06.470> suggest<00:03:06.769> go<00:03:07.610> into<00:03:07.849> the<00:03:07.940> location

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
then I'd suggest go into the location

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.860 
then I'd suggest go into the location
and<00:03:08.569> find<00:03:08.810> that<00:03:09.019> so<00:03:09.590> yeah<00:03:10.299> this<00:03:11.299> has<00:03:11.360> been<00:03:11.480> game
