00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.549
 hola como estan very well hope 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.710
 Today at the request of many of you 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:19.470
 but a cool day of a little bag for 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.560
 hang from is very very easy to 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.320
 do believe me and it is inspired by 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.840
 a little bag that we had already made but in 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.240
 white color and it was not cooked 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.079
 but this is much easier to 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.149
 make it less complicated and even though it 's 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.129
 known to machine because it 's too much 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.749
 power to do and if you do not have a machine 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.940
 Well, you can take it with someone who 

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:43.170
 have because the truth the positions that 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.329
 you have to do are very very 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.640
 simple and it is nothing of the other love 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.870
 let's see video I hope you like it 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.620
 you will take a snack 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.230
 also some scissors some glue 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.960
 Multi-purpose or specific for the material 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.210
 that you are going to use also of this 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.489
 thread that is synthetic leather but already what 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.979
 you get in all the haberdasheries and 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.979
 Various colors and some rivets 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.490
 The first thing we will do is extend 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:21.000
 our material and we will mark as 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.920
 a rectangle with the help of the rule and I 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.700
 I am using these measures that 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.700
 you have here and then simply 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.700
 we cut 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.310
 Once this is done, we fold it so that 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.799
 we stayed like the other way around 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.680
 and the first thing I will do is paste the 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:44.250
 laterals this is optional but I 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.470
 I prefer it to be more reinforced and also 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.750
 as the pins are marked a lot in 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.210
 this type of material well of this 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.270
 way it will not move when you pass it by 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.310
 machine 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.310
 and now sew the sides 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.140
 Once done, put your hand in the 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.430
 part of inside and see doing this 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:15.260
 shape like triangle in the corners 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.260
 and also there you have to sew 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:25.010
 and then we're just going to cut the 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.989
 left over from the corners 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.329
 and in this way we will be like 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.360
 a kind of bag that only 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:35.829
 we have to turn around so that the 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.829
 part of outside 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.459
 and around we are going to make some 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.330
 little eyes that will be where we will go 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.330
 our thread 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.790
 which will help us open and close 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.790
 our little bag 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:11.460
 now I chose a belt that no longer 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:16.240
 I needed and the only thing I'm going to do is 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:19.090
 open some eyes at each end 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:22.380
 and I'm also going to add it to the bag with 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.380
 rivets help 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.990
 and ready in this way we have one 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.410
 super convenient and very very easy 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.410
 of doing 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.700
 what do you think of the video that has been 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.370
 liked me I really liked it very much 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.050
 it seems that it is perfect super character 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.750
 casual and the colors you use 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.180
 combine with many many things so 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.350
 Well, it is an entity of peer favorites 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.650
 I hope you have also 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.450
 liked and that marlene a guy like that but to 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.050
 despite the comments I send them 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:43.900
 many successes 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.900
 for that I have your side
