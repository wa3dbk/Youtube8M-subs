00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
terrific game it is one of the reasons

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.229 
terrific game it is one of the reasons
that<00:03:43.300> I<00:03:43.360> like<00:03:43.810> the<00:03:44.110> Sega<00:03:44.410> 32x<00:03:44.879> add-on<00:03:45.879> for<00:03:46.180> the

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
that I like the Sega 32x add-on for the

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:51.420 
that I like the Sega 32x add-on for the
Genesis<00:03:48.750> because<00:03:49.750> it<00:03:49.900> has<00:03:50.050> cool<00:03:50.470> exclusives

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
Genesis because it has cool exclusives

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.850 
Genesis because it has cool exclusives
like<00:03:51.580> metal<00:03:52.209> head<00:03:52.450> games<00:03:53.170> that<00:03:53.410> seems<00:03:53.769> that

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
like metal head games that seems that

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.740 
like metal head games that seems that
like<00:03:54.069> they<00:03:54.220> were<00:03:54.280> so<00:03:54.670> immediately<00:03:55.180> destined

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
like they were so immediately destined

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.750 
like they were so immediately destined
to<00:03:56.019> fail<00:03:56.319> yet<00:03:56.590> they<00:03:56.769> went<00:03:56.950> down<00:03:57.220> swinging

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
to fail yet they went down swinging

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.600 
to fail yet they went down swinging
because<00:03:58.540> they<00:03:58.900> they<00:03:59.290> really<00:03:59.530> weren't<00:03:59.860> bad

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
because they they really weren't bad

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:01.979 
because they they really weren't bad
they<00:04:00.730> were<00:04:00.790> just<00:04:01.120> outdated<00:04:01.690> almost

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
they were just outdated almost

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:07.350 
they were just outdated almost
immediately<00:04:05.040> my<00:04:06.040> guess<00:04:06.310> is<00:04:06.519> that<00:04:06.730> fans<00:04:07.150> of

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
immediately my guess is that fans of

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.539 
immediately my guess is that fans of
modern<00:04:07.750> shooters<00:04:08.170> won't<00:04:08.470> enjoy<00:04:08.950> metalhead

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
modern shooters won't enjoy metalhead

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.430 
modern shooters won't enjoy metalhead
all<00:04:09.700> that<00:04:09.910> much<00:04:10.180> because<00:04:10.450> it<00:04:10.690> is<00:04:10.900> a<00:04:10.930> lot<00:04:11.200> slower

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
all that much because it is a lot slower

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.759 
all that much because it is a lot slower
