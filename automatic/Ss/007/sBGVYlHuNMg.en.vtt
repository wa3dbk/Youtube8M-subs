and<00:00:02.490> I'm<00:00:02.610> going<00:00:02.820> to<00:00:02.850> demonstrate<00:00:03.000> how<00:00:03.389> the

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
and I'm going to demonstrate how the

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.579 
and I'm going to demonstrate how the
color<00:00:03.840> select<00:00:04.230> mode<00:00:04.470> works<00:00:05.000> I<00:00:06.319> hope<00:00:07.319> was<00:00:07.560> to

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
color select mode works I hope was to

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.339 
color select mode works I hope was to
have<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.570> lightsaber<00:00:09.570> that<00:00:09.840> I<00:00:09.870> could<00:00:10.110> change

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
have a lightsaber that I could change

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.900 
have a lightsaber that I could change
the<00:00:10.559> color<00:00:10.769> of<00:00:10.860> without<00:00:11.280> having<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.610> take<00:00:11.759> it

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
the color of without having to take it

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.970 
the color of without having to take it
apart<00:00:12.179> or<00:00:12.420> reprogram<00:00:13.019> anything<00:00:13.440> or<00:00:13.679> change

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
apart or reprogram anything or change

or<00:00:17.970> anything<00:00:18.449> like<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:19.670> when<00:00:20.670> this<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:20.910> all

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
or anything like that when this is all

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.820 
or anything like that when this is all
put<00:00:21.210> together<00:00:21.359> it'll<00:00:21.840> be<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.050> very<00:00:22.350> simple<00:00:22.939> very

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
put together it'll be a very simple very

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.490 
put together it'll be a very simple very
simple<00:00:25.830> exterior<00:00:26.400> with<00:00:26.880> just<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.480> kill<00:00:28.230> plug

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
simple exterior with just the kill plug

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.960 
simple exterior with just the kill plug
in<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.890> in<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.250> button<00:00:29.609> will<00:00:29.760> be<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.939> only

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
in the in the button will be the only

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.280 
in the in the button will be the only
controls<00:00:30.510> on<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.779> whole<00:00:30.929> lightsaber<00:00:33.140> we<00:00:34.140> do

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
controls on the whole lightsaber we do

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.889 
controls on the whole lightsaber we do
to<00:00:34.920> get<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.130> color<00:00:35.309> change<00:00:35.610> mode<00:00:35.880> what<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.719> did

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
to get the color change mode what I did

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.840 
to get the color change mode what I did
was<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.530> added<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.100> whole<00:00:38.280> mode<00:00:38.460> for<00:00:38.670> color

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
was I I added a whole mode for color

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.369 
was I I added a whole mode for color
change<00:00:40.670> when<00:00:41.670> it's<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:41.940> idle<00:00:42.300> an<00:00:42.960> off<00:00:43.170> state

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
change when it's in idle an off state

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.760 
change when it's in idle an off state
the<00:00:43.680> LED<00:00:44.129> accidentally<00:00:45.059> you'll<00:00:45.270> just<00:00:45.420> blink

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
the LED accidentally you'll just blink

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.190 
the LED accidentally you'll just blink
but<00:00:46.770> if<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:46.920> put<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> color<00:00:47.340> change<00:00:47.610> mode<00:00:48.200> you

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
but if you put a color change mode you

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.350 
but if you put a color change mode you
get<00:00:49.379> there<00:00:49.530> by<00:00:49.710> holding<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.340> button<00:00:50.640> 10

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
get there by holding in the button 10

00:00:51.360 --> 00:01:00.230 
get there by holding in the button 10
seconds

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:00.240 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.590 

okay<00:01:00.900> then<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.200> comes<00:01:01.380> on<00:01:02.270> surely<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.360> blade

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
okay then it comes on surely the blade

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.060 
okay then it comes on surely the blade
see<00:01:04.050> the<00:01:04.140> blade<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.530> not<00:01:04.650> but<00:01:04.830> there's<00:01:04.980> no

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
see the blade is not but there's no

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.480 
see the blade is not but there's no
sound<00:01:05.340> and<00:01:05.670> that's<00:01:06.420> intentional<00:01:07.490> because

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
sound and that's intentional because

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.310 
sound and that's intentional because
we're<00:01:08.790> in<00:01:08.940> configuration<00:01:09.600> mode<00:01:09.930> now<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
we're in configuration mode now and the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.930 
we're in configuration mode now and the
the<00:01:13.320> axe<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.680> LED<00:01:13.980> blinks<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.310> little<00:01:14.490> faster

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
the axe and LED blinks a little faster

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.610 
the axe and LED blinks a little faster
now<00:01:14.970> than<00:01:15.860> it<00:01:16.860> did<00:01:16.890> when<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.190> was<00:01:17.310> an<00:01:18.060> idol<00:01:18.620> in

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:19.620 
now than it did when it was an idol in

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.860 
now than it did when it was an idol in
the<00:01:19.770> off<00:01:19.890> state<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:21.000> when<00:01:21.540> you're<00:01:21.660> in<00:01:21.750> this

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
the off state so when you're in this

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.300 
the off state so when you're in this
state<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.530> can<00:01:22.680> change<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.040> few<00:01:23.220> different

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
state you can change a few different

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.660 
state you can change a few different
things<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:24.150> two<00:01:24.570> things<00:01:24.840> actually<00:01:25.490> see<00:01:26.490> right

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
things to two things actually see right

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.210 
things to two things actually see right
now<00:01:26.700> I've<00:01:27.000> got<00:01:27.060> kind<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.510> green<00:01:28.220> colour

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
now I've got kind of a green colour

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.760 
now I've got kind of a green colour
blade<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:30.510> it's<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.070> it's<00:01:32.070> strobing<00:01:33.590> it's<00:01:34.590> got

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
blade and it's a it's strobing it's got

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.410 
blade and it's a it's strobing it's got
that<00:01:34.950> kind<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.280> slow<00:01:36.240> pulse<00:01:36.570> strobing<00:01:37.440> effect

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
that kind of slow pulse strobing effect

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.859 
that kind of slow pulse strobing effect
Karis<00:01:39.420> sort<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.229> picking<00:01:40.530> up<00:01:41.330> if<00:01:42.330> you<00:01:42.479> give<00:01:42.780> it

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
Karis sort of picking up if you give it

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:49.910 
Karis sort of picking up if you give it
a<00:01:42.960> tap<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:46.430> see<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:47.550> now<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:48.440> you<00:01:49.440> get<00:01:49.590> kind<00:01:49.860> of

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
a tap I see so now that you get kind of

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:59.420 
a tap I see so now that you get kind of
fast<00:01:50.250> flickr<00:01:50.670> effect<00:01:54.650> that's<00:01:55.650> solid<00:01:56.010> on<00:01:58.430> and

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
fast flickr effect that's solid on and

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.250 
fast flickr effect that's solid on and
that's<00:01:59.760> kind<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.210> an<00:02:00.330> ambient<00:02:00.750> flickr<00:02:00.990> it's

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
that's kind of an ambient flickr it's

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.249 
that's kind of an ambient flickr it's
actually<00:02:01.650> my<00:02:01.770> favorite<00:02:02.990> it<00:02:03.990> doesn't<00:02:04.200> look

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
actually my favorite it doesn't look

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.990 
actually my favorite it doesn't look
that<00:02:04.320> great<00:02:04.560> on<00:02:04.770> camera<00:02:04.979> but<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.610> looks<00:02:05.820> good

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
that great on camera but it looks good

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.880 
that great on camera but it looks good
in<00:02:06.149> real<00:02:06.330> life<00:02:07.310> so<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.369> can<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.820> can<00:02:08.970> pick<00:02:09.149> the

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
in real life so you can you can pick the

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.450 
in real life so you can you can pick the
blade<00:02:10.890> flickr<00:02:11.160> style<00:02:11.550> among<00:02:11.940> those<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.600> then

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
blade flickr style among those and then

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.560 
blade flickr style among those and then
change<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.580> color<00:02:14.820> just<00:02:15.150> push<00:02:15.420> the

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
change the color just push the

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.120 
change the color just push the
activation<00:02:16.140> switch<00:02:18.830> and<00:02:19.830> there's<00:02:20.040> a

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
activation switch and there's a

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.580 
activation switch and there's a
programmed<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.060> with<00:02:21.180> 116<00:02:21.930> different<00:02:22.290> colors

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
programmed it with 116 different colors

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.400 
programmed it with 116 different colors
so<00:02:23.490> some<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.120> them<00:02:24.360> are<00:02:24.540> very<00:02:24.750> close<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.350> each

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
so some of them are very close to each

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.600 
so some of them are very close to each
other<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.890> it's<00:02:26.040> hard<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.340> tell<00:02:26.520> the

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
other and it's hard to tell the

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.160 
other and it's hard to tell the
difference<00:02:26.810> especially<00:02:27.810> if<00:02:27.870> you're<00:02:27.960> looking

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
difference especially if you're looking

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.950 
difference especially if you're looking
at<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.380> emitter<00:02:28.650> with<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:28.890> camera<00:02:29.780> but<00:02:30.780> now<00:02:30.900> you

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960

colors will pick like this amber orange

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.130 
colors will pick like this amber orange
color<00:04:26.420> let's<00:04:27.420> say<00:04:27.570> that's<00:04:27.660> the<00:04:27.810> color<00:04:27.990> you

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.750 

then<00:04:40.790> when<00:04:40.880> you<00:04:40.970> release<00:04:41.240> it<00:04:42.130> turns<00:04:43.130> off<00:04:43.370> their
