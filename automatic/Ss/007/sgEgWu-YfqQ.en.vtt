okay<00:00:01.589> in<00:00:01.680> this<00:00:01.800> video<00:00:02.040> I'm<00:00:02.100> just<00:00:02.159> going<00:00:02.340> to

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
okay in this video I'm just going to

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.519 
okay in this video I'm just going to
show<00:00:02.550> you<00:00:02.610> a<00:00:02.810> high-resolution<00:00:03.810> video

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
show you a high-resolution video

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.280 
show you a high-resolution video
animation<00:00:05.370> of<00:00:05.549> this<00:00:05.790> scene<00:00:06.569> in<00:00:06.810> here<00:00:07.109> and

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
animation of this scene in here and

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.620 
animation of this scene in here and
really<00:00:08.160> most<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.460> time<00:00:08.610> I<00:00:08.639> spent<00:00:09.179> was<00:00:09.360> just

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
really most the time I spent was just

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.089 
really most the time I spent was just
setting<00:00:09.870> up<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:09.990> lighting<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:10.620> getting<00:00:10.920> it

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
setting up the lighting and getting it

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.270 
setting up the lighting and getting it
the<00:00:11.389> water<00:00:12.389> effects<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.960> look<00:00:13.110> right<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.650> it's

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
the water effects to look right and it's

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.300 
the water effects to look right and it's
set<00:00:15.000> pretty<00:00:15.269> high<00:00:15.480> about<00:00:15.719> 200<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:16.949> the

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
set pretty high about 200 and the

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.070 
set pretty high about 200 and the
simulation<00:00:17.850> itself<00:00:18.119> didn't<00:00:18.420> take<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:18.779> long

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
simulation itself didn't take that long

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.500 
simulation itself didn't take that long
is<00:00:19.380> less<00:00:20.189> than<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.369> half<00:00:20.520> an<00:00:20.699> hour<00:00:20.850> but<00:00:21.359> the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
is less than a half an hour but the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.620 
is less than a half an hour but the
rendering<00:00:21.960> in<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:22.619> case<00:00:22.890> was<00:00:23.490> several<00:00:24.480> hours

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
rendering in this case was several hours

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.480 
rendering in this case was several hours
about<00:00:25.050> two<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.410> half<00:00:25.560> hours<00:00:25.920> because<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.340> had

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
about two and a half hours because I had

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.140 
about two and a half hours because I had
though<00:00:27.140> water<00:00:28.140> where<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.590> had<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.949> samples<00:00:29.670> in

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
though water where I had the samples in

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.100 
though water where I had the samples in
the<00:00:30.449> rendering<00:00:31.399> path<00:00:32.399> set<00:00:32.759> up<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:33.000> 60<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.570> that

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
the rendering path set up to 60 and that

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.479 
the rendering path set up to 60 and that
really<00:00:34.320> helps<00:00:34.620> otherwise<00:00:34.920> if<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.160> don't<00:00:35.340> have

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
really helps otherwise if you don't have

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.760 
really helps otherwise if you don't have
that<00:00:35.700> up<00:00:35.880> there<00:00:35.910> at<00:00:36.630> least<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:37.020> high<00:00:37.230> then

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
that up there at least that high then

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.950 
that up there at least that high then
this<00:00:38.129> water<00:00:38.460> will<00:00:38.670> start<00:00:38.940> looking<00:00:39.120> grainy<00:00:39.570> and

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
this water will start looking grainy and

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.049 
this water will start looking grainy and
it<00:00:40.110> really<00:00:40.290> doesn't<00:00:40.500> work<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.920> well<00:00:41.160> alright

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
it really doesn't work that well alright

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.420 
it really doesn't work that well alright
so<00:00:42.660> let's<00:00:43.020> see<00:00:43.110> what<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.320> animation<00:00:43.739> looks

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
so let's see what the animation looks

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.400 
so let's see what the animation looks
like<00:00:44.640> seven<00:00:45.360> seconds<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:45.989> there<00:00:46.079> are<00:00:46.200> some

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
like seven seconds and there are some

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.200 
like seven seconds and there are some
anomalies<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.399> haven't<00:00:47.879> figured<00:00:48.059> that

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
anomalies in it I haven't figured that

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.090 
anomalies in it I haven't figured that
out<00:00:48.360> yet<00:00:48.570> but<00:00:48.960> at<00:00:49.320> least<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.559> have<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> lighting

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
out yet but at least I have the lighting

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.920 
out yet but at least I have the lighting
the<00:00:50.190> way<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.309> want<00:00:50.579> so<00:00:50.730> then<00:00:50.879> now<00:00:51.210> if<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:51.539> build<00:00:51.840> a

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the way I want so then now if I build a

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.310 
the way I want so then now if I build a
city<00:00:52.199> scene<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.860> here<00:00:53.670> then<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.870> have<00:00:55.140> my

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
city scene in here then I have my

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.479 
city scene in here then I have my
general<00:00:55.649> lighting<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.129> everything<00:00:56.190> already

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
general lighting and everything already

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:15.700 
general lighting and everything already
in<00:00:56.670> place<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.149> let's<00:00:57.360> see

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.160 

so<00:01:16.580> here's<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.120> anomaly's<00:01:17.690> I'm<00:01:17.840> talking

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
so here's the anomaly's I'm talking

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.340 
so here's the anomaly's I'm talking
about<00:01:18.230> right<00:01:18.620> up<00:01:18.980> in<00:01:19.190> here<00:01:20.180> you<00:01:20.810> see<00:01:21.020> that<00:01:21.200> with

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
about right up in here you see that with

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.870 
about right up in here you see that with
the<00:01:21.410> mouse<00:01:21.560> one<00:01:21.830> there<00:01:22.070> and<00:01:22.280> over<00:01:22.490> here<00:01:22.520> as

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
the mouse one there and over here as

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.940 
the mouse one there and over here as
well<00:01:24.880> I'm<00:01:25.880> not<00:01:26.180> sure<00:01:26.240> what<00:01:26.420> that's<00:01:26.660> all<00:01:26.840> about

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
well I'm not sure what that's all about

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:34.150 
well I'm not sure what that's all about
yet<00:01:32.140> but<00:01:33.140> if<00:01:33.229> this<00:01:33.320> resolution<00:01:33.680> it<00:01:34.010> worked

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
yet but if this resolution it worked

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.880 
yet but if this resolution it worked
good<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:35.030> so<00:01:35.360> you<00:01:35.420> know<00:01:35.660> for<00:01:36.229> what<00:01:36.740> I'm<00:01:36.830> trying

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
good and so you know for what I'm trying

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:37.600 
good and so you know for what I'm trying
to<00:01:37.160> do

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
to do

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.160 
to do
I<00:01:37.640> don't<00:01:38.150> really<00:01:38.300> need<00:01:38.540> to<00:01:38.630> set<00:01:38.780> it<00:01:38.900> at<00:01:39.020> much

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
I don't really need to set it at much

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.540 
I don't really need to set it at much
higher<00:01:39.350> resolution<00:01:39.470> though<00:01:40.010> it<00:01:40.190> doesn't<00:01:40.369> even

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
higher resolution though it doesn't even

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
higher resolution though it doesn't even
look<00:01:40.760> better<00:01:40.910> if<00:01:41.090> you<00:01:41.150> said<00:01:41.300> it<00:01:41.420> higher<00:01:41.540> than

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
look better if you said it higher than

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.910 
look better if you said it higher than
this<00:01:41.900> but<00:01:42.560> it<00:01:42.710> works<00:01:42.860> fine<00:01:44.110> but<00:01:45.110> it<00:01:45.350> really<00:01:45.890> a

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
this but it works fine but it really a

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.530 
this but it works fine but it really a
lot<00:01:46.100> of<00:01:46.130> it<00:01:46.310> for<00:01:46.700> this<00:01:46.880> really<00:01:47.119> just<00:01:47.210> comes

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
lot of it for this really just comes

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.870 
lot of it for this really just comes
down<00:01:47.630> to<00:01:47.780> your<00:01:48.110> colors<00:01:48.649> and<00:01:48.860> your<00:01:48.950> lighting<00:01:49.250> to

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
down to your colors and your lighting to

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.490 
down to your colors and your lighting to
get<00:01:50.119> the<00:01:50.240> effect<00:01:50.509> that<00:01:50.660> you're<00:01:50.780> looking<00:01:50.990> for

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.420 

all<00:01:54.500> right<00:01:54.619> so<00:01:54.950> I'll<00:01:55.040> probably<00:01:55.250> continue

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
all right so I'll probably continue

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.120 
all right so I'll probably continue
working<00:01:55.940> fluid<00:01:56.570> stuff<00:01:56.840> through<00:01:57.830> the<00:01:57.860> end<00:01:58.070> of

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
working fluid stuff through the end of

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.920 
working fluid stuff through the end of
the<00:01:58.220> month<00:01:58.399> so<00:01:58.670> keep<00:01:59.330> an<00:01:59.450> eye<00:01:59.540> out<00:01:59.570> for<00:01:59.720> that

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
the month so keep an eye out for that

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.640 
the month so keep an eye out for that
and<00:02:00.170> I'll<00:02:01.040> see<00:02:01.190> you<00:02:01.250> next<00:02:01.520> video
