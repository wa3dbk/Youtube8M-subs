 then look that there are very few 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.550
 hours of rest but I'm still very 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.960
 happy very happy here in Cartagena 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.850

 Men here to accompany you in Cartagena 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.930
 what plans do you like to do as a family 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.399
 we like to be on the beach more 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.289
 that in the pool we love the 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.869
 contact with nature get us to 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:28.000
 sea ​​play soccer on the beach do 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.020
 sandcastles as well as very 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.609
 relatives 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.090
 what we like the most, you win over your 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:36.609
 men in football no no no no evil my 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.030
 eldest son, he's already really out 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:43.000
 quite makes me play and you're me 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.740
 they leave as if you have learned a lot and do not 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.450
 my husband also knows how to play very well 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.149
 there is time for example to go out to 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.429
 rumbear or prefer to stay in a house 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.100
 in the hotel what happens is that I almost 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:56.200
 I do not go out to rumble because really 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.030
 husband and I have other types of plans 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.659

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:10.479
 something beautiful and very romantic conversation 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:13.030
 even if for example we were 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.440
 alone in the night hours we do not 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:20.099
 we would go to rumbear but we would prefer 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:24.010
 to sit by the sea talking and 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.720
 talk and drink some wine or something 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.390

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:34.960
 cloud this causes a beer the so 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.030
