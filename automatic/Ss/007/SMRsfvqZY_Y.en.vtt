00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:09.090
 hi people finally my first video 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.340
 I took a little while because I was 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.450
 in da dae I do is make a video - 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.840
 So, I'll talk about what I want. 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.420
 do many south videos and advice and 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.269
 tips for those who subscribe among others 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.570
 But let's start things because this is 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.610
 start is my debut my videos 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.079
 blog talking about ideas to who writes 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:38.309
 whether on the internet are cinema or 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:41.190
 theater 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.899
 the thing I like is sometimes has 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:49.140
 That sucks I do not write without 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.730
 no creativity only make a drama 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.219
 work path 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.350
 I care which of course only speak to me ever 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.140
 I'd rather be a writer, I 'm not maybe 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.359
 is so much that if you write you 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.399
 writer whether it's good or bad 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:07.200
 the conversation is another we made a video 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.060
 perhaps very fragile with these crises 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.470
 I realized one thing in common in all 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.570
 they are the fact so you are reading a lot 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.310
 consumed culture which is absurd to 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.180
 Who writes for anyone who works with art 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.270
 right 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.180
 so when you see yourself a little empty 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.220
 that after this crisis has no more subject 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.350
 never write again and people run the 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.130
 computer will read blogs and cut which is a 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.659
 theme that you give yourself is 11 is a serious voice 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:40.049
 you identify 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:44.040
 It will hit the streets to see people go to the movies look 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:47.220
 cool movies read far above view 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.899
 that you will never be ever 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.159
 liked the content of that time, I said that 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.229
 I would sign it all over where the Wii is 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.439
 essential to realize that when 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.270
 The more I read the more I write because 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:09.420
 It's very crazy, what happened to you? 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:12.060
 Are you reading my blato law here? 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.020
 book our word I did not use it 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.970
 or is 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.700
 word, she is what I wanted to say 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.260
 this morning you can write that not 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.760
 I was thinking this is what I wanted 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:26.520
 say then write he had him 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.430
 excites and reads lets you know more 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.800
 excited to write more 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.270
 it's good advice to have people coming out 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.860
 Evening at the bb 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:52.020
 the levezinho who gets more creative in 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:53.700
 my case and the dodo to write once 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.900
 with tiburi martial she said that you 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.380
 You have to offer something for his 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.450
 Genie ee offers coffee 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:06.570
 I always have a coffee from the side 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:10.500
 because it made me more excited excited 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.420
 and is attentive to each one to find out if the 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.980
 Lance cheered the cigarette and drank wine. 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:20.430
 a beer or put in a rest I do not know 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:24.480
 not like your way there that excites you and 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:29.240
 the second thing that is very important and 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.240
 it's crowded on the blog 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:44.750
 always keep a notepad in your bag or 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:49.130
 in the pocket or the side of the bed in the drawer 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:51.140
 work because honey is very good to be 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.810
 intense or that is the note in the cell phone too 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.280
 It's super cool because that 's an idea. 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.580
 something is up here that we 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.130
 it was not even dancing around the world and 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.650
 Only I hope you catch it before 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.110
 so if the note forgets tomorrow 30 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.020
 years and has never had to have a 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:14.210
 idea to sleep and then you wake up in the day 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:17.420
 next, that's what this is for 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:19.760
 the short notes are to have an idea 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.739
 You have to consume culture reads a lot. 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.900
 see in the cinema at the theater see things 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.480
 different plastic arts exhibition of 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.220
 photography consumes everything you are 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.590
 because you can take what you do 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.020
 You are an incredible poetry composer . 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.740
 but also to literature and instead is 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.750
 all this enriches your repertoire and 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:43.120
 You do good things already good things. 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:46.100
 do not you think it's eller spiritist book? 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:50.350
 I'm talking to a writer, are you? 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:53.420
 need to read bonus writers and need 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.190
 see the text to test the searches in the 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.710
 internet because fucking question 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.620
 because sometimes we read and do not have 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.170
 experience the sharp look to 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:06.260
 understand why the guy is good so the 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:08.900
 my tip is that you even search the 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.870
 understand that the guy is good at knowing how 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.700
 is that the framework he uses for you 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.470
 Do not do it now, it's more for you. 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.200
 inspire hurry because she 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:23.030
 do something 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:24.940
 built a step beyond the guy gave 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.480
 an end 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:31.830
 and write down always write down everything for 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:35.500
 forget your brilliant ideas and 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:37.600
 texts and scripts of pieces and songs 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.610
 wonderful you were to write 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.350
 Good, I hope you enjoyed the 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.750

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.040
