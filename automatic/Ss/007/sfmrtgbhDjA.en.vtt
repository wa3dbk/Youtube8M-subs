00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:07.049
 Halli hello taxi and I greet you 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.420
 a little voting video 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.190
 concerning my europe universalis 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.269
 four let's play 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.230
 I 've got it myself in the end 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.560
 announced that I have such a small here 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.390
 video will make 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.340
 as to whether you agree with her 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.140
 do this let's play like this 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.310
 want or if we prefer not to 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.109
 want to start new because yes we have 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.750
 now let's play the holy roman 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.910
 rich founded we can see here so 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.480
 the world cathedral looks like that 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.800
 everything and additionally belong to us 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.840
 various colonies such as austria guyana 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:51.300
 then we have a few more islands here 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.760
 which belong to us Castilian Canada 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.879
 belongs to us is also one of ours 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.710
 vasallen and furthermore bosnia belongs 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.270
 yet one of our vasalls is the us 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.990
 we would tackle france is short 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.860
 before the fall with which we then the 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.540
 French colonies hereby 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.119
 would take over 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.570
 because goal is of course France too 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.320
 visualize then take over and that 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.479
 means we also have your colonies with you 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.490
 reap 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:26.369
 and yes in Europe would be then stop 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.009
 go on with aragon with portugal 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.310
 the vending machine eventually at some point 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.300
 poland and so on first 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.760
 france to aragon then 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.130
 The highway to Portugal somehow so in 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.610
 maybe even the order 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.970
 sometime the UK does not know 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.020
 that would be the further course of this 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.730
 leak place but should be noted 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.250
 no matter what I put here 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:57.880
 none of this will be in any way 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.630
 be interesting because our military 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:05.320
 with is absolutely monstrous we have one 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.649
 Military limit of 353 troops 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.369
 we have the unit with almost complete 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.560
 expanded 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.880
 We are on a ship with almost 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.540
 completely at the limit 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.420
 We still earn 150 gold each 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.990
 month at full expenses so we have 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.600
 nothing screwed down here 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:29.110
 we have a maximum number of soldiers 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:34.000
 or one stronger of nearly 400,000 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.350
 get 3400 per month that is 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.360
 we could probably be halfway across Europe 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.370
 besiege and still be more likely 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.700
 manpower to get as which 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.550
 withdrawn 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.880
 It was already before we became Roman 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.380
 have established rich relative 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.090
 uninteresting if I somehow in the 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.620
 declared war I'm simple 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.150
 marched over it everywhere mine 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.890
 troops leave'm more 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.170
 marched and it was completely me 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.660
 no matter whether I was with 50,000 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.450
 then besieged some province 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.220
 So it was because I was the anyway 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.810
 man strength available I had 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.560
 I did not have to pay attention anymore 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.090
 and I won every war anyway 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.030
 france has the 23,000 man standing 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:21.670
 What should they do great when I am 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:23.730
 here 40,000 36,000 50,000 here 22 21 43h 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.760
 Set 77,000 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.350
 what does france want big? 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.210
 I do not even need them 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.970
 half of my army and would be the war 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.560
 still win in sleep as well 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.170
 of course it looks against aragon 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.660
 that's exactly how it looks against the highway 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.400
 It would be the same with Great Britain 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.190
 look at the least synonymous 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.900
 There are 208 ships standing here 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.920
 have stood 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.480
 but even our fleet ours 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.110
 plate itself is not too 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.060
 despise 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.950
 we have 50 transport ships here 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.210
 More than 50 big warships are yes 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.660
 actually on the most modern level 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:05.180
 no you do not cost to 2000 euros okay 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.650
 now are on the most modern stand at 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.120
 Of course I will not save that 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:12.110
 I have to remember that anyway 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.810
 that I have to do it again then yes 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.950
 we still have 37,000 men standing here 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.840
 and so on 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:24.240
 long talk short sense 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.620
 the game here will be easy if we 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.870
 not the whole world at one time 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.030
 war certainly does not explain anymore 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.110
 interesting to watch 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.520
 So no longer exciting say it is 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.630
 if we declare any war to anyone 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.120
 then we have to do that before 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.240
 win 100 percent and the 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.860
 While doing so, nothing goes wrong because 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.900
 no matter what goes wrong we can do it 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:51.979
 somehow through feels men or 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:55.560
 just balance by mass again 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:57.330
 and there is the question you want 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.060
 Look at this even further 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.430
 That's why I started a survey 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.680
 link to this you will find in this video 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.600
 description and there you can about it 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.190
 vote if we are so here with it 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.479
 if we still want to continue 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:14.430
 if you want to keep on doing it 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:16.020
 should stop immediately and yes what we 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.539
 then do it instead 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.699
 my suggestion my favorite 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:23.400
 suggestion would be a game with the 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:25.680
 ming dynasty here to start easy 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.030
 let's go for a completely different one 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.039
 now have two games in europe 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.050
 why not even look at asia 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.700
 and let's see what's going on there 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.530
 going 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.479
 or just japan japan would be synonymous one 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:40.169
 possibility that you look at japan 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:44.220
 look or you make yourself suggestions 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:45.599
 I will be a window in the survey 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.110
 will be in the window where you too 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:53.240
 make your own suggestions and then 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:55.950
 I'll think of something and yes 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.470
 Finally I do these videos 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:59.880
 for you 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.979
 me makes fun here continue 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:05.639
 no question I despise I stop 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:08.010
 but how interesting is it for you as 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:09.450
 audience because you are kind of 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.360
 passively participates 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:13.650
 so you should continue here or 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.139
 rather start something new 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.610
 The decision is yours , tell me 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:18.270
 what he wanted and then we will 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.330
 see further 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.550
 in this sense, I express my thanks 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:27.710
 to watch and see you then 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:27.710
 at the next video takao
