00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
so it has beaten the MV Agusta f4 Double

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.210 
so it has beaten the MV Agusta f4 Double

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
Clinton tellers old race bike there now

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.440 
Clinton tellers old race bike there now
it's<00:02:54.470> only<00:02:54.620> a<00:02:54.710> 600<00:02:55.280> but<00:02:55.640> it<00:02:55.730> was<00:02:55.850> perfectly

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
it's only a 600 but it was perfectly

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.570 
it's only a 600 but it was perfectly
geared<00:02:56.870> for<00:02:57.020> the<00:02:57.200> track<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:57.920> brilliant

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
geared for the track and brilliant

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.760 
geared for the track and brilliant
rubber<00:02:58.910> and<00:02:59.600> it's<00:02:59.870> what<00:02:59.990> Ian's<00:03:00.290> is<00:03:00.350> living<00:03:00.650> on

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
rubber and it's what Ian's is living on

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.350 
rubber and it's what Ian's is living on
so<00:03:01.010> you'd<00:03:01.220> expect<00:03:01.610> a<00:03:01.700> race<00:03:01.850> bike<00:03:02.030> even<00:03:02.300> a

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
so you'd expect a race bike even a

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.150 
so you'd expect a race bike even a
smaller<00:03:02.600> capacity<00:03:03.110> one<00:03:03.260> to<00:03:03.709> be<00:03:03.830> well<00:03:04.010> out

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
smaller capacity one to be well out

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.220 
smaller capacity one to be well out
front<00:03:04.490> but<00:03:05.090> now<00:03:05.330> here's<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:05.810> thing<00:03:06.050> this

news<00:03:13.430> network<00:03:14.450> yeah<00:03:14.840> could<00:03:15.140> any<00:03:15.290> of<00:03:15.410> those

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800

approach<00:03:16.370> that<00:03:16.670> race<00:03:16.910> bike<00:03:17.180> do<00:03:17.480> you<00:03:17.540> think<00:03:18.220> no

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
approach that race bike do you think no

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.550 
approach that race bike do you think no
really<00:03:20.150> but<00:03:20.390> I<00:03:20.660> think<00:03:20.870> all<00:03:20.989> three<00:03:21.140> of<00:03:21.320> them<00:03:21.440> are

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
really but I think all three of them are

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.170 
really but I think all three of them are
capable<00:03:21.709> of<00:03:21.950> taking<00:03:22.190> it<00:03:22.459> to<00:03:22.580> the<00:03:22.670> H<00:03:22.790> before

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
capable of taking it to the H before

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.850 
capable of taking it to the H before
that's<00:03:23.390> for<00:03:23.570> sure<00:03:23.720> well<00:03:24.530> we'll<00:03:24.620> just<00:03:24.650> have<00:03:24.830> to

that's for sure well we'll just have to

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.860 
that's for sure well we'll just have to
