be on the evolution of combat actually
and<00:00:06.480> it<00:00:07.350> is<00:00:07.470> called<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.890> runescape<00:00:08.280> dream<00:00:08.519> and

basically what it consists of is me
going<00:00:12.570> for<00:00:12.960> all<00:00:13.139> these<00:00:13.320> items<00:00:13.530> over<00:00:13.830> here<00:00:13.980> so

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
going for all these items over here so

of these goals is extremely unlikely

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.580 
of these goals is extremely unlikely
because<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.449> amount<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.810> money<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.140> takes<00:00:31.170> to

because the amount of money it takes to

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.090 
because the amount of money it takes to
obtain<00:00:32.399> just<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.759> rares<00:00:32.969> no<00:00:33.559> 33rd<00:00:34.559> H<00:00:34.770> items

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.080 
obtain just the rares no 33rd H items
alone<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.640> an<00:00:36.480> extremely<00:00:37.820> insane<00:00:38.820> amount<00:00:39.059> of

alone is an extremely insane amount of

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.850 
alone is an extremely insane amount of
money<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.329> i<00:00:39.780> will<00:00:39.960> probably<00:00:40.469> never<00:00:40.590> get

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930

unless I turn into details for something
which<00:00:43.050> won't<00:00:43.260> happen<00:00:43.550> but<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:45.539> know<00:00:45.629> what<00:00:45.719> I

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
which won't happen but you know what I

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.810 
which won't happen but you know what I
thought<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.140> thought<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.620> don't<00:00:47.520> really<00:00:47.670> have

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.500 
can see on train this is um times to
speed<00:05:02.980> i<00:05:03.070> think<00:05:03.310> but<00:05:03.640> you<00:05:03.790> can<00:05:03.910> kill<00:05:04.120> them<00:05:04.240> so

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
speed i think but you can kill them so

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.900 
speed i think but you can kill them so
quickly<00:05:04.690> so<00:05:05.620> this<00:05:05.800> is<00:05:05.919> about<00:05:06.010> exactly<00:05:06.550> this

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
quickly so this is about exactly this

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.060 
quickly so this is about exactly this
was<00:05:07.060> exactly<00:05:07.210> half<00:05:07.900> an<00:05:08.050> hour<00:05:08.230> of<00:05:08.500> killing<00:05:08.950> them

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
was exactly half an hour of killing them

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.420 
was exactly half an hour of killing them
either<00:05:09.430> 120<00:05:10.330> bones<00:05:10.570> so<00:05:11.410> i'll<00:05:12.130> tell<00:05:12.310> you<00:05:12.370> right

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
either 120 bones so i'll tell you right

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.370 
either 120 bones so i'll tell you right
now<00:05:12.550> it<00:05:12.910> added<00:05:13.300> up<00:05:13.960> to<00:05:14.940> 33.8<00:05:15.940> 1.8<00:05:16.900> mil<00:05:17.080> and<00:05:17.350> a

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
now it added up to 33.8 1.8 mil and a

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.770 
now it added up to 33.8 1.8 mil and a
half<00:05:17.500> an<00:05:17.620> hour<00:05:17.710> so<00:05:18.370> that<00:05:18.400> would<00:05:18.610> be<00:05:18.640> 3.6<00:05:19.360> mil<00:05:19.540> in

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
half an hour so that would be 3.6 mil in

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.230 
half an hour so that would be 3.6 mil in
a<00:05:19.870> full<00:05:20.080> hour<00:05:20.370> plus<00:05:21.370> some<00:05:21.700> if<00:05:21.910> you<00:05:21.970> add

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
a full hour plus some if you add

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.030 
a full hour plus some if you add
overloads<00:05:22.780> which<00:05:23.470> I<00:05:23.590> didn't<00:05:23.830> at<00:05:23.919> the<00:05:23.950> time

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
overloads which I didn't at the time

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:26.820 
overloads which I didn't at the time
plus<00:05:24.850> some<00:05:25.180> maybe<00:05:25.660> even<00:05:25.900> drag<00:05:26.169> wars<00:05:26.380> you<00:05:26.650> can

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
plus some maybe even drag wars you can

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.560 
plus some maybe even drag wars you can
easily<00:05:27.070> hit<00:05:27.340> formula<00:05:27.790> hours<00:05:28.180> so<00:05:28.330> if<00:05:28.390> you're

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
easily hit formula hours so if you're

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.350 
easily hit formula hours so if you're
ever<00:05:28.810> bored<00:05:29.470> go<00:05:29.919> ahead<00:05:30.100> and<00:05:30.220> do<00:05:30.280> that<00:05:30.310> so<00:05:31.120> next

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
ever bored go ahead and do that so next

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.450 
ever bored go ahead and do that so next
thing<00:05:31.540> I<00:05:31.660> tried<00:05:31.960> was<00:05:32.200> clean<00:05:32.500> black<00:05:32.680> dragon<00:05:33.250> and

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
thing I tried was clean black dragon and

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.480 
thing I tried was clean black dragon and
I<00:05:33.820> did<00:05:34.000> one<00:05:34.180> kill<00:05:34.390> and<00:05:34.570> it<00:05:34.960> did<00:05:35.140> not<00:05:35.290> go<00:05:35.500> well<00:05:35.530> um

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
I did one kill and it did not go well um

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.880 
I did one kill and it did not go well um
as<00:05:37.300> you<00:05:37.570> can<00:05:37.660> see<00:05:37.840> on<00:05:37.870> strain<00:05:38.229> I<00:05:38.260> just<00:05:38.560> was<00:05:38.710> not

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
as you can see on strain I just was not

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.350 
as you can see on strain I just was not
hitting<00:05:39.250> while<00:05:39.370> at<00:05:39.490> all<00:05:39.700> and<00:05:39.970> it<00:05:40.090> was<00:05:40.180> just

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
hitting while at all and it was just

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.630 
hitting while at all and it was just
kind<00:05:41.020> of<00:05:41.050> a<00:05:41.169> struggle<00:05:41.620> that's<00:05:41.979> the<00:05:42.160> most<00:05:42.310> which

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
kind of a struggle that's the most which

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.500 
kind of a struggle that's the most which
was<00:05:43.770> really<00:05:44.770> annoying<00:05:45.130> so<00:05:45.580> I<00:05:45.820> did<00:05:46.150> one<00:05:46.330> kill

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
was really annoying so I did one kill

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.310 
was really annoying so I did one kill
and<00:05:46.540> I<00:05:46.720> stopped<00:05:47.050> afterwards<00:05:47.590> but<00:05:48.340> um<00:05:49.020> yes<00:05:50.020> so<00:05:50.290> I

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
and I stopped afterwards but um yes so I

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.020 
and I stopped afterwards but um yes so I
know<00:05:50.590> not<00:05:50.860> to<00:05:50.979> do<00:05:51.100> that<00:05:51.250> now<00:05:51.430> at<00:05:51.640> least<00:05:51.820> for<00:05:52.000> a

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
know not to do that now at least for a

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.090 
know not to do that now at least for a
while<00:05:52.090> I<00:05:52.479> just<00:05:53.080> like<00:05:53.260> I<00:05:53.410> could<00:05:53.590> do<00:05:53.770> it<00:05:53.950> I<00:05:54.070> could

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100
