00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:17.260
 hello how about friends youtube in a new 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:20.410
 video tutorial in this case 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.640
 with these as version 2.0 of a 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.480
 video that I did previously but that 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.750
 many people had problems was 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.880
 more powerful and that's why I could not 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.560
 answer some because I'm not going to try 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.930
 methods 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:42.570
 and in this case a solution for those who 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:45.570
 they have quite good and jamaica 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.570
 Minecraft 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.930
 but it 's only for computers 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.450
 like 4 gigs up ram 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.030
 in this case I have car and terram and 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.540
 I told myself the pyramids like up to 4 gigas 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.000
 of ram and I have not tried anymore but already with 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.830
 that does not need anything else spills micro 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.010
 I showed him how much ramp I have 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.790
 assigned now 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.790
 remember 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.130
 What functions does now immediately 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:17.729
 I will show you how to install it and 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.729
 download it 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.890
 if you have computers of 4 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:28.230
 gigas of ram and more wants to tell you that 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.230
 we are 64 bits then they need 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:38.620
 for example you can appreciate the art 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:43.270
 in the upper right corner came a 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:45.460
 shtick x 2 752 310 in 400 to 500 less 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.310
 of 910 meters 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.369
 I need is equivalent to almost a gig of ram 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.380
 spinal that means that what I 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:58.610
 I have assigned to this game by default 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.979
 already entered by default of truth that 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.159
 It's not bad but when I had many 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.200
 Modes says the guide are enough circles 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.080
 that indicate that ram memory climate and 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.610
 Ready is solved then as you see 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.080
 I have almost a great allocator and it is 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.480
 pretty little to move as is 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.180
 quiet and having so much ram but 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.900
 forward and can not be increased as 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.849
 as it is very out 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.470
 then we manage to do then let's 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.720
 enter your browser I will leave you the 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:32.060
 free description 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:34.100
 and it's going to download here because sometimes 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.780
 here they are always downloaded by default 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.370
 32 bit installed where we need 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.830
 so we 're going to the game of each 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.470
 of all the flame downloads 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.930
 and we click the one that says windows was the 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.560
 of 64 bits remember that this is for 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.650
 people who have 19 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:57.780
 how to see how many pits have 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:00.069
 that is installed home equipment 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.920
 system properties 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:13.859
 and in the part of here it goes type of 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:13.859
 system 724 822 this 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.160
 then then we give you to click and 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.099
 will download but will normally be like 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:27.310
 any common program and then from 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:30.030
 this side as that start of control 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.030
 Java 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.510
 here that will open this panel we are not going to 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.610
 watch 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.610
 here that appears from this 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.990
 and without these pitfalls of leaving these 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:51.220
 codes this command god 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.540
 and I chose the process to the processes of 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.790
 key not only to the micro but to arrive 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.110
 to all the processes left that I governed 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.210
 the sign this 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.480
 this type of memory for example I have 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:04.700
 assigned 3,038, you must have a wallet 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.500
 They can change the end if they do not 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:12.870
 they arrive in 2024 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:16.099
 2030 2048 the shield arrives in the game 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.099
 we do the same with 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.709
 another one arrives almost maria or 3 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:25.090
 almost they bring arrives 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.090
 but you do not need more 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:41.490
 by accepting we close our important 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:50.879
 here already contains a profile 

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:53.500
 edis profile or at least that profile 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:58.110
 because this box 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.110
 what does jvm mean? 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.510
 like something similar 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:22.890
 448 m because they are mb or 3g 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.180
 marked 

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:36.480
 does not fit at 32m 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:39.660
 2.9 hours but 310 megs 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.700
 the difference is much, that is, to have 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.420
 much much better performance the 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.280
 dream 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.720
 I hope this video serves you I answered 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.180
 many doubts why 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.450
 some writers did not serve them and what of 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.450
 his life 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.040
 many problems well that what such 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.450
 with this 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.090
 and that they were pretty good 

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.190
 computers the truth 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.490
 but now with these eleven it will work 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.490
 friends 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:09.870
 up now yes from america change 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:16.440
 says he has when 500 reaches 500 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:22.400
 media of 2,709 megabytes that is 28 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:22.400
 almost 3 kilos that we set up in 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:28.910
 and greatly improve water performance 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.790
 best 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:34.100
 but you what you have 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:37.850
 concrete drawback in the description 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:40.900
 of strings have already installed 64 bits and 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:43.780
 check the box in the suaita profile 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:47.310
 the important steps 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.310
 rivers from 20 years
