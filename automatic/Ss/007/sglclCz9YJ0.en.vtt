00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hello it comes to this video me 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.359
 through here briefly show how to get one 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.610
 pulse limit the ball so one 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:08.940
 reconstruction by giving the signal 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.860
 can shorten 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.290
 and if you ask her now 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.139
 the left torch looks if you 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.570
 normal button presses then you have 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.300
 about one second long simply 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.100
 signal and I want but the pulse 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.289
 shorten for certain machines is 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.670
 that's necessary and if you have it the right one 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:33.989
 torch looks you can see that the 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:35.460
 significantly shorter than the left one exactly 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.620
 so it is important that you know 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.719
 how to briefly limit can build a 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.059
 and I want to show something so im 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.340
 At the end we put two blocks and 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.410
 therein is a last repeater of the 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.090
 set to the maximum level 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.100
 then comes here to put android 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.949
 torch and here's a rescue torch 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.699
 and other factors we do here 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:00.199
 blog and about it in the blog then come 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.699
 twice the last signal in 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.140
 red storm cable on it and here comes 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.159
 then in the end the signal in and 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.189
 Here we can, for example, one 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.790
 Turn switch three and we're ready 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.470
 finished without you exactly the signal 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.119
 will be exhibited and the repeater below 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.630
 this ensures that the signal is received 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.630
 remains 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:27.370
 she reissues wonderfully okay that 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.110
 whole one can also with a firm 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:35.229
 Construction means that if 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:37.210
 I now here the signal press 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:44.200
 you can see that the signal is even stronger 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:45.130
 shortening the of so was here 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.650
 that his signal 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.150
 the repeater gives the signal immediately 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.400
 continue to this blog the block 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.530
 this kappel and the cable 's out 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.540
 to those redstone to this rest 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.950
 tackled and as soon as the signal from here 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.410
 this one like Peter a tick later 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.910
 will be passed in these fixed 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:05.160
 the slopes push the blog away so that 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.160
 the electrical signal breaks down here 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.430
 but the whole thing has a few pitfalls 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:17.080
 Here, for example, the signal 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:27.910
 So he wants to reverse that he says here 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:30.390
 does that matter so here we have that 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:35.140
 signal active then it continues here 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.549
 on this blog on it and these factors 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.980
 so if you just out of the case 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.420
 want to have as it takes place here 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.370
 then you can go here if you want the button 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.400
 you can see that the signal is too high 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.090
 It's quick that the torch is here 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.700
 would become active 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.440
 It can also test if this torch 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.440
 also gives a signal 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.970
 So you do not hear anything so it is 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.170
 actually no signal available and 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.960
 but if we increase the tick 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.480
 Here then another stage is the 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.350
 last signal is slow enough that the 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.350
 can make consumers 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:15.090
 exactly one sees so here comes completely 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.860
 short single and this runway limiter 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.410
 You can easily build it in too 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.570
 you have a signal limit here 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.230
 but of course the knowledge is there 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.750
 a blog on it 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:30.120
 then we put two repeaters on it 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.540
 where we then here this the 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.540
 input signal 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.550
 We will create this repeat on level 2 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:45.800
 and here comes the end effect 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:47.870
 cable out and that was already this 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.640
 Construction was for example at the 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.860
 three times three piste tor used that 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.550
 I am here at this point only at the end 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.140
 the videos so would definitely 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:59.060
 this construction ends in the end 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.100
 width is nice flat and because of that 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.780
 signal is shortened even more than 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.060
 if you look at these elemental ones now 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.370
 looks and confuses that limite 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.560
 used in automatic molding 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.690
 there is also and left at the end of 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.160
 videos about exactly what I have been 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.970
 hope you have fun while neighbors in 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.970
 the constructions
