00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.200
 Hi, this is Real. 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.540
 This course is Q &amp; A time. 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.700
 There are many people who ask questions, and I think I will continue Q &amp; A for a while. 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.340
 So let's get started! 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.520
 HO T has sent you the Hiding Entities and Shadowing Act. 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.760
 1. Right-click My Apprentice -&gt; Add Entities. 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.580
 2. Check Hide Entities and uncheck Show Weapons. 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.320
 3. Uncheck Enable Shadow. 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.460
 ? Where have you been? 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.440
 Here you are. 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.380
 You can do this anyway. So next question! 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.020
 Reimu H is your question. 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.740
 1. Let's add a model that will become an axis once. 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.720
 2. Set the bone to none. 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.780
 3. Right-click the model to be the axis -&gt; Add the model. 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.480
 4. Move to the side. 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.880
 5. Set the size of the axis to zero. 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.614
 6. Add a proxy to the axis. 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.600
 7. Set the variable name to 'Angle'. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.760
 8. Write nil, time () * speed, and nil in the formula. 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.700
 Then it looks like this is turning around. 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.780
 Please note that if you want to reduce the speed, please reduce the number of numeric parts. 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.480
 Now the next question! 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.360
 If you have this question, you can have only one disc. 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.580
 You can see what I'm doing and follow along. 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.060
 Now, your eyes are finished. 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.840
 Usually the eyes of the Digimon are lanterns in this form. 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.640
 So you can do this. 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.920
 Q &amp; A Time is over. 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.480
 This tutorial is here. 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.920
 Let's see it in section 31!
