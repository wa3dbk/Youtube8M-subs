00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
just like sub stalling and in the end

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.910 
just like sub stalling and in the end
it's<00:03:10.709> really<00:03:11.130> just<00:03:11.400> going<00:03:11.819> to<00:03:11.940> come<00:03:12.239> down<00:03:12.630> to<00:03:13.079> a

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
it's really just going to come down to a

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.900 
it's really just going to come down to a
speed<00:03:14.790> ty<00:03:15.680> by<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.739> time<00:03:17.099> I'm<00:03:17.340> done<00:03:17.370> sub

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.370 
speed ty by the time I'm done sub
stalling<00:03:18.540> like<00:03:18.690> there's<00:03:18.930> no<00:03:19.079> doubt<00:03:19.349> about

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
stalling like there's no doubt about

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.629 
stalling like there's no doubt about
that<00:03:19.920> because<00:03:20.489> we<00:03:21.239> run<00:03:21.510> more<00:03:21.870> or<00:03:21.989> less<00:03:22.639> similar

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
i so we have the same speed and right

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.770 
i so we have the same speed and right
now<00:03:31.859> I<00:03:32.160> can't<00:03:32.519> really<00:03:32.760> sell<00:03:33.000> one<00:03:33.209> more<00:03:33.389> time<00:03:33.599> or
