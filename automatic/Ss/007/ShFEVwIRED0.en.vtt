00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.320
 good afternoon everyone 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.990
 we request the wireless microphone 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.090
 coordinate the Real Madrid company 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.849
 I camilo the press conference of the gentleman 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.259
 ancelotti and we indicate to the request of 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.650
 and my wireless crime is about me 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:27.650
 partner 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.399
 besides purchase and a present 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.950
 I think that the team has seen something well 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.229
 play a good game 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.939
 in the end we did not deserve to lose 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.670
 also because we have not had the luck 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:17.740
 to mark when we had the 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.350
 opportunity to score 2-0 to score 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.990
 2 to 1 and at the end of drawing with the 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.149
 many opportunities that we have had nothing 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:29.130
 what to say about the team afterwards 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.130
 there is also a lot of work 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.619
 most found 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.290
 Y 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:50.770
 that's why we had a moment 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.159
 important party opportunities that 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:57.310
 we have not concretized for as I said 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:01.230
 in football this may not always happen 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.180
 they can not play in front effectively 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:07.730
 I think that in front they have worked well 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:13.250
 have had the opportunity to play 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:16.020
 always with danger have not marked this 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.720
 does not tell us anything then I think the 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.100
 work of the whole team as putting 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.100
 the forwards was good 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.200
 good 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.360
 he did not let us 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.370
 to talk about plow against milan me 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.430
 they seem to pay friendly we have played 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.310
 all 45 minutes this is a defeat 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.230
 who arrives after 22 won match 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.930
 then sooner or later I had to 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.430
 get this defeat in today not 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.560
 we forget what we said that what 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.060
 we have done very well that we are going to 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.060
 do very well after this defeat 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.160
 not good this is the calendar 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.590
 the workers that from valencia a team 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.660
 strong about what this year I think what 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.740
 we have prepared the match well too 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.480
 judge these and other copies is that I had 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.270
 caviar can be that from time to time you 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.740
 will lose the game the past today 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.950
 congratulations valencia who has fought 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.950
 much 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.370
 and we continue preparing that in the next 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.370
 match 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.980
 good good but by neighborhood mesh 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.690
 trees we have to think about it to put 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.920
 the team better to try to win 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.550
 Wednesday 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.900
 I do not think that you try in the midfield 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.140
 worked well I think that in the end too 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.030
 on the physical level the team was 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.239
 very well as all the final part of the 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.239
 match 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:38.060
 I do not think it's going to affect what I've said 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:41.160
 past had to go from his 22 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:45.409
 victories we continue the season is very 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:48.189
 long that we have the we are 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:48.189
 well positioned 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:56.340
 in the line we have many competitions 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:58.689
 does not affect in this sense because 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:02.639
 we have other 

00:04:58.689 --> 00:05:02.639
 the things that we have done very well 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:26.030
 I believe that the referee has played and has 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:28.819
 made a very very good match because no 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:33.080
 they were easy I had a lot of pressure from the 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:35.319
 hobby many kicks many fouls very 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.319
 all right 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.430
 who has made a good match 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:00.430
 and for coming out with more quality
