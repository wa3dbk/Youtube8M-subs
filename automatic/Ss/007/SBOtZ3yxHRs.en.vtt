00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:08.910
 Now we will learn how to wash things with 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.630
 using a washing machine 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.540
 how to do the shaman first you need 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:22.170
 disassemble things white things need to be washed 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:25.880
 Separately from color separately let's 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.880
 together with you we will understand 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.810
 it is color and it is white 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.330
 things need to be washed separately because 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.560
 can 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.560
 using those colors 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.239
 first wash the white stuff 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:10.090
 open the lid and on the super powder for 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.130
 white things 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.060
 close the lid and turn on the washing 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.060
 the car 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.030
 Now we wait while you wash 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.370
 now pull out the laundry 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:46.660
 and we can only hang it 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.660
 now take the colored underwear 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.329
 open the lid 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:57.220
 and pour powder for colored linen 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.290
 the main thing is not to confuse 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.290
 and turn on the machine 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.930
 and again we wait while it is washed to us 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.680
 will only get things and their 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.680
 to dry 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.700
 so here we have learned to use 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.700
