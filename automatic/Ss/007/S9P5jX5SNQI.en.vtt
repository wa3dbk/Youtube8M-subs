00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello to you andrew andreevich my 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.820
 site all point dot py and let's solve 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:15.049
 task number 322 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:20.220
 mass of hippopotamus 31 31 centner 25 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:23.070
 a kilogram and the mass of his cub at 19 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.210
 quintals 32 kilograms less that is 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.070
 we don't know a lot of young yet 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.009
 express and the total mass of hippos young 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.899
 in kilograms, well, I understand that the total 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.840
 the mass of his hippopotamus cub 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.020
 this means how much hippo with 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.399
 the cub weighs together but to 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:49.460
 it is necessary to calculate this first 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:49.460
 how much does the cub so let's 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:53.930
 think how we count there 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:02.510
 let's try a lot of hippo first 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.510
 convert to kilograms 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:11.850
 in one center 100 kilograms then 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:16.799
 31 centners is 3,000 dumb pounds and more 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.930
 25 kilos well, because you see 25 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.090
 kilogram of us already 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.560
 one centner is 100 kilograms here 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.220
 just 125 what 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.720
 and 30 quintals it turns out three thousand 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:35.640
 a kilogram that is here weighs so much one 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:38.700
 adult hippo and cub weighs 19 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.860
 quintals 32 kilograms less 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.390
 this is not weight cubs this is how much he 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.780
 weighs less but let's also in 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.570
 kilograms we translate it turns out a thousand 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.149
 nine hundred and thirty two kilos because 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.390
 that at one cent as 100 kilograms 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:02:00.000
 so it turns out so much 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:03.890
 kilograms is the weight of an adult hippo and 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.710
 this is how much cub weighs less 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.750
 how do we find out how much the calf weighs 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.260
 how much is a grown body adult 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:17.750
 hippo and this is how much easier the cub 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:25.730
 it means you need from 3125 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:28.890
 subtract 1932 and we will find out the cub's weight 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.250
 let's count the five deuce 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.819
 subtract this triple from twain triple 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:39.030
 we cannot deduct therefore occupy from 12 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.069
 subtract 3 will be 9 from the edinichki occupied 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.280
 left 0 out of 0 9 can not subtract 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:47.930
 so take there are 10 subtract 9 this 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:52.829
 one of the troika occupied two left to 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:58.489
 deuce minus one is one look 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:03:04.500
 this is the weight of an adult hippo and this is weight 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:09.420
 calf 1193 kilos and we are asked 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:11.250
 find the total mass of hippopotamus and cubs 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.590
 have we need to add weight hippo and 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:18.000
 cubs and we will find out how much they are together 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:20.040
 weigh means 3125 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.209
 This weight hippo but to him need 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:28.790
 add 1193 is the weight of the cub and 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:35.519
 let's count 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:41.730
 5 to 3 this is 82 to 9 this is 11 1 we write 1 in 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:50.790
 mind 1 to 12 and another one has 3 and 3 to 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:54.569
 1 will be 4 what is the answer of the problem 4300 18 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:58.790
 kilogram is the total mass of the hippo 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:00.449
 baby with baby that's such a problem 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.489
 that's all 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.480
