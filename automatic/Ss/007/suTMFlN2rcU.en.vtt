00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.900 
uses the ability in the new snack shop
one<00:02:41.100> texture<00:02:41.670> at<00:02:41.970> high<00:02:42.380> resolution<00:02:43.380> and

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
one texture at high resolution and

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.330 
one texture at high resolution and
animated<00:02:44.910> this<00:02:45.750> means<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.530> can<00:02:46.739> do<00:02:47.010> all<00:02:47.310> sorts

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
animated this means you can do all sorts

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.090 
animated this means you can do all sorts
of<00:02:48.060> crazy<00:02:48.540> things<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:50.400> counter<00:02:51.060> is<00:02:51.330> the<00:02:51.690> clock

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
of crazy things the counter is the clock

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.370 
of crazy things the counter is the clock
retexture<00:02:53.100> when<00:02:53.610> I<00:02:53.640> push<00:02:54.269> the<00:02:54.540> button<00:02:54.570> it

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
retexture when I push the button it

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.130 
retexture when I push the button it
tells<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.920> command<00:02:56.310> block<00:02:56.730> change<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.870> time

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
tells the command block change the time

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.270 
tells the command block change the time
and<00:02:58.620> so<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.519> texture<00:03:00.090> changes<00:03:00.860> this<00:03:01.860> is<00:03:02.070> the

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
and so the texture changes this is the

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.110 
and so the texture changes this is the
