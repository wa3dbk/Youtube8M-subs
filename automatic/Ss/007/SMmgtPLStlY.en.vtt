00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:09.420
 so good afternoon friends next video 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:13.799
 from the kitchen video editing cycle and now i'm 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.100
 I will show you how to work with sometimes 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.029
 amenable to unpresentable and frames 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:25.170
 here we have a frame does not even enter and 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:27.720
 sees the bride on the other hand is worth 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.510
 the bride who is shooting the second camera this 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.050
 the camera is aimed at the groom in this 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:37.160
 situations we see that the shooting location is not 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:42.690
 very presentable and and unfortunately 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:45.329
 take off in another way was impossible because 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.020
 that on the one hand there were bushes on the other 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.920
 parties 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.690
 the fence and the whole structure such it is not 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.010
 especially presentable type let's say 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.370
 what will we do this situation 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.530
 it is very simple to remove the extra 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.270
 elements from the frame since we 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:10.070
 We foresee at once that this will be a clip. 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.390
 I use all my clips 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:18.560
 filter and the so -called white screen 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.560
 which of video 9 by 16 makes 10 25 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.229
 such a plan 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.490
 this filter allows us to immediately 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:34.640
 get rid here is the top septum 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.640
 fences cuts up 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.530
 So 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.060
 there is such a thing now we need 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.780
 get rid of this part of the wall 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:51.020
 what can we do about it 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.020
 copy the frame 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.750
 ticker taller 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.960
 it means we will have the top frame 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.960
 main 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:17.050
 which we trim the crop tab we shift 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.630
 slider 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:24.040
 cropping on the left will be the state which 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:26.940
 we like it better say so in this 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.940
 bottom frame time 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.780
 move a little line 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.670
 here 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.019
 no, so here 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.830
 copy it all again 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:04.520
 and again the bottom we move 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:14.760
 still on a certain fragment of the alphabet that 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:17.090
 make you need to crop the frame which is 2 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.090
 rulers 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:26.580
 so here to some kind of magnitude which 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.580
 we are most satisfied 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.020
 Spread the leftmost frame to not 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:42.220
 there were no 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:48.240
 rusty pieces and don't forget after 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.240
 trim add softness around the edges 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:56.060
 let's say here 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:00.170
 much was added to the measurements of the sit-down 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:04.070
 got the right edge nowhere from this 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:09.310
 get away and so will be somewhat easier 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:13.180
 just move right this way and 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:16.630
 created and softness and at the same time mina 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:24.850
 here's the problem 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:24.850
 dimming the right edge so see 0 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:33.830
 here also create softness you can see that 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:39.710
 the borders immediately blurred it becomes 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:41.230
 smooth so well this is not the end like 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.380
 turned green fence 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:49.900
 but no less small some 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:56.170
 color differences have something to do with it 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:56.170
 Add a color correction filter and 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:11.150
 a little bit choosing where and what we will 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:16.040
 add matter darker add third 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:19.630
 frame filter color correction and similar 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:22.340
 we shade it 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:26.600
 until the moment the picture is equal 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:29.169
 visually here's a picture visually 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.169
 caught up 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.819
 almost indistinguishable 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.560
 that's what we did 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.780
 further in order to work with such 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.870
 Here is a complex frame that consists of 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.460
 three video tracks 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.500
 it just needs to be combined into one 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.530
 the sequence that we do for this 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:10.530
 create a new sequence called not 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:14.080
 know frame 2 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:17.260
 example, well, or somehow there can be called 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:24.600
 there is not entering the green door it 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:24.600
 already at your discretion we copy 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.020
 I clean immediately 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.219
 here 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:45.069
 we got a finished sequence under 

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:45.069
 title frame 2 is what it looks like on 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:53.960
 your main path she will lay down 

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:57.710
 sequence like this campanula new 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:59.629
 video frame from which you can go further 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.000
 work for what this is done in order 

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:04.879
 so as not to apply subsequent 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.180
 film 3 color corrections to each of 

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:09.199
 frames that will be very uncomfortable 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:12.819
 it will be enough to apply only to 

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:14.029
 one sequence here now we will see 

00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:16.039
 any 

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:19.550
 color correction filter which will allow 

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:23.050
 give even more naturalness to this 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:23.050
 with frame layout 

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:31.080
 and put the control on top of the screen 

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:38.520
 this is how the frame took 

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:43.890
 greater integrity now no one 

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:44.960
 distinguish the original fence here is faked 

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:47.790
 in us 

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.900
 that is, anyway this frame looks like 

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:55.419
 much better than 

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:56.400
 was the previous one on this all thanks for 

00:07:55.419 --> 00:07:59.110
