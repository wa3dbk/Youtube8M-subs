00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
the video she definitely has green just

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.630 
the video she definitely has green just
glowing<00:03:12.050> around<00:03:12.380> her<00:03:12.470> eyes<00:03:12.680> but<00:03:13.310> since<00:03:13.460> she's

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
glowing around her eyes but since she's

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.490 
glowing around her eyes but since she's
moving<00:03:14.120> so<00:03:14.330> fast<00:03:14.540> in<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:14.900> video<00:03:15.080> it's<00:03:15.260> kind<00:03:15.440> of

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
moving so fast in the video it's kind of

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.370 
moving so fast in the video it's kind of
hard<00:03:15.680> to<00:03:15.740> see<00:03:16.010> exactly<00:03:16.430> how<00:03:17.210> she<00:03:17.240> has<00:03:17.540> hers<00:03:17.780> so

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
hard to see exactly how she has hers so

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.600 
hard to see exactly how she has hers so
I<00:03:18.410> may<00:03:19.010> have<00:03:19.070> done<00:03:19.430> my<00:03:20.620> liner<00:03:21.620> a<00:03:21.830> bit<00:03:22.280> thicker

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
I may have done my liner a bit thicker

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.720 
I may have done my liner a bit thicker
than<00:03:22.880> she<00:03:23.150> has<00:03:23.390> I<00:03:23.720> think<00:03:24.350> I<00:03:24.440> did<00:03:24.680> but<00:03:24.950> I<00:03:25.010> like<00:03:25.550> it

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
than she has I think I did but I like it

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.420 
than she has I think I did but I like it
regardless<00:03:26.450> and<00:03:26.690> it's<00:03:27.170> just<00:03:27.440> a<00:03:27.620> green<00:03:28.040> liner

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
regardless and it's just a green liner

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.820 
regardless and it's just a green liner
now<00:03:28.820> I<00:03:28.850> didn't<00:03:29.270> have<00:03:29.450> a<00:03:29.660> liner<00:03:29.900> that's<00:03:30.620> exactly

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
now I didn't have a liner that's exactly

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.550 
now I didn't have a liner that's exactly
that<00:03:31.370> color<00:03:32.120> so<00:03:32.360> I<00:03:32.390> mix<00:03:32.690> two<00:03:33.020> of<00:03:33.110> my<00:03:33.230> fluid

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
that color so I mix two of my fluid

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.170 
that color so I mix two of my fluid
lines<00:03:33.710> these<00:03:33.950> were<00:03:34.160> also<00:03:34.490> both<00:03:34.730> limited

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
lines these were also both limited

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.610 
lines these were also both limited
edition<00:03:35.540> I'm<00:03:35.690> sorry<00:03:35.930> it's<00:03:36.170> really<00:03:36.380> hard<00:03:36.530> to

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
edition I'm sorry it's really hard to

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.920

find a green eyeliner though so I just

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.350 
find a green eyeliner though so I just
decided<00:03:39.050> to<00:03:39.530> use<00:03:39.650> what<00:03:39.860> I<00:03:39.890> had<00:03:40.100> the<00:03:40.970> first<00:03:41.120> one

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360

I'm using a sweet sage which is exactly

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.310 
I'm using a sweet sage which is exactly
how<00:03:47.780> it<00:03:47.870> sounds<00:03:47.900> just<00:03:48.410> like<00:03:48.650> a<00:03:48.709> saged<00:03:49.120> liner

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320
