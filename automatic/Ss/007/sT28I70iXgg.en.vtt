00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.930
 here is the repeater god to the star band o 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:14.350
 but here is the amp that amplifies 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:17.039
 both the gsm frequencies to 900m girls and the 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.039
 umts frequencies 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:26.019
 here is the internal panel antenna ed 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:29.820
 here is the external antenna that I am getting ready 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:29.820
 to install on my home 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:56.309
 ok i'm about to mount the antenna on the pole 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:01:00.059
 on the side of my house I find the antenna 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:04.070
 towards the local network that some 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.070
 research I did turns out to be there 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:17.340
 then I connect the cable 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:21.590
 so I've already put a cable through here 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.590
 in my house in my kitchen 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.410
 ok so here is the star home repeater 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.539
 installed in my house o 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.300
 to the amplifier here and the antenna 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:35.820
 inside here the cable from the external antenna 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.090
 enter here and it's connected 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.070
 to the amplifier at this point 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.230
 the antenna is connected at this point is 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.590
 the current is connected here 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.500
 now we explain in LED 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.770
 there are two banks of led the bank in 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.360
 high and for the gsma 900 mega hertz while 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.330
 the one at the bottom and for him mts 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.760
 on the bar 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.620
 at the top 10 indicates the power supply 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.690
 means that the amplifier is 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.140
 connected and working well 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:12.130
 the LEDs 16 indicate the signal strength 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.680
 and we can see that they are all on 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.890
 this means that the external antenna is 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.550
 receiving a very strong gsm signal 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.940
 similarly for the bank at the bottom 10 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.590
 and for the current and the first six are for 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.330
 the signal strength 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.550
 we can see that the first five are 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.730
 also turned on this means that 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.620
 the antenna is receiving an umts signal 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.600
 very strong as we know ours 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.030
 repeater is working properly 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.100
 and that the phones communicate with the 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.110
 repeater we know we are receiving 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.180
 a very good signal from the outside 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.980
 thanks to these signal bars 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.080
 but I really want to see the phone 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.970
 communicate with the repeater I will do a 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.170
 small text using my iphone 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.170
 to make a call 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.599
 here you can 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.560
 and to see that a blue light has appeared on the 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.330
 LEDs for the bench mts 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.280
 it means that the phone is 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.470
 communicating with the repeater on 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.270
 umts frequencies 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.270
 now I'll end the call 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.760
 and you can see that blue light has 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.520
 extinguished 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.530
 ok now we have our repeater kit 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.450
 installed the we receive a nice signal 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.280
 from the outside and we know it is there 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.010
 communication between the phone and the 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.710
 repeater is that everything works well on the 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.140
 my phone now or 5 signal bars but 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.180
 I am very close to the repeater then 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.390
 let's take a tour around the house and see 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.680
 if I still get this strong signal 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.680
 still five bars 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:48.270
 I'm walking towards the 5 bar salon 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.310
 now there are 5 bars in this room 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.430
 five bars throughout this part of the 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.430
 home 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.680
 still full signal let's go over 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:10.550
 I still get five bars 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.550
 I'm upstairs 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:16.139
 I go to this room 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.680
 I still get five bars on mine 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.680
 phone 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.729
 the whole house is covered I go to this 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.729
 room 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.310
 now or 4 bars if one is lost 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:38.319
 actually or 3 4 bars here is so 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.340
 here's another room let's see how much 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.340
 let's take it here 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.719
 five bars here 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.870
 let's go to this other room 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.470
 and here too five bars 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:07.170
 so the whole house is covered by the signal 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.170
 now using the star home repeater
