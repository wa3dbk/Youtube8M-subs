00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
book inner paths to outer space and its

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.720 
book inner paths to outer space and its
really<00:00:09.210> really<00:00:09.480> amazing<00:00:09.809> talks<00:00:10.469> about<00:00:10.800> you

really really amazing talks about you
know<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:11.880> inner<00:00:12.410> inner<00:00:13.410> psychedelic<00:00:14.370> ways<00:00:14.580> we

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
know the inner inner psychedelic ways we

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.769 
know the inner inner psychedelic ways we
can<00:00:15.089> communicate<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:16.410> otherworldly<00:00:17.100> beings

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:17.779 
can communicate to otherworldly beings

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.349 
can communicate to otherworldly beings
and<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.930> course<00:00:18.990> on<00:00:19.560> page<00:00:20.130> 210<00:00:20.609> says<00:00:21.000> something

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
and of course on page 210 says something

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.480 
and of course on page 210 says something
really<00:00:21.600> awesome<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.740> already<00:00:22.920> knew<00:00:23.220> but

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
really awesome that I already knew but

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.849 
really awesome that I already knew but
just<00:00:23.699> kind<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:23.970> reinforces<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:25.500> talks<00:00:25.740> about

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
just kind of reinforces it talks about

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.300 
just kind of reinforces it talks about
plants<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.609> consciousness<00:00:27.800> this<00:00:28.800> guy<00:00:28.980> did<00:00:29.220> an

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
plants and consciousness this guy did an

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.030 
plants and consciousness this guy did an
experiment<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:30.060> know<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.900> screamed<00:00:31.289> at<00:00:31.470> he

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
experiment you know you screamed at he

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.830 
experiment you know you screamed at he
originally<00:00:32.669> just<00:00:32.820> wanted<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.270> see<00:00:33.450> how<00:00:33.600> long

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
originally just wanted to see how long

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.180 
originally just wanted to see how long
it<00:00:34.050> took<00:00:34.260> for<00:00:34.760> the<00:00:35.760> water<00:00:36.230> to<00:00:37.230> rise<00:00:37.739> up<00:00:38.129> through

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
it took for the water to rise up through

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.950 
it took for the water to rise up through
the<00:00:38.670> root<00:00:38.850> system<00:00:39.059> or<00:00:39.360> something<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.899> he

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
the root system or something that he

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.600 
the root system or something that he
found<00:00:40.140> all<00:00:40.290> these<00:00:40.410> other<00:00:40.620> correlations

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
found all these other correlations

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.720 
found all these other correlations
corresponding<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.860> emotion<00:00:43.860> but<00:00:44.280> anyway<00:00:44.610> I'll

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
corresponding to emotion but anyway I'll

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.450 
corresponding to emotion but anyway I'll
page<00:00:44.879> 210<00:00:45.239> specifically<00:00:46.110> said<00:00:46.350> even<00:00:46.710> when<00:00:46.739> he

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
page 210 specifically said even when he

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.340 
page 210 specifically said even when he
left<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.910> room<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.480> went<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.930> bar<00:00:49.110> to

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
left the room and went to the bar to

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.240 
left the room and went to the bar to
talk<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.680> his<00:00:49.770> friends<00:00:50.600> the<00:00:51.600> conversation<00:00:52.590> he

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
talk to his friends the conversation he

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.700 
talk to his friends the conversation he
recorded<00:00:53.910> both<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.480> plan<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.020> hang<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
recorded both of the plan and hang the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.709 
recorded both of the plan and hang the
conversation<00:00:56.430> corresponds<00:00:57.000> exactly<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
conversation corresponds exactly to the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.349 
conversation corresponds exactly to the
rise<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.320> level<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.280> plants<00:00:59.699> frequencies

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
rise and level of the plants frequencies

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.299 
rise and level of the plants frequencies
so<00:01:00.719> like<00:01:00.960> means<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.800> know<00:01:01.890> quantum

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
so like means you know quantum

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.219 
so like means you know quantum
nonlocality<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:03.239> occurring<00:01:03.719> with<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.140> know

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
nonlocality is occurring with you know

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.590 
nonlocality is occurring with you know
plants<00:01:04.559> because<00:01:04.920> they<00:01:05.129> are<00:01:05.309> they<00:01:06.150> are<00:01:06.299> alive

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
plants because they are they are alive

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.730 
plants because they are they are alive
as<00:01:07.170> well<00:01:07.460> okay<00:01:09.140> it<00:01:10.140> depends<00:01:10.619> on<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
as well okay it depends on the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.859 
as well okay it depends on the
sensitivity<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.820> user<00:01:12.060> as<00:01:12.360> well<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.600> know

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
sensitivity of the user as well I know

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.010 
sensitivity of the user as well I know
if<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.200> did<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:13.850> we<00:01:14.850> can<00:01:15.030> find<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.450> whole<00:01:15.600> lot<00:01:15.840> of

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
if I did this we can find a whole lot of

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.130 
if I did this we can find a whole lot of
studies<00:01:16.380> alone<00:01:16.740> like<00:01:17.270> backwards<00:01:18.270> pop<00:01:18.840> color

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
studies alone like backwards pop color

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.420 
studies alone like backwards pop color
okay<00:01:19.970> um<00:01:21.110> but<00:01:22.110> yeah<00:01:22.229> anyway<00:01:22.650> I've<00:01:23.369> been

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
okay um but yeah anyway I've been

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.570 
okay um but yeah anyway I've been
thinking<00:01:23.820> about<00:01:23.909> more<00:01:24.380> why<00:01:25.380> I'm<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.100> one<00:01:26.280> to

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
thinking about more why I'm the one to

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.600 
thinking about more why I'm the one to
discover<00:01:27.210> quetzal<00:01:27.689> codal<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.979> real<00:01:29.189> cuts<00:01:29.460> of

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
discover quetzal codal the real cuts of

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.490 
discover quetzal codal the real cuts of
coal<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.090> then<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.750> was<00:01:30.840> looking<00:01:31.140> up<00:01:31.229> stuff

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
coal and then I was looking up stuff

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.569 
coal and then I was looking up stuff
about<00:01:31.650> him<00:01:32.040> stuff<00:01:32.689> and<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.780> found<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.200> dude

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579 
about him stuff and I found this dude

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.780 
about him stuff and I found this dude

Tezcatlipoca rules the night the Jaguar
that's<00:01:56.399> what<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.729> am<00:01:57.000> as<00:01:57.210> well<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.630> mean<00:01:58.259> I'm

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
that's what I am as well I mean I'm

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.130 
that's what I am as well I mean I'm
starting<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.219> lean<00:01:59.909> towards<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.659> idea<00:02:01.049> that

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
starting to lean towards the idea that

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.980 
starting to lean towards the idea that
perhaps<00:02:02.329> 87<00:02:03.329> was<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.659> return<00:02:03.960> of

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
perhaps 87 was the return of

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.340 
perhaps 87 was the return of
Tezcatlipoca<00:02:05.090> not<00:02:06.090> just<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.450> race<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:06.899> galactic

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
Tezcatlipoca not just a race of galactic

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.900 
Tezcatlipoca not just a race of galactic
wizards<00:02:07.770> in<00:02:07.890> general

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
wizards in general

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.090 
wizards in general
but<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.450> fact<00:02:10.690> that<00:02:10.840> I<00:02:10.930> can<00:02:11.230> recognize<00:02:11.830> my

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
but the fact that I can recognize my
