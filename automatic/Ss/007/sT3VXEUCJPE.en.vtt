00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
shots it's because that's really one of

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.549 
shots it's because that's really one of
the<00:00:11.280> most<00:00:11.490> important<00:00:11.969> shots<00:00:12.179> in<00:00:12.389> pool<00:00:12.660> it<00:00:13.349> will

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
sense for the speed at the table that

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.689 
sense for the speed at the table that
you<00:00:27.210> need<00:00:27.420> for<00:00:28.050> getting<00:00:28.289> balls<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.949> go<00:00:29.130> places

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
you need for getting balls to go places

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.030 
you need for getting balls to go places
at<00:00:29.910> certain<00:00:30.480> speeds<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.439> really<00:00:31.830> need<00:00:31.980> to

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
at certain speeds so you really need to

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.240 
at certain speeds so you really need to
to<00:00:32.820> work<00:00:33.660> on<00:00:33.840> your<00:00:33.960> kick<00:00:34.170> shots<00:00:34.380> here's<00:00:34.890> one<00:00:35.160> of

the drills that I came up with a few
years<00:00:37.170> ago<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:38.010> root<00:00:38.340> can<00:00:38.579> really<00:00:38.940> improve

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
years ago that root can really improve

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.660 
years ago that root can really improve

pockets and you have to kick at that

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.010 
pockets and you have to kick at that
ball<00:00:49.590> every<00:00:49.770> time<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.700> starting<00:00:51.120> out<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.809> look

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
ball every time so starting out you look

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.650 
ball every time so starting out you look
at<00:00:52.140> your<00:00:52.260> angles<00:00:52.820> if<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.210> your<00:00:54.360> starting

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
at your angles if this is your starting

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.029 
at your angles if this is your starting
position<00:00:55.079> for<00:00:55.199> your<00:00:55.320> cue<00:00:55.530> ball<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.920> your

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
position for your cue ball and your

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.459 
position for your cue ball and your
object<00:00:56.250> ball<00:00:56.489> starts<00:00:56.969> there<00:00:57.120> your<00:00:57.719> natural

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
object ball starts there your natural

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.610 
object ball starts there your natural
angle<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.980> right<00:00:59.640> there<00:00:59.940> for<00:01:00.510> an<00:01:00.719> equal<00:01:01.079> angle

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
angle is right there for an equal angle

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.139 
angle is right there for an equal angle
out<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.160> have<00:01:02.280> coming<00:01:02.520> in<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:02.910> we<00:01:02.940> know

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
out that you have coming in but we know

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.969 
out that you have coming in but we know
we<00:01:03.270> can't<00:01:03.480> use<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.170> we<00:01:04.350> have<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.680> go<00:01:04.799> one

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
we can't use that so we have to go one

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.890 
we can't use that so we have to go one
side<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.489> other<00:01:05.610> let's<00:01:06.240> go<00:01:06.420> back<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.780> this

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
side of the other let's go back to this

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.109 
side of the other let's go back to this
side<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.260> pocket<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.830> open<00:01:08.490> up<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.760> angle

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
side of the pocket and open up the angle

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.870 
side of the pocket and open up the angle
with<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.689> little<00:01:10.020> running<00:01:10.380> English<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.010> what

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
with a little running English and what

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.429 
with a little running English and what
we<00:01:12.000> want<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.240> do<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.540> hit<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.750> at<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> control

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
we want to do is hit it at a control

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.620 
we want to do is hit it at a control
speed<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.189> we<00:01:14.310> just<00:01:14.580> bump<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.360> ball

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
speed so that we just bump that ball

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.280 
speed so that we just bump that ball
over<00:01:15.960> in<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.229> direction<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.830> pocket<00:01:18.290> like

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
over in the direction of a pocket like

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.249 
over in the direction of a pocket like
so<00:01:19.530> now<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.580> objective<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.600> just<00:01:22.049> keep

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
so now the objective is to just keep

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.070 
so now the objective is to just keep
kicking<00:01:22.530> at<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.150> we<00:01:24.150> can<00:01:24.330> kick<00:01:24.570> from<00:01:24.810> side<00:01:25.049> to

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
kicking at it we can kick from side to

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.280 
kicking at it we can kick from side to
side<00:01:25.310> we<00:01:26.310> can<00:01:26.490> go<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.670> either<00:01:26.850> pocket<00:01:27.180> but<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
side we can go to either pocket but the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.530 
side we can go to either pocket but the
objective<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:28.950> always<00:01:29.579> be<00:01:29.610> kicking<00:01:30.240> at<00:01:30.390> it

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
objective is to always be kicking at it

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.140 
objective is to always be kicking at it
until<00:01:30.720> we<00:01:31.590> pocket<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.340> one<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:32.759> these<00:01:32.850> two

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
until we pocket it in one of these two

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.240 
until we pocket it in one of these two
pockets<00:01:33.860> to<00:01:34.860> use<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:36.299> drill<00:01:37.170> at<00:01:37.979> its

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
pockets to use the the drill at its

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.490 
pockets to use the the drill at its
maximum<00:01:38.759> benefit<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.900> can<00:01:40.110> count<00:01:40.350> your

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
maximum benefit you can count your

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.889 
maximum benefit you can count your
strokes<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.159> then<00:01:41.759> when<00:01:42.000> after<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.479> pocket

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
strokes and then when after you pocket

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.679 
strokes and then when after you pocket
the<00:01:42.930> ball<00:01:43.020> write<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.040> down<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.549> keep<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.299> log<00:01:45.509> of
