00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.979
 the whales are finished I am the 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:08.420
 afro welcome to a new gameplay me 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:10.940
 I found this game I have no idea 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:21.109
 What is it about is called the best game of 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:23.179
 heart or that there are doritos I do not understand anything 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.909
 there they show me a shipowner and I have to 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:29.599
 take doritos I suppose it can be in a 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:33.890
 abandoned iron and I have to take 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:35.370
 a lot of rivers u2 I think I do not have 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.440
 no idea 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.440
 well let's see what this is 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.060
 this is more or less of the 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.630
 controls 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:50.040
 the disciple 9 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.040
 and I have to get down to those 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.890
 I'm fine 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:12.350
 why it is not said that it is there 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:15.640
 go so weird I do not know how to catch those 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.640
 things without firing 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.410
 ok ya 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.780
 we continue pressure to efe to open 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.659
 ready thanks to that they say toritos 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.590
 alone this game is pretty weird 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.590
 the eyes 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.680
 walsh doubt 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.440
 although it is quite strange 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.120
 yes 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.200
 let's go for them guys let's see 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.860
 thank you thank you thank you 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.450
 because I already have a new weapon or 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.380
 we advance we advance of level because 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.380
 we have better weapon 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.879
 i 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.140
 because it is super difficult to kill someone 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.140
 A) Yes 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.260
 ah 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.959
 this is the craziest game that in my life 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.120
 I'm going to judge we're going to try it once 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.690
 more tell me if you are not crazy in the 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.690
 comments 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.360
 I only yolo what I do but 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.940
 Let's go doritos I do not know how many crimes 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.840
 I have to choose, I guess I should 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.840
 catch several crimes 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:42.140
 let's take the two I do not know if I can 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:44.430
 catch gas or cadiz and gas power 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.189
 no no 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.469
 machine gun I think that that could be 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:51.989
 weapons of that could be bullets not 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:53.790
 indeed it is not that the problem is 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.590
 when this man is worked because the 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.380
 Lock is a gonorrhea ballast more 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:02.120
 we value back centuries amen 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.120
 if the mind the century the mind 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:10.400
 you can not kill from a distance ok yes yes 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.400
 It can 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:26.060
 and that's why we're going for it 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.830
 although here the marijuana enters they are 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:32.110

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.110

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.990

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.680

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:51.740

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:51.740

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:06.500
 set 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:15.650
 the man needs needs too much 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.500
 I have never known that it is montain view 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:30.620
 so far I 'm sorry 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.240
 it can be marijuana and that daddy 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.720
 giving giving it to the flu and the 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.000
 dembow goes like a flower boy 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.300

 I'm achieving them and achieving those of the 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.900
 grain 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.130
 for me that this game one can not 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.900
 go from there to me I can not 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.640
 move on from there if you manage to go from 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.110
 there they tell me and they send me a capture 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.240
 until they fall guys but it has 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.890
 really liked this game are closing 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:44.810
 in which I found myself out there browsing in 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:44.810
