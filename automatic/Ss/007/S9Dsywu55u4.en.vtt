00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
anything on the bottom of my cage is

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.039 
anything on the bottom of my cage is
because<00:01:46.700> first<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.820> all<00:01:47.939> it's<00:01:48.180> extremely

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
because first of all it's extremely

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.539 
because first of all it's extremely
expensive<00:01:49.970> it's<00:01:50.970> probably<00:01:51.750> like<00:01:52.369> 20<00:01:53.369> pounds

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
expensive it's probably like 20 pounds

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.899 
expensive it's probably like 20 pounds
for<00:01:54.329> twenty<00:01:54.869> pounds<00:01:55.280> twenty<00:01:56.280> dollars<00:01:56.610> for

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909

for twenty pounds twenty dollars for
twenty<00:01:57.180> pounds<00:01:57.649> so<00:01:58.649> yeah<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.189> would<00:01:59.880> not<00:02:00.540> use

twenty pounds so yeah I would not use

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.859 
twenty pounds so yeah I would not use
small<00:02:02.399> animal<00:02:02.759> bedding<00:02:02.880> because<00:02:03.329> it's<00:02:03.659> pretty

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
small animal bedding because it's pretty

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.069 
small animal bedding because it's pretty
much<00:02:04.020> like<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.290> waste<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.740> money<00:02:05.360> so<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.780> you
