now we're going to do is going to open
this<00:01:22.320> up<00:01:22.500> we're<00:01:23.250> going<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.430> take<00:01:23.549> these

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
this up we're going to take these

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.310 
this up we're going to take these
corners<00:01:23.759> here<00:01:24.330> we're<00:01:24.420> going<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.630> fold<00:01:24.869> them<00:01:25.049> in

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
corners here we're going to fold them in

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:33.109 
corners here we're going to fold them in
to<00:01:26.030> that<00:01:27.030> point<00:01:27.470> there<00:01:31.670> now<00:01:32.670> we've<00:01:32.939> done<00:01:33.060> that

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
to that point there now we've done that

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.429 
to that point there now we've done that
we're<00:01:33.360> going<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.540> open<00:01:33.659> those<00:01:33.900> back<00:01:34.110> up<00:01:34.290> as

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
we're going to open those back up as

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.100 
we're going to open those back up as
well<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.369> have<00:01:35.570> this<00:01:36.570> crease<00:01:36.930> that

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
well and you have this crease that

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.200 
well and you have this crease that
you've<00:01:37.229> created<00:01:37.470> right<00:01:37.950> here<00:01:38.400> what<00:01:39.119> you're

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
you've created right here what you're

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.300 
you've created right here what you're
going<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.360> do<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.570> you're<00:01:39.689> just<00:01:39.720> going<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.049> take

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
going to do is you're just going to take

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.210 
going to do is you're just going to take
and<00:01:41.310> fold<00:01:41.579> those<00:01:41.820> under<00:01:42.979> its<00:01:43.979> reverse<00:01:44.399> fold

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
and fold those under its reverse fold

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.030 
and fold those under its reverse fold
like<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:48.409> do<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.470> same<00:01:49.649> thing<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.009> other

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
like so do the same thing on the other

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.850 
like so do the same thing on the other
side<00:01:51.049> and<00:01:52.049> take<00:01:52.970> free<00:01:53.970> crease<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.390> again<00:01:54.860> so

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
side and take free crease that again so

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.550 
side and take free crease that again so
they<00:01:55.950> fold<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.340> little<00:01:56.549> bit<00:01:56.640> easier<00:01:57.500> there<00:01:58.500> you

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
they fold a little bit easier there you

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.170 
they fold a little bit easier there you
go

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.680 

like<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:05.090> now<00:02:06.090> we're<00:02:06.210> going<00:02:06.300> to<00:02:06.360> do<00:02:06.480> is<00:02:06.600> we're

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
like so now we're going to do is we're

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.870 
like so now we're going to do is we're
going<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.840> take<00:02:07.160> we're<00:02:08.160> basically<00:02:08.520> going<00:02:08.790> to

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
going to take we're basically going to

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.370 
going to take we're basically going to
take<00:02:09.060> these<00:02:09.210> ends<00:02:09.509> we're<00:02:09.750> going<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:09.930> fold<00:02:10.140> them

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
take these ends we're going to fold them

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.070 
take these ends we're going to fold them
up<00:02:11.990> this<00:02:12.990> way<00:02:13.050> along<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.070> triangle<00:02:14.550> piece

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
up this way along that triangle piece

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.630 
up this way along that triangle piece
and<00:02:16.080> then<00:02:16.230> kind<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.500> squish<00:02:16.770> them<00:02:16.890> down<00:02:16.950> to

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
and then kind of squish them down to

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.530 
and then kind of squish them down to
where<00:02:17.760> they<00:02:17.850> stand<00:02:18.180> up<00:02:18.390> like<00:02:18.570> this<00:02:18.750> in<00:02:18.960> 3d<00:02:19.260> mode

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
where they stand up like this in 3d mode

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.890 
where they stand up like this in 3d mode
there<00:02:21.540> we<00:02:21.600> go

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.030 

then<00:02:24.900> just<00:02:25.080> take<00:02:25.850> fold<00:02:26.850> it<00:02:27.000> down<00:02:27.120> like<00:02:27.360> so<00:02:28.040> what

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
then just take fold it down like so what

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.720 
then just take fold it down like so what
you're<00:02:29.160> going<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.310> do<00:02:29.400> is<00:02:29.490> you're<00:02:29.580> going<00:02:29.670> to

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
you're going to do is you're going to

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.430 
you're going to do is you're going to
take<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.120> along<00:02:30.330> this<00:02:30.510> crease<00:02:30.930> line<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.260> have

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
take and along this crease line you have

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.390 
take and along this crease line you have
here<00:02:31.710> just<00:02:32.070> going<00:02:32.250> to<00:02:32.340> take<00:02:32.490> it<00:02:34.070> reverse<00:02:35.070> fold

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
here just going to take it reverse fold

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.870 
here just going to take it reverse fold
it<00:02:35.550> in<00:02:36.890> same<00:02:37.890> thing<00:02:38.070> on<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.250> other<00:02:38.280> side<00:02:38.430> like

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
it in same thing on the other side like
