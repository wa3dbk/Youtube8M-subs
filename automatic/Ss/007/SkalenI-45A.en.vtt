00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
it's been so much easier having a better

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.590 
it's been so much easier having a better
idea<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.260> where<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:23.340> source<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.119> problem

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
idea of where the source of this problem

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.540 
idea of where the source of this problem
is<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:26.390> even<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.750> point<00:00:27.960> where<00:00:28.550> being

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
is and even to the point where being

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.860 
is and even to the point where being
able<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:30.890> physically<00:00:31.890> manipulate<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.969> which<00:00:33.570> I

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
able to physically manipulate it which I

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.709 
able to physically manipulate it which I
already<00:00:34.170> was<00:00:34.649> but<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:35.370> just<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:36.450> the

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
already was but this just the the

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.459 
already was but this just the the
knowledge<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.469> where<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:39.440> you<00:00:40.440> know

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
knowledge of where it is and you know

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.100 
knowledge of where it is and you know
raising<00:00:40.829> my<00:00:41.129> arm<00:00:41.370> or<00:00:43.820> just<00:00:44.820> it's<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.870> same

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
raising my arm or just it's the same

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.229 
raising my arm or just it's the same
thing<00:00:46.379> but<00:00:46.590> different<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.460> just<00:00:47.910> it's

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
thing but different and it just it's

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.910 
thing but different and it just it's
helped<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:49.140> know<00:00:49.940> exactly<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.629> pinpoint<00:00:52.320> where

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
helped to know exactly to pinpoint where

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.830 
helped to know exactly to pinpoint where
the<00:00:52.949> problem<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.170> so<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:56.480> did<00:00:57.480> get<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.690> touch

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
the problem is so I did get in touch

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.130 
the problem is so I did get in touch
with<00:00:57.870> my<00:00:58.199> Dodger<00:00:58.440> last<00:00:58.920> week<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.579> got<00:00:59.809> an<00:01:00.809> MRI

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
with my Dodger last week and got an MRI

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.179 
with my Dodger last week and got an MRI
ordered<00:01:02.010> for<00:01:02.969> today<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:04.189> intentionally

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
ordered for today I intentionally

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.840 
ordered for today I intentionally
planned<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.790> for<00:01:06.030> day<00:01:06.240> four<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.840> my<00:01:07.290> cycle

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
planned it for day four of my cycle

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.399 
planned it for day four of my cycle
knowing<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.450> always<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.170> worst

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
knowing that this is always the worst

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.380 
knowing that this is always the worst
day<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.400> seems<00:01:11.670> like<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.030> would<00:01:12.150> be<00:01:12.180> the

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
day so it seems like it would be the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.260 
day so it seems like it would be the
best<00:01:12.570> time<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:13.049> capture<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:14.030> especially<00:01:15.030> if

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
best time to capture it especially if

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.450 
best time to capture it especially if
that<00:01:15.299> swelling<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:16.200> causing<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.009> issues<00:01:17.430> that

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
that swelling is causing the issues that

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.450 
that swelling is causing the issues that
I'm<00:01:17.759> having<00:01:17.820> in
