the sole there's a little on the dry
side<00:02:04.850> it's<00:02:05.850> very<00:02:06.149> important<00:02:06.719> when<00:02:06.840> you

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
side it's very important when you

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.650 
side it's very important when you
transplant<00:02:07.469> from<00:02:07.799> one<00:02:07.950> thing<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.220> another

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.630 
size to have it a little on the dry side
it<00:02:12.239> will<00:02:12.450> stay<00:02:12.720> together<00:02:12.930> if<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.099> soil<00:02:14.400> is<00:02:14.580> wet

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
it will stay together if the soil is wet

all the soil will fall away from the

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.400 
all the soil will fall away from the
roots<00:02:17.420> generally<00:02:18.420> you<00:02:18.629> do<00:02:18.840> this<00:02:19.110> when<00:02:19.379> you

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
roots generally you do this when you

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.460 
roots generally you do this when you
have<00:02:19.739> roots<00:02:20.010> coming<00:02:20.370> at<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.670> bottom<00:02:21.060> I<00:02:21.470> would

like<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.800> see<00:02:23.010> more<00:02:23.220> roots<00:02:23.520> than<00:02:23.730> this<00:02:23.879> coming

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
like to see more roots than this coming

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.750 
like to see more roots than this coming
at<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.510> bottom<00:02:24.870> but<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.590> tops<00:02:25.860> have<00:02:26.160> good

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
at the bottom but the tops have good
