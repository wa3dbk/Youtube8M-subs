for space like I said one plant like

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.640 
for space like I said one plant like
that<00:00:28.240> every<00:00:28.840> three<00:00:29.080> days<00:00:29.230> you<00:00:29.470> get<00:00:29.590> a

crocheted yet if you have two you get

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.050 
crocheted yet if you have two you get
double<00:00:32.650> you<00:00:32.770> know<00:00:32.800> you<00:00:32.950> can<00:00:33.250> multiply<00:00:33.580> it<00:00:33.790> so

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.060 
double you know you can multiply it so

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.570 
double you know you can multiply it so
it's<00:00:34.210> absolutely<00:00:34.840> wonderful<00:00:35.380> and<00:00:35.530> you<00:00:36.340> want

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:36.580 
it's absolutely wonderful and you want

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.580 
it's absolutely wonderful and you want
to<00:00:36.700> delay<00:00:37.000> the<00:00:37.210> planting<00:00:37.690> till<00:00:37.930> the<00:00:38.200> very<00:00:38.440> end

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
to delay the planting till the very end

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.620 
to delay the planting till the very end
of<00:00:38.860> May<00:00:39.100> you<00:00:39.580> may<00:00:39.760> have<00:00:39.940> to<00:00:40.090> part<00:00:40.360> them<00:00:40.480> on

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:40.630 
of May you may have to part them on

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.479 
of May you may have to part them on
which<00:00:40.960> we<00:00:41.140> sowed<00:00:41.350> them<00:00:41.470> into<00:00:41.710> those<00:00:41.830> trays<00:00:42.160> now

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
which we sowed them into those trays now

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.780 
which we sowed them into those trays now
today<00:00:43.230> but<00:00:44.230> it'll<00:00:44.470> be<00:00:44.590> bigger<00:00:44.860> before<00:00:45.280> you

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
today but it'll be bigger before you

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.060 
today but it'll be bigger before you
will<00:00:45.970> put<00:00:46.210> them<00:00:46.360> on<00:00:46.540> probably<00:00:47.080> into<00:00:47.500> a<00:00:47.530> part

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
will put them on probably into a part

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.440 
will put them on probably into a part
that<00:00:48.160> slice<00:00:48.640> yeah

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450 
that slice yeah

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.320 
that slice yeah
to<00:00:50.230> delay<00:00:50.530> the<00:00:50.710> planting<00:00:51.100> hours<00:00:51.309> really<00:00:51.670> again

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.330 
to delay the planting hours really again

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.660 
to delay the planting hours really again
because<00:00:52.690> they're<00:00:52.870> going<00:00:53.020> to<00:00:53.080> do<00:00:53.200> the<00:00:53.739> variance

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
because they're going to do the variance

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.850 
because they're going to do the variance
will<00:00:54.820> be<00:00:54.850> spent<00:00:55.210> on<00:00:55.510> smaller<00:00:55.989> trays<00:00:56.559> so<00:00:56.769> we

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
will be spent on smaller trays so we

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.290 
will be spent on smaller trays so we
just<00:00:57.040> yeah<00:00:57.159> yeah<00:00:57.550> and<00:00:57.699> they<00:00:57.820> just<00:00:58.059> need<00:00:58.269> more

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
just yeah yeah and they just need more

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.979 
just yeah yeah and they just need more

warm<00:01:10.750> so<00:01:10.960> in<00:01:11.080> the<00:01:11.170> greenhouse<00:01:11.590> between<00:01:12.040> house

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
warm so in the greenhouse between house

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.740 
warm so in the greenhouse between house
or<00:01:12.550> if<00:01:12.640> you<00:01:12.729> have<00:01:12.820> space<00:01:13.030> on<00:01:13.240> your<00:01:13.420> windowsill

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
or if you have space on your windowsill

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.110 
or if you have space on your windowsill
a<00:01:13.990> south<00:01:14.409> facing<00:01:14.650> window<00:01:15.130> sill<00:01:15.340> so<00:01:15.580> your<00:01:15.940> bytes

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 
a south facing window sill so your bytes

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.969 
a south facing window sill so your bytes
if<00:01:16.390> it<00:01:16.600> won't<00:01:16.750> stare<00:01:17.050> up<00:01:17.200> they're<00:01:17.740> very

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
if it won't stare up they're very

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.740 
if it won't stare up they're very
sensitive<00:01:18.250> to<00:01:18.580> frost<00:01:18.909> it<00:01:19.210> actually<00:01:19.570> kills

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
sensitive to frost it actually kills

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.140 
sensitive to frost it actually kills
them<00:01:20.080> okay<00:01:20.409> in<00:01:20.500> a<00:01:20.560> second<00:01:20.979> so<00:01:21.400> you<00:01:21.460> cover<00:01:21.909> them

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
them okay in a second so you cover them

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.940 
them okay in a second so you cover them
with<00:01:22.240> fleece<00:01:22.540> and<00:01:22.810> it<00:01:22.960> gives<00:01:23.170> you<00:01:23.290> extra<00:01:23.740> three

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
with fleece and it gives you extra three

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.570 
with fleece and it gives you extra three
degrees<00:01:24.310> frost<00:01:24.700> protection

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580

you much earlier so yeah look they're
quite<00:01:56.930> easy<00:01:56.960> to<00:01:57.170> grow<00:01:57.410> class<00:01:57.620> I<00:01:57.800> think<00:01:58.010> very

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
quite easy to grow class I think very

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.130 
quite easy to grow class I think very
easy<00:01:58.670> to<00:01:58.730> grow<00:01:58.880> you<00:01:58.970> don't<00:01:59.270> do<00:01:59.390> anything<00:01:59.840> with

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
easy to grow you don't do anything with

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.170 
easy to grow you don't do anything with
them<00:02:00.260> apart<00:02:01.040> from<00:02:01.190> regular<00:02:01.430> harvesting

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
them apart from regular harvesting

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.740 
them apart from regular harvesting
that's<00:02:02.420> all<00:02:02.830> the<00:02:03.830> nicely<00:02:04.400> rooted<00:02:04.790> now<00:02:04.970> here<00:02:05.570> if

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
that's all the nicely rooted now here if

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.510 
that's all the nicely rooted now here if
you<00:02:06.230> have<00:02:06.440> to<00:02:06.620> stay<00:02:06.800> underneath<00:02:07.220> the

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
you have to stay underneath the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.970 
you have to stay underneath the
cotyledons<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:08.810> cotyledons<00:02:09.170> are<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.800> two

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:09.980 
cotyledons the cotyledons are the two

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.430 
cotyledons the cotyledons are the two
seed<00:02:10.310> leaves<00:02:10.550> here<00:02:10.850> yeah<00:02:11.180> so<00:02:11.360> if<00:02:11.480> you<00:02:11.600> plant<00:02:12.230> up

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
seed leaves here yeah so if you plant up

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.740 
seed leaves here yeah so if you plant up
to<00:02:12.470> here<00:02:12.830> you<00:02:12.860> bury<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.610> growth<00:02:13.820> point<00:02:14.150> and

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
to here you bury the growth point and

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.690 
to here you bury the growth point and
then<00:02:14.930> they<00:02:15.080> start<00:02:15.320> to<00:02:15.440> rot<00:02:15.620> away<00:02:15.800> right<00:02:16.520> so

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
then they start to rot away right so

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.220 
then they start to rot away right so
that's<00:02:16.880> that's<00:02:17.090> crucial<00:02:17.600> all<00:02:17.870> right<00:02:18.050> and

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
that's that's crucial all right and

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.260 
that's that's crucial all right and
again<00:02:18.560> they're<00:02:18.770> very<00:02:18.800> greedy<00:02:19.340> plants<00:02:19.850> so<00:02:20.150> we

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
again they're very greedy plants so we

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.810 
again they're very greedy plants so we
need<00:02:20.450> to<00:02:20.570> feed<00:02:21.080> them<00:02:21.400> sprinkle<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.490> poultry

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
need to feed them sprinkle the poultry

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.640 
need to feed them sprinkle the poultry
pellets<00:02:23.180> around<00:02:23.540> don't<00:02:24.020> just<00:02:24.230> have<00:02:24.380> them<00:02:24.590> in

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
pellets around don't just have them in

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.620 
pellets around don't just have them in
the<00:02:24.740> planting<00:02:25.130> all<00:02:25.310> because<00:02:25.760> you<00:02:26.360> know<00:02:26.420> the

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
the planting all because you know the

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.390 
the planting all because you know the
roots<00:02:26.810> want<00:02:27.080> to<00:02:27.170> spread<00:02:27.410> out<00:02:27.470> over<00:02:27.650> a<00:02:27.950> big<00:02:28.190> area

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
roots want to spread out over a big area

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.460 
roots want to spread out over a big area
the<00:02:28.880> crew<00:02:29.090> shed<00:02:29.300> plant<00:02:29.600> with<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.870> leaves<00:02:30.110> as

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
the crew shed plant with the leaves as

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.680 
the crew shed plant with the leaves as
big<00:02:30.710> as<00:02:30.890> Leigh's<00:02:31.220> at<00:02:31.430> least<00:02:31.700> way<00:02:32.240> under<00:02:32.570> the

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
big as Leigh's at least way under the

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.110 
big as Leigh's at least way under the
leaf<00:02:32.840> so<00:02:33.080> that<00:02:33.230> means<00:02:33.440> an<00:02:33.739> area<00:02:34.160> in<00:02:34.550> a<00:02:34.670> circle

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
leaf so that means an area in a circle

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.970 
leaf so that means an area in a circle
like<00:02:35.150> that<00:02:35.330> I<00:02:35.720> loosened<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.320> soil<00:02:36.500> around<00:02:36.800> it

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
like that I loosened the soil around it

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.710 
like that I loosened the soil around it
a<00:02:37.040> bit<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.610> as<00:02:37.760> you<00:02:37.910> said<00:02:38.120> we're<00:02:38.360> not<00:02:38.450> planting

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
a bit and as you said we're not planting

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.720 
a bit and as you said we're not planting
a<00:02:38.930> two-team<00:02:39.350> yeah<00:02:39.590> we're<00:02:40.190> still<00:02:40.400> making<00:02:40.670> sure

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
a two-team yeah we're still making sure

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.850 
a two-team yeah we're still making sure
we<00:02:40.910> can<00:02:41.060> see<00:02:41.239> those<00:02:41.450> two<00:02:41.720> primaries<00:02:42.590> that's

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
we can see those two primaries that's

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.949 
we can see those two primaries that's
right<00:02:43.100> but<00:02:43.459> the<00:02:43.790> contact<00:02:44.270> with<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.570> soil<00:02:44.810> is

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
right but the contact with the soil is

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.530 
right but the contact with the soil is
important<00:02:45.470> so<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:46.160> root<00:02:46.370> ball<00:02:46.730> is<00:02:46.970> here<00:02:47.270> yeah

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
important so the root ball is here yeah

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.720 
important so the root ball is here yeah
and<00:02:48.140> I<00:02:48.230> pushed<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.770> soil<00:02:49.010> from<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.280> outside

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
and I pushed the soil from the outside

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.210 
and I pushed the soil from the outside
into<00:02:50.090> it<00:02:50.570> so<00:02:51.080> it<00:02:51.200> wants<00:02:51.380> to<00:02:51.530> be<00:02:51.620> nice<00:02:51.830> and<00:02:52.040> firm

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
into it so it wants to be nice and firm

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.400 
into it so it wants to be nice and firm
you<00:02:52.820> can't<00:02:53.120> plant<00:02:53.450> them<00:02:53.600> too<00:02:53.630> loose<00:02:53.989> because

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
you can't plant them too loose because

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.500 
you can't plant them too loose because
they'll<00:02:54.830> till<00:02:55.160> just<00:02:55.400> dry<00:02:55.640> out<00:02:55.670> destroy<00:02:56.150> yeah

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
they'll till just dry out destroy yeah

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.140 
they'll till just dry out destroy yeah
so<00:02:57.470> close<00:02:57.680> here's<00:02:58.340> a<00:02:58.489> plant<00:02:58.700> that's<00:02:58.880> come<00:02:59.000> on<00:02:59.090> a

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
so close here's a plant that's come on a

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.790 
so close here's a plant that's come on a
little<00:02:59.450> bit<00:02:59.570> more<00:02:59.750> we<00:02:59.930> can<00:02:59.959> see<00:03:00.290> a<00:03:00.470> little<00:03:00.650> bit

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
little bit more we can see a little bit

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.740 
little bit more we can see a little bit
action<00:03:01.160> here<00:03:01.340> with<00:03:01.459> some<00:03:01.670> guys<00:03:02.239> popping<00:03:02.540> up

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
action here with some guys popping up

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.720 
action here with some guys popping up
here<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:03.260> just<00:03:03.860> shows<00:03:04.010> I<00:03:04.160> know<00:03:04.220> we<00:03:04.400> have<00:03:04.520> male

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
here and just shows I know we have male

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.430 
here and just shows I know we have male
and<00:03:04.760> female<00:03:05.630> farts<00:03:05.959> how<00:03:06.050> do<00:03:06.110> we<00:03:06.230> know<00:03:06.320> the

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
and female farts how do we know the

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.350 
and female farts how do we know the
difference<00:03:06.470> it's<00:03:07.370> it's<00:03:07.610> quite<00:03:07.730> simple<00:03:08.239> really

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
difference it's it's quite simple really

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.910 
difference it's it's quite simple really
but<00:03:08.660> you<00:03:08.870> don't<00:03:09.080> need<00:03:09.230> to<00:03:09.350> know<00:03:09.500> because<00:03:09.650> the

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
but you don't need to know because the

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.160 
but you don't need to know because the
male<00:03:10.100> flowers<00:03:10.550> did<00:03:10.760> to<00:03:10.940> stay<00:03:11.209> male<00:03:11.480> they<00:03:11.959> don't

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
male flowers did to stay male they don't

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.050 
male flowers did to stay male they don't
produce<00:03:12.260> anything<00:03:12.770> and<00:03:13.040> the<00:03:13.100> females<00:03:13.489> are<00:03:13.820> the

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
produce anything and the females are the

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.729 
produce anything and the females are the
ones<00:03:14.239> you<00:03:14.420> have<00:03:14.540> your<00:03:14.720> crew<00:03:14.870> sheds<00:03:15.110> from<00:03:15.290> yeah

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
ones you have your crew sheds from yeah

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.610 
ones you have your crew sheds from yeah
so<00:03:16.010> see<00:03:16.430> here<00:03:16.670> that's<00:03:16.880> a<00:03:16.970> female<00:03:17.209> flower<00:03:17.720> the

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
so see here that's a female flower the

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.949 
so see here that's a female flower the
speed<00:03:18.890> of<00:03:19.040> growth<00:03:19.220> is<00:03:19.489> phenomenal<00:03:20.060> so<00:03:20.209> you'd

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
speed of growth is phenomenal so you'd

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.750 
speed of growth is phenomenal so you'd
be<00:03:21.230> prepared<00:03:21.650> to<00:03:21.830> eat<00:03:21.950> lots<00:03:22.130> of<00:03:22.310> crocheting

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
be prepared to eat lots of crocheting

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.190 
be prepared to eat lots of crocheting
when<00:03:23.510> they're<00:03:23.690> ready

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.010 

so<00:03:27.980> we're<00:03:28.849> getting<00:03:29.120> close<00:03:29.300> to<00:03:29.330> cause<00:03:29.599> yet<00:03:29.780> time

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
so we're getting close to cause yet time

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.380 
so we're getting close to cause yet time
in<00:03:30.200> here<00:03:30.410> we<00:03:30.680> I've<00:03:30.860> been<00:03:31.520> harvesting<00:03:32.030> them<00:03:32.180> for

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
in here we I've been harvesting them for

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.479 
in here we I've been harvesting them for
a<00:03:32.420> good<00:03:32.540> while<00:03:32.720> yeah<00:03:33.080> nicely<00:03:33.560> fine<00:03:34.069> when<00:03:34.310> my

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
a good while yeah nicely fine when my

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.610 
a good while yeah nicely fine when my
courgette<00:03:35.030> start<00:03:35.360> producing<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:35.959> first<00:03:36.260> one

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
courgette start producing the first one

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.580
