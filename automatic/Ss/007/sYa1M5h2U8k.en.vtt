00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.850 
fish so his net is sitting over on the

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:49.600 

we'll<00:00:37.489> go<00:00:37.700> walk<00:00:38.000> down

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:58.000 

nice<00:00:50.149> Bowl<00:00:50.480> and<00:00:54.700> she's<00:00:55.700> off<00:00:56.680> that's<00:00:57.680> the<00:00:57.829> thing

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
nice Bowl and she's off that's the thing

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.950 
nice Bowl and she's off that's the thing
about<00:00:58.040> fishing<00:00:58.730> fishing<00:00:59.210> the<00:00:59.449> reef<00:00:59.660> there's

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
about fishing fishing the reef there's

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.990 
about fishing fishing the reef there's
always<00:01:00.110> that<00:01:00.350> chance<00:01:00.670> you<00:01:01.670> know<00:01:01.790> you're<00:01:01.910> gonna

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
always that chance you know you're gonna

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.750 
always that chance you know you're gonna
get<00:01:02.210> a<00:01:02.269> monster<00:01:02.750> fish<00:01:03.019> and<00:01:03.410> get<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:04.430> other<00:01:04.550> day

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
get a monster fish and get the other day

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.359 
get a monster fish and get the other day
got<00:01:04.940> a<00:01:05.000> couple<00:01:05.239> of<00:01:05.420> 20s<00:01:05.810> and<00:01:06.080> so<00:01:06.320> that's<00:01:07.190> one<00:01:07.340> of

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
got a couple of 20s and so that's one of

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.670 
got a couple of 20s and so that's one of
the<00:01:07.490> reasons<00:01:07.790> we<00:01:07.909> keep<00:01:08.090> coming<00:01:08.360> back<00:01:08.680> the

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
the reasons we keep coming back the

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.880 
the reasons we keep coming back the
conditions<00:01:10.190> are<00:01:10.369> a<00:01:10.400> little<00:01:10.490> bit<00:01:10.759> different

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
conditions are a little bit different

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.190 
conditions are a little bit different
the<00:01:12.890> waters<00:01:13.280> got<00:01:13.430> about<00:01:13.640> two<00:01:14.030> to<00:01:14.900> three<00:01:14.930> feet

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
the waters got about two to three feet

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.240 
the waters got about two to three feet
of<00:01:15.590> clarity<00:01:16.149> and<00:01:17.149> when<00:01:17.659> it<00:01:17.750> has<00:01:17.930> a<00:01:18.440> little<00:01:19.009> out

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
of clarity and when it has a little out

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.160 
of clarity and when it has a little out
color<00:01:19.550> like<00:01:19.820> this<00:01:19.970> it<00:01:20.600> changes<00:01:20.630> your

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
color like this it changes your

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.460 
color like this it changes your
strategies<00:01:21.800> just<00:01:22.130> a<00:01:22.250> little<00:01:22.520> bit<00:01:22.670> in<00:01:23.470> clearer

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
strategies just a little bit in clearer

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.240 
strategies just a little bit in clearer
water<00:01:25.060> you<00:01:26.060> can<00:01:26.240> get<00:01:26.360> away<00:01:26.660> with<00:01:27.220> you<00:01:28.220> know

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
water you can get away with you know

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.660 
water you can get away with you know
natural<00:01:28.880> colored<00:01:29.390> flies<00:01:30.340> things<00:01:31.340> that<00:01:31.520> are

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
natural colored flies things that are

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.770 
natural colored flies things that are
really<00:01:32.619> really<00:01:33.619> subtle<00:01:34.009> really<00:01:34.670> done<00:01:34.940> well

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
really really subtle really done well

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.060 
really really subtle really done well
tied<00:01:36.170> perfect<00:01:37.100> flies<00:01:38.060> for<00:01:38.679> clear<00:01:39.679> water<00:01:39.950> that

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
tied perfect flies for clear water that

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.190 
tied perfect flies for clear water that
looks<00:01:40.310> just<00:01:40.460> like<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:40.820> bug<00:01:41.000> but<00:01:41.600> in<00:01:41.720> this<00:01:41.899> kind

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
looks just like the bug but in this kind

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.029 
looks just like the bug but in this kind
of<00:01:42.289> water<00:01:43.300> typically<00:01:44.440> you<00:01:45.440> know<00:01:45.560> those<00:01:45.770> flies

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
of water typically you know those flies

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.480 
of water typically you know those flies
will<00:01:46.310> work<00:01:46.580> but<00:01:47.240> you're<00:01:47.869> probably<00:01:48.250> standing<00:01:49.250> a

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
will work but you're probably standing a

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.609 
will work but you're probably standing a
better<00:01:49.729> chance<00:01:50.149> fishing<00:01:51.080> something<00:01:51.470> with<00:01:51.590> a

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
better chance fishing something with a

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.919 
better chance fishing something with a
little<00:01:51.979> bit<00:01:52.100> of<00:01:52.130> Flash<00:01:52.520> to<00:01:52.909> it<00:01:53.090> a<00:01:53.330> little<00:01:53.810> bit

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
little bit of Flash to it a little bit

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:58.320 
little bit of Flash to it a little bit
of<00:01:54.140> flash<00:01:55.009> abou<00:01:55.369> on<00:01:55.640> it<00:01:55.940> or<00:01:56.470> something<00:01:57.470> like

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
of flash abou on it or something like

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.169 
of flash abou on it or something like
we've<00:01:59.330> been<00:01:59.479> catching<00:01:59.690> them<00:02:00.020> on<00:02:00.670> hares<00:02:01.670> here

00:02:02.169 --> 00:02:02.179 
we've been catching them on hares here

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.520 
we've been catching them on hares here
with<00:02:02.479> flash<00:02:03.170> back<00:02:04.119> pinks<00:02:05.119> all<00:02:05.330> bugs<00:02:05.690> stuff

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
with flash back pinks all bugs stuff

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.800 
with flash back pinks all bugs stuff
that<00:02:06.709> has<00:02:06.890> white<00:02:07.220> color<00:02:07.580> to<00:02:07.700> it<00:02:08.060> and<00:02:08.239> when

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
that has white color to it and when

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.540 
that has white color to it and when
you're<00:02:08.959> fishing<00:02:09.140> this<00:02:09.470> kind<00:02:09.709> of<00:02:09.770> slightly<00:02:10.250> off

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
you're fishing this kind of slightly off

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.020 
you're fishing this kind of slightly off
colored<00:02:10.970> water<00:02:12.130> good<00:02:13.130> chances<00:02:13.580> are<00:02:13.790> you're

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
colored water good chances are you're

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.750 
colored water good chances are you're
going<00:02:14.209> to<00:02:14.300> fish<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:15.050> scenes<00:02:15.349> and<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:16.310> kind<00:02:16.670> of

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
going to fish the scenes and and kind of

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.150 
going to fish the scenes and and kind of
the<00:02:16.880> slack<00:02:17.270> water<00:02:17.569> and<00:02:17.930> twitch<00:02:18.590> that<00:02:18.830> fly

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
the slack water and twitch that fly

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.979 
the slack water and twitch that fly
through<00:02:19.520> that<00:02:19.700> slack<00:02:20.150> water<00:02:20.480> just<00:02:20.810> a<00:02:20.959> little

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
through that slack water just a little

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.589 
through that slack water just a little
bit<00:02:21.440> so<00:02:22.160> they<00:02:22.280> get<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:22.489> better<00:02:22.580> look<00:02:23.270> at<00:02:23.390> that

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
bit so they get a better look at that

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.869 
bit so they get a better look at that
fly<00:02:23.900> it's<00:02:24.470> not<00:02:24.709> to<00:02:24.890> say<00:02:25.069> that<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.370> naturals

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
fly it's not to say that the naturals

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.960 
fly it's not to say that the naturals
aren't<00:02:26.150> going<00:02:26.300> to<00:02:26.360> work<00:02:26.569> but<00:02:27.349> typically<00:02:27.970> the

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
aren't going to work but typically the

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.089 
aren't going to work but typically the
Flies<00:02:29.209> with<00:02:29.510> a<00:02:29.540> little<00:02:29.930> bit<00:02:30.110> more<00:02:30.319> flash<00:02:30.770> to

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
Flies with a little bit more flash to

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:32.949 
Flies with a little bit more flash to
them<00:02:31.220> a<00:02:31.280> little<00:02:31.430> bit<00:02:31.550> more<00:02:31.790> color<00:02:32.090> and<00:02:32.750> these

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
them a little bit more color and these

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.190 
them a little bit more color and these
conditions<00:02:33.260> may<00:02:33.680> be<00:02:33.800> a<00:02:33.950> little<00:02:34.129> bit<00:02:34.340> of<00:02:34.489> white

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
conditions may be a little bit of white

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
conditions may be a little bit of white
probably<00:02:36.200> are<00:02:36.290> going<00:02:36.410> to<00:02:36.500> serve<00:02:36.709> you<00:02:36.890> a<00:02:36.920> little

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
probably are going to serve you a little

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.729 
probably are going to serve you a little
bit<00:02:37.340> better<00:02:37.580> so<00:02:38.180> again<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.750> lot<00:02:39.230> of<00:02:39.260> it<00:02:39.440> is<00:02:39.560> about

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
bit better so again a lot of it is about

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.150 
bit better so again a lot of it is about
