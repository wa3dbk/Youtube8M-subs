minecraft video and he inspired me to
create<00:01:21.720> my<00:01:21.930> own<00:01:22.140> zombie<00:01:22.619> trapping<00:01:23.250> thing

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
create my own zombie trapping thing

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.320 
create my own zombie trapping thing
which<00:01:24.540> basically<00:01:25.020> i<00:01:25.820> found<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.909> little<00:01:27.030> dungeon

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
which basically i found a little dungeon

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.170 
which basically i found a little dungeon
was<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.750> mob<00:01:28.259> spawner<00:01:28.439> or<00:01:29.009> monster<00:01:29.549> spawner<00:01:29.850> and

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
was a mob spawner or monster spawner and

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.030 
was a mob spawner or monster spawner and
made<00:01:31.170> one<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.470> these<00:01:31.970> contraptions<00:01:32.970> and

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
made one of these contraptions and

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.620 
made one of these contraptions and
hopefully<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.070> skeleton<00:01:35.790> will<00:01:35.970> spawn<00:01:36.270> i<00:01:36.479> can

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
hopefully a skeleton will spawn i can

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.670 
hopefully a skeleton will spawn i can
show<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.810> exactly<00:01:37.200> what<00:01:37.590> happens<00:01:39.290> and<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.560> the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
show you exactly what happens and so the

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.350 
show you exactly what happens and so the
very<00:01:40.829> simple<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.430> make<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:42.150> pretty

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
very simple to make this pretty

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.999 
very simple to make this pretty
self-explanatory<00:01:42.780> really<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.680> just<00:01:43.799> want

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
self-explanatory really you just want

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.569 
self-explanatory really you just want
some<00:01:44.159> water<00:01:44.399> underneath<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.470> cage<00:01:46.579> which

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
some water underneath the cage which

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.930 
some water underneath the cage which
kind<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.880> flawed<00:01:48.149> stone<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.780> then

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 
kind of flawed stone and then

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.390 
kind of flawed stone and then
the<00:01:50.720> skeletons<00:01:51.530> will<00:01:51.680> drop<00:01:51.980> down<00:01:52.010> to<00:01:52.310> the

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.620 
is my beautiful beautiful creation and
it<00:06:20.340> actually<00:06:20.460> works<00:06:20.820> really<00:06:21.000> well<00:06:21.240> because

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
it actually works really well because

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.750 
it actually works really well because
one<00:06:21.900> time<00:06:22.290> I<00:06:22.500> took<00:06:22.560> a<00:06:22.830> boat<00:06:23.070> out<00:06:23.100> and<00:06:23.550> I<00:06:23.580> could

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:23.760 
one time I took a boat out and I could

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.430 
one time I took a boat out and I could
pretty<00:06:23.910> much<00:06:24.030> if<00:06:24.300> I<00:06:24.390> turn<00:06:24.570> off<00:06:24.600> the<00:06:24.780> fog<00:06:25.110> I<00:06:25.260> can

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 
pretty much if I turn off the fog I can

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.160 
pretty much if I turn off the fog I can
pretty<00:06:25.560> much<00:06:25.680> see<00:06:25.950> this<00:06:26.130> from<00:06:26.340> almost<00:06:26.550> any<00:06:26.820> way

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:27.170 
pretty much see this from almost any way

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.570 
pretty much see this from almost any way
I<00:06:28.170> made<00:06:28.440> a<00:06:28.470> little<00:06:28.680> ladder<00:06:28.980> so<00:06:29.190> I<00:06:29.220> can<00:06:29.400> get<00:06:29.520> to

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
I made a little ladder so I can get to

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.180 
I made a little ladder so I can get to
the<00:06:29.790> top<00:06:30.060> as<00:06:30.240> well<00:06:30.420> and<00:06:30.830> I<00:06:31.830> was<00:06:31.860> originally

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
the top as well and I was originally

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.950 
the top as well and I was originally
going<00:06:32.580> to<00:06:32.640> fill<00:06:32.910> the<00:06:33.060> whole<00:06:33.240> thing<00:06:33.480> with<00:06:33.660> lava

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 
going to fill the whole thing with lava

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.030 
going to fill the whole thing with lava
so<00:06:34.860> it'd<00:06:34.980> be<00:06:35.130> really<00:06:35.340> Chloe<00:06:35.790> but<00:06:36.210> I<00:06:36.800> decided<00:06:37.800> I

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:38.040 
so it'd be really Chloe but I decided I

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.900 
so it'd be really Chloe but I decided I
won't<00:06:38.280> do<00:06:38.520> that<00:06:40.010> just<00:06:41.010> because<00:06:41.370> things<00:06:41.610> get

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:41.910 
won't do that just because things get

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:46.130 
won't do that just because things get
really<00:06:42.150> messy<00:06:42.690> with<00:06:42.810> lava<00:06:44.690> she<00:06:45.690> had<00:06:45.780> this<00:06:45.900> is

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:46.140 
really messy with lava she had this is

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:50.090 
really messy with lava she had this is
pretty<00:06:46.440> much<00:06:46.620> the<00:06:46.680> lighthouse<00:06:47.460> I<00:06:48.800> also<00:06:49.800> made

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:50.100
