00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
is a mod that adds new textures to all

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.780 
is a mod that adds new textures to all
the<00:00:07.200> potions<00:00:07.589> in<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.710> game<00:00:07.980> that<00:00:08.280> reflect

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
the potions in the game that reflect

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.150 
the potions in the game that reflect
what<00:00:09.059> kind<00:00:09.300> of<00:00:09.360> potions<00:00:09.750> they<00:00:09.870> are<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.349> all

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
what kind of potions they are and all

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.709

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
the potion textures are 1k and

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.419 
the potion textures are 1k and
resolution<00:00:13.440> so<00:00:13.679> it's<00:00:14.099> pretty<00:00:14.280> high

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
resolution so it's pretty high

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.029 
resolution so it's pretty high
resolution<00:00:15.000> for<00:00:15.120> such<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.299> small<00:00:15.599> object<00:00:16.139> so

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
resolution for such a small object so

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.890 
resolution for such a small object so
I'm<00:00:17.100> going<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.279> go<00:00:17.340> ahead<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.640> look<00:00:17.940> about

go<00:00:20.699> over<00:00:20.760> some<00:00:21.000> more<00:00:21.150> details<00:00:21.449> here<00:00:21.660> all<00:00:22.439> right

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
go over some more details here all right

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.160 
go over some more details here all right
whoops<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.699> for<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.180> Cure<00:00:24.330> poison<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.960> has<00:00:25.140> a

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
whoops so for the Cure poison it has a

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.070 
whoops so for the Cure poison it has a
little<00:00:25.500> snake<00:00:25.920> simple<00:00:26.460> with<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.820> with<00:00:27.390> the

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
little snake simple with the with the

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.509 
little snake simple with the with the
poison<00:00:28.470> coming<00:00:28.769> out<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.130> kind<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.340> signify

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
poison coming out to kind of signify

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.700 
poison coming out to kind of signify
that<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.240> that's<00:00:30.750> just<00:00:30.929> an<00:00:31.019> example<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.500> how

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
that and that's just an example of how

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.520 
that and that's just an example of how
everything<00:00:32.520> in<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.669> game<00:00:32.910> has<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.870> new<00:00:34.290> little

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
everything in the game has a new little

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.639 
everything in the game has a new little
symbol<00:00:34.950> now<00:00:35.120> for<00:00:36.140> what<00:00:37.140> they<00:00:37.290> kind<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.530> reflect

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
symbol now for what they kind of reflect

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.770 
symbol now for what they kind of reflect
so<00:00:38.100> for<00:00:38.370> example<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:38.879> elixir<00:00:39.090> resists<00:00:39.600> fire

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
so for example this elixir resists fire

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.410 
so for example this elixir resists fire
has<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.140> dragon<00:00:40.620> on<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.940> lot<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.239> people

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
has the dragon on it and a lot of people

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.180 
has the dragon on it and a lot of people
associate<00:00:42.780> dragons<00:00:43.260> with<00:00:43.379> fire<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:43.920> that's

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
associate dragons with fire so that's

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.240 
associate dragons with fire so that's
pretty<00:00:44.430> obvious<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.620> the<00:00:46.620> emblems<00:00:47.039> will

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
pretty obvious and the emblems will

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.880 
pretty obvious and the emblems will
increase<00:00:47.670> with<00:00:48.239> strength<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.410> potion<00:00:49.739> so

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
increase with strength of the potion so

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.069 
increase with strength of the potion so
they<00:00:49.980> might<00:00:50.129> change<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.510> design<00:00:51.899> might

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
they might change and that design might

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.049 
they might change and that design might
change<00:00:52.289> as<00:00:52.469> well

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
change as well

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.090 
change as well
so<00:00:54.059> for<00:00:54.239> instance<00:00:54.329> here's<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.840> poison<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:55.980> it

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
so for instance here's a poison so it

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.959 
so for instance here's a poison so it
has<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.219> little<00:00:56.460> skull<00:00:56.910> symbol<00:00:57.149> on<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.590> and<00:00:58.969> this

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
has a little skull symbol on it and this

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.520 
has a little skull symbol on it and this
is<00:01:00.120> applied<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.510> all<00:01:00.539> potions<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.170> poisons

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
is applied to all potions of poisons

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.850 
is applied to all potions of poisons
within<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.859> game<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:04.379> mod<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.619> pretty

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
within the game and the mod is pretty

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.010 
within the game and the mod is pretty
big<00:01:05.100> for<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> download<00:01:06.030> it's<00:01:06.210> about<00:01:06.390> 61

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
big for a download it's about 61

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.740 
big for a download it's about 61
megabytes<00:01:07.590> as<00:01:07.890> an<00:01:08.400> archive<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:09.180> there's<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.570> lot

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
megabytes as an archive so there's a lot

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.240 
megabytes as an archive so there's a lot
of<00:01:09.869> new<00:01:09.990> textures<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.590> game<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:10.920> this

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
of new textures in the game and this

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.770 
of new textures in the game and this
really<00:01:11.490> adds<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.760> lot<00:01:11.939> because<00:01:12.240> every<00:01:12.659> single

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
really adds a lot because every single

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.120 
really adds a lot because every single
potion<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.229> different<00:01:13.619> like<00:01:13.710> for<00:01:14.040> example

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
potion is different like for example

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.340 
potion is different like for example
this<00:01:14.490> minor<00:01:15.060> stamina<00:01:15.509> potion<00:01:15.659> has<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.049> little

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
this minor stamina potion has a little

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.160 
this minor stamina potion has a little
Viking<00:01:16.799> with<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.340> mug<00:01:18.560> to<00:01:19.560> signify<00:01:19.920> stamina<00:01:20.549> and

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
Viking with a mug to signify stamina and

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.090 
Viking with a mug to signify stamina and
overall<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.200> really<00:01:22.380> like<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.590> mod<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.979> will

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100
