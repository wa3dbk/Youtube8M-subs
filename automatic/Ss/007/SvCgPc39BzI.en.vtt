00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.849
 appeal against these actions many citizens 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.830

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.719
 mobile phones it is legal and even 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.330
 recommended the head of the traffic police to the Russian

 Federation Viktor Nilov April 19 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.750
 railway district of the city of Ulyanovsk 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.369
 there was a conflict between 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.260
 the driver of the vehicle and 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.850
 police officers the result of which 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.550
 became the hospitalization of the driver and his 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.470
 passenger we moved the train 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.470
 District Court on the street Gaya 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.470

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.600
 vzlom Airborne Division employees have about what 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.200
 i need to stop i performed 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.810
 a desire that is the traffic police and the 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.560
 have stopped lower the glass I 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.070
 employee 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:53.790
 the poet the police asked him to present 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.410
 documents on the police officer became yes 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.030
 this is to get the document I asked 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.070
 show me here directly here on 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.739
 this level because I see an employee 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.290
 traffic police refused in every way that is not 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.240
 identify showed top side said 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.280
 about the fact that we have no right to shoot 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.430
 I asked him on the basis of what 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.530
 of the law he explained nothing hit by 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.170
 the phone which is the next payment we 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.869
 considered these actions illegal then 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.070
 is there any point reported by the police 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.110
 subsequently, that is, he leaned on 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.420
 on the glass of my car after that 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.750
 opened the door that is grabbed me by 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.970
 head that is and that is pulled me out 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.950
 cars so i hit my head any 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.960
 conflict is the result of provocation 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.840
 the question arises which laws or 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.310
 Documents govern this situation. 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.729
 by viewing this video you can 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.679
 exactly right to conclude 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.960
 that in this case from 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.720
 vehicle driver and his 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.539
 passenger from the first seconds of recording 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.710
 there is a provocation on the fact held 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.020
 service check 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.520
 the result of which we will surely later 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.709
 take we mass media 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:07.250
 and all participants of this conflict this 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:08.539
 conflict situation you consider 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.670
 employee 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.200
 gps accordingly behaved absolutely 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.840
 correctly that of them was not 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.510
 no violations as a specialist yes 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.849
 yes at least what I saw on 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.150
 video recording here so that was me 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.950
 presented for viewing any 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.989
 violations of current legislation 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.099
 side of the police side 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:34.319
 DPS inspectors 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:37.439
 I did not see if a police officer 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.370
 speaks and understands about the reason 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.620
 stew with him 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.079
 apply physically he has to this 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.379
 rights means there is a basis they of course 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:48.060
 delay to divert water definitely yes how 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.129
 Drivers need to behave 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.680
 conflict inspector dps on 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:55.620
 road police officers anyway 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.720
 must behave politely and correctly and 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.299
 in accordance with the requirements 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.480
 regulatory legislation 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.590
 regulating activities 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.569
 police officers can be endless 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.639
 argue and prove their case but 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.379
 numerous skirmishes of DPS officers and 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.389
 drivers prove only that despite 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.099
 no regulations human 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:15.660
 factor can cause damage to two 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.190
 parties can be the root of all problems 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.530
 lies not in legal ignorance 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.120
 people but what we just forgot how to 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.129
 understand and talk to each other 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.870
 humanly famous 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.639
 writer Boris Zhitkov to not 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.739
 you need to lose respect in any situation 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:32.540
 stay human and we just 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.540
 need to remember this more often
