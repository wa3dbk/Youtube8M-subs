 hello, I'm Pedro Pedra Henrique 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.570
 celpe course language study center 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.599
 Portuguese had welcomed us to 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.449
 Portuguese language channel here will be 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:25.970
 several important tips for your day 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.490
 the day for both writing and 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.269
 talk is not the language spoken of the language 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.890
 writing 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.930
 What are you going to do? 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.969
 will be taking a college entrance exam 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.129
 or is going to do something 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.710
 involving the Portuguese language 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.870
 more often our channel in the 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.570
 our youtube channel with lots of tips 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.730
 Portuguese-speaking countries are diverse 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.090
 That's right we 're preparing to 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:53.059
 you seek a very interesting very 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.320
 cool for example I found here that is the 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.510
 use of whys 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.210
 this subject is very controversial many 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.559
 people make small mistakes 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.780
 that end there 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.030
 missing some erroneous questions in the 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.740
 moment of writing a text this is 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.340
 very important then the first step 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.619
 not to err or avoid error is 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.310
 know how many because they exist in our 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.130
 language 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.590
 good is four because this is cool o 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.990
 because together in accentuated because together 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.869
 with accent or why separated without 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.259
 accent and why separated with good accent 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:30.470
 I do not want to miss another teacher 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:33.259
 just look at the first one is more 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.420
 known is what you use since 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.939
 little to explain things 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.280
 the one you use to give the cause 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:43.610
 things so that's why it's called 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.219
 explanatory causal explanation of the 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.219
 cause explains something it is 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:51.619
 replaced by then easily then 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:54.439
 when you can replace this 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.289
 first there because we together in a seat 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:00.320
 because you are on the correct path you are 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.729
 using for sure the right reason 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.950
 All right, good. 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.300
 The second one is kind of weird, it's not a 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.970
 because together with 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.160
 hundred as it is he's so weird 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.510
 that it is a noun as if it were the 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.070
 car 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.650
 the boat or because the cars the boats 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.290
 by cheese or because it is a 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.140
 It is important to note that 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.120
 presence of a determining determinant 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.760
 as well as a key and is 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.800
 usually an article comes before because 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.770
 it's cool it comes in the plural is a 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.470
 noun even today because this or 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.570
 Because I want to know why so many 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.300
 lies and so on 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.010
 This guy is so weird it's hard. 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.110
 to forget all right 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.690
 Good, then we learned the first two 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.990
 because together with the explanatory 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:54.530
 easily replaced because the 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.610
 second that the noun always with 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.310
 determinant 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.580
 usually the presence of the 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.730
 article is in the singular to accompany 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.950
 or because it is in the plural 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.900
 cool! 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.360
 Now came a case a little more 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.250
 complicated is when you use why 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.190
 separate 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.040
 whether with accent or without accent it can 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.950
 be replaced for what reason or for 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.470
 what reason if you are in a sentence and 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.800
 can replace little with the reason 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.590
 or for what reason it will be separated 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.959
 Good how we 'll know if it's going to be 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:37.310
 separated with accent or without accent 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:40.190
 will depend on the position in the sentence ie 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.580
 if it arrives at the beginning or in the middle you 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:46.400
 will use the why separated without accent and 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.430
 if it appears at the end you will use the 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.540
 that separated with accent reminding that 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:57.050
 to be considered the end of the phrase logo 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.239
 after the use of why it leaves the last 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.750
 with an accent there should be a 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:06.050
 punctuation is an end point is a 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:09.680
 exclamation mark is an interrogation if 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:12.080
 after which separated without accent 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.920
 appear a score or a signal 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.170
 punctuation because they are the three 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.290
 exclamation points 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:23.600
 and end point you'll be able to use 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.010
 correctly the why separated with 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.150
 accent, alright 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:31.490
 Well then we have the 424 why 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.450
 our dear and beloved Portuguese language 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.820
 Ok 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:38.060
 well now I'll put some sentences 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:41.780
 to fill in the gaps of these phrases 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:44.480
 in order to fix what we have just seen in 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.210
 theory okay good 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.530
 are four phases the first one did not come 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.290
 because I was sick 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.890
 the second she did not come nobody knows why 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.200
 what 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:57.530
 the third nobody knows why she did not 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.340
 came the fourth she does not see and nobody knows 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.010
 because 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.290
 how do we fill simple 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.930
 first she did not come because she was 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:09.500
 I can change easily for one 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:12.080
 Because she wants to see, she did not come because she was 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.630
 sick is it because explanatory 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.660
 causal that can be replaced 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.090
 easily because it is the first of the 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.640
 Our table is the reason I judge without 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.160
 accent so when I say she did not come 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.620
 because he was sick is what they have together 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.510
 seat you should use and to 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.150
 fill the gap okay 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:35.690
 well come on the second sentence she does not 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:38.030
 came and no one knows why they played 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:41.110
 plural, she did not come nobody 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:43.790
 know today because it is why 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:47.660
 noun looks at the presence of the article 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:50.030
 there the article or is the noun has 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.940
 determinant what is the same pedro 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.980
 because along with accent is that because 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.380
 weird one who is difficult to 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.720
 forget so weird that we 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:02.270
 We always remind you why it 's cool. 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.360
 so she did not come and no one knows the 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.850
 because the determinant presence by 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:11.480
 be a noun it will be along with 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:14.150
 nice accent third sentence nobody 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.730
 know why she did not come nobody knows 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.770
 for which reason no one knows 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.870
 why did not she come if I 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.540
 exchanged for what reason for what reason 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:26.570
 it will already be separated 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:29.420
 we learn that if it appears at the beginning or 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:31.340
 in the middle of the sentence will be separated into 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:34.160
 that being the case 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:37.040
 the phrase nobody knows for what reason 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.530
 no one knows why she did not come 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.590
 nobody knows why she did not come 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:45.169
 is in the middle and can be replaced 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:48.949
 for what reason or for what reason 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:52.460
 will be separated without the last 104 phrase 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:54.440
 it did not come and no one knows why she 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.020
 do not see and nobody knows why 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.120
 for what reason if I touched by which 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:01.790
 reason and why he is still 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:04.190
 appeared at the end of the sentence it will be 

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.090
 separated with seat on tongue 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.060
 portuguese 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:11.720
 the four because exemplifying each one 

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:13.750
 and were given here in this celpe tip
