00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.920
 well once we get into the car 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.370
 The first thing that the 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.670
 Attention 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.250
 It is a very large size steering wheel 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.930
 reduced and with a cut in the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.020
 lower for this let's start 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.180
 then with the height of the seat what 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.470
 let's regulate higher than what 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.200
 we are used to in a car 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.970
 conventional then let's regulate the 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.640
 steering wheel has a double 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.590
 regulation in height and depth go 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.500
 to locate the depth that we have left 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.809
 comfortable and then the height we 're going to 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.140
 locate lower than we are 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.140
 accustomed 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.340
 in this position 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:01.870
 that is so special and that is a novelty 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.850
 of 208 and it takes the system to one extreme or 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.400
 the concept of head-up-display because of 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.140
 this way we are seeing everything 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.560
 the instrumental 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.270
 at a level very close to the height of 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.880
 windshield and then this allows us 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.369
 move less the look distract us less 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.560
 and be with all the information at the level 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.560
 of the route 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.240
 let's familiarize ourselves with the system 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.280
 multimedia touchscreen here is important 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.350
 emphasize that this system is not 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.790
 added to the car but all the 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.910
 interior of the car and the position of 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.740
 management was conceived considering the 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.050
 location the position and the 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.070
 operation of the system here we can 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.530
 choose radio or locate music in a 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.410
 pendrive or on the phone via audio 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.930
 streaming we can even see 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.900
 images also on the screen and by 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.930
 last we can configure the browser 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.580
 we go to the address list and 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.300
 we found the address that we already have 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:10.230
 prefixed to get to 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.230
 do our tour 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.420
 we recommend opening the curtain of 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.280
 roof sky to take advantage of all the 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.730
 interior brightness all the 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.580
 visibility and finally regulate the 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.500
 Automatic climate control this this 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.260
 bizona conditioner then we can 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.910
 regulate the temperature for the driver 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.220
 and the companion and has a 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:41.290
 particularity that is that the system 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:44.250
 Automatic has three auto soft modes 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.250
 and fast 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.510
 and we configure the car to our measure 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.250
 so after the boat trip we're going 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.380
 to take the route to discover 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.200
 all the benefits the comfort of walking 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.450
 the wealth of equipment the 208 and in 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.270
 particular this new proposal of 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.990
 driving command post all 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.080
 virtues of the 208 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.080
 yes
