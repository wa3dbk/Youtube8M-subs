00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.470 

first<00:00:58.950> thing<00:00:59.130> I<00:00:59.190> noticed<00:00:59.520> here<00:00:59.700> are<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.120> empty

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
first thing I noticed here are the empty

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.480 
first thing I noticed here are the empty
expose<00:01:00.900> which<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.590> key<00:01:01.830> to<00:01:01.860> farming<00:01:02.370> with

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:02.490 
expose which is the key to farming with

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.580 
expose which is the key to farming with
the<00:01:02.580> Town<00:01:02.760> Hall<00:01:02.880> 10<00:01:03.120> zoom<00:01:04.020> out<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.230> little<00:01:04.380> bit

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:04.590 
the Town Hall 10 zoom out a little bit

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:05.840 
the Town Hall 10 zoom out a little bit
and<00:01:04.800> you<00:01:04.890> can<00:01:04.920> see<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.430> most<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.760> the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
and you can see that most of the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.150 
and you can see that most of the
collectors<00:01:06.270> are<00:01:06.390> easy<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.810> get<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.860> heroes

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
collectors are easy to get to the heroes

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.440 
collectors are easy to get to the heroes
are<00:01:08.280> pretty<00:01:08.490> high<00:01:08.640> level<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.180> I'm<00:01:09.270> going<00:01:09.420> to

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
are pretty high level so I'm going to

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.780 
are pretty high level so I'm going to
start<00:01:09.720> by<00:01:09.900> using<00:01:10.230> the<00:01:11.010> hero<00:01:11.280> distraction

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
start by using the hero distraction

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.820 
start by using the hero distraction
strategy<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.360> them<00:01:12.570> draw<00:01:13.350> them<00:01:13.530> over<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
strategy on them draw them over the

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.170 
strategy on them draw them over the
corner<00:01:14.160> so<00:01:14.310> we<00:01:14.400> don't<00:01:14.520> have<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.730> waste<00:01:14.910> a<00:01:15.030> bunch

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
corner so we don't have to waste a bunch

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.030 
corner so we don't have to waste a bunch
of<00:01:15.270> troops<00:01:15.510> trying<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.870> kill<00:01:16.050> them<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.350> then

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
of troops trying to kill them and then

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.850 
of troops trying to kill them and then
we<00:01:17.130> can<00:01:17.280> start<00:01:17.550> attacking<00:01:17.850> over<00:01:18.210> here<00:01:18.540> and

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
we can start attacking over here and

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.520 
we can start attacking over here and
taking<00:01:19.860> out<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.130> collectors

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.500 

I'm<00:01:24.250> gonna<00:01:24.369> drop<00:01:24.729> a<00:01:24.790> few

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
I'm gonna drop a few

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.060 
I'm gonna drop a few
here<00:01:25.690> so<00:01:25.870> we<00:01:25.990> make<00:01:26.170> sure<00:01:26.200> the<00:01:26.530> king<00:01:26.830> and<00:01:26.950> queen

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
here so we make sure the king and queen

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.800 
here so we make sure the king and queen
are<00:01:27.340> walking<00:01:27.730> on<00:01:27.850> the<00:01:28.000> side

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
are walking on the side

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.270 
are walking on the side
which<00:01:30.810> they<00:01:31.050> are<00:01:31.230> so<00:01:31.440> we<00:01:31.530> can<00:01:31.710> continue<00:01:32.130> our

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
which they are so we can continue our

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.220 
which they are so we can continue our
attack

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
attack

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.600 
attack
it<00:01:34.230> looks<00:01:34.410> like<00:01:34.500> my<00:01:34.680> troops<00:01:34.950> are<00:01:35.100> just<00:01:35.370> out<00:01:35.490> of

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
it looks like my troops are just out of

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.520 
it looks like my troops are just out of
range<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.940> the<00:01:36.000> wizard<00:01:36.510> tower<00:01:36.720> on<00:01:36.870> the<00:01:36.900> top<00:01:36.990> so

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
range of the wizard tower on the top so

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.330 
range of the wizard tower on the top so
they're<00:01:37.740> not<00:01:37.860> having<00:01:38.010> any<00:01:38.190> trouble

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
they're not having any trouble

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.160 
they're not having any trouble
destroying<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.180> buildings<00:01:39.630> on<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.780> outside

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.050 

so<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.200> made<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.470> mistake<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.070> attack<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:44.820> side

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
so I made a mistake and attack this side

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.359 
so I made a mistake and attack this side
too<00:01:45.270> quickly<00:01:45.509> over<00:01:45.840> here<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.979> can<00:01:47.159> see

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
too quickly over here and you can see

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.069 
too quickly over here and you can see
that<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.700> heroes<00:01:48.210> are<00:01:48.390> actually<00:01:48.659> starting<00:01:48.899> to

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
that the heroes are actually starting to

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.020 
that the heroes are actually starting to
walk<00:01:49.259> backwards<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:50.009> they're<00:01:50.520> going<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.729> stop

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
walk backwards and they're going to stop

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.359 
walk backwards and they're going to stop
my<00:01:51.180> troops<00:01:51.420> head-on<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:52.100> what<00:01:53.100> we're<00:01:53.189> going<00:01:53.280> to

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
my troops head-on so what we're going to

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.460 
my troops head-on so what we're going to
have<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.610> do<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.880> counteract<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.780> drop<00:01:55.439> a

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
have to do to counteract that is drop a

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.889 
have to do to counteract that is drop a
couple<00:01:55.890> extra<00:01:56.159> troops<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.670> take<00:01:56.820> them<00:01:57.030> out

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
couple extra troops to take them out

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.719 
couple extra troops to take them out
you<00:01:59.899> know<00:01:59.990> what<00:02:00.110> I<00:02:00.259> lied<00:02:00.590> it's<00:02:00.890> not<00:02:01.399> gonna<00:02:01.579> take

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
you know what I lied it's not gonna take

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.249 
you know what I lied it's not gonna take
a<00:02:01.759> couple<00:02:02.060> troops<00:02:02.360> it's<00:02:02.539> gonna<00:02:02.719> take<00:02:02.960> a<00:02:02.990> bunch

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
a couple troops it's gonna take a bunch

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.170 
a couple troops it's gonna take a bunch
of<00:02:03.409> them<00:02:03.530> see<00:02:04.219> how<00:02:04.340> many<00:02:04.520> troops<00:02:04.759> it<00:02:04.939> saves

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
of them see how many troops it saves

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.749 
of them see how many troops it saves
using<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.049> hero<00:02:06.229> distraction<00:02:06.770> strategy<00:02:07.219> with

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
using the hero distraction strategy with

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:08.889 
using the hero distraction strategy with
all<00:02:07.909> those<00:02:08.030> troops<00:02:08.330> I<00:02:08.450> could<00:02:08.599> have<00:02:08.690> probably

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
all those troops I could have probably

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.389 
all those troops I could have probably
gotten<00:02:09.200> an<00:02:09.319> extra<00:02:09.470> two<00:02:09.890> or<00:02:10.039> three<00:02:10.220> percent

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
gotten an extra two or three percent

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.030 
gotten an extra two or three percent
which<00:02:11.360> actually<00:02:11.780> is<00:02:11.870> a<00:02:11.900> lot<00:02:12.200> when<00:02:12.920> you're

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
which actually is a lot when you're

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.580 
which actually is a lot when you're
trying<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.340> go<00:02:13.489> for<00:02:13.640> 50<00:02:13.940> percent

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.590 

looks<00:02:20.459> like<00:02:20.580> we're<00:02:20.730> gonna<00:02:20.819> miss<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.270> gold

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
looks like we're gonna miss the gold

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.270 
looks like we're gonna miss the gold
mine<00:02:21.750> by<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:21.990> Town<00:02:22.319> Hall<00:02:22.530> but<00:02:22.890> it<00:02:23.040> doesn't

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
mine by the Town Hall but it doesn't

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.949 
mine by the Town Hall but it doesn't
really<00:02:23.370> matter<00:02:23.580> cuz<00:02:23.910> our<00:02:24.060> storages<00:02:24.660> are<00:02:24.750> full

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
really matter cuz our storages are full

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.870 
really matter cuz our storages are full
now<00:02:25.110> so<00:02:25.319> now<00:02:25.950> we<00:02:26.010> have<00:02:26.190> enough<00:02:26.400> gold<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.730> get

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
now so now we have enough gold to get

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.360 
now so now we have enough gold to get
our<00:02:26.970> Inferno<00:02:27.270> tower<00:02:27.480> upgrading<00:02:28.020> and<00:02:28.980> what<00:02:29.220> did

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
our Inferno tower upgrading and what did

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.430 
our Inferno tower upgrading and what did
I<00:02:29.490> say<00:02:29.760> an<00:02:29.880> extra<00:02:30.180> 2<00:02:30.510> or<00:02:30.660> 3<00:02:30.810> percentage<00:02:31.260> we

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
I say an extra 2 or 3 percentage we

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.770 
I say an extra 2 or 3 percentage we
could<00:02:31.590> have<00:02:31.709> saved<00:02:31.920> from<00:02:32.330> properly<00:02:33.330> using<00:02:33.569> the

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
could have saved from properly using the

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.780 
could have saved from properly using the
hero<00:02:34.020> distraction<00:02:34.560> strategy<00:02:35.040> but<00:02:35.340> no<00:02:35.640> big

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
hero distraction strategy but no big

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.670 
hero distraction strategy but no big
deal<00:02:36.030> we're<00:02:36.300> farming<00:02:36.569> so<00:02:36.989> all<00:02:37.350> that<00:02:37.560> really

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
deal we're farming so all that really

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:45.680 
deal we're farming so all that really
matters<00:02:38.069> is<00:02:38.190> that<00:02:38.220> we<00:02:38.400> got<00:02:38.580> all<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.819> resources

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.780 

give<00:02:46.470> me<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.590> sec<00:02:46.830> while<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.040> hit<00:02:47.340> this<00:02:47.460> tree<00:02:47.670> with

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
give me a sec while I hit this tree with

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.310 
give me a sec while I hit this tree with
a<00:02:47.850> hammer<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.150> couple<00:02:48.480> times<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.930> remove<00:02:49.200> it

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
a hammer a couple times to remove it

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.080 
a hammer a couple times to remove it
from<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.560> ground<00:02:49.740> all<00:02:50.700> right<00:02:50.850> let's<00:02:51.000> not

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
from the ground all right let's not

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.820 
from the ground all right let's not
waste<00:02:51.300> any<00:02:51.540> more<00:02:51.660> time<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:51.960> get<00:02:52.260> our<00:02:52.350> Inferno

I<00:03:01.420> really<00:03:02.420> hope<00:03:02.570> that<00:03:02.690> builders<00:03:03.020> not<00:03:03.170> trying

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
I really hope that builders not trying

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
pretty interesting I got two stars and

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
pretty interesting I got two stars and
that<00:03:29.220> doesn't<00:03:29.550> usually<00:03:29.700> happen

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.240 

so<00:03:36.810> I<00:03:36.840> decided<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.320> take<00:03:37.560> out<00:03:37.710> these<00:03:37.860> mortars

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
so I decided to take out these mortars

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.590 
so I decided to take out these mortars
with

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
with

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.080 
with
expose<00:03:38.990> because<00:03:39.440> there's<00:03:39.680> an<00:03:39.920> extra<00:03:40.280> 200,000

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
expose because there's an extra 200,000

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.850 
expose because there's an extra 200,000
in<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.240> storages<00:03:41.780> and<00:03:41.990> I<00:03:42.470> would<00:03:42.620> have<00:03:42.710> never

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
in the storages and I would have never

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.290 
in the storages and I would have never
gotten<00:03:43.100> to<00:03:43.280> them<00:03:43.490> if<00:03:43.550> I<00:03:43.640> didn't<00:03:43.910> take<00:03:44.030> out<00:03:44.150> the

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
gotten to them if I didn't take out the

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.080 
gotten to them if I didn't take out the
mortars

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.030 

so<00:03:48.080> it<00:03:48.170> looks<00:03:48.290> like<00:03:48.440> there's<00:03:48.620> only<00:03:48.680> three

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
so it looks like there's only three

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.410 
so it looks like there's only three
troops<00:03:49.250> in<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.459> clinic<00:03:49.730> castles<00:03:50.090> so<00:03:50.209> I<00:03:50.270> don't

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
troops in the clinic castles so I don't

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.970 
troops in the clinic castles so I don't
have<00:03:50.480> to<00:03:50.599> worry<00:03:50.750> about<00:03:50.810> that<00:03:51.140> now<00:03:51.800> I'm<00:03:51.890> gonna

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
have to worry about that now I'm gonna

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.370 
have to worry about that now I'm gonna
focus<00:03:52.250> on<00:03:52.520> the<00:03:52.610> barb<00:03:52.819> King<00:03:53.060> and<00:03:53.450> I<00:03:53.780> decided<00:03:54.170> not

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
focus on the barb King and I decided not

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.370 
focus on the barb King and I decided not
to<00:03:54.440> do<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:54.860> hero<00:03:55.220> distraction<00:03:55.819> because<00:03:56.380> I'm

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
to do the hero distraction because I'm

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.690 
to do the hero distraction because I'm
going<00:03:57.500> to<00:03:57.560> be<00:03:57.650> attacking<00:03:58.130> for<00:03:58.280> mainly<00:03:58.459> one

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
going to be attacking for mainly one

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.850 
going to be attacking for mainly one
side<00:03:58.970> and<00:03:59.270> I<00:03:59.480> decided<00:03:59.870> it<00:04:00.050> was<00:04:00.170> best<00:04:00.440> to<00:04:00.650> just

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
side and I decided it was best to just

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.070 
side and I decided it was best to just
take<00:04:01.400> him<00:04:01.520> out<00:04:01.610> quickly

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
take him out quickly

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.750 
take him out quickly
luckily<00:04:03.080> the<00:04:03.380> barb<00:04:03.560> King<00:04:03.769> is<00:04:03.920> only<00:04:04.069> level<00:04:04.280> 1<00:04:04.550> so

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
luckily the barb King is only level 1 so

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.290 
luckily the barb King is only level 1 so
I'd<00:04:04.880> have<00:04:05.060> to<00:04:05.120> waste<00:04:05.390> too<00:04:05.569> many<00:04:05.720> troops

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
I'd have to waste too many troops

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.690 
I'd have to waste too many troops
so<00:04:08.290> I'm<00:04:08.530> going<00:04:08.620> to<00:04:08.680> be<00:04:08.770> mainly<00:04:09.010> attacking<00:04:09.550> from

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
so I'm going to be mainly attacking from

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.580 
so I'm going to be mainly attacking from
the<00:04:09.850> top<00:04:10.030> area<00:04:10.360> and<00:04:10.600> I'm<00:04:11.050> also<00:04:11.170> going<00:04:11.410> to<00:04:11.470> be

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
the top area and I'm also going to be

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.110 
the top area and I'm also going to be
scattering<00:04:12.010> some<00:04:12.220> troops<00:04:12.430> around<00:04:12.700> to<00:04:12.850> get<00:04:13.000> the

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
scattering some troops around to get the

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.670 
scattering some troops around to get the
collectors<00:04:13.570> because<00:04:13.810> there<00:04:14.230> are<00:04:14.410> some

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
collectors because there are some

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.500 
collectors because there are some
resources<00:04:15.130> in<00:04:15.370> them<00:04:15.520> but<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.090> main<00:04:16.239> goal<00:04:16.270> is

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
resources in them but the main goal is

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.000 
resources in them but the main goal is
to<00:04:16.690> get<00:04:16.810> into<00:04:16.989> the<00:04:17.230> center<00:04:17.500> because<00:04:17.680> that's

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
to get into the center because that's

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.620 
to get into the center because that's
where<00:04:18.160> most<00:04:18.340> of<00:04:18.430> the<00:04:18.520> resources<00:04:18.790> are

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
where most of the resources are

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.020 
where most of the resources are
I<00:04:20.890> wanted<00:04:21.890> to<00:04:21.980> make<00:04:22.130> sure<00:04:22.160> that<00:04:22.460> I<00:04:22.520> got<00:04:22.730> to<00:04:22.910> the

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
I wanted to make sure that I got to the

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.420 
I wanted to make sure that I got to the
center<00:04:23.270> so<00:04:23.540> I<00:04:23.600> also<00:04:23.780> dropped<00:04:24.200> my<00:04:24.320> barb<00:04:24.530> King<00:04:24.770> to

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
center so I also dropped my barb King to

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.520 
center so I also dropped my barb King to
take<00:04:25.760> a<00:04:25.790> bunch<00:04:26.030> of<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.210> damage<00:04:26.570> right<00:04:27.380> when<00:04:27.470> I

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
take a bunch of the damage right when I

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.320 
take a bunch of the damage right when I
drop<00:04:27.770> my<00:04:27.800> barb<00:04:28.160> King<00:04:28.400> I<00:04:28.550> realized<00:04:28.880> that<00:04:29.060> not

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
drop my barb King I realized that not

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.910 
drop my barb King I realized that not
too<00:04:29.570> far<00:04:29.750> down<00:04:29.900> there<00:04:30.140> is<00:04:30.230> an<00:04:30.320> inferno<00:04:30.710> Tower

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
too far down there is an inferno Tower

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.400 
too far down there is an inferno Tower
you<00:04:31.700> guys<00:04:31.850> got<00:04:32.060> to<00:04:32.150> make<00:04:32.270> sure<00:04:32.480> that<00:04:32.750> you<00:04:33.320> don't

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
you guys got to make sure that you don't

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.020 
you guys got to make sure that you don't
place<00:04:33.680> your<00:04:33.710> heroes<00:04:34.190> by<00:04:34.370> inferno<00:04:34.850> towers

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
place your heroes by inferno towers

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.420 
place your heroes by inferno towers
because<00:04:35.420> it'll<00:04:35.570> take<00:04:35.690> them<00:04:35.810> out<00:04:35.960> quick<00:04:36.400> but<00:04:37.400> I

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
because it'll take them out quick but I

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.780 
because it'll take them out quick but I
got<00:04:37.670> lucky<00:04:37.820> and<00:04:38.120> he<00:04:38.180> changed<00:04:38.480> direction

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.180 

so<00:04:42.750> what<00:04:42.870> happens<00:04:43.140> next<00:04:43.350> is<00:04:43.530> very<00:04:43.740> interesting

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
so what happens next is very interesting
