00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.030 
for making this so I'm thinking that the
most<00:01:46.180> optimal<00:01:46.750> way<00:01:46.810> to<00:01:46.960> summon<00:01:47.560> this<00:01:47.770> guy<00:01:47.979> is

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
most optimal way to summon this guy is

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.100 
most optimal way to summon this guy is
probably<00:01:48.610> going<00:01:49.060> to<00:01:49.119> be<00:01:49.180> using<00:01:49.420> crane<00:01:49.840> crane

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
probably going to be using crane crane

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.130 
probably going to be using crane crane
you<00:01:50.740> know<00:01:50.890> because<00:01:51.250> with<00:01:52.060> crane<00:01:52.329> crane<00:01:52.570> I<00:01:52.899> mean

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
you know because with crane crane I mean

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.499 
you know because with crane crane I mean

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
if you're looking at you know the plant

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.510 
if you're looking at you know the plant
synchro<00:01:55.990> deck<00:01:56.229> or<00:01:56.439> just<00:01:56.619> how<00:01:56.710> plant<00:01:57.070> operates

graveyard to make effective now I think
that<00:03:16.920> this<00:03:17.069> car<00:03:17.310> coming<00:03:17.700> out<00:03:17.989> coinciding<00:03:18.989> with

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
that this car coming out coinciding with

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.900 
that this car coming out coinciding with
the<00:03:19.319> recent<00:03:19.680> release<00:03:20.069> of<00:03:20.099> crane<00:03:20.459> crane<00:03:20.670> is

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
the recent release of crane crane is

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.069 
the recent release of crane crane is
going<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.150> give<00:03:21.269> this<00:03:21.359> back<00:03:21.569> a<00:03:21.690> ton<00:03:22.049> of

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
going to give this back a ton of

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.440 
going to give this back a ton of
potential<00:03:22.739> you<00:03:23.340> know<00:03:23.459> because<00:03:23.790> Franklin

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
potential you know because Franklin

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.659 
potential you know because Franklin
gives<00:03:24.750> us<00:03:24.900> duck<00:03:25.139> a<00:03:25.290> lot<00:03:25.620> more<00:03:25.859> synergy<00:03:26.160> that<00:03:26.400> it

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
gives us duck a lot more synergy that it

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.729 
gives us duck a lot more synergy that it
didn't<00:03:27.000> have<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:27.660> gives<00:03:27.900> it<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.139> ability<00:03:28.230> to

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
didn't have it gives it the ability to

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.500 
didn't have it gives it the ability to
easily<00:03:28.950> make<00:03:29.400> those<00:03:29.609> right<00:03:29.940> three<00:03:30.150> exceeds

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
easily make those right three exceeds

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.539 
easily make those right three exceeds
where<00:03:30.810> in<00:03:31.019> the<00:03:31.139> past<00:03:31.319> I<00:03:31.650> mean<00:03:31.799> outside<00:03:32.040> of<00:03:32.250> torg

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
where in the past I mean outside of torg

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.250 
where in the past I mean outside of torg
out<00:03:32.730> like<00:03:32.970> making<00:03:33.630> right<00:03:33.810> three<00:03:34.019> he's<00:03:34.139> in

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
out like making right three he's in

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.720 
out like making right three he's in
plant<00:03:34.440> synchro<00:03:34.799> like<00:03:34.980> wasn't<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.400> easiest

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
plant synchro like wasn't the easiest

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.610 
plant synchro like wasn't the easiest
thing<00:03:35.970> to<00:03:36.090> do<00:03:36.269> but<00:03:36.780> now<00:03:36.959> when<00:03:37.169> you<00:03:37.230> have<00:03:37.349> crane

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
thing to do but now when you have crane

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.140 
thing to do but now when you have crane
crane<00:03:37.859> you<00:03:38.069> can<00:03:38.190> instantly<00:03:38.519> go<00:03:38.790> on<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:38.970> levee

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
crane you can instantly go on the levee

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.970 
crane you can instantly go on the levee
air<00:03:39.389> which<00:03:39.959> means<00:03:40.200> that<00:03:40.290> you<00:03:40.410> can<00:03:40.530> instantly

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
air which means that you can instantly

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.220 
air which means that you can instantly
get<00:03:41.250> those<00:03:41.430> lone<00:03:41.730> fires<00:03:42.030> and<00:03:42.389> dandelions<00:03:43.019> back

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
get those lone fires and dandelions back

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.750 
get those lone fires and dandelions back
that<00:03:43.470> earlier<00:03:43.859> in<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.069> game<00:03:44.099> you<00:03:44.489> may<00:03:44.609> have

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
that earlier in the game you may have

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.640 
that earlier in the game you may have
removed<00:03:45.120> for<00:03:45.329> sport<00:03:45.630> you<00:03:46.049> know<00:03:46.169> crane<00:03:46.440> crane

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
removed for sport you know crane crane

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.069 
removed for sport you know crane crane
is<00:03:46.889> also<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.400> blue<00:03:47.579> target<00:03:48.030> so<00:03:48.180> it's<00:03:48.329> like<00:03:48.450> now

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
is also the blue target so it's like now

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.599 
is also the blue target so it's like now
I<00:03:49.109> feel<00:03:49.349> like<00:03:49.560> everything<00:03:50.160> in<00:03:50.280> the

I feel like everything in the

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.190 
I feel like everything in the
tech<00:03:50.819> is<00:03:50.970> basically<00:03:51.419> at<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:51.630> boots<00:03:51.810> argument

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
tech is basically at the boots argument

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.960 
tech is basically at the boots argument
you<00:03:52.260> got<00:03:52.410> card<00:03:52.709> trooper<00:03:53.130> dandelion<00:03:53.669> crane

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
you got card trooper dandelion crane

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.210 
you got card trooper dandelion crane

crane yellow fire Boston like you have

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.610 
crane yellow fire Boston like you have
so<00:03:56.549> many<00:03:56.819> different<00:03:57.150> options<00:03:57.540> for<00:03:58.049> debris

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
so many different options for debris

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.650 
so many different options for debris
dragon<00:03:59.010> where<00:03:59.220> you<00:03:59.669> know<00:03:59.790> in<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.120> past<00:04:00.299> maybe

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
dragon where you know in the past maybe

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.390 
dragon where you know in the past maybe
their<00:04:00.959> debris<00:04:01.169> dragon<00:04:01.620> targets<00:04:02.069> were<00:04:02.160> kind<00:04:02.370> of

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
their debris dragon targets were kind of

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.650 
their debris dragon targets were kind of
limited<00:04:02.790> maybe<00:04:03.000> you<00:04:03.060> have<00:04:03.150> to<00:04:03.239> play<00:04:03.389> slow

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660

the<00:04:05.669> blue<00:04:05.819> dragon<00:04:06.209> should<00:04:06.389> never<00:04:06.690> really<00:04:06.930> be<00:04:07.049> a

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
the blue dragon should never really be a

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.589 
the blue dragon should never really be a
