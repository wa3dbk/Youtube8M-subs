00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:04.930
 hello to all the students continue to do anticor place 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.879
 to present the israel coastline which often runs prohibitively presented 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:10.149
 as 

00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:10.950
 as TV 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.430
 phone or in turn 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.889
 I think I won 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.889
 fuck you 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.590
 good here is the beast 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.970
 at a critical moment 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.480
 will they be big screen 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.090
 the phone maker is moderately 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.390
 - - the country 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.010
 and especially the doors we have 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.010
 the etic h patio saw the cnas 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.960
 mikit precisely allow to make these caches euros waterproof for water 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.050
 the ofsp technically it's supposed not to 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.190
 not or not to be 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.400
 I see all the strongest in liberia and the coast you have in celebration 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.920
 a kind of market by his captain dadis q you slip like that 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.090
 nicchi precisely 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.440
 kiki defeats coca and friends 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.070
 which makes sense logically that you have closed it but it's gone 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.370
 no internal error 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.330
 before the phone vote simply 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.100
 the minimum level and it turns under androïd 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.640
 it looks like 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.870
 so to me I happen to be no I do not hide you that the summit 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.650
 not particularly 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.660
 but it's still easy to use and applications 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.650
 are not bad 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.329
 so we'll let you know 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.329
 several points white shirt 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.139
 so percent 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:13.629
 the presentations 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:14.579
 you have 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.239
 three to four 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.939
 if these offices 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.939
 so where can you put 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.420
 all kinds of applications 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.639
 mondou and jets 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:27.639
 or lead by mistakes 

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:30.359
 one of those motorola 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.719
 I do not say bullshit 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:35.719
 even though I know you will not be brief 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.829
 in euros the list 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.929
 the duo of head quite nice 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:45.379
 after the comedy me I find that level of use it's not 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.819
 it's not yet the start and iphone ya better 

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:52.739
 finally compare phone windows 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.099
 German 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:55.659
 we knew better than 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:56.899
 their love 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:59.429
 android then is these androids or 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:02.109
 it's just that if I start phone there 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.159
 I do not know 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:07.429
 a setback that has several advantages 

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:09.189
 especially the fact is that if 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.189
 vicky hotter 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.479
 synchronize with everything 

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:16.899
 all devices benefiting from 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:18.219
 ammunition 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:21.679
 the de dede of the wifi system muddy alone 

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:24.369
 we leave traces to this classic 

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:27.319
 but for all that is beautiful all that yes if I find it not bad 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.759
 the center exists point on the 100 times that I had no less subject to the 

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:32.109
 phone 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:32.950
 tested 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.379
 it can be quite handy for hello to plug the cable 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:39.839
 then Thursday to its applications 

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:43.369
 finally various applications a thing that I do not feel under androïd assist the 

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:44.310
 boss peeps 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.399
 mobile 3g 

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:49.529
 if in fact that turns your 

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:51.219
 your phone not 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:52.059
 heart member 

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:53.609
 basically that's it 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.849
 so if you're on the phone for three days, you can not wait 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:03:59.580
 we knew to advance or other 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.620
 portable in router mode precisely and can connect from your 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.699
 computer 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:05.389
 quickly 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:07.739
 in broadband for 33 debit 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.839
 baluch and because its name debit but that's it crumbles so that's it 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.639
 - on the other hand we must know that the subscriptions finally 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.870
 on the intranet 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.639
 subscriptions little dark often limited so that if you stay 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.400
 30 years in office download too much data with connection networks 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.559
 telephone 

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:29.770
 you're going to invite to see a little 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.819
 6 structure at the end 

00:04:31.819 --> 00:04:33.440
 at the end of the month we knew 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.430
 quite important 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.460
 so 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.729
 also what else to say the mood the museum under android google there is a 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:43.330
 keyboard 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.219
 keyboard rather not bad 

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:46.020
 it depends 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.779
 we do not make fun of 

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:49.870
 it's stupid but it does not work that 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.219
 we do not know 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:56.550
 it has a keyboard is good you can not see it but it does not matter a keyboard 

00:04:56.549 --> 00:04:59.059
 multipoint which makes they did 

00:04:59.059 --> 00:05:02.370
 if you make customers also per month 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.029
 silence 

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:06.279
 it's gold 

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:07.339
 that makes a c 

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:10.339
 we feel like that's how this stuff the club's healthy topics 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:12.749
 certain forms 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:16.770
 the luff involved written and obviously and yesterday if you retype the same form 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.559
 the iphone phone guess the mans 

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:21.559
 so that's how he does I do not know 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.690
 yes but here it can be interesting 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.180
 from the moment 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.629
 we dropped him which is not my case 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:31.569
 I do it without hiding 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:34.990
 without hiding it to get rich yesterday 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.009
 initialed to this little game I think that precisely 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.580
 even 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.580
 sacred man wants it all wrong with latrines 

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:47.580
 short on this passage 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.860
 like others 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.650
 we must fight at all times to speak 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.659
 the postman of androids 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:56.659
 for me not for I'm pretty hot too 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:01.830
 it's like being 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.300
 it has not convinced me yet we will say a runner in terms of 

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:10.619
 marquette I think we made you its brand app store I felt that I 

00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:13.369
 something like that 

00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:16.279
 for the others were loaded in europe project 

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:19.139
 so why from how do I do not know 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:20.460
 the eu does not want 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:22.389
 before what makes that every time that m 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:25.540
 prieto of the implication must I connect to a point where I am 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:26.930
 lynch me too 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.860
 what is frankly drying inbound 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.219
 designed to configure france 

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:35.219
 ah it can become enough by ceasing his dogs 

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:38.789
 quite simply 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:40.969
 on what else 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:44.150
 he was finally gps the subject was also an application 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.150
 this receding gps content of his site 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.160
 the ccc not to these people did not have 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.759
 the gpu still the opportunity 

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:55.050
 to use it 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.759
 except that the world must 

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:59.759
 it's already something that you have automatically ranking 

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:04.050
 so why do not we complain after what it really is 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.830
 the PS project, which is currently found in 

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.830
 cars I do not know 

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:14.149
 we'll see it was all for this short text to what is motorola 

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:16.779
 I would dive well 

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:20.009
 in a little glass of water but thankfully I'm afraid they're not 

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:21.960
 of choc 

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.430
 and many other functions done are the following - 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.470
 not that I invite you simply in the air see the video m 

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:28.779
 it will save me from 

00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:31.050
 bousies my phone 

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.050
 and although deep motor of me I have there 

00:07:34.569 --> 00:07:36.669
 but he erased the site already begins 

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:37.699
 to weaken 

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:40.430
 so now going on is still totally authors run that 

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:41.860
 I do not know 

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.650
 and honestly I do not prefer to take the risk his sister has risen 

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.419
 dungeon something damage 

00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:50.419
 the hub of the cashmere is not held 

00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:54.550
 some among voting against 

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.550
 to systar in turn take an iphone 

00:07:58.119 --> 00:07:59.249
 rather 

00:07:59.249 --> 00:08:01.199
 of doses bought on my son had 

00:08:01.199 --> 00:08:03.999
 seen like that we will not complain 

00:08:03.999 --> 00:08:06.809
 but we still go a little iphone 

00:08:06.809 --> 00:08:09.999
 that was all it was all finances to make it so
