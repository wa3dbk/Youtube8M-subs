about rhythmic restrictions and
technical<00:00:07.290> restrictions<00:00:07.440> just<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:08.790> remind

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
technical restrictions just to remind

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.629 
technical restrictions just to remind
you<00:00:09.269> these<00:00:09.420> restrictions<00:00:10.080> are<00:00:10.550> things<00:00:11.550> that

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
you these restrictions are things that

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.759 
you these restrictions are things that
you<00:00:11.910> put<00:00:12.240> on<00:00:12.420> yourself<00:00:12.570> while<00:00:13.049> practicing

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
you put on yourself while practicing

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.340 
you put on yourself while practicing
improvisation<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:15.330> make<00:00:15.540> sure<00:00:15.750> that<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.170> can

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
improvisation to make sure that you can

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.310 
improvisation to make sure that you can
break<00:00:16.680> out<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.010> your<00:00:17.220> normal<00:00:18.320> improvisational

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
break out of your normal improvisational

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.320 
break out of your normal improvisational
habits<00:00:19.830> so<00:00:20.550> we're<00:00:20.670> going<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.820> start<00:00:21.060> with

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
habits so we're going to start with

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.900 
habits so we're going to start with
rhythmic<00:00:21.720> restrictions<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.769> we'll<00:00:23.670> start

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
rhythmic restrictions and we'll start

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.019 
rhythmic restrictions and we'll start
simple<00:00:24.680> only<00:00:25.680> quarter<00:00:26.250> notes<00:00:26.460> in<00:00:26.730> your

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
simple only quarter notes in your

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.450 
simple only quarter notes in your
improvisation<00:00:27.449> let's<00:00:28.109> take<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.349> simple<00:00:28.619> 251

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
improvisation let's take a simple 251

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:45.750 
improvisation let's take a simple 251
and<00:00:29.490> F<00:00:29.820> here

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:59.079 

cool<00:00:46.789> next<00:00:47.360> we'll<00:00:47.510> just<00:00:47.780> do<00:00:47.989> it<00:00:48.289> notes

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:03.560 

if<00:01:00.089> that's<00:01:00.390> our<00:01:00.539> pretty<00:01:00.870> standard<00:01:01.370> and<00:01:02.370> now<00:01:03.359> it

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
if that's our pretty standard and now it

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.620 
if that's our pretty standard and now it
gets<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.870> little<00:01:03.989> trickier<00:01:04.530> why<00:01:04.830> don't<00:01:05.009> we<00:01:05.129> do

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
gets a little trickier why don't we do

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:17.570 
gets a little trickier why don't we do
note<00:01:06.630> triplets

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.340 

so<00:01:18.580> obviously<00:01:19.360> I'm<00:01:19.540> showing<00:01:19.900> you<00:01:20.170> these

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
so obviously I'm showing you these

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.530 
so obviously I'm showing you these
fairly<00:01:21.130> quickly<00:01:21.280> but<00:01:21.790> it<00:01:21.940> might<00:01:22.090> take<00:01:22.120> some

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
fairly quickly but it might take some

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.500 
fairly quickly but it might take some
practice<00:01:22.800> to<00:01:23.800> really<00:01:24.310> feel<00:01:24.640> comfortable<00:01:24.670> with

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
practice to really feel comfortable with

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.690 
practice to really feel comfortable with
these<00:01:25.630> restrictions<00:01:26.320> all<00:01:27.190> right<00:01:27.340> let's<00:01:27.550> talk

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
these restrictions all right let's talk

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.880 
these restrictions all right let's talk
about<00:01:27.850> some<00:01:28.270> simple<00:01:28.690> technical<00:01:29.140> restrictions

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
about some simple technical restrictions

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.870 
about some simple technical restrictions
here<00:01:31.110> it's<00:01:32.110> one<00:01:32.620> of<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:32.800> most<00:01:33.010> common<00:01:33.430> habits

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
here it's one of the most common habits

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.970 
here it's one of the most common habits
that<00:01:34.210> I<00:01:34.270> personally<00:01:34.900> see<00:01:35.110> in<00:01:35.290> students<00:01:35.800> is

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:35.980 
that I personally see in students is

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.700 
that I personally see in students is
that<00:01:36.850> they<00:01:37.120> want<00:01:37.420> to<00:01:37.510> just<00:01:37.840> play<00:01:38.080> a<00:01:38.170> lot<00:01:38.680> of

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
that they want to just play a lot of

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.280 
that they want to just play a lot of
notes<00:01:38.890> and<00:01:39.490> so<00:01:40.420> these<00:01:40.600> restrictions<00:01:41.050> are

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
notes and so these restrictions are

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.850 
notes and so these restrictions are
really<00:01:41.680> helpful<00:01:41.950> with<00:01:42.820> breaking<00:01:43.510> those

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
really helpful with breaking those

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.770 
really helpful with breaking those
habits<00:01:44.860> and<00:01:45.100> helping<00:01:45.400> yourself<00:01:45.820> learn<00:01:46.570> to

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
habits and helping yourself learn to

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.170 
habits and helping yourself learn to
think<00:01:46.960> in<00:01:47.110> terms<00:01:47.350> of<00:01:47.530> melodies<00:01:47.920> so<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.880> first

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
think in terms of melodies so the first

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.510 
think in terms of melodies so the first
restriction<00:01:49.540> is<00:01:49.930> just<00:01:50.320> going<00:01:50.470> to<00:01:50.530> be<00:01:50.710> to

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
restriction is just going to be to

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.600 
restriction is just going to be to
improvise<00:01:52.030> only<00:01:52.720> every<00:01:53.200> other<00:01:53.380> measure<00:01:53.650> so

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
improvise only every other measure so

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:04.950 
improvise only every other measure so
let's<00:01:54.790> give<00:01:54.970> that<00:01:55.000> a<00:01:55.150> shot

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.219 

cool

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
cool

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.050 
cool
nice<00:02:06.770> and<00:02:07.010> simple<00:02:07.490> next<00:02:08.450> we'll<00:02:08.750> do<00:02:09.610> only<00:02:10.610> using

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
nice and simple next we'll do only using

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.110 
nice and simple next we'll do only using
our<00:02:11.150> left<00:02:11.360> hand<00:02:11.720> so<00:02:12.880> this<00:02:13.880> will<00:02:14.030> obviously

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
our left hand so this will obviously

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.180 
our left hand so this will obviously
make<00:02:14.420> it<00:02:14.660> hard<00:02:15.230> for<00:02:15.290> me<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.530> do<00:02:15.650> a<00:02:15.680> baseline<00:02:16.100> in

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
make it hard for me to do a baseline in

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.920 
make it hard for me to do a baseline in
my<00:02:16.280> left<00:02:16.430> hand<00:02:16.610> but<00:02:16.850> I'll<00:02:16.940> just<00:02:16.970> do<00:02:17.840> a<00:02:17.870> little

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
my left hand but I'll just do a little

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:28.789 
my left hand but I'll just do a little
improvisation<00:02:18.800> in<00:02:18.890> my<00:02:19.010> left<00:02:19.190> hand

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.800 

so<00:02:29.799> obviously<00:02:30.730> that's<00:02:30.939> a<00:02:31.150> pretty<00:02:31.359> tricky

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
so obviously that's a pretty tricky

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.199 
so obviously that's a pretty tricky
thing<00:02:31.989> to<00:02:32.140> do<00:02:32.319> is<00:02:32.590> learn<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:33.459> improvise<00:02:33.730> with

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
thing to do is learn to improvise with

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.940 
thing to do is learn to improvise with
your<00:02:34.359> left<00:02:34.599> hand<00:02:34.840> as<00:02:35.109> your<00:02:35.290> left<00:02:35.439> hand<00:02:35.739> is

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
your left hand as your left hand is

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.069 
your left hand as your left hand is
generally<00:02:36.849> your<00:02:37.030> weaker<00:02:37.359> hand<00:02:37.569> unless<00:02:37.870> you're

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
generally your weaker hand unless you're

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.309 
generally your weaker hand unless you're
left-handed<00:02:38.349> and<00:02:39.450> finally<00:02:40.450> for<00:02:40.659> today<00:02:40.900> we'll

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
left-handed and finally for today we'll

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.819 
left-handed and finally for today we'll
try<00:02:42.359> improvising<00:02:43.359> with<00:02:43.389> only<00:02:44.079> using

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
try improvising with only using

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:57.929 
try improvising with only using
arpeggios<00:02:45.609> let's<00:02:45.939> see<00:02:46.060> how<00:02:46.180> that<00:02:46.239> goes<00:02:56.939> cool

00:02:57.929 --> 00:02:57.939 
arpeggios let's see how that goes cool

00:02:57.939 --> 00:02:59.819 
arpeggios let's see how that goes cool
and<00:02:58.239> so<00:02:58.419> those<00:02:58.599> are<00:02:58.720> some<00:02:58.930> soil<00:02:59.260> restrictions

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
and so those are some soil restrictions

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.920 
and so those are some soil restrictions
they're<00:03:00.069> really<00:03:00.459> fun<00:03:00.669> to<00:03:00.700> practice<00:03:00.970> I<00:03:01.450> hope

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
they're really fun to practice I hope

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.129 
they're really fun to practice I hope
you<00:03:02.109> enjoy<00:03:02.379> working<00:03:02.560> on<00:03:02.799> them<00:03:03.750> you<00:03:04.750> can<00:03:04.930> always
