00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.869
 good friends this is call of duty 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.670
 advanced warfare and the truth is that 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.290
 it looks nothing like any of the call of 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.360
 duty that we have been able to prove in many 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.190
 years they said he wanted to keep the 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.990
 essence call of duty but for me 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.239
 after trying the game here in 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.790
 colony the essence call of duty has 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.530
 changed completely and looks the same neither 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.750
 it feels the same when playing 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.879
 advanced warfare starts a new stage 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.059
 in the call of duty era when it comes out 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.609
 advanced warfare 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.469
 we will not see equal to call of duty and 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:51.780
 I'm never playing on the map you're in 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.420
 my favorite map of the 4 that we could 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.909
 try yesterday we could try a total of 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.440
 four maps this was my favorite 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.769
 we could also try a total of 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.510
 four game modes between the separate 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.710
 to take the flag that is the one that you are 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.720
 seeing on screen we could try 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.850
 also hard point that returns at last 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.530
 after black ops 2 we could try 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.259
 also duel for teams and the new 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.270
 game mode that promises a lot that 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.190
 it's called appling which is kind of 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.679
 monkey as in halo reach I do not know if 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.990
 you remember that that was that way of game 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:23.610
 where the goal was to bring 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.560
 the flag to the team base 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.299
 contrary that still take the flag but 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.920
 with a variation that was that you could 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.350
 move from the flag you could go pulling the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.789
 well the same in ablin but with one with 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.289
 a little ball you have to strain the 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.509
 little ball let's say in a kind of 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:37.319
 expected to be at the base of the team 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.000
 contrary 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:41.190
 in any case take the flag was 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.459
 the favorite my favorite of the four 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.289
 the others had some problem of 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:47.729
 respawn that I did not like or what 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.750
 better then do not just understand the very 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.460
 all right 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.750
 they are game modes that you 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.400
 you have to get used to capture the 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.840
 flag is to capture the flag is much 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.460
 easier to read the map know by 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.960
 where do you have to go and it's just 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.630
 lack of habit because neither 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.950
 we could play we could play a lot of the 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.420
 weapons that I tried apart from the shotgun 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.630
 which is what you have seen at the beginning 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.009
 that you have already seen that it is very very op 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.539
 I also tried this assault rifle that 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.000
 for me it is of the three that there was 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.440
 unlocked in my favorite has a 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.230
 good year a good cadence and a 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.760
 very small recoil and that a weapon in 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.530
 advance warfare have a very 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.989
 small is something to keep in mind 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.820
 because the sensitivity is much more 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.260
 sensitive in quotes worth the 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.600
 redundancy is much more complicated 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.000
 keep the aim steady keep the 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.260
 pulse is much harder here so 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.940
 this weapon for me is the one that works 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.500
 better an automatic assault rifle 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.450
 there was another one of bursts that did not finish me 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.040
 convince too much and the other does not 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.410
 I tried, I do not have to tell you either 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.209
 neither does it provide many weapons to prefer 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.980
 focus on a couple or three you're going to have 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.560
 more gameplays soon you will have 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.720
 a total of 3 gameplays plus 3 maps 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.550
 that I have left with their respective modes 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.590
 of game only by hard point equipment and 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.420
 appling so stay tuned to the channel 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.970
 because soon they come new 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.900
 new gameplays see you soon 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.900
 guys so far
