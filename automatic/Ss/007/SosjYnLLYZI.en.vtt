get a glass container and start putting
in<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.369> honey<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:27.119> want<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.330> make<00:00:27.449> sure<00:00:27.480> it's

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
in the honey you want to make sure it's

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.200 
in the honey you want to make sure it's
raw<00:00:28.109> honey<00:00:28.380> because<00:00:29.000> pasteurized<00:00:30.000> honey

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
raw honey because pasteurized honey

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.820 
raw honey because pasteurized honey
doesn't<00:00:30.570> have<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.840> same<00:00:31.050> hydrogen<00:00:31.470> peroxide

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
doesn't have the same hydrogen peroxide

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.500 
doesn't have the same hydrogen peroxide
levels<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.730> that's<00:00:32.850> what<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.149> need<00:00:33.360> to

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
levels and that's what we need to

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.750 
levels and that's what we need to
lighten<00:00:33.719> our<00:00:33.870> hair<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.530> now<00:00:35.460> I'm<00:00:35.550> going<00:00:35.700> to

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
lighten our hair and now I'm going to

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.490 
lighten our hair and now I'm going to
add<00:00:35.850> in<00:00:36.000> some<00:00:36.210> water<00:00:36.390> it's<00:00:36.989> preferred<00:00:37.469> that

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
add in some water it's preferred that

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.530 
add in some water it's preferred that
you<00:00:37.920> use<00:00:38.219> distilled<00:00:38.730> water<00:00:38.940> because<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.420> its

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
you use distilled water because of its

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.020 
you use distilled water because of its
low<00:00:39.780> mineral<00:00:40.200> content<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:40.860> its<00:00:41.040> pH<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.670> yields

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
low mineral content and its pH it yields

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.760 
low mineral content and its pH it yields
a<00:00:42.090> lot<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.420> hydrogen<00:00:42.809> peroxide<00:00:43.110> from<00:00:43.590> the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
a lot of hydrogen peroxide from the

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.819 
a lot of hydrogen peroxide from the
honey<00:00:43.950> but<00:00:44.280> I'm<00:00:44.399> just<00:00:44.640> using<00:00:44.820> tap<00:00:45.300> water<00:00:45.829> now

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
honey but I'm just using tap water now

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.529 
honey but I'm just using tap water now
we're<00:00:47.010> going<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.190> add<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.520> some<00:00:47.550> cinnamon<00:00:48.270> and

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
we're going to add in some cinnamon and

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.209 
we're going to add in some cinnamon and
a<00:00:48.600> little<00:00:48.629> bit<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.079> olive<00:00:49.320> oil<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.920> those<00:00:50.039> are

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
a little bit of olive oil and those are

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.459 
a little bit of olive oil and those are
great<00:00:50.460> hydrogen<00:00:51.030> peroxide<00:00:51.210> boosters<00:00:51.989> and

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
great hydrogen peroxide boosters and

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.410 
great hydrogen peroxide boosters and
we're<00:00:53.160> just<00:00:53.250> going<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.460> keep<00:00:53.670> stirring<00:00:54.090> that

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
we're just going to keep stirring that

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.810 
we're just going to keep stirring that
up<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.960> since<00:00:55.920> there's<00:00:56.100> oil<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.610> water

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
up and since there's oil and water

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.369 
up and since there's oil and water
they're<00:00:57.059> going<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.270> repel<00:00:57.600> each<00:00:57.629> other<00:00:57.989> and

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
they're going to repel each other and

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.959 
they're going to repel each other and
that's<00:00:58.859> going<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.100> cause<00:00:59.280> them<00:00:59.430> mixture<00:00:59.789> to

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
that's going to cause them mixture to

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.360 
that's going to cause them mixture to
look<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.420> little<00:01:00.570> bit<00:01:00.809> like<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.620> which<00:01:02.340> is

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
look a little bit like this which is

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.390 
look a little bit like this which is
some<00:01:02.699> scary<00:01:03.059> sewage<00:01:03.719> water<00:01:04.049> except<00:01:04.920> it's<00:01:05.129> okay

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
some scary sewage water except it's okay

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.380 
some scary sewage water except it's okay
because<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:05.729> going<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.880> make<00:01:06.030> our<00:01:06.180> hair

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
because it's going to make our hair

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.390 
because it's going to make our hair
beautiful<00:01:06.860> you're<00:01:07.860> going<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.070> want<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.280> let

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
beautiful you're going to want to let

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.219 
beautiful you're going to want to let
the<00:01:08.520> mixture<00:01:08.790> sit<00:01:09.060> for<00:01:09.119> about<00:01:09.360> an<00:01:09.479> hour<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:09.960> it

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
the mixture sit for about an hour so it

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.170 
the mixture sit for about an hour so it
can<00:01:10.350> develop<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.830> nice<00:01:11.100> amount<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.640> hydrogen

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
can develop a nice amount of hydrogen

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.780 
can develop a nice amount of hydrogen
peroxide<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:13.020> after<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:13.979> hour<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.400> can

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
peroxide and after that hour you can

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.670 
peroxide and after that hour you can
start<00:01:15.119> applying<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.780> mixture<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.290> your<00:01:16.409> hair

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680

so I'm putting on this old t-shirt just

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.780 
so I'm putting on this old t-shirt just
in<00:01:18.960> case<00:01:19.170> things<00:01:19.439> get<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.680> little<00:01:19.979> bit<00:01:20.100> messy<00:01:20.250> I

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
in case things get a little bit messy I

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.240 
in case things get a little bit messy I
first<00:01:21.600> begin<00:01:21.900> by<00:01:21.930> brushing<00:01:22.409> out<00:01:22.650> my<00:01:22.680> damp<00:01:23.040> hair

with<00:01:23.490> my<00:01:23.670> amazing<00:01:24.180> wooden<00:01:24.780> brush<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.350> then

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
with my amazing wooden brush and then

with my amazing wooden brush and then
the<00:01:26.040> lightening<00:01:26.340> process<00:01:26.520> begins<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.420> start

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
mixture evenly all over and I'll just

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.060 
mixture evenly all over and I'll just
remind<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.990> very<00:01:34.350> gentle<00:01:34.740> way<00:01:35.040> to

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.350 
difference the first time you use it
however<00:01:40.590> it's<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.009> very<00:01:41.220> gradual<00:01:41.670> effect<00:01:42.060> I've

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
however it's a very gradual effect I've

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.050 
however it's a very gradual effect I've
used<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.079> about<00:01:43.229> six<00:01:43.740> times<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.399> each<00:01:44.520> time<00:01:44.850> I

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
used it about six times and each time I

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.399

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
lighter I'm probably going to use it

another ten to fifteen times it's just a

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.780 
another ten to fifteen times it's just a
really<00:01:51.390> great<00:01:51.750> alternative<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.680> using<00:01:52.890> bleach
