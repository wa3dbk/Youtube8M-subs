the he did lose it there is locking that

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.070

Falcon to get the extra missile shot off
the<00:02:19.620> missiles<00:02:19.980> do<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.340> lot<00:02:20.640> of<00:02:20.670> damage<00:02:21.000> but

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
the missiles do a lot of damage but

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.850 
the missiles do a lot of damage but
their<00:02:21.420> weaknesses<00:02:21.810> their<00:02:21.990> rate<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.170> fire<00:02:22.470> so

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
their weaknesses their rate of fire so

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.410 
their weaknesses their rate of fire so
if<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.069> can<00:02:23.220> keep<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.580> enemy<00:02:23.670> in<00:02:23.970> range<00:02:24.209> the

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
missiles for as long as possible they're

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.920 
missiles for as long as possible they're
going<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.250> maximize<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.880> effectiveness<00:02:27.240> and

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
going to maximize the effectiveness and

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.140 
going to maximize the effectiveness and
now<00:02:28.080> we've<00:02:28.290> got<00:02:28.500> these<00:02:28.650> dual<00:02:29.100> Razorbacks<00:02:29.760> just

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
now we've got these dual Razorbacks just

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.330 
now we've got these dual Razorbacks just
raping<00:02:30.840> everything<00:02:31.410> on<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.650> field<00:02:31.860> for<00:02:32.040> bio

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
raping everything on the field for bio

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.130 
raping everything on the field for bio
Terra<00:02:32.640> again<00:02:34.760> once<00:02:35.760> again<00:02:35.880> with<00:02:36.300> a<00:02:36.330> counter<00:02:36.959> on

the<00:02:37.170> map<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:38.010> this<00:02:38.670> is<00:02:38.700> why<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.030> sort<00:02:39.390> of<00:02:39.480> liked

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
the map so this is why I sort of liked

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.080 
the map so this is why I sort of liked
the<00:02:39.930> early<00:02:40.230> ban<00:02:40.440> cheese<00:02:40.709> is<00:02:41.520> you're<00:02:41.880> probably

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
the early ban cheese is you're probably

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.610 
the early ban cheese is you're probably
not<00:02:42.330> going<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.540> kill<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.750> Razorback<00:02:43.260> with<00:02:43.470> them

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
not going to kill a Razorback with them

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.440 
not going to kill a Razorback with them
but<00:02:43.770> you<00:02:43.830> can<00:02:44.100> at<00:02:44.160> least<00:02:44.220> do<00:02:44.670> something<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.300> it

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
but you can at least do something to it

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.449 
but you can at least do something to it
you<00:02:45.630> can<00:02:45.750> cause<00:02:45.989> some<00:02:46.230> damage<00:02:46.410> for<00:02:46.980> sit<00:02:47.220> back

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
you can cause some damage for sit back

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.910 
you can cause some damage for sit back
and<00:02:47.760> at<00:02:48.420> that<00:02:48.510> point<00:02:48.750> in<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:48.959> case<00:02:49.170> we'd<00:02:49.440> have<00:02:49.709> to

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
and at that point in a case we'd have to

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.830 
and at that point in a case we'd have to
repair<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.640> Razorback<00:02:51.090> which<00:02:51.300> not<00:02:51.480> only<00:02:51.510> ties

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.750 
actually going to hurt cuz that power
you<00:03:10.110> could<00:03:10.290> have<00:03:10.410> used<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.800> upgrade<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.190> tier<00:03:11.459> 3

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
you could have used to upgrade to tier 3

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.270 
you could have used to upgrade to tier 3
and<00:03:11.880> got<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.239> Falcon<00:03:12.660> shield<00:03:12.930> which<00:03:13.280> really

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
and got the Falcon shield which really

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.229 
and got the Falcon shield which really
would<00:03:14.489> have<00:03:14.610> helped<00:03:14.850> them<00:03:14.940> a<00:03:15.030> lot<00:03:15.060> more

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
would have helped them a lot more

would have helped them a lot more
because<00:03:15.959> he<00:03:16.140> still<00:03:16.380> has<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:16.680> deal<00:03:16.860> with<00:03:17.040> this

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
because he still has to deal with this

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.770 
because he still has to deal with this
missile<00:03:18.060> tac<00:03:18.269> squad<00:03:18.299> as<00:03:18.780> well<00:03:20.329> yeah<00:03:21.329> until<00:03:21.540> you

said shield up the missile attacks are a

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.120 
said shield up the missile attacks are a
huge<00:03:23.970> threat<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.420> that<00:03:24.450> Falcon<00:03:24.989> and<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:26.010> looks

shield<00:05:41.700> now<00:05:43.160> Anika<00:05:44.160> dose<00:05:44.310> is<00:05:44.460> floating<00:05:44.760> a<00:05:44.820> lot

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
shield now Anika dose is floating a lot

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.550 
shield now Anika dose is floating a lot
of<00:05:45.150> power<00:05:45.300> right<00:05:45.570> now<00:05:45.600> he's<00:05:45.900> pushing<00:05:46.260> almost

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
of power right now he's pushing almost

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.820 
of power right now he's pushing almost
200<00:05:47.250> which<00:05:47.430> is<00:05:48.260> obviously<00:05:49.260> well<00:05:49.530> above

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
200 which is obviously well above

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.280 
200 which is obviously well above
anything<00:05:50.070> a<00:05:50.280> Space<00:05:50.520> Marine<00:05:50.960> unit<00:05:51.960> would<00:05:52.050> cost

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:52.290 
anything a Space Marine unit would cost

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.190 
anything a Space Marine unit would cost
the<00:05:52.979> number<00:05:53.460> one<00:05:53.610> unit<00:05:53.910> waiting<00:05:54.180> in<00:05:54.270> it<00:05:54.390> 125<00:05:54.870> of

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.200 
the number one unit waiting in it 125 of

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.080 
the number one unit waiting in it 125 of
the<00:05:55.260> predator<00:05:55.620> and<00:05:56.070> I<00:05:56.310> don't<00:05:56.490> really<00:05:56.610> well

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
the predator and I don't really well

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.120 
the predator and I don't really well
predator<00:05:57.720> actually<00:05:57.900> wouldn't<00:05:58.380> be<00:05:58.500> too<00:05:58.710> bad<00:05:58.740> to

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
predator actually wouldn't be too bad to

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.980 
predator actually wouldn't be too bad to
deal<00:05:59.310> with<00:05:59.490> this<00:05:59.610> Falcon<00:06:00.180> they<00:06:00.479> tend<00:06:00.720> to<00:06:00.780> take

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
deal with this Falcon they tend to take

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.830 
deal with this Falcon they tend to take
down<00:06:01.140> the<00:06:01.290> shield<00:06:01.470> pretty<00:06:01.740> quickly<00:06:01.979> I<00:06:02.100> find

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 
down the shield pretty quickly I find

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.080 
down the shield pretty quickly I find
usually<00:06:03.840> about<00:06:03.990> two<00:06:04.229> shots<00:06:04.500> or<00:06:04.680> so

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.730 

right<00:06:09.090> now<00:06:09.180> the<00:06:09.240> plasma<00:06:09.960> cannon<00:06:10.260> is<00:06:10.350> set<00:06:10.560> up

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
right now the plasma cannon is set up

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.220 
right now the plasma cannon is set up
towards<00:06:11.190> the<00:06:11.250> the<00:06:11.730> central<00:06:12.120> victory<00:06:12.480> pointing

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:13.230 
towards the the central victory pointing

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.220 
towards the the central victory pointing
downward<00:06:13.770> got<00:06:14.490> a<00:06:14.520> shot<00:06:15.180> off<00:06:15.210> on<00:06:15.630> the<00:06:15.840> the

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:16.230 
downward got a shot off on the the

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.840 
downward got a shot off on the the
warlock<00:06:16.680> and<00:06:18.680> looks<00:06:19.680> like<00:06:19.860> it's<00:06:20.010> just<00:06:20.190> barely

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:20.850 
warlock and looks like it's just barely

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.280 
warlock and looks like it's just barely
in<00:06:20.970> range<00:06:21.210> that<00:06:21.420> bright<00:06:21.630> lines<00:06:21.840> cannon<00:06:22.200> as

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:22.290 
in range that bright lines cannon as

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.320 
in range that bright lines cannon as
well<00:06:22.440> but<00:06:22.620> I<00:06:22.680> doubt<00:06:22.770> his<00:06:23.190> sight<00:06:23.490> on<00:06:23.670> it<00:06:23.820> at<00:06:24.210> the

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.330 
well but I doubt his sight on it at the

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.070 
well but I doubt his sight on it at the
moment<00:06:25.340> yeah<00:06:26.340> I<00:06:26.460> think<00:06:26.730> Anika<00:06:27.390> dose<00:06:27.570> unless

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
moment yeah I think Anika dose unless

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.530 
moment yeah I think Anika dose unless
you<00:06:28.500> does<00:06:28.710> something<00:06:29.100> very<00:06:29.400> wrong<00:06:29.730> very<00:06:30.030> soon

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:30.540 
you does something very wrong very soon

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.020 
you does something very wrong very soon
I<00:06:30.780> think<00:06:31.020> he's<00:06:31.140> gonna<00:06:31.290> want<00:06:31.590> this<00:06:31.680> one<00:06:31.950> I<00:06:32.160> mean

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.030 
I think he's gonna want this one I mean

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.480 
I think he's gonna want this one I mean
that's<00:06:33.180> just<00:06:33.540> so<00:06:33.930> my<00:06:34.200> units<00:06:34.950> for<00:06:35.220> a<00:06:35.250> Space

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
that's just so my units for a Space

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.870 
that's just so my units for a Space
Marine<00:06:35.520> player<00:06:35.970> to<00:06:36.120> head<00:06:36.270> out<00:06:36.450> on<00:06:36.480> the<00:06:36.780> field

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:37.880 
Marine player to head out on the field

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.090 
Marine player to head out on the field
think<00:06:38.880> about<00:06:38.970> space<00:06:39.330> marines<00:06:39.690> is<00:06:39.840> that<00:06:40.100> they

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.100 
think about space marines is that they

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.790 
think about space marines is that they
have<00:06:41.310> a<00:06:41.640> small<00:06:42.450> amount<00:06:42.750> of<00:06:42.900> very<00:06:43.530> durable

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 
have a small amount of very durable

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.220 
have a small amount of very durable
units<00:06:44.400> so<00:06:44.730> when<00:06:44.970> you<00:06:45.060> get<00:06:45.300> the<00:06:45.510> sort<00:06:46.110> of<00:06:46.170> the

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:46.230 
units so when you get the sort of the

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.470 
units so when you get the sort of the
snowball<00:06:46.710> effect<00:06:46.860> going<00:06:47.340> with<00:06:47.820> their<00:06:48.030> units

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:48.480 
snowball effect going with their units

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.030 
snowball effect going with their units
eventually<00:06:49.230> they<00:06:49.320> hit<00:06:49.470> critical<00:06:49.680> mass<00:06:49.860> and

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:50.040 
eventually they hit critical mass and

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.860 
eventually they hit critical mass and
all<00:06:50.370> the<00:06:50.490> units<00:06:50.820> typically<00:06:51.360> have<00:06:51.540> a<00:06:51.570> lot<00:06:51.840> of

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:51.870 
all the units typically have a lot of

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.450 
all the units typically have a lot of
experience<00:06:52.560> on<00:06:52.710> them<00:06:52.890> because<00:06:53.160> they're<00:06:53.310> so

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460 
experience on them because they're so

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.020 
experience on them because they're so
durable<00:06:53.790> yeah<00:06:55.190> looks<00:06:56.190> like<00:06:56.340> we<00:06:56.460> got<00:06:56.610> dual

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.030 
durable yeah looks like we got dual

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.480 
durable yeah looks like we got dual
sniper<00:06:57.840> rifles<00:06:58.350> out<00:06:58.590> on<00:06:58.770> those<00:06:58.920> Scouts<00:06:59.280> as

00:06:59.480 --> 00:06:59.490 
sniper rifles out on those Scouts as

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.580 
sniper rifles out on those Scouts as
well<00:06:59.700> so<00:07:00.030> we<00:07:00.150> can<00:07:00.300> forget<00:07:00.630> using<00:07:01.110> platforms

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.590 
well so we can forget using platforms

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:06.650 
well so we can forget using platforms
effectively<00:07:03.770> the<00:07:04.880> Falcon<00:07:05.880> tank<00:07:06.090> is<00:07:06.330> looping

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:06.660 
effectively the Falcon tank is looping

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.690 
effectively the Falcon tank is looping
around<00:07:06.750> the<00:07:07.050> the<00:07:07.410> plasma<00:07:07.800> cannon<00:07:08.100> as<00:07:08.220> we<00:07:08.370> speak

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:08.700 
around the the plasma cannon as we speak

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.450 
around the the plasma cannon as we speak
however<00:07:09.260> but<00:07:10.260> the<00:07:10.440> missile<00:07:10.890> attacks<00:07:11.160> are

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:11.460 
however but the missile attacks are

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.050 
however but the missile attacks are
nearby<00:07:12.120> and<00:07:12.750> it<00:07:13.680> looks<00:07:13.830> like<00:07:13.980> we're<00:07:14.220> suiciding

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.060 
nearby and it looks like we're suiciding

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.340 
nearby and it looks like we're suiciding
the<00:07:15.210> Warlock<00:07:15.570> it<00:07:15.750> to<00:07:15.870> the<00:07:15.990> middle<00:07:16.110> of<00:07:16.230> the

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:16.350 
the Warlock it to the middle of the

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20.330 
the Warlock it to the middle of the
space<00:07:16.650> marine<00:07:16.920> army<00:07:17.100> I<00:07:17.370> think<00:07:17.760> so<00:07:19.220> maybe<00:07:20.220> a

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:20.340 
space marine army I think so maybe a

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.010 
space marine army I think so maybe a
little<00:07:20.490> bit<00:07:20.700> too<00:07:20.910> over<00:07:21.330> concerned<00:07:21.720> with<00:07:21.900> this

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.020 
little bit too over concerned with this

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.700 
little bit too over concerned with this
a<00:07:22.050> Devastator<00:07:22.920> plasma<00:07:23.430> gun<00:07:23.610> yeah<00:07:24.620> looks<00:07:25.620> like

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:25.710 
a Devastator plasma gun yeah looks like

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:29.450 
a Devastator plasma gun yeah looks like
the<00:07:25.800> Warlock<00:07:26.280> is<00:07:26.490> booked<00:07:26.790> at<00:07:27.000> the<00:07:28.460> Falcon

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:29.460 
the Warlock is booked at the Falcon

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:30.710 
the Warlock is booked at the Falcon
alone<00:07:29.670> probably<00:07:30.000> would<00:07:30.090> have<00:07:30.150> been<00:07:30.270> enough<00:07:30.540> to

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 
alone probably would have been enough to

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.440 
alone probably would have been enough to
force<00:07:31.230> the<00:07:31.350> plasma<00:07:31.710> gun<00:07:31.890> off<00:07:32.760> the<00:07:33.030> map<00:07:33.210> he's

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:33.450 
force the plasma gun off the map he's

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:34.820 
force the plasma gun off the map he's
not<00:07:33.600> careful<00:07:33.870> he's<00:07:34.140> going<00:07:34.320> to<00:07:34.410> get<00:07:34.500> hit<00:07:34.680> with

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:34.830 
not careful he's going to get hit with

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:36.590 
not careful he's going to get hit with
the<00:07:34.950> Force<00:07:35.160> Commander<00:07:35.580> power<00:07:35.790> fist<00:07:36.090> to<00:07:36.360> here

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:36.600 
the Force Commander power fist to here

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:43.130 
the Force Commander power fist to here
and<00:07:36.750> get<00:07:36.960> disabled<00:07:37.530> and<00:07:37.760> like<00:07:38.760> that<00:07:41.930> that<00:07:42.930> is

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:43.140 
and get disabled and like that that is

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.790
