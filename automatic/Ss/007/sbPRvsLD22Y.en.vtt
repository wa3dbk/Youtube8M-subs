00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
all right so got a really good question

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.550 
all right so got a really good question
interaction<00:00:02.970> idea<00:00:03.270> from<00:00:03.629> a<00:00:03.659> user<00:00:04.049> who<00:00:04.319> wanted

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
interaction idea from a user who wanted

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.749 
interaction idea from a user who wanted
to<00:00:04.620> set<00:00:04.830> up<00:00:04.859> a<00:00:05.009> custom<00:00:05.250> drag-and-drop

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
to set up a custom drag-and-drop

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.080 
to set up a custom drag-and-drop
interaction<00:00:06.270> that<00:00:07.200> had<00:00:07.680> four<00:00:08.040> categories<00:00:08.880> and

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
interaction that had four categories and

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.990 
interaction that had four categories and
then<00:00:09.240> from<00:00:09.450> each<00:00:09.660> category<00:00:10.160> only<00:00:11.160> one<00:00:11.490> item

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
then from each category only one item

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.780 
then from each category only one item
could<00:00:12.540> be<00:00:12.599> selected<00:00:12.990> so<00:00:13.740> in<00:00:13.889> this<00:00:13.980> case<00:00:14.219> there

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
could be selected so in this case there

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.180 
could be selected so in this case there
are<00:00:14.820> four<00:00:15.150> groups<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.170> doesn't<00:00:16.830> matter<00:00:16.949> which

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
are four groups and doesn't matter which

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.779 
are four groups and doesn't matter which
one<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.820> each<00:00:18.480> category<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:19.199> select<00:00:19.680> we<00:00:20.520> can

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
one of each category I select we can

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.060 
one of each category I select we can
only<00:00:20.910> have<00:00:21.090> one<00:00:21.150> if<00:00:21.630> one<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.439> each<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.740> in<00:00:22.920> there

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
only have one if one of each is in there

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.800 
only have one if one of each is in there
you<00:00:23.100> can<00:00:23.369> see<00:00:23.519> my<00:00:23.550> variable<00:00:24.090> tracking<00:00:24.539> and

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
you can see my variable tracking and

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
you can see my variable tracking and
we'll<00:00:24.990> look<00:00:25.109> at<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.380> little<00:00:25.470> bit<00:00:25.590> closer

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
we'll look at this a little bit closer

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.580 
we'll look at this a little bit closer
all<00:00:26.460> shows<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.090> there's<00:00:27.300> one<00:00:27.570> click<00:00:28.260> Submit

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
all shows that there's one click Submit

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.349 
all shows that there's one click Submit
and<00:00:28.710> then<00:00:28.800> it's<00:00:28.949> going<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.130> be<00:00:29.220> correct<00:00:29.550> now<00:00:30.119> if

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
and then it's going to be correct now if

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.709 
and then it's going to be correct now if
for<00:00:30.420> any<00:00:30.750> reason<00:00:30.890> there<00:00:31.890> are<00:00:32.189> two<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:33.480> a

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
for any reason there are two of a

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.799 
for any reason there are two of a
category<00:00:34.170> or<00:00:34.350> there<00:00:34.950> are<00:00:35.160> maybe<00:00:35.579> none<00:00:36.329> from

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
category or there are maybe none from

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.760 
category or there are maybe none from
one<00:00:36.989> category<00:00:37.219> then<00:00:38.219> we<00:00:38.640> will<00:00:38.879> have<00:00:39.149> it

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
one category then we will have it

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.470 
one category then we will have it
incorrect<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.520> here's<00:00:41.760> how<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:41.940> can<00:00:42.120> set<00:00:42.329> this

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
incorrect so here's how you can set this

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.380 
incorrect so here's how you can set this
up<00:00:42.540> in<00:00:42.960> storyline<00:00:43.969> couple<00:00:44.969> things<00:00:45.210> to

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
up in storyline couple things to

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.720 
up in storyline couple things to
consider<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.350> what<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.649> user<00:00:46.890> was

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
consider so this is what the user was

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.240 
consider so this is what the user was
working<00:00:48.239> with<00:00:48.390> now<00:00:49.320> what's<00:00:49.890> really<00:00:50.010> cool

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
working with now what's really cool

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.229 
working with now what's really cool
about<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:50.940> they're<00:00:51.120> actually

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
about this is that they're actually

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.819 
about this is that they're actually
working<00:00:51.420> with<00:00:51.780> meaningful<00:00:52.260> objects<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:52.680> it's

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
working with meaningful objects so it's

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.160 
working with meaningful objects so it's
really<00:00:53.039> easy<00:00:53.280> for<00:00:53.460> someone<00:00:54.210> who's<00:00:54.390> really

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
really easy for someone who's really

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.319 
really easy for someone who's really
familiar<00:00:55.559> with<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.710> content<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:57.239> know

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
familiar with the content to you know

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.900 
familiar with the content to you know
visually<00:00:57.539> group<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.140> identify<00:00:58.879> what<00:00:59.879> each

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
visually group and identify what each

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.569 
visually group and identify what each
category<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.690> now<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.559> do<00:01:01.680> know<00:01:01.949> my<00:01:02.100> food<00:01:02.309> groups

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
category is now I do know my food groups

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.520 
category is now I do know my food groups
but<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.390> don't<00:01:03.719> have<00:01:03.809> as<00:01:03.899> much<00:01:04.019> time<00:01:04.229> on<00:01:04.290> this

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
but I don't have as much time on this

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.140 
but I don't have as much time on this
interaction<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.309> first<00:01:05.580> thing<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.850> wanted

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
interaction so the first thing I wanted

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.390 
interaction so the first thing I wanted
to<00:01:06.210> do<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.600> kind<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.869> make<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.200> simple<00:01:07.710> this

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
to do is kind of make this simple this

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.219 
to do is kind of make this simple this
looks<00:01:08.700> great<00:01:08.909> when<00:01:09.360> you're<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.810> one<00:01:09.960> who's

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
looks great when you're the one who's

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.510 
looks great when you're the one who's
really<00:01:10.470> working<00:01:10.770> with<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.950> content<00:01:11.369> because

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
really working with the content because

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.870 
really working with the content because
you<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:11.760> know<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.180> objects<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:12.810> well<00:01:13.700> for<00:01:14.700> me

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
you just know the objects so well for me

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.969 
you just know the objects so well for me
I<00:01:15.090> wanted<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.479> simplify<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.799> only

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
I wanted to simplify it so that I only

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.580 
I wanted to simplify it so that I only
had<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.400> really<00:01:17.729> manage<00:01:18.000> for<00:01:18.509> objects<00:01:19.380> and

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
had to really manage for objects and

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.109 
had to really manage for objects and
then<00:01:19.680> four<00:01:19.979> objects<00:01:20.400> are<00:01:20.490> really<00:01:20.610> these<00:01:20.790> color

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
then four objects are really these color

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.330 
then four objects are really these color
groups<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.810> others<00:01:22.020> some<00:01:22.200> sub<00:01:22.409> objects

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
groups the others some sub objects

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.310 
groups the others some sub objects
within<00:01:23.640> each<00:01:23.759> one<00:01:24.000> but<00:01:24.960> I'm<00:01:25.080> really<00:01:25.170> only

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
within each one but I'm really only

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.170 
within each one but I'm really only
managing<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.890> green<00:01:26.100> group<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.580> red<00:01:26.729> group<00:01:27.000> a

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
managing a green group a red group a

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.230 
managing a green group a red group a
brown<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.829> oranges<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.520> color<00:01:29.820> really

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
brown and oranges so that color really

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.020 
brown and oranges so that color really
helps<00:01:30.570> me<00:01:31.009> simplify<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.729> get<00:01:32.909> up<00:01:33.000> to

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
helps me simplify this and get up to

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.569 
helps me simplify this and get up to
speed<00:01:33.360> with<00:01:33.479> something<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.079> is<00:01:34.320> just<00:01:35.310> new<00:01:35.549> to

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
speed with something that is just new to

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.340 
speed with something that is just new to
me<00:01:35.820> right<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.299> just<00:01:36.600> another<00:01:37.020> one<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.290> those

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
me right so just another one of those

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.039 
me right so just another one of those
little<00:01:38.180> workflows<00:01:39.180> or<00:01:39.360> techniques<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.900> just

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
little workflows or techniques that just

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.149 
little workflows or techniques that just
make<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.320> easy<00:01:40.439> when<00:01:40.619> you're<00:01:40.770> not<00:01:40.860> really<00:01:40.979> as

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
make it easy when you're not really as

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.800 
make it easy when you're not really as
comfortable<00:01:41.579> with<00:01:41.640> something<00:01:41.939> try<00:01:42.750> to

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
comfortable with something try to

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.480 
comfortable with something try to
simplify<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.530> colors<00:01:43.829> obviously<00:01:44.250> really

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
simplify it and colors obviously really

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.120 
simplify it and colors obviously really
great<00:01:44.700> for<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.810> what<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.530> want<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.799> do<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.040> I

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
great for that so what I want to do is I

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.010 
great for that so what I want to do is I
want<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.340> track<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.000> make<00:01:48.630> sure<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.869> no

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
want to track and make sure that no

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.190 
want to track and make sure that no
matter<00:01:49.140> what<00:01:49.920> at<00:01:50.280> least<00:01:50.579> one<00:01:51.030> object<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:51.659> on

matter what at least one object is on

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.770 
matter what at least one object is on
the<00:01:53.159> plate<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.640> if<00:01:53.880> they<00:01:54.000> all<00:01:54.149> are<00:01:54.390> then<00:01:54.689> I'll

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
the plate and if they all are then I'll

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.179 
the plate and if they all are then I'll
show<00:01:54.960> my<00:01:55.110> good<00:01:55.290> job<00:01:55.530> layer<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.009> if<00:01:56.070> they're

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
show my good job layer and if they're

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.459 
show my good job layer and if they're
not<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.340> I'll<00:01:56.579> show<00:01:56.759> my<00:01:56.939> no<00:01:57.000> player<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:58.290> it's

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
not that I'll show my no player so it's

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.170 
not that I'll show my no player so it's
a<00:01:58.530> straight<00:01:58.890> convert<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.340> freeform<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.939> brought

a straight convert to freeform I brought

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.730 
a straight convert to freeform I brought
in<00:02:00.360> these<00:02:00.450> images<00:02:00.899> or<00:02:01.079> these<00:02:01.200> could<00:02:01.380> be<00:02:01.469> shapes

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.649 
in these images or these could be shapes
you<00:02:02.070> could<00:02:02.219> actually<00:02:02.369> work<00:02:02.670> with<00:02:02.909> story<00:02:03.479> lines

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
you could actually work with story lines

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.170 
you could actually work with story lines
just<00:02:03.810> vector<00:02:04.259> shapes<00:02:04.530> here<00:02:04.829> get<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.729> objects

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
objects are on the plate then we're

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.930 
objects are on the plate then we're
going<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.620> track<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:20.160> add<00:02:20.310> something<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.910> our

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
going to track and add something to our

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.330 
going to track and add something to our
variable<00:02:21.540> if<00:02:21.690> it's<00:02:22.290> not<00:02:22.590> on<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.860> plate<00:02:23.010> and

it's<00:02:23.550> on<00:02:23.790> our<00:02:24.650> over<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.830> hot<00:02:26.130> spot<00:02:26.160> then<00:02:27.120> we're

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
it's on our over the hot spot then we're

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.880 
it's on our over the hot spot then we're
going<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.450> take<00:02:27.660> away<00:02:27.810> we're<00:02:28.290> going<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.500> remove

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
going to take away we're going to remove

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.540 
going to take away we're going to remove
that<00:02:30.080> addition<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.260> variable<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.830> reset

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
that addition to the variable and reset

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.309 
that addition to the variable and reset
everything<00:02:32.970> so<00:02:33.510> just<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.810> hot<00:02:33.959> spot<00:02:34.170> I'm<00:02:34.290> going

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
everything so just a hot spot I'm going

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.360 
everything so just a hot spot I'm going
to<00:02:34.440> turn<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:34.650> off<00:02:34.770> just<00:02:34.950> because<00:02:35.100> it's<00:02:35.310> a

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
to turn it off just because it's a

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.479 
to turn it off just because it's a
little<00:02:35.489> bit<00:02:35.640> glaring<00:02:36.560> okay<00:02:37.560> so<00:02:37.620> those<00:02:38.250> are<00:02:38.400> the

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
little bit glaring okay so those are the

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:39.860 
little bit glaring okay so those are the
two<00:02:38.640> objects<00:02:39.060> once<00:02:39.270> everything's<00:02:39.660> on<00:02:39.780> the

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
two objects once everything's on the

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.720 
two objects once everything's on the
slide<00:02:40.080> though<00:02:40.319> including<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.800> hot<00:02:40.950> spot<00:02:41.220> we

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
slide though including the hot spot we

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.280 
slide though including the hot spot we
just<00:02:41.880> came<00:02:41.970> up<00:02:42.150> here<00:02:42.300> to<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.510> insert<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.110> then

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
just came up here to the insert and then

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.770 
just came up here to the insert and then
we<00:02:43.350> wanted<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.650> convert<00:02:43.950> it<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.160> a<00:02:44.660> free-form

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
we wanted to convert it to a free-form

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.620 
we wanted to convert it to a free-form
interaction<00:02:46.440> drag-and-drop<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.550> that<00:02:48.420> just

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
interaction drag-and-drop and that just

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.130 
interaction drag-and-drop and that just
brings<00:02:48.780> up<00:02:49.340> this<00:02:50.340> window<00:02:50.750> where<00:02:51.750> we<00:02:51.989> go

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
brings up this window where we go

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.170 
brings up this window where we go
through<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.470> we<00:02:52.680> set<00:02:52.890> every<00:02:53.370> object<00:02:53.880> on<00:02:54.000> the

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
through and we set every object on the

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.430 
through and we set every object on the
slide<00:02:54.420> right<00:02:55.110> every<00:02:55.440> one<00:02:55.560> of<00:02:55.590> these<00:02:57.350> some<00:02:58.350> of

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
slide right every one of these some of

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.309 
slide right every one of these some of
them<00:02:58.560> over<00:02:58.709> here<00:02:59.010> goes<00:02:59.910> on<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.540> plate<00:03:00.780> so

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
them over here goes on the plate so

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.259 
them over here goes on the plate so
there's<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.590> plate<00:03:01.800> right<00:03:02.670> everything<00:03:03.150> gets

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
there's a plate right everything gets

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.630 
there's a plate right everything gets
assigned<00:03:03.600> to<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.840> plate<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:04.319> what<00:03:04.920> I<00:03:04.950> also<00:03:05.250> do

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
assigned to the plate and what I also do

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.550 
assigned to the plate and what I also do
just<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.150> make<00:03:06.300> that<00:03:06.420> catch-all<00:03:06.900> work<00:03:07.200> is<00:03:07.410> I

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
just to make that catch-all work is I

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.800 
just to make that catch-all work is I
actually<00:03:07.739> add<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.400> hotspot<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.360> rectangle

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
actually add the hotspot the rectangle

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.340 
actually add the hotspot the rectangle
hotspot<00:03:10.200> as<00:03:10.410> a<00:03:10.440> valid<00:03:11.069> drop<00:03:11.819> target<00:03:12.360> but<00:03:13.260> I'm

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
hotspot as a valid drop target but I'm

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.630 
hotspot as a valid drop target but I'm
not<00:03:13.470> setting<00:03:13.800> anything<00:03:14.160> to<00:03:14.340> it<00:03:14.489> I'm<00:03:14.550> not

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
not setting anything to it I'm not

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.880 
not setting anything to it I'm not
assigning<00:03:15.239> any<00:03:15.510> object<00:03:16.140> to<00:03:16.290> that<00:03:16.320> one

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
assigning any object to that one

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.460 
assigning any object to that one
so<00:03:17.250> it<00:03:17.579> registers<00:03:18.420> as<00:03:18.600> a<00:03:18.630> drop<00:03:18.900> target<00:03:19.320> but

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
so it registers as a drop target but

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.800 
so it registers as a drop target but
nothing's<00:03:19.799> going<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.160> it<00:03:20.459> so<00:03:21.360> that<00:03:21.480> just<00:03:21.660> gives

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
nothing's going to it so that just gives

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.780 
nothing's going to it so that just gives
it<00:03:21.930> some<00:03:22.049> additional<00:03:22.380> properties<00:03:22.590> that<00:03:23.400> helps

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
it some additional properties that helps

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.370 
it some additional properties that helps
keep<00:03:24.120> really<00:03:24.450> this<00:03:24.600> interaction<00:03:24.959> smooth

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
keep really this interaction smooth

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.710 
keep really this interaction smooth
otherwise<00:03:25.709> these<00:03:25.980> objects<00:03:26.370> will<00:03:26.489> snap<00:03:26.730> to<00:03:27.450> the

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
otherwise these objects will snap to the

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.590 
otherwise these objects will snap to the
plate<00:03:27.989> each<00:03:28.140> time<00:03:28.489> turn<00:03:29.489> off<00:03:29.670> my<00:03:29.700> feedback<00:03:30.120> and

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
plate each time turn off my feedback and

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.240 
plate each time turn off my feedback and
turn<00:03:30.840> off<00:03:30.930> my<00:03:30.959> score<00:03:31.530> it's<00:03:31.860> not<00:03:32.040> really

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
turn off my score it's not really

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.400 
turn off my score it's not really
important<00:03:32.640> in<00:03:32.700> this<00:03:32.790> interaction<00:03:33.450> then<00:03:34.320> I'm

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
important in this interaction then I'm

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.870 
important in this interaction then I'm
also<00:03:34.530> going<00:03:34.769> to<00:03:34.829> turn<00:03:34.980> off<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.280> snap<00:03:35.519> drop

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
also going to turn off the snap drop

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.000 
also going to turn off the snap drop
target<00:03:36.360> and<00:03:36.450> drop<00:03:37.049> two<00:03:37.170> items<00:03:37.380> to<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.560> target

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
target and drop two items to the target

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.550 
target and drop two items to the target
if<00:03:38.549> they<00:03:39.000> all<00:03:39.120> snap<00:03:39.329> in<00:03:39.720> here<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:39.959> can<00:03:40.260> either<00:03:40.320> do

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
if they all snap in here I can either do

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.190 
if they all snap in here I can either do
it<00:03:40.590> free<00:03:40.950> or<00:03:41.090> random<00:03:42.090> but<00:03:42.690> it<00:03:42.780> just<00:03:42.989> kind<00:03:43.140> of

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
it free or random but it just kind of

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.240 
it free or random but it just kind of
looks<00:03:43.320> a<00:03:43.350> little<00:03:43.410> cluttered<00:03:43.739> so<00:03:43.920> I<00:03:43.980> just<00:03:44.100> want

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
looks a little cluttered so I just want

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.920 
looks a little cluttered so I just want
to<00:03:44.280> let<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.549> learner<00:03:45.030> bring<00:03:45.359> these<00:03:45.510> in<00:03:45.690> in<00:03:45.840> a

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
to let the learner bring these in in a

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.310 
to let the learner bring these in in a
free-form<00:03:46.410> way<00:03:46.620> save<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.549> close<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:48.750> rest<00:03:49.109> of

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
free-form way save and close the rest of

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.590 
free-form way save and close the rest of
this<00:03:49.470> is<00:03:49.739> really<00:03:50.010> controlled<00:03:50.459> by<00:03:50.820> triggers

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
this is really controlled by triggers

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.520 
this is really controlled by triggers
that<00:03:52.019> I<00:03:52.049> set<00:03:52.500> up<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:53.150> variables<00:03:54.150> so<00:03:54.690> variables

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
that I set up and variables so variables

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.199 
that I set up and variables so variables
we<00:03:55.650> actually<00:03:55.920> have<00:03:56.010> four<00:03:56.280> variables<00:03:56.790> group<00:03:57.030> a

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
we actually have four variables group a

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.720 
we actually have four variables group a
B<00:03:57.420> C<00:03:57.630> and<00:03:57.780> D<00:03:57.930> really<00:03:58.410> just<00:03:58.590> one<00:03:58.799> per<00:03:59.310> category

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
B C and D really just one per category

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.960 
B C and D really just one per category
and<00:04:00.209> it's<00:04:00.930> a<00:04:01.019> number<00:04:01.410> variable<00:04:01.769> and<00:04:02.130> so<00:04:02.760> what

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
and it's a number variable and so what

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.789 
and it's a number variable and so what
I'm<00:04:03.090> telling<00:04:03.450> this<00:04:03.570> to<00:04:03.720> do<00:04:03.870> is<00:04:04.019> every<00:04:04.380> time<00:04:04.620> I

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
I'm telling this to do is every time I

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.670 
I'm telling this to do is every time I
drop<00:04:05.310> an<00:04:05.609> object<00:04:06.180> on<00:04:06.630> the<00:04:06.690> plate<00:04:07.109> for<00:04:07.620> each

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
drop an object on the plate for each

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.560 
drop an object on the plate for each
category<00:04:07.950> I<00:04:10.400> want<00:04:11.400> to<00:04:11.670> adjust<00:04:11.820> that<00:04:12.150> variable

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
category I want to adjust that variable

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.810 
category I want to adjust that variable
and<00:04:12.750> so<00:04:13.019> this<00:04:13.200> is<00:04:13.350> Group<00:04:13.590> A<00:04:13.769> I'm<00:04:14.010> going<00:04:14.579> to<00:04:14.640> set

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
and so this is Group A I'm going to set

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.610 
and so this is Group A I'm going to set
Group<00:04:15.060> A<00:04:15.180> I'm<00:04:15.269> going<00:04:15.420> to<00:04:15.480> add<00:04:15.570> one<00:04:15.989> to<00:04:16.200> Group<00:04:16.440> A

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
Group A I'm going to add one to Group A

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.390 
Group A I'm going to add one to Group A
when<00:04:17.039> it's<00:04:17.190> dropped<00:04:17.459> on<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.729> plate<00:04:18.829> the<00:04:19.829> rule

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
when it's dropped on the plate the rule

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.099 
when it's dropped on the plate the rule
I'd<00:04:20.489> say<00:04:20.640> that<00:04:20.760> really<00:04:20.909> the<00:04:21.030> big<00:04:21.630> part<00:04:21.900> of<00:04:22.019> this

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
I'd say that really the big part of this

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.529 
I'd say that really the big part of this
is<00:04:22.349> right<00:04:22.500> here<00:04:22.740> on<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:22.919> subtract<00:04:23.430> I<00:04:23.729> want<00:04:24.450> to

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
is right here on the subtract I want to

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:25.400 
is right here on the subtract I want to
subtract

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
subtract

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.220 
subtract
one<00:04:25.650> each<00:04:26.370> time<00:04:26.880> one<00:04:27.300> of<00:04:27.330> these<00:04:27.510> objects<00:04:28.080> is

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
one each time one of these objects is

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.670 
one each time one of these objects is
dropped<00:04:28.590> over<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.640> hot<00:04:29.970> spot<00:04:30.350> however<00:04:31.350> if<00:04:31.560> you

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
dropped over the hot spot however if you

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.460 
dropped over the hot spot however if you
keep<00:04:31.890> dropping<00:04:32.280> them<00:04:32.700> over<00:04:33.150> you<00:04:33.810> subtract

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
keep dropping them over you subtract

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.260 
keep dropping them over you subtract
then<00:04:34.800> we<00:04:34.890> lose<00:04:35.130> that<00:04:35.160> whole<00:04:35.550> logic

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
then we lose that whole logic

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.180 
then we lose that whole logic
functionality<00:04:37.230> so<00:04:37.410> what<00:04:37.560> I<00:04:37.590> want<00:04:37.860> to<00:04:37.920> do<00:04:38.070> is

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
functionality so what I want to do is

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.430 
functionality so what I want to do is
also<00:04:38.460> add<00:04:38.610> a<00:04:38.640> condition<00:04:38.880> that<00:04:39.180> says<00:04:39.510> on<00:04:39.720> the

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
also add a condition that says on the

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.860 
also add a condition that says on the
condition<00:04:40.920> that<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.760> variable<00:04:42.240> is<00:04:42.360> currently

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
condition that the variable is currently

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.290 
condition that the variable is currently
greater<00:04:43.590> than<00:04:43.800> or<00:04:43.950> equal<00:04:44.010> to<00:04:44.190> one<00:04:44.460> and<00:04:44.700> this

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
greater than or equal to one and this

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.630 
greater than or equal to one and this
really<00:04:45.600> is<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:45.900> same<00:04:46.220> set<00:04:47.220> up<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.490> two

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
really is the same set up the two

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.870 
really is the same set up the two
triggers<00:04:48.000> set<00:04:48.210> up<00:04:48.360> for<00:04:48.780> each<00:04:49.080> of<00:04:49.380> the<00:04:50.190> objects

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
triggers set up for each of the objects

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.030 
triggers set up for each of the objects
so<00:04:51.090> we'll<00:04:51.960> do<00:04:52.050> a<00:04:52.080> little<00:04:52.200> bit<00:04:52.380> more<00:04:52.560> with<00:04:52.860> this

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
so we'll do a little bit more with this

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.470 
so we'll do a little bit more with this
later<00:04:53.340> on<00:04:53.520> the<00:04:53.640> week<00:04:53.790> but<00:04:53.940> I<00:04:53.970> wanted<00:04:54.180> to<00:04:54.240> kind

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
later on the week but I wanted to kind

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.210 
later on the week but I wanted to kind
of<00:04:54.510> share<00:04:54.660> this<00:04:54.870> and<00:04:55.140> put<00:04:55.740> it<00:04:55.830> out<00:04:55.920> there<00:04:55.950> so

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
of share this and put it out there so

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.310 
of share this and put it out there so
you<00:04:56.310> could<00:04:56.400> play<00:04:56.580> with<00:04:56.730> it<00:04:56.940> and<00:04:57.210> look<00:04:57.990> for<00:04:58.170> some

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
you could play with it and look for some

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.670 
you could play with it and look for some
more<00:04:58.500> on<00:04:59.130> this<00:04:59.310> lesson
