that's<00:01:10.680> much<00:01:10.890> larger<00:01:11.100> even<00:01:11.790> though<00:01:12.060> they're

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
that's much larger even though they're

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.609 
that's much larger even though they're
kicking<00:01:12.630> up<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.869> lot<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.080> dust

about 45 miles an hour
the<00:01:21.600> idea<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.110> position<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.950> car<00:01:23.130> well

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
traction slide it's not about speed but
