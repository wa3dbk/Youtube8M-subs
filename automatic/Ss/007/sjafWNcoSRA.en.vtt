00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 today in the world 80 percent low-rise 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.330
 construction and is carried out by frame 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.790
 technology in dubna this industry 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.040
 represents a group of companies time steel 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.230
 time steel offers to its partners 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.690
 complete solution from design to 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.760
 frame assembly at the heart of all the work here 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.380
 such a profile from high quality 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.199
 zinc coated steel 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.640
 plant capacities allow annually 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.510
 produce up to 300 thousand square 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.180
 meters of housing 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.800
 Today our group is one of 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.320
 recognized leaders in the frame area 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.120
 Housing in the company includes 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.890
 Building company 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.320
 production company which 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.850
 directly manufactures steel 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.010
 frameworks of which we build our 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.960
 beautiful ladies equipment company 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.210
 produces high grade parts 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.520
 readiness does not need to measure anything 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.129
 drill or cut parts all items 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.440
 exactly sized hole 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.449
 for fixture already punched builders 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.149
 it remains only to combine these holes 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.579
 and connect them with screws assembly frame 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.030
 reminds the side of the designer easily and 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:07.470
 quickly the whole house is done with finishing 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:10.159
 about three to four months frame then 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.950
 all very quickly here such data 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:18.240
 frame the first floor was put in two 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:21.330
 of the day really build a house of time 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.330
 takes half a year 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.550
 this gives a quick return on investment 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.310
 finishing work inside the building can 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.350
 start immediately after its construction 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.910
 steel structures do not shrink what 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.210
 also significantly reduces costs 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:39.860
 time and money for construction 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.520
 assembly accuracy ensures absolute 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.610
 smooth walls 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:49.590
 absolutely flat corners allowing 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:52.230
 save when finishing work and 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.400
 tenants who are already in this house 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:58.830
 they live thankful and very happy about it 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.030
 which is absolutely exceptional even 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.710
 custom made furniture 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.470
 fit in absolutely all straight corners 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.500
 for 5 years of work as engineers of the company 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.810
 sold more than 1,200 steel buildings and 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.300
 thin-walled structures have been tested 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.430
 differences in climatic conditions building 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.130
 time steel technology already 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.000
 There are in 23 regions of Russia from Makhachkala 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.350
 to Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk on 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.540
 all smo resistivity has high 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.160
 characteristics of such buildings to nine 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.840
 graders scale this building 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.400
 endure will not experience any 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.590
 certain problems the building is very warm 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.260
 building energy efficiency 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.120
 belongs to the class of passive houses 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.010
 only in dubna and steel frames 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.739
 dozens of buildings were built 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.019
 car washes and gas stations, warehouses and garages 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.750
 country houses and production workshops 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.670
 one of the latest developments of the company 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.090
 series of energy efficient multi-unit 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.250
 houses 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.120
 which analogues in Russia yet 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.220
 first of all it is very technological 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.680
 very high degree of factory 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.010
 readiness and accordingly it turns out 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.260
 high speed perfect geometry 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:14.069
 these homes do not shrink justified my 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:17.930
 waiting and one hundred percent house 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:22.170
 very nice house very beautiful nature 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.269
 mascara apartment for a gorgeous warm 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.370
 Moscow region in the village of pace 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.650
 the construction of two successive ones began 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.750
 multi-unit energy-efficient homes 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.599
 most of the apartments are the first house of this 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.400
 the series is already sold out and it is not surprising 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:37.829
 considering the cost per square meter 30 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.040
 thousand rubles there is a question about 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:42.630
 people moved into decent housing when 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.700
 began to consider options 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.940
 construction then concluded that 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.700
 one of how acceptable for us 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.530
 options is building houses 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:57.120
 on metal frame technology 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:59.670
 this technology is new but already has such 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.579
 house 1 built in the village of pace we 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.340
 We can safely say that this 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:07.430
 the house justifies all hope and has 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.919
 great future prospects themselves 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:15.730
 structures with a life of one hundred years 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:18.340
 a lot of talk about the advantages of 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.510
 studied my now in practice see 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.970
 what is the construction of a multi-family 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.889
 three-storey house produced 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:31.450
 almost without lifting 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:35.860
 mechanisms can be said manually with 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:39.780
 manual assembly only when pouring 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:44.310
 floors of the second and third floors 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.310
 concrete pumps were used 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:54.250
 the number of working people did not exceed 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:55.600
 even the most peak loads of 15 people 4 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.910
 similar object was designed 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.560
 time steel companies specifically for 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.930
 operating in the Far North 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.350
 his construction in autonomous Nenets 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.800
 county are planning to complete before the end of 2012 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.660
 of the year 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.700
 to the new technology showed great 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.880
 interest administration several 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.860
 regions of Russia in early March 2012 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.479
 new house came to inspect 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.290
 representatives of the Moscow government 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:19.110
 areas 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.130
 they were pleasantly surprised 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.169
 energy saving performance and 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.510
 quality of housing at such a low 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:27.850
 cost per square meter in particular 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.039
 it was said we believe that these houses 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:34.320
 a great future in the Moscow region 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:39.370
 the lady erected then everyone had a feeling 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:43.360
 some kind of what we collect as a house 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.229
 card talked now seeing how 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.220
 he performed 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:50.289
 people mean heavy furniture and jumped 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.410
 sisters having passed the reliability of this house 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:55.720
 therefore already received many orders 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.000
 time steel has developed a whole 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.530
 a number of architectural and engineering solutions 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.960
 that allow you to build 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.690
 energy efficient buildings are homes of new 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.650
 generations they are quickly built 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.930
 reduce energy consumption 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.030
 eight ten times at lower 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.130
 construction costs are different 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.900
 good heat and sound insulation 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.870
 ventilation and high comfort 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:18.900
 accommodation for tenants first of all 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:21.220
 important ecological properties of the house 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.280
 the house is built from environmentally friendly 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.280
 of materials 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.820
 it is not used phenol formaldehyde 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.010
 connection so on completely by accident 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.860
 heard announcements about this house arrived 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.850
 look 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:37.240
 really nature bribed me 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:40.300
 it is very beautiful here and when I went into the house 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:43.540
 after the terrible heat that was somewhere behind 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:45.490
 30 and the house was cool here already 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:47.320
 talked about sound insulation here 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.840
 very good 

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:55.180
 Well, somehow, so here and decided to stay 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:56.860
 here already in the bones of the tenant not immediately 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.890
 of course, bye for now 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.330
 staged before finishing in winter in winter 

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:04.330
 came convinced that really 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.860
 in the winter here is warm in front of the company yet 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.440
 a lot of work to find the best 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.780
 building solutions now she 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.590
 introduces to the market enclosing panel for 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.270
 high rises 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.370
 their use allows to reduce 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.320
 deadlines for the construction of exterior walls on 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:19.050
 seventy-four percent and this in his 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.190
 queue leads to huge savings 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.470
 most important designers of the company 

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:25.540
 understand the demands of our time 

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.040
 technology time steel aimed at 

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.690
 environmental protection 

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.780
 economical use of natural 

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.780
 resources
