00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
solo let's see how this works out there

00:03:02.549 --> 00:04:30.190 
solo let's see how this works out there
we<00:03:02.640> go

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.450 

okay<00:04:31.200> so<00:04:31.260> you're<00:04:31.500> getting<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:31.860> idea<00:04:32.130> that

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
okay so you're getting the idea that

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.600 
okay so you're getting the idea that
with<00:04:32.730> different<00:04:33.120> sounds<00:04:33.330> it'll<00:04:33.980> mean<00:04:34.980> that

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
with different sounds it'll mean that

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.570 
with different sounds it'll mean that
that<00:04:36.270> original<00:04:36.630> solo<00:04:37.380> net<00:04:37.680> has<00:04:37.860> some<00:04:38.100> support

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
that original solo net has some support

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.280 
that original solo net has some support
now<00:04:38.730> of<00:04:39.180> course<00:04:39.360> a<00:04:39.510> lot<00:04:39.660> of<00:04:39.750> times<00:04:39.930> we<00:04:40.080> leave<00:04:40.260> a

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
now of course a lot of times we leave a

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.220 
now of course a lot of times we leave a
lot<00:04:40.470> of<00:04:40.500> air<00:04:40.710> meaning<00:04:41.040> we<00:04:41.220> don't<00:04:41.340> layer<00:04:41.760> a

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:42.230 
lot of air meaning we don't layer a

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.110 
lot of air meaning we don't layer a
guitar<00:04:43.230> on<00:04:43.530> guitar<00:04:44.040> and<00:04:44.250> guitar<00:04:44.340> are<00:04:44.760> lots<00:04:45.000> of

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120
