hey everyone John from RCD thanks for

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.110 
hey everyone John from RCD thanks for
joining<00:00:05.710> me<00:00:05.830> well<00:00:06.460> you<00:00:06.549> know<00:00:06.640> I<00:00:06.669> love<00:00:06.939> the

blade<00:00:07.299> 200<00:00:07.720> cubic<00:00:07.839> squat<00:00:08.260> copter<00:00:08.590> I<00:00:08.650> think

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:08.860 
blade 200 cubic squat copter I think

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.799 
blade 200 cubic squat copter I think
it's<00:00:08.980> just<00:00:09.129> a<00:00:09.219> great<00:00:09.490> little<00:00:09.730> machine<00:00:09.809> it's

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:10.809 
it's just a great little machine it's

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:12.780 
it's just a great little machine it's
got<00:00:10.900> great<00:00:11.170> power<00:00:11.440> great<00:00:11.590> performance<00:00:12.400> of

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:12.790 
got great power great performance of

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.539 
got great power great performance of
course<00:00:13.089> brushless<00:00:13.690> motors<00:00:14.230> and<00:00:14.950> three<00:00:15.309> great

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:15.549 
course brushless motors and three great

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:16.830 
course brushless motors and three great
flight<00:00:15.790> modes<00:00:16.000> it's<00:00:16.150> got<00:00:16.270> the<00:00:16.390> green<00:00:16.599> low

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.840 
flight modes it's got the green low

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.510 
flight modes it's got the green low
angle<00:00:17.169> mode<00:00:17.320> so<00:00:17.560> you<00:00:17.590> can<00:00:17.890> really<00:00:18.130> learn<00:00:18.310> to

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.520 
angle mode so you can really learn to

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.490 
angle mode so you can really learn to
fly<00:00:18.700> quad<00:00:18.970> copters<00:00:19.329> on<00:00:19.450> that<00:00:19.570> mode<00:00:19.779> very

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
fly quad copters on that mode very

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.560 
fly quad copters on that mode very
docile<00:00:20.880> self-leveling<00:00:21.880> once<00:00:22.419> you're

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
docile self-leveling once you're

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:23.850 
docile self-leveling once you're
comfortable<00:00:22.869> with<00:00:22.960> that<00:00:23.140> glow<00:00:23.290> the<00:00:23.439> blue<00:00:23.619> mode

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
comfortable with that glow the blue mode

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.670 
comfortable with that glow the blue mode
which<00:00:24.130> is<00:00:24.419> higher<00:00:25.419> angles<00:00:25.869> but<00:00:26.200> still<00:00:26.410> self

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680 
which is higher angles but still self

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.440 
which is higher angles but still self
leveling<00:00:27.130> and<00:00:27.309> then<00:00:27.849> you<00:00:27.970> can<00:00:28.090> go<00:00:28.180> to<00:00:28.270> the<00:00:28.329> red

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.450 
leveling and then you can go to the red

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.109 
leveling and then you can go to the red
mode<00:00:28.660> which<00:00:28.869> is<00:00:29.399> basically<00:00:30.399> your<00:00:30.610> manual<00:00:30.969> mode

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:31.119 
mode which is basically your manual mode

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:33.150 
mode which is basically your manual mode
no<00:00:31.300> self<00:00:31.570> levelling<00:00:32.079> high<00:00:32.290> rates<00:00:32.559> and<00:00:32.950> you<00:00:33.010> can

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
no self levelling high rates and you can

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.560 
no self levelling high rates and you can
do<00:00:33.250> your<00:00:33.399> flips<00:00:33.670> and<00:00:33.880> all<00:00:33.969> that<00:00:34.120> kind<00:00:34.300> of<00:00:34.360> stuff

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
do your flips and all that kind of stuff

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.389 
do your flips and all that kind of stuff
and<00:00:34.690> fly<00:00:34.839> really<00:00:35.199> aggressively<00:00:35.620> so<00:00:36.100> in<00:00:36.250> one

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
and fly really aggressively so in one

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:38.160 
and fly really aggressively so in one
package<00:00:36.850> you<00:00:37.030> can<00:00:37.179> bind<00:00:37.839> it<00:00:37.929> to<00:00:38.050> your

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
package you can bind it to your

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.200 
package you can bind it to your
transmitter<00:00:38.620> and<00:00:38.890> you've<00:00:39.370> got<00:00:39.609> three<00:00:39.969> great

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
transmitter and you've got three great

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.939 
transmitter and you've got three great
modes<00:00:40.420> to<00:00:40.570> learn<00:00:40.690> to<00:00:40.809> fly<00:00:40.960> a<00:00:40.989> quadcopter<00:00:41.230> on<00:00:41.679> so

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949 
modes to learn to fly a quadcopter on so

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:43.650 
modes to learn to fly a quadcopter on so
I've<00:00:42.760> always<00:00:42.940> been<00:00:43.030> really<00:00:43.329> impressed<00:00:43.600> with

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
I've always been really impressed with

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.270 
I've always been really impressed with
that<00:00:43.749> and<00:00:43.899> the<00:00:44.410> price<00:00:44.620> point<00:00:44.890> I<00:00:45.010> think<00:00:45.070> is

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
that and the price point I think is

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.860 
that and the price point I think is
great<00:00:45.489> the<00:00:46.059> only<00:00:46.239> thing<00:00:46.390> I've<00:00:46.480> never<00:00:46.600> liked

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
great the only thing I've never liked

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.599 
great the only thing I've never liked
about<00:00:47.019> that<00:00:47.140> quadcopter<00:00:47.800> though<00:00:47.949> is<00:00:48.159> the

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:48.609 
about that quadcopter though is the

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:51.270 
about that quadcopter though is the
frame<00:00:49.179> or<00:00:49.449> the<00:00:49.539> shell<00:00:49.780> very<00:00:50.620> fragile<00:00:51.100> plastic

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
frame or the shell very fragile plastic

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.239 
frame or the shell very fragile plastic
breaks<00:00:52.210> very<00:00:52.420> easily<00:00:52.649> one<00:00:53.649> crash<00:00:53.920> and<00:00:54.159> you're

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:54.249 
breaks very easily one crash and you're

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:56.009 
breaks very easily one crash and you're
probably<00:00:54.399> going<00:00:54.579> to<00:00:54.670> break<00:00:54.760> it<00:00:55.030> and<00:00:55.210> then

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
probably going to break it and then

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:57.450 
probably going to break it and then
basically<00:00:56.350> you're<00:00:56.530> looking<00:00:56.620> at<00:00:56.949> replacing

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
basically you're looking at replacing

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.910 
basically you're looking at replacing
the<00:00:57.579> frame<00:00:58.089> because<00:00:58.539> it's<00:00:58.870> all<00:00:59.019> one<00:00:59.230> piece<00:00:59.589> to

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
the frame because it's all one piece to

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.529 
the frame because it's all one piece to
top<00:01:00.249> you<00:01:00.579> know<00:01:00.670> top<00:01:00.909> piece<00:01:01.120> and<00:01:01.269> a<00:01:01.300> bottom

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
top you know top piece and a bottom

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.959 
top you know top piece and a bottom
piece<00:01:01.690> and<00:01:01.960> when<00:01:02.859> I<00:01:02.890> crashed<00:01:03.249> mine<00:01:03.429> I<00:01:03.460> broke<00:01:03.819> it

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
piece and when I crashed mine I broke it

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:05.460 
piece and when I crashed mine I broke it
right<00:01:04.150> where<00:01:04.330> the<00:01:04.510> arm<00:01:04.690> meets<00:01:05.110> the<00:01:05.229> motor-pod

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
right where the arm meets the motor-pod

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.910 
right where the arm meets the motor-pod
on<00:01:06.340> the<00:01:06.460> top<00:01:06.670> and<00:01:06.880> bottom<00:01:07.240> so<00:01:07.710> kind<00:01:08.710> of<00:01:08.770> bummed

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
on the top and bottom so kind of bummed

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.290 
on the top and bottom so kind of bummed
about<00:01:09.040> it<00:01:09.160> put<00:01:09.400> it<00:01:09.460> back<00:01:09.490> in<00:01:09.790> the<00:01:09.910> bin<00:01:10.090> and

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
about it put it back in the bin and

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.850 
about it put it back in the bin and
thought<00:01:10.450> what<00:01:10.690> should<00:01:11.110> I<00:01:11.140> do<00:01:11.200> with<00:01:11.440> it<00:01:11.620> should

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
thought what should I do with it should

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.190 
thought what should I do with it should
I<00:01:11.950> replace<00:01:12.250> it<00:01:12.430> with<00:01:12.520> a<00:01:12.550> stock<00:01:12.820> frame<00:01:13.120> you<00:01:14.080> know

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
I replace it with a stock frame you know

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.630 
I replace it with a stock frame you know
they<00:01:14.500> don't<00:01:14.560> still<00:01:14.830> be<00:01:14.920> a<00:01:14.950> fragile<00:01:15.370> frame<00:01:15.520> I'll

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
they don't still be a fragile frame I'll

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.430 
they don't still be a fragile frame I'll
probably<00:01:15.790> break<00:01:16.090> it<00:01:16.270> again<00:01:16.360> should<00:01:17.200> I<00:01:17.260> get<00:01:17.350> an

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
probably break it again should I get an

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.690 
probably break it again should I get an
aftermarket<00:01:17.740> frame<00:01:18.100> you<00:01:18.250> know<00:01:18.310> there's<00:01:18.490> a<00:01:18.550> lot

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700

for it but the end of the day I decided
I'll<00:01:25.540> just<00:01:25.690> build<00:01:25.870> my<00:01:25.960> own<00:01:26.110> frame<00:01:26.290> it's<00:01:26.440> a<00:01:26.470> very

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
I'll just build my own frame it's a very

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.300 
I'll just build my own frame it's a very
simple<00:01:27.180> quadcopter<00:01:28.180> very<00:01:28.330> simple<00:01:28.600> design<00:01:28.960> and

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
simple quadcopter very simple design and

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.730 
simple quadcopter very simple design and
I<00:01:30.310> got<00:01:31.300> one<00:01:31.450> piece<00:01:31.630> of<00:01:31.870> two-foot<00:01:32.230> basswood

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
I got one piece of two-foot basswood

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.530 
I got one piece of two-foot basswood
right<00:01:32.920> here<00:01:33.190> and<00:01:33.340> then<00:01:34.030> a<00:01:34.060> little<00:01:34.210> square

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
right here and then a little square

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.990 
right here and then a little square
stock<00:01:34.810> right<00:01:35.050> here<00:01:35.380> this<00:01:35.860> is<00:01:36.040> about<00:01:36.280> two

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
stock right here this is about two

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.400 
stock right here this is about two
dollars<00:01:37.150> and<00:01:37.450> fifty<00:01:37.630> cents<00:01:37.840> worth<00:01:38.020> of<00:01:38.170> wood

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
dollars and fifty cents worth of wood

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.460 
dollars and fifty cents worth of wood
and<00:01:38.770> that's<00:01:39.280> enough<00:01:39.640> to<00:01:39.670> build<00:01:40.030> a<00:01:40.390> new<00:01:41.170> frame

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
and that's enough to build a new frame

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.650 
and that's enough to build a new frame
so<00:01:41.800> this<00:01:42.040> is<00:01:42.160> a<00:01:42.190> very<00:01:42.370> cheap<00:01:42.640> very<00:01:43.150> easy<00:01:43.390> frame

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
so this is a very cheap very easy frame

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.660 
so this is a very cheap very easy frame
to<00:01:43.810> build<00:01:43.930> I<00:01:44.170> really<00:01:44.410> like<00:01:44.560> the<00:01:44.680> way<00:01:44.770> flies<00:01:45.040> and

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
to build I really like the way flies and

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.640 
to build I really like the way flies and
I<00:01:45.730> built<00:01:45.970> it<00:01:46.120> just<00:01:46.150> to<00:01:46.390> be<00:01:46.540> an<00:01:46.630> FB<00:01:46.870> V<00:01:47.020> quadcopter

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
I built it just to be an FB V quadcopter

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.050 
I built it just to be an FB V quadcopter
so<00:01:47.830> you've<00:01:48.010> got<00:01:48.220> just<00:01:48.430> room<00:01:48.640> for<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:48.910> camera

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
so you've got just room for the camera

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.030 
so you've got just room for the camera
and<00:01:49.570> for<00:01:50.080> the<00:01:50.140> battery<00:01:50.440> underneath<00:01:50.770> it's

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
and for the battery underneath it's

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.860 
and for the battery underneath it's
balanced<00:01:51.340> right<00:01:51.490> in<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:51.670> center<00:01:51.970> no<00:01:52.540> room<00:01:52.720> for

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
balanced right in the center no room for

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.120 
balanced right in the center no room for
a<00:01:52.900> Mobius<00:01:53.380> or<00:01:53.500> worrying<00:01:53.710> about<00:01:53.830> how<00:01:54.100> to

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
a Mobius or worrying about how to

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.430 
a Mobius or worrying about how to
balance<00:01:54.370> the<00:01:54.640> Mobius<00:01:55.030> plus<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.390> battery<00:01:55.720> just

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
balance the Mobius plus the battery just

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.410 
balance the Mobius plus the battery just
keep<00:01:56.620> it<00:01:56.740> real<00:01:56.890> simple<00:01:57.100> and<00:01:57.520> just<00:01:57.700> to<00:01:57.760> fpv<00:01:58.150> so

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
keep it real simple and just to fpv so

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.970 
keep it real simple and just to fpv so
we're<00:01:58.990> gonna<00:01:59.080> go<00:01:59.230> ahead<00:01:59.320> i'll<00:01:59.620> show<00:01:59.740> you<00:01:59.830> some

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
we're gonna go ahead i'll show you some

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.260 
we're gonna go ahead i'll show you some
line<00:02:00.130> of<00:02:00.280> sight<00:02:00.460> flying<00:02:00.760> on<00:02:00.940> it<00:02:01.060> real<00:02:01.240> quick

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
line of sight flying on it real quick

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.270 
line of sight flying on it real quick
and<00:02:01.900> then<00:02:02.110> we'll<00:02:02.170> go<00:02:02.260> to<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.440> fpv<00:02:02.860> video<00:02:03.130> now

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
and then we'll go to the fpv video now

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.100 
and then we'll go to the fpv video now
keep<00:02:03.460> in<00:02:03.580> mind<00:02:03.760> the<00:02:03.910> fpv<00:02:04.360> video<00:02:04.630> is<00:02:04.900> the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
keep in mind the fpv video is the

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.720 
keep in mind the fpv video is the
transmitted<00:02:05.710> video<00:02:05.920> from<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:06.280> spectrum

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
transmitted video from the spectrum

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.930 
transmitted video from the spectrum
micro<00:02:07.570> fpv<00:02:08.050> units<00:02:08.440> so<00:02:08.679> it's<00:02:09.429> going<00:02:09.550> to<00:02:09.610> be<00:02:09.759> low

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
micro fpv units so it's going to be low

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.610 
micro fpv units so it's going to be low
resolution<00:02:10.450> video<00:02:10.689> it's<00:02:10.840> not<00:02:10.869> going<00:02:11.079> to<00:02:11.140> be<00:02:11.230> HD

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
resolution video it's not going to be HD

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.050 
resolution video it's not going to be HD
video<00:02:11.890> or<00:02:11.950> anything<00:02:12.099> like<00:02:12.280> that<00:02:12.340> it's

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
video or anything like that it's

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.910 
video or anything like that it's
recorded<00:02:13.450> on<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.599> fat<00:02:13.749> shark<00:02:13.989> Dominator<00:02:14.499> v2

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
recorded on the fat shark Dominator v2

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.199 
recorded on the fat shark Dominator v2
so<00:02:15.219> you're<00:02:15.340> basically<00:02:15.700> seeing<00:02:15.879> what<00:02:16.090> I'm

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
so you're basically seeing what I'm

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:16.480 
so you're basically seeing what I'm
saying

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
saying

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.240 
saying
when<00:02:16.580> I<00:02:16.610> fly<00:02:16.910> with<00:02:17.180> all<00:02:17.900> of<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.230> signal<00:02:19.100> loss

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
when I fly with all of the signal loss

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.440 
when I fly with all of the signal loss
interference<00:02:19.790> all<00:02:19.910> that<00:02:20.060> stuff<00:02:20.210> that<00:02:20.240> goes

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
interference all that stuff that goes

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.480 
interference all that stuff that goes
along<00:02:20.570> with<00:02:20.810> it<00:02:20.870> so<00:02:21.130> they'll<00:02:22.130> give<00:02:22.310> you<00:02:22.400> an

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
along with it so they'll give you an

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.250 
along with it so they'll give you an
idea<00:02:22.580> of<00:02:22.730> how<00:02:22.850> it<00:02:22.940> looks<00:02:23.120> I<00:02:23.360> think<00:02:23.960> it's<00:02:24.050> a<00:02:24.110> lot

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
idea of how it looks I think it's a lot

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.360 
idea of how it looks I think it's a lot
of<00:02:24.380> fun<00:02:24.530> I'm<00:02:24.650> really<00:02:24.680> happy<00:02:24.980> with<00:02:25.160> it

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
of fun I'm really happy with it

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.590 
of fun I'm really happy with it
and<00:02:25.550> I<00:02:25.760> think<00:02:25.970> I'm<00:02:26.060> gonna<00:02:26.180> glide<00:02:26.450> a<00:02:26.510> little

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
and I think I'm gonna glide a little

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.360 
and I think I'm gonna glide a little
more<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.500> I'll<00:02:27.590> probably<00:02:27.740> do<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:27.950> build<00:02:28.130> video

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
more and I'll probably do a build video

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.250 
more and I'll probably do a build video
for<00:02:28.580> you<00:02:28.640> guys<00:02:28.670> so<00:02:28.790> you<00:02:29.030> can<00:02:29.150> see<00:02:29.960> how<00:02:30.110> it's

for you guys so you can see how it's

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.380 
for you guys so you can see how it's

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.120 
built it's very simple very easy and you
can<00:02:32.510> build<00:02:32.630> your<00:02:32.780> own<00:02:32.840> if<00:02:33.200> you<00:02:33.440> do<00:02:33.680> break<00:02:33.890> your

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
can build your own if you do break your

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.370 
can build your own if you do break your
torqx<00:02:34.670> so<00:02:34.850> let's<00:02:35.000> go<00:02:35.090> ahead<00:02:35.210> and<00:02:35.390> see<00:02:36.200> how<00:02:36.230> it

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
torqx so let's go ahead and see how it

00:02:36.380 --> 00:05:23.939 
torqx so let's go ahead and see how it
flies

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:23.949 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:25.900

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
I do have a somewhat strange taste in

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.750 
I do have a somewhat strange taste in
music<00:05:32.840> I<00:05:33.169> guess<00:05:33.410> so<00:05:34.100> if<00:05:34.220> you<00:05:34.280> did<00:05:34.400> want<00:05:34.430> to<00:05:34.639> mute

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
music I guess so if you did want to mute

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.430 
music I guess so if you did want to mute
it<00:05:34.940> or<00:05:35.090> turn<00:05:35.270> it<00:05:35.300> down<00:05:35.510> or<00:05:35.570> turn<00:05:35.990> it<00:05:36.110> off<00:05:36.229> I

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
it or turn it down or turn it off I

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.140 
it or turn it down or turn it off I
don't<00:05:36.650> blame<00:05:36.800> you<00:05:36.949> at<00:05:37.070> all<00:05:37.220> but<00:05:37.790> hey<00:05:37.910> I<00:05:37.940> haven't

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
don't blame you at all but hey I haven't

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.490 
don't blame you at all but hey I haven't
used<00:05:38.330> any<00:05:38.419> dubstep<00:05:38.870> before<00:05:39.169> I<00:05:39.229> think<00:05:39.320> that's

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
used any dubstep before I think that's

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.620 
used any dubstep before I think that's
the<00:05:39.560> first<00:05:39.740> time<00:05:39.889> I've<00:05:40.850> used<00:05:40.910> it<00:05:41.240> in<00:05:41.300> a<00:05:41.389> video

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
the first time I've used it in a video

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.020 
the first time I've used it in a video
so<00:05:41.930> well<00:05:42.320> there's<00:05:42.500> that<00:05:42.680> anyway<00:05:43.669> I<00:05:43.699> do<00:05:43.820> like

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
so well there's that anyway I do like

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.460 
so well there's that anyway I do like
the<00:05:44.150> way<00:05:44.240> the<00:05:44.330> quad<00:05:44.510> flies<00:05:44.780> it's<00:05:45.020> very<00:05:45.199> stable

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:45.470 
the way the quad flies it's very stable

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.439 
the way the quad flies it's very stable
I<00:05:45.889> like<00:05:46.250> the<00:05:46.340> video<00:05:46.490> quality<00:05:46.820> there's<00:05:47.300> not

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:47.449 
I like the video quality there's not

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:49.420 
I like the video quality there's not
much<00:05:47.630> jello<00:05:48.050> at<00:05:48.169> all<00:05:48.320> until<00:05:48.590> you<00:05:48.620> really<00:05:49.010> hit

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
much jello at all until you really hit

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.920 
much jello at all until you really hit
the<00:05:49.550> throttle<00:05:49.790> pretty<00:05:50.120> hard<00:05:50.360> and<00:05:50.570> go<00:05:50.660> straight

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
the throttle pretty hard and go straight

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.030 
the throttle pretty hard and go straight
up<00:05:51.080> then<00:05:51.200> you<00:05:51.290> get<00:05:51.410> a<00:05:51.440> little<00:05:51.650> bit<00:05:51.770> of<00:05:51.860> wobble

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.040 
up then you get a little bit of wobble

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.040 
up then you get a little bit of wobble
but<00:05:52.760> overall<00:05:53.150> it's<00:05:53.300> very<00:05:53.360> smooth<00:05:53.750> very<00:05:53.990> easy

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
but overall it's very smooth very easy

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.719 
but overall it's very smooth very easy
to<00:05:54.260> see<00:05:54.380> where<00:05:54.530> you're<00:05:54.650> going<00:05:54.830> I<00:05:55.130> feel<00:05:55.610> like

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
to see where you're going I feel like

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:57.700 
to see where you're going I feel like
the<00:05:55.820> main<00:05:56.000> limitation<00:05:56.540> as<00:05:56.630> far<00:05:56.780> as<00:05:56.870> the<00:05:57.020> FPV<00:05:57.320> is

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
the main limitation as far as the FPV is

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.219 
the main limitation as far as the FPV is
actually<00:05:58.100> this<00:05:58.280> little<00:05:58.490> fpv<00:05:59.090> unit<00:05:59.419> this<00:05:59.930> quad

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:00.229 
actually this little fpv unit this quad

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:03.010 
actually this little fpv unit this quad
kind<00:06:00.560> of<00:06:00.760> outruns<00:06:01.760> it<00:06:02.000> you<00:06:02.450> get<00:06:02.600> to<00:06:02.720> the<00:06:02.810> far

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
kind of outruns it you get to the far

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.719 
kind of outruns it you get to the far
end<00:06:03.139> of<00:06:03.169> the<00:06:03.260> range<00:06:03.470> pretty<00:06:03.770> quickly<00:06:04.010> this

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:04.729 
end of the range pretty quickly this

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:06.460 
end of the range pretty quickly this
doesn't<00:06:05.000> do<00:06:05.090> great<00:06:05.360> with<00:06:05.510> trees<00:06:05.810> around<00:06:06.139> so

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:06.470 
doesn't do great with trees around so

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.529 
doesn't do great with trees around so
it's<00:06:07.130> almost<00:06:07.340> too<00:06:07.580> much<00:06:07.700> quad<00:06:07.970> for<00:06:08.360> the

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:08.539 
it's almost too much quad for the

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:09.969 
it's almost too much quad for the
transmitter<00:06:09.110> but<00:06:09.289> still<00:06:09.470> a<00:06:09.500> lot<00:06:09.620> of<00:06:09.650> fun<00:06:09.860> to

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:09.979 
transmitter but still a lot of fun to

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:13.690 
transmitter but still a lot of fun to
fly<00:06:10.160> I'm<00:06:10.550> going<00:06:10.970> to<00:06:11.240> try<00:06:11.539> a<00:06:11.870> pico<00:06:12.830> fpv<00:06:13.340> set<00:06:13.550> from

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:13.700 
fly I'm going to try a pico fpv set from

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.550 
fly I'm going to try a pico fpv set from
ready-made<00:06:14.090> RC<00:06:14.510> where<00:06:14.870> the<00:06:14.990> camera<00:06:15.260> goes<00:06:15.289> on

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
ready-made RC where the camera goes on

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.200 
ready-made RC where the camera goes on
the<00:06:15.620> front<00:06:15.860> and<00:06:16.010> you<00:06:16.100> have<00:06:16.130> the<00:06:16.400> little<00:06:16.669> video

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
the front and you have the little video

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:18.670 
the front and you have the little video
transmitter<00:06:17.690> in<00:06:17.840> the<00:06:17.930> back<00:06:18.110> and<00:06:18.380> just<00:06:18.500> see<00:06:18.650> how

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 
transmitter in the back and just see how

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.620 
transmitter in the back and just see how
that<00:06:18.919> does<00:06:19.190> I'm<00:06:19.699> hoping<00:06:19.970> for<00:06:20.030> a<00:06:20.150> little<00:06:20.270> bit<00:06:20.479> of

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:20.630 
that does I'm hoping for a little bit of

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.900 
that does I'm hoping for a little bit of
a<00:06:20.690> better<00:06:20.840> result<00:06:21.260> compared<00:06:21.740> to<00:06:21.889> the<00:06:22.100> spectrum

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:22.910 
a better result compared to the spectrum

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.520 
a better result compared to the spectrum
unit<00:06:23.240> so<00:06:23.810> we'll<00:06:23.930> see<00:06:24.050> how<00:06:24.139> that<00:06:24.200> goes<00:06:24.350> but

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.530 
unit so we'll see how that goes but

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:25.750 
unit so we'll see how that goes but
overall<00:06:24.919> I'm<00:06:24.979> very<00:06:25.010> happy<00:06:25.190> with<00:06:25.520> it

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:25.760 
overall I'm very happy with it

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.090 
overall I'm very happy with it
quad<00:06:26.630> seems<00:06:26.870> pretty<00:06:27.020> durable<00:06:27.530> I<00:06:27.650> had<00:06:27.800> that<00:06:27.919> one

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:28.100 
quad seems pretty durable I had that one

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.950 
quad seems pretty durable I had that one
crash<00:06:28.669> where<00:06:29.000> I<00:06:29.030> was<00:06:29.270> going<00:06:29.479> towards<00:06:29.600> a<00:06:29.780> tree

trying<00:06:30.229> to<00:06:30.350> decide<00:06:30.590> to<00:06:30.710> go<00:06:30.830> left<00:06:31.130> or<00:06:31.400> right<00:06:31.580> and

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:31.970 
trying to decide to go left or right and

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.570 
trying to decide to go left or right and
ended<00:06:32.599> up<00:06:32.660> deciding<00:06:33.110> to<00:06:33.139> go<00:06:33.260> neither<00:06:34.160> left<00:06:34.490> nor

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:34.580 
ended up deciding to go neither left nor

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.100 
ended up deciding to go neither left nor
right<00:06:34.729> and<00:06:35.090> just<00:06:35.240> go<00:06:35.330> straight<00:06:35.570> into<00:06:35.810> the<00:06:35.900> tree

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
right and just go straight into the tree

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.930 
right and just go straight into the tree
because<00:06:36.470> that<00:06:36.740> seemed<00:06:36.979> like<00:06:37.010> a<00:06:37.130> better<00:06:37.340> idea

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:37.940 
because that seemed like a better idea

prop this was bent up at 90 degrees I
just<00:06:45.080> bent<00:06:45.260> it<00:06:45.349> back<00:06:45.410> and<00:06:45.740> kept<00:06:45.889> flying<00:06:46.099> now<00:06:46.400> I

just bent it back and kept flying now I
don't<00:06:46.669> really<00:06:46.820> recommend<00:06:46.970> doing<00:06:47.330> that

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:47.510 
don't really recommend doing that

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:48.879 
don't really recommend doing that
because<00:06:47.660> you<00:06:48.050> can<00:06:48.169> see<00:06:48.320> that<00:06:48.470> mark<00:06:48.710> right

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:48.889 
because you can see that mark right

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:50.770 
because you can see that mark right
there<00:06:48.919> that's<00:06:49.789> a<00:06:49.970> real<00:06:50.150> weak<00:06:50.330> spot<00:06:50.570> in<00:06:50.690> the

spare prop with me and I sided just to

spare prop with me and I sided just to

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:57.590
