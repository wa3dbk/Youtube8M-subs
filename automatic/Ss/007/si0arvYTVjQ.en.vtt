00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210 
and barbarians the reason for this if

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.000 
and barbarians the reason for this if
you<00:03:22.720> look<00:03:22.840> directly<00:03:23.020> in<00:03:23.410> front<00:03:23.560> of<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.770> wizard

square leading into that Valley and

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.420 
square leading into that Valley and
that's<00:03:29.230> going<00:03:29.410> to<00:03:29.500> allow<00:03:29.740> the<00:03:29.800> wizard<00:03:30.280> tower

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
come down that single path so he's just

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.740

the<00:03:38.350> center<00:03:38.710> of<00:03:38.800> the<00:03:38.920> base<00:03:39.070> is<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.940> archer

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
the center of the base is the archer

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.640 
the center of the base is the archer
towers<00:03:40.390> I've<00:03:40.570> put<00:03:40.720> these<00:03:40.840> in<00:03:40.960> the<00:03:41.050> center<00:03:41.230> for

towers I've put these in the center for

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.680 
towers I've put these in the center for
one<00:03:41.830> reason<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:42.340> that's<00:03:42.400> because<00:03:42.850> archers

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
one reason and that's because archers

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.230 
one reason and that's because archers
are<00:03:43.930> very<00:03:44.800> good<00:03:45.130> at<00:03:45.310> defending<00:03:45.760> against

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
are very good at defending against

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.300 
are very good at defending against
larger<00:03:46.960> troops<00:03:47.200> such<00:03:47.410> as<00:03:47.530> barbarian<00:03:48.100> king

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
larger troops such as barbarian king

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.640 
larger troops such as barbarian king

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
Archer Queen Giants anything on that

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.890 
Archer Queen Giants anything on that
scale<00:03:50.950> so<00:03:51.730> you've<00:03:51.940> got<00:03:52.090> kind<00:03:52.330> of<00:03:52.420> a<00:03:52.480> mix<00:03:52.720> the

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
scale so you've got kind of a mix the

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.690 
scale so you've got kind of a mix the
wizards<00:03:53.230> house<00:03:53.380> I'm<00:03:53.620> going<00:03:53.710> to<00:03:53.800> take<00:03:53.980> out<00:03:54.220> the

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
wizards house I'm going to take out the

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.540 
wizards house I'm going to take out the
archers<00:03:55.180> and<00:03:55.390> the<00:03:55.720> barbarians<00:03:56.230> but<00:03:56.550> the

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
archers and the barbarians but the

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.190 
archers and the barbarians but the
wizard<00:03:57.850> tower<00:03:58.000> was<00:03:58.150> not<00:03:58.180> very<00:03:58.540> easy<00:03:58.630> to<00:03:58.870> get<00:03:59.140> to

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
wizard tower was not very easy to get to

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.510 
wizard tower was not very easy to get to
so<00:03:59.350> it's<00:03:59.680> not<00:03:59.770> really<00:04:00.010> going<00:04:00.130> to<00:04:00.190> get<00:04:00.280> taken

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
so it's not really going to get taken

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.520 
so it's not really going to get taken
out<00:04:00.760> and<00:04:00.970> then<00:04:01.810> you've<00:04:01.960> obviously<00:04:02.080> got<00:04:02.470> the

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
out and then you've obviously got the

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.170 
out and then you've obviously got the
archer<00:04:02.890> towers<00:04:03.160> directly<00:04:03.760> in<00:04:03.850> the<00:04:03.940> center

which<00:04:04.330> you're<00:04:04.450> going<00:04:04.540> to<00:04:04.600> defend<00:04:04.990> against

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
which you're going to defend against

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:06.890 
which you're going to defend against
