Ramos and also I think a second inform
even<00:01:55.350> third<00:01:55.590> inform<00:01:56.040> Alexis<00:01:56.520> Sanchez<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.299> are

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
even third inform Alexis Sanchez so are

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.300 
even third inform Alexis Sanchez so are

this time actually from a pretty
different<00:02:08.879> angle<00:02:09.209> but<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.420> never<00:02:09.660> know<00:02:09.869> it

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989

to<00:02:37.500> go<00:02:37.620> with<00:02:37.650> some<00:02:37.920> skin<00:02:38.220> was<00:02:38.400> a<00:02:38.430> bit<00:02:38.730> of

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
to go with some skin was a bit of

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.670 
to go with some skin was a bit of
shielding<00:02:39.209> work<00:02:39.390> as<00:02:39.569> well<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:40.200> didn't<00:02:40.560> really

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
shielding work as well it didn't really

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.619 
shielding work as well it didn't really
look<00:02:40.799> that<00:02:41.189> nice<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.730> just<00:02:42.090> went<00:02:42.299> with<00:02:42.390> fake

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
look that nice so I just went with fake

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.210 
look that nice so I just went with fake
shot<00:02:42.840> instead<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.409> I<00:02:43.470> just<00:02:43.709> finished<00:02:44.040> it<00:02:44.099> off

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
shot instead and I just finished it off

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.710 
shot instead and I just finished it off
really<00:02:44.459> not<00:02:44.700> really<00:02:44.879> a<00:02:44.909> skill<00:02:45.180> Bowl<00:02:45.359> I<00:02:45.390> feel

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
really not really a skill Bowl I feel

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.690 
really not really a skill Bowl I feel
that<00:02:46.379> is<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.560> reason<00:02:46.709> why<00:02:46.980> I<00:02:47.010> decide<00:02:47.459> not<00:02:47.489> to

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
that is the reason why I decide not to

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.250 
that is the reason why I decide not to
count<00:02:48.060> it<00:02:48.269> and<00:02:48.480> now<00:02:48.569> we're<00:02:48.720> in<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.840> 85th

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
count it and now we're in the 85th

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.539 
count it and now we're in the 85th
minute<00:02:49.470> we<00:02:49.650> have<00:02:49.739> quiche<00:02:49.980> inaudible<00:02:50.430> I

minute we have quiche inaudible I

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.759 
minute we have quiche inaudible I
decided<00:02:50.909> to<00:02:51.000> stop<00:02:51.209> him<00:02:51.329> on<00:02:51.420> once<00:02:51.659> again<00:02:51.989> we<00:02:52.590> cut

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
decided to stop him on once again we cut

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.199 
decided to stop him on once again we cut

inside here what we teen yo a few
bottles<00:02:54.629> again<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:55.019> was<00:02:55.230> hoping<00:02:55.530> for<00:02:55.590> a<00:02:55.799> rabona

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
bottles again I was hoping for a rabona

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.099 
bottles again I was hoping for a rabona
shot<00:02:56.489> I<00:02:56.519> could<00:02:56.819> have<00:02:56.909> been<00:02:57.030> sweet<00:02:57.329> that<00:02:57.870> late

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
shot I could have been sweet that late

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.080 
shot I could have been sweet that late
in<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.439> game<00:02:58.590> but<00:02:58.650> unfortunately<00:02:58.920> it<00:02:59.639> went

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
in the game but unfortunately it went

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.849 
in the game but unfortunately it went
white<00:03:00.359> once<00:03:00.689> again<00:03:00.989> so<00:03:01.260> uh<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.560> is<00:03:01.650> pretty

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
white once again so uh that is pretty

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.379 
white once again so uh that is pretty
much<00:03:01.980> hard<00:03:02.189> at<00:03:02.280> game<00:03:02.489> and<00:03:02.730> that<00:03:02.790> we<00:03:03.000> ended<00:03:03.269> up

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
much hard at game and that we ended up

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.300 
much hard at game and that we ended up
winning<00:03:03.629> that<00:03:03.780> game<00:03:04.019> wanting<00:03:04.560> nil<00:03:04.709> we<00:03:05.189> had<00:03:05.280> a

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
winning that game wanting nil we had a

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.369 
winning that game wanting nil we had a
lot<00:03:05.489> of<00:03:05.549> chances<00:03:06.000> mainly<00:03:06.239> rabona<00:03:06.750> shots<00:03:07.139> but

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
lot of chances mainly rabona shots but

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.050 
lot of chances mainly rabona shots but
we<00:03:07.530> we<00:03:08.040> weren't<00:03:08.280> ready<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.519> get<00:03:08.609> lucky<00:03:08.849> in<00:03:08.970> that

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
we we weren't ready to get lucky in that

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.119 
we we weren't ready to get lucky in that
game<00:03:09.299> I'm<00:03:09.450> afraid<00:03:09.780> so<00:03:10.049> we<00:03:10.230> go<00:03:10.530> into<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:10.920> third

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
game I'm afraid so we go into the third

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.660 
game I'm afraid so we go into the third
game<00:03:11.340> we<00:03:11.819> came<00:03:11.970> against<00:03:12.299> a<00:03:12.420> silver<00:03:13.049> team<00:03:13.260> 83<00:03:14.010> 83

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
game we came against a silver team 83 83

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.369 
game we came against a silver team 83 83
chemistry<00:03:15.209> a<00:03:15.299> lot<00:03:15.389> of<00:03:15.629> players<00:03:15.840> I<00:03:16.019> think<00:03:16.049> from

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
chemistry a lot of players I think from

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:18.470 
chemistry a lot of players I think from
a<00:03:16.470> Saudi<00:03:16.739> leak<00:03:17.010> and<00:03:17.159> the<00:03:17.280> Liga<00:03:17.579> BBVA<00:03:17.760> as<00:03:18.209> well

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
a Saudi leak and the Liga BBVA as well

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.390 
a Saudi leak and the Liga BBVA as well
and<00:03:18.690> we<00:03:18.989> getting<00:03:19.319> start<00:03:19.560> off<00:03:19.650> with<00:03:19.799> toe<00:03:19.980> such<00:03:20.220> a

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
and we getting start off with toe such a

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.309 
and we getting start off with toe such a
nice<00:03:20.819> gear<00:03:21.120> on<00:03:21.209> straight<00:03:21.510> from<00:03:21.690> kickoff<00:03:21.989> I<00:03:22.169> was

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
nice gear on straight from kickoff I was

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.259 
nice gear on straight from kickoff I was
actually<00:03:22.620> trying<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.160> get<00:03:23.370> a<00:03:23.430> rabona<00:03:23.699> shot<00:03:24.060> but

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
actually trying to get a rabona shot but

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.479 
actually trying to get a rabona shot but
I<00:03:24.299> think<00:03:24.660> he<00:03:25.139> he<00:03:25.440> doesn't<00:03:25.799> have<00:03:25.889> the<00:03:25.980> flat<00:03:26.220> rate

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
I think he he doesn't have the flat rate

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:27.979 
I think he he doesn't have the flat rate
so<00:03:26.519> I<00:03:26.730> that<00:03:26.940> is<00:03:27.030> why<00:03:27.180> it<00:03:27.239> actually<00:03:27.449> ended<00:03:27.930> up

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
so I that is why it actually ended up

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.839 
so I that is why it actually ended up
being<00:03:28.169> a<00:03:28.379> normal<00:03:28.829> chip<00:03:29.099> shot<00:03:29.340> then<00:03:29.579> in<00:03:29.760> the

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
being a normal chip shot then in the

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.550 
being a normal chip shot then in the
fifth<00:03:30.060> minute<00:03:30.209> we<00:03:30.510> picked<00:03:30.750> up<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:30.989> free-kick

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
fifth minute we picked up a free-kick

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.920 
fifth minute we picked up a free-kick
you<00:03:32.190> can<00:03:32.340> see<00:03:32.549> it<00:03:32.639> I<00:03:32.760> aim<00:03:33.030> it<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.329> a<00:03:33.359> lava<00:03:33.629> but

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
you can see it I aim it to a lava but

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.750 
you can see it I aim it to a lava but
for<00:03:34.079> some<00:03:34.319> reason<00:03:34.650> Laurie<00:03:34.799> spots<00:03:35.220> it<00:03:35.430> straight

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
for some reason Laurie spots it straight

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.490 
for some reason Laurie spots it straight
into<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.180> feet<00:03:36.359> of<00:03:36.480> my<00:03:36.629> opponent<00:03:37.169> and<00:03:37.409> he

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
into the feet of my opponent and he

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.319 
into the feet of my opponent and he
obviously<00:03:37.650> made<00:03:38.129> it<00:03:38.159> one<00:03:38.459> nil<00:03:38.639> for<00:03:38.669> an<00:03:38.909> opener

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
obviously made it one nil for an opener

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:40.699 
obviously made it one nil for an opener
to<00:03:39.510> a<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.780> give<00:03:39.989> an<00:03:40.139> elite

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
to a to give an elite

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.170 
to a to give an elite
bit<00:03:40.829> of<00:03:40.859> a<00:03:40.980> stupid<00:03:41.310> go<00:03:41.430> to<00:03:41.579> concede<00:03:41.909> to<00:03:42.060> be

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
bit of a stupid go to concede to be

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.180 
bit of a stupid go to concede to be
honest<00:03:42.479> I<00:03:42.659> think<00:03:42.930> I<00:03:43.229> wasn't<00:03:43.409> like<00:03:43.709> aiming

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
honest I think I wasn't like aiming

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.409 
honest I think I wasn't like aiming
enough<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.579> the<00:03:44.669> left<00:03:44.879> side<00:03:45.090> with<00:03:45.269> my

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
enough to the left side with my

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:47.210 
enough to the left side with my
controller<00:03:45.810> but<00:03:46.019> anyway<00:03:46.319> when<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:46.889> 7th

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
controller but anyway when the 7th

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.500 
controller but anyway when the 7th
minute<00:03:47.370> stretched<00:03:47.699> from<00:03:47.790> kickoff<00:03:48.090> again<00:03:48.359> we

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
minute stretched from kickoff again we

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.879 
minute stretched from kickoff again we
go<00:03:48.659> on<00:03:48.720> a<00:03:48.810> nice<00:03:48.959> ski<00:03:49.260> run<00:03:49.379> this<00:03:49.500> time<00:03:49.739> with

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
go on a nice ski run this time with

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.099 
go on a nice ski run this time with
rebury<00:03:50.159> and<00:03:50.489> we<00:03:50.579> obviously<00:03:50.819> finish<00:03:51.690> it<00:03:51.810> off<00:03:51.930> to

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
rebury and we obviously finish it off to

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.390 
rebury and we obviously finish it off to
it<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.409> pretty<00:03:52.620> much<00:03:52.769> get<00:03:52.949> a<00:03:53.010> goal<00:03:53.250> back

we got past the goalkeeper but then the

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.450 
we got past the goalkeeper but then the
rabona<00:04:24.810> like<00:04:25.440> for<00:04:25.710> an<00:04:25.770> open<00:04:26.159> net<00:04:26.279> we've

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
rabona like for an open net we've

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
rabona like for an open net we've
actually<00:04:26.700> put<00:04:27.210> it

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
actually put it

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.270 
actually put it
over<00:04:27.660> the<00:04:27.780> bar<00:04:27.990> I<00:04:28.320> just<00:04:28.380> couldn't<00:04:28.950> believe<00:04:29.070> it

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
over the bar I just couldn't believe it

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.130 
over the bar I just couldn't believe it
we<00:04:29.490> had<00:04:29.580> so<00:04:29.820> many<00:04:30.030> chances<00:04:30.450> and<00:04:30.780> I<00:04:30.930> thought

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
we had so many chances and I thought

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.200 
we had so many chances and I thought
this<00:04:31.410> was<00:04:31.620> a<00:04:31.680> chance<00:04:32.040> that<00:04:32.520> we<00:04:32.640> finally<00:04:33.090> got

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
this was a chance that we finally got

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.240 
this was a chance that we finally got
the<00:04:33.330> rabona<00:04:33.660> go<00:04:33.900> but<00:04:34.080> I'm<00:04:34.170> afraid<00:04:34.350> it<00:04:34.920> was<00:04:34.980> not

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
the rabona go but I'm afraid it was not

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.280 
the rabona go but I'm afraid it was not
really<00:04:35.370> our<00:04:35.580> lucky<00:04:35.820> day<00:04:36.090> so<00:04:36.150> we<00:04:36.720> went<00:04:36.930> into<00:04:37.080> the

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
really our lucky day so we went into the

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.660 
really our lucky day so we went into the
second<00:04:37.620> off<00:04:37.680> I<00:04:37.830> decided<00:04:37.890> to<00:04:38.220> make<00:04:38.370> a<00:04:38.400> few

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
second off I decided to make a few

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.370 
second off I decided to make a few
changes<00:04:38.730> and<00:04:39.270> you<00:04:39.690> can<00:04:39.810> see<00:04:39.960> that<00:04:40.110> the<00:04:40.200> bottom

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
changes and you can see that the bottom

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.900 
changes and you can see that the bottom
as<00:04:40.620> well<00:04:40.740> I<00:04:40.800> had<00:04:41.010> to<00:04:41.130> wait<00:04:41.310> like<00:04:41.490> pretty<00:04:41.820> much

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
as well I had to wait like pretty much

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.360 
as well I had to wait like pretty much
the<00:04:42.240> whole<00:04:42.510> 40<00:04:43.110> seconds<00:04:43.470> I<00:04:43.530> think<00:04:43.590> you<00:04:44.220> usually

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
the whole 40 seconds I think you usually

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.830 
the whole 40 seconds I think you usually
have<00:04:44.610> to<00:04:44.760> wait<00:04:44.910> so<00:04:45.090> I<00:04:45.120> decided<00:04:45.450> to<00:04:45.540> bring<00:04:45.690> on

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.500 
kick off he decided not to do anything

winning that game two to one and since
it<00:05:14.190> was<00:05:14.340> in<00:05:14.490> the<00:05:14.580> second<00:05:14.940> half<00:05:15.030> my<00:05:15.210> opponent

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
it was in the second half my opponent

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.870 
it was in the second half my opponent
decided<00:05:16.020> to<00:05:16.140> leave<00:05:16.350> it<00:05:16.860> usually<00:05:17.520> would<00:05:17.670> mean

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
decided to leave it usually would mean

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.580 
decided to leave it usually would mean
that<00:05:18.090> this<00:05:18.210> game<00:05:18.480> will<00:05:18.630> actually<00:05:18.690> count<00:05:19.200> but

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
that this game will actually count but

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.230 
that this game will actually count but
like<00:05:19.800> straight<00:05:20.280> from<00:05:20.460> kickoff<00:05:20.790> he<00:05:20.970> didn't

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
like straight from kickoff he didn't

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.970 
like straight from kickoff he didn't
really<00:05:21.390> do<00:05:21.480> anything<00:05:21.750> so<00:05:22.260> that<00:05:22.560> is<00:05:22.650> kind<00:05:22.920> of

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
really do anything so that is kind of

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.010 
really do anything so that is kind of
the<00:05:23.100> reason<00:05:23.280> why<00:05:24.030> I<00:05:24.060> decide<00:05:24.510> not<00:05:24.540> to<00:05:24.750> count

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
the reason why I decide not to count

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.510 
the reason why I decide not to count
this<00:05:25.170> game<00:05:25.410> because<00:05:25.800> he<00:05:25.980> also<00:05:26.130> could<00:05:26.430> have

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
this game because he also could have

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.340 
this game because he also could have
easily<00:05:26.790> left<00:05:27.180> basically<00:05:27.600> during<00:05:28.050> halftime

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
easily left basically during halftime

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.170 
easily left basically during halftime
and<00:05:28.830> then<00:05:29.070> it<00:05:29.220> was<00:05:29.370> still<00:05:29.550> in<00:05:29.670> the<00:05:29.760> first<00:05:29.940> stuff

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
and then it was still in the first stuff

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.550 
and then it was still in the first stuff
if<00:05:30.330> you<00:05:30.450> know<00:05:30.570> what<00:05:30.720> I<00:05:30.750> mean<00:05:30.960> so<00:05:31.170> I'm<00:05:31.320> not<00:05:31.440> going

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
if you know what I mean so I'm not going

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.530 
if you know what I mean so I'm not going
to<00:05:31.620> count<00:05:31.740> this<00:05:31.920> game<00:05:32.130> which<00:05:32.940> i<00:05:33.060> think<00:05:33.120> is<00:05:33.360> fair

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 
to count this game which i think is fair

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.330 
to count this game which i think is fair
enough<00:05:33.720> so<00:05:33.960> we<00:05:34.110> go<00:05:34.200> into<00:05:34.320> the<00:05:34.440> final<00:05:34.590> game<00:05:34.920> we

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
enough so we go into the final game we

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.740 
enough so we go into the final game we
cover<00:05:35.520> against<00:05:35.730> a<00:05:35.850> pretty<00:05:36.120> nice-looking<00:05:36.330> team

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
cover against a pretty nice-looking team

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.600 
cover against a pretty nice-looking team
actually<00:05:36.930> with<00:05:37.290> the<00:05:37.440> in-form<00:05:37.890> alien<00:05:38.340> form

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
actually with the in-form alien form

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.460 
actually with the in-form alien form
Lintz<00:05:38.910> and<00:05:39.060> i<00:05:39.120> think<00:05:39.390> also<00:05:39.570> at<00:05:39.930> the<00:05:40.020> five-star

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
Lintz and i think also at the five-star

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.320 
Lintz and i think also at the five-star
scale<00:05:40.620> our<00:05:40.800> democracy<00:05:41.580> man<00:05:41.790> now<00:05:41.940> we<00:05:42.090> start

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
scale our democracy man now we start

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.640 
scale our democracy man now we start
things<00:05:42.480> off<00:05:42.600> just<00:05:42.930> before<00:05:43.230> half-time<00:05:43.350> with

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
things off just before half-time with

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.320 
things off just before half-time with
jewelry<00:05:44.010> we<00:05:44.130> get<00:05:44.310> past<00:05:44.520> the<00:05:44.670> goalkeeper<00:05:44.850> and

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
jewelry we get past the goalkeeper and

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.450 
jewelry we get past the goalkeeper and
it<00:05:45.840> can't<00:05:46.110> just<00:05:46.200> like<00:05:46.530> in<00:05:46.770> the<00:05:46.860> previous<00:05:47.280> game

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
it can't just like in the previous game

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.370 
it can't just like in the previous game
for<00:05:47.730> an<00:05:47.790> open<00:05:48.180> net<00:05:48.330> we<00:05:48.810> actually<00:05:49.140> put<00:05:49.350> the

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
for an open net we actually put the

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.110 
for an open net we actually put the
rabona<00:05:49.800> pretty<00:05:50.160> much<00:05:50.310> over<00:05:50.610> the<00:05:50.700> bar<00:05:50.940> which

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
rabona pretty much over the bar which

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.730 
rabona pretty much over the bar which
which<00:05:51.480> was<00:05:51.630> a<00:05:51.660> big<00:05:51.900> shame<00:05:52.140> again<00:05:52.290> I<00:05:52.440> would<00:05:52.650> have

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
which was a big shame again I would have

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:53.900 
which was a big shame again I would have
thought<00:05:52.890> that<00:05:53.070> would<00:05:53.220> have<00:05:53.400> gone<00:05:53.550> in<00:05:53.760> but

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
thought that would have gone in but

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.340 
thought that would have gone in but
afraid<00:05:54.330> I'm<00:05:54.510> not<00:05:54.660> that<00:05:54.870> was<00:05:54.990> not<00:05:55.110> really<00:05:55.260> the

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
afraid I'm not that was not really the

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.720 
afraid I'm not that was not really the
case<00:05:55.620> then<00:05:55.890> in<00:05:55.950> the<00:05:56.010> second<00:05:56.310> half<00:05:56.430> we<00:05:56.550> got<00:05:56.670> a

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
could have been a really really nice

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.600 
could have been a really really nice
goal<00:06:12.870> but<00:06:13.020> then<00:06:13.200> straight<00:06:13.560> after<00:06:13.890> that<00:06:13.920> my

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
goal but then straight after that my

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.190 
goal but then straight after that my
opponent<00:06:15.090> actually<00:06:15.420> decided<00:06:15.780> to<00:06:15.840> score<00:06:16.110> an

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
opponent actually decided to score an

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.560 
opponent actually decided to score an
own<00:06:16.350> goal<00:06:16.580> I'm<00:06:17.580> not<00:06:17.790> really<00:06:17.880> too<00:06:18.060> sure<00:06:18.090> why<00:06:18.420> he

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570 
own goal I'm not really too sure why he

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.210 
own goal I'm not really too sure why he
did<00:06:18.720> it<00:06:18.750> maybe<00:06:19.050> he<00:06:19.290> felt<00:06:19.500> sorry<00:06:19.590> because<00:06:20.160> I

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
did it maybe he felt sorry because I

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.770 
did it maybe he felt sorry because I
missed<00:06:20.550> that<00:06:20.670> chance<00:06:20.880> with<00:06:21.060> Picasso<00:06:21.420> even

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
missed that chance with Picasso even

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.420 
missed that chance with Picasso even
which<00:06:21.960> as<00:06:22.080> I<00:06:22.110> said<00:06:22.380> could<00:06:22.920> have<00:06:23.010> been<00:06:23.130> a<00:06:23.160> really

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
which as I said could have been a really

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.740 
which as I said could have been a really
really<00:06:23.610> sweet<00:06:23.730> goal<00:06:24.060> so<00:06:24.270> that<00:06:24.300> could<00:06:24.660> have

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
really sweet goal so that could have

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.270 
really sweet goal so that could have
been<00:06:24.870> the<00:06:25.020> reason<00:06:25.170> but<00:06:25.500> I<00:06:25.560> mean<00:06:25.800> yeah<00:06:25.890> we<00:06:26.010> ended

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
been the reason but I mean yeah we ended

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.430 
been the reason but I mean yeah we ended
up<00:06:26.340> winning<00:06:26.520> that<00:06:26.730> game<00:06:26.940> two<00:06:27.300> to<00:06:27.540> nil<00:06:27.780> we
