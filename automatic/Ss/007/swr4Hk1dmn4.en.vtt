00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.210
 things started to get confused 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.030
 Uruguay passed the president of the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.130
 republic assumed the subject Suarez as a 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.810
 state issue and yesterday the president of 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.390
 chile received the team the truth 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.189
 I understand I understand the anguish of putting 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.830
 sports loss but from there to 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.750
 move the national facts of 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.060
 debate when these South American countries 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.219
 they have so many difficulties and they do not 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.260
 dramatizes both the situation really 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.300
 it makes us think it makes me think 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.309
 that we have our head somewhere else or we 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.750
 they have taken the head to another side and 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.329
 it may be that we are 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.489
 responsible also I do not take off 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.950
 no responsibility no no no no 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.899
 way by feminism by 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.489
 nationalism does not interest me I do not believe in 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.309
 the nationalisms I do not think I do not think 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.980
 absolutely but I believe in the 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.840
 universalism not in nationalism the 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.520
 nationalism is a deformation without 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.890
 no doubt about national sentiment 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.930
 that ends in what we already know has 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.700
 finished in many countries but good 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.120
 that does not mean it 's not patriot 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.590
 do not 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.110
 interest is what happens in Argentina 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.760
 that's another thing absolutely something else 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.780
 that is afflicted by the things that you 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.760
 Argentines pass if now nationalist 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.580
 to dramatize for things that are 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.750
 absolutely minor please 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.430
 well let's deal with the issue with 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.580
 specialist because it's a subject that 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.920
 of course this one rolls for soft 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.270
 what am I going to say with the world in japan 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.920
 come to the players and the 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.400
 they applauded everyone for it to publish it 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.400
 and they were eliminated 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.460
 no spirit to contradict you and obviously 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.800
 My opinion is very small but I know that 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.240
 he listens to you very carefully I also 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.650
 I share with you the issue of not going to the 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.330
 ends later I'm going to get into the 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.340
 Argentine team that came down at the same time and 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.280
 for omen but I like to see the 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.350
 player who gets excited with that note 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.500
 because they are ambassadors, although it is true 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.750
 that no no that but if the government 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.790
 dollar is that the debt is not going to change 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.010
 external but I do like that they receive it 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.570
 no no but I do not like it I like it 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.729
 receive governments because they are 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.740
 ambassadors represent a country 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.390
 also because they play with the shirt 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.530
 obviously and taking the distances 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.530
 because they represent 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.510
 no no no no no no represent a 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.370
 federation that plays a sport in a 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.900
 certain country 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.870
 do not confuse do not confuse 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.670
 clear but good 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.590
 in fact obviously it's not going to change the 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.840
 external debt but I like that the 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.209
 Presidents receive without having this 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.620
 a political connotation obviously and 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.060
 that the players are excited that 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.739
 cry because ultimately it's a 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.680
 football game and it's also true 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:44.459
 that the result the result is always 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.459
 very important 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.420
 no, but I sure, but nobody 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.610
 invalidates if the Dutch won and the 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.430
 they celebrated they applauded with their audience and 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.590
 the next day they were on the beach but not 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.680
 confuse the story are not waiting 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.530
 what maxims and the king is put a 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.319
 red carpet pretends is this I think 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.120
 that his mental circuit goes by another 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.220
 side but it's okay we need 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.140
 of these kinds of situations we 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.400
 we feed on this type of situations 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.400
 for the good and for the bad 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:27.450
 perfect fernando of those who are going to come 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.810
 I'm not saying I'm sure the next thing 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.700
 if you were sports journalists 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:39.260
 I would be selling warrior flag and 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.260
 headbands fans 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.310
 you want me to tell you something I did in some 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.959
 moment and I'm not ashamed of it and I 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:52.430
 it was pretty good fernando when it was 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:54.349
 many I 'm not talking 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.030
 I'm not talking that means any 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:59.239
 embarrassed to sell that type of elements 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.579
 I say they are closer from the 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:04.400
 sympathizer who are passionate about that 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:07.549
 cries of the one who cries of the one who tears 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.829
 that there are still guys went to see a 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:12.290
 show won they go home lost 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.180
 bad luck ready tomorrow follow the 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.260
 things I have to pay the bills I have 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.459
 have to take care of the children who go to 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.630
 school I have to think about my future 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.100
 that none of these players is just going 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.660
 the water 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.180
 if I imagine you 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.860
 if I imagine you going to a theater for 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.830
 example arrived you're going to see the game as 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.630
 if it were a theater and I out there I live it 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.100
 I hear he saw that people sing and 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.360
 that moves you at least to me 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:41.190
 I still spend those things for them what 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.970
 I saw as if you were going to see placid 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.970
 Sunday for example 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:51.560
 not so much we manifested seeing you was 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.560
 chicago for example 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.240
 no but I'll see it and if it wins I'll get 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.389
 glad you got lost my house was 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.370
 ended by one or another question what 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.349
 I learned over time I learned it with the 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.639
 time because I was not born that way but 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:06.349
 I learned it over time it gives me the 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:09.199
 feeling that no sporting triumph 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:11.599
 change the history of any country like that 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:13.250
 that I do know that the rulers of the 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:14.960
 countries try to take second 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.220
 sports triumphs to distort 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.220
 that story 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.639
 yes I do not share with you fully the 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.199
 issue this is not going to change the debt 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:29.090
 externally that does not have to change the 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:31.280
 humor of a country that do not have to 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.650
 coexist the economy at the hand of a 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.210
 success or a sporting failure or 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.550
 football in this case because we are 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.349
 talking about the world but I repeat to me 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.629
 I like to get excited 

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:43.159
 still when certain things happen 

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:44.569
 in a world I live it that way and 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:48.639
 obviously in my opinion it is totally 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:48.639
 relative in this story
