00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
you go and purchase your spark plugs

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.160 
you go and purchase your spark plugs
from<00:00:41.430> your<00:00:41.760> motorcycle<00:00:42.329> store<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:43.020> should

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
from your motorcycle store you should

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.279 
from your motorcycle store you should
ask<00:00:43.290> if<00:00:43.469> their<00:00:43.620> pre<00:00:43.829> gapped<00:00:44.899> even<00:00:45.899> if<00:00:45.989> they<00:00:46.140> are

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
ask if their pre gapped even if they are

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.959 
ask if their pre gapped even if they are
you<00:00:46.620> should<00:00:46.829> get<00:00:46.920> them<00:00:47.190> anyway<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.940> be

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
you should get them anyway just to be

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.270 
you should get them anyway just to be
sure<00:00:48.059> what<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.110> like<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.440> do<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.860> like<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.039> use

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
sure what I like to do is I like to use

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.920 
sure what I like to do is I like to use
this<00:00:50.489> type<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.760> key<00:00:51.090> it's<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.510> little<00:00:51.690> bit<00:00:51.780> more

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
this type of key it's a little bit more

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.450 
this type of key it's a little bit more
accurate<00:00:53.030> because<00:00:54.030> it's<00:00:54.239> got<00:00:54.420> these<00:00:54.660> uh<00:00:54.719> these

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
accurate because it's got these uh these

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.770 
accurate because it's got these uh these
wire<00:00:56.460> measurements<00:00:57.149> here<00:00:57.300> there<00:00:57.629> are<00:00:57.690> other

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
wire measurements here there are other

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.229 
wire measurements here there are other
slide<00:00:58.170> keys<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.649> are<00:00:58.680> easier<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.160> use<00:00:59.489> these

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
slide keys that are easier to use these

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.200 
slide keys that are easier to use these
ones<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.539> little<00:01:00.719> bit<00:01:00.809> more<00:01:00.899> accurate<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:02.280> my

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
ones a little bit more accurate so my

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.679 
ones a little bit more accurate so my
manual<00:01:03.690> here<00:01:03.989> says<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.729> spark<00:01:06.270> plug<00:01:06.479> gap

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
manual here says that the spark plug gap

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.649 
manual here says that the spark plug gap
should<00:01:06.990> be<00:01:07.110> between<00:01:07.369> 23<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.400> 27<00:01:09.060> thousandths

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
should be between 23 and 27 thousandths

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.740 
should be between 23 and 27 thousandths
of<00:01:09.720> an<00:01:09.840> inch<00:01:10.159> I'm<00:01:11.159> going<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.490> do<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:12.270> find<00:01:12.600> on

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
of an inch I'm going to do is find on

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.300 
of an inch I'm going to do is find on
here<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:15.240> corresponding<00:01:15.930> wire<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:17.100> one

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
here the corresponding wire this one

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.370 
here the corresponding wire this one
here<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.790> my<00:01:18.119> twenty<00:01:18.570> five<00:01:18.750> thousand<00:01:19.170> seven

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
here is my twenty five thousand seven

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.749 
here is my twenty five thousand seven
inch<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.740> this<00:01:19.890> one<00:01:20.070> here<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.369> 28th

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
inch and this one here is the 28th

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.350 
inch and this one here is the 28th
thousandth<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.299> an<00:01:21.420> inch<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:23.360> proper

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
thousandth of an inch so the proper

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.690 
thousandth of an inch so the proper
method<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.810> do<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:26.009> basically<00:01:26.220> just

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
method to do this is to basically just

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.300 
method to do this is to basically just
slide<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.150> wire<00:01:27.299> in<00:01:27.600> between<00:01:28.020> your<00:01:28.799> gap<00:01:29.040> right

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
slide the wire in between your gap right

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.770 
slide the wire in between your gap right
here

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.890 

you<00:01:32.350> can<00:01:32.530> see<00:01:32.680> that<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:32.970> 25,000<00:01:33.970> slides

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
you can see that the 25,000 slides

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.710 
you can see that the 25,000 slides
through<00:01:35.140> pretty<00:01:35.380> easily<00:01:35.590> I'm<00:01:36.570> 28,000<00:01:37.570> get

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
through pretty easily I'm 28,000 get

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.930 
through pretty easily I'm 28,000 get
stuck<00:01:37.990> so<00:01:38.830> you<00:01:38.920> know<00:01:39.070> it's<00:01:39.250> between<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.760> two

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
stuck so you know it's between the two

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.609 
stuck so you know it's between the two
and<00:01:40.180> that<00:01:40.540> is<00:01:40.690> just<00:01:40.930> perfect<00:01:41.380> for<00:01:41.500> this

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
and that is just perfect for this

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.390 
and that is just perfect for this
motorcycle<00:01:43.080> if<00:01:44.080> I<00:01:44.229> needed<00:01:44.500> to<00:01:44.619> adjust<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:45.190> gap

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
motorcycle if I needed to adjust the gap

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.969 
motorcycle if I needed to adjust the gap
I<00:01:45.610> would<00:01:45.850> use<00:01:46.030> either<00:01:46.270> my<00:01:46.570> rubber<00:01:46.840> mallet<00:01:47.290> to

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
I would use either my rubber mallet to

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.180 
I would use either my rubber mallet to
bang<00:01:48.820> this<00:01:49.090> tine<00:01:49.450> down<00:01:49.750> a<00:01:50.080> little<00:01:50.770> bit<00:01:50.950> closer

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
bang this tine down a little bit closer

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.520 
bang this tine down a little bit closer
or<00:01:51.880> I<00:01:51.909> would<00:01:52.210> use<00:01:52.330> a<00:01:52.360> simple<00:01:52.780> screwdriver<00:01:53.259> to

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
or I would use a simple screwdriver to

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.160 
or I would use a simple screwdriver to
gently<00:01:53.920> pry<00:01:54.250> it<00:01:54.310> up<00:01:54.549> be<00:01:55.210> very<00:01:55.509> very<00:01:55.659> careful

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
gently pry it up be very very careful

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.600 
gently pry it up be very very careful
when<00:01:56.530> you're<00:01:56.649> doing<00:01:56.890> this<00:01:56.979> because<00:01:57.159> hey

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
when you're doing this because hey

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
don't have an air compressor so I use

about<00:03:40.500> that<00:03:40.650> it's<00:03:41.040> something<00:03:41.190> that<00:03:41.430> I<00:03:41.489> can

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
about that it's something that I can

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.080 
about that it's something that I can
pretty<00:03:41.880> easily<00:03:41.970> adjust<00:03:42.750> I<00:03:43.310> with<00:03:44.310> carburetor

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
pretty easily adjust I with carburetor

lean<00:03:58.560> which<00:03:58.860> means<00:03:59.100> that<00:03:59.190> there's<00:03:59.430> too<00:03:59.580> much

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
lean which means that there's too much

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.350 
lean which means that there's too much

carelessly install your spark plugs you

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.970 
carelessly install your spark plugs you
could<00:04:05.519> damage<00:04:05.790> your<00:04:06.660> cylinder<00:04:07.500> head<00:04:07.739> by

could damage your cylinder head by

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.520 
could damage your cylinder head by
stripping<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:08.670> threads<00:04:09.170> the<00:04:10.170> head<00:04:10.320> of<00:04:10.440> an

plug<00:04:12.780> is<00:04:12.959> steel<00:04:13.290> and<00:04:13.640> so<00:04:14.640> it's<00:04:14.790> much<00:04:14.970> harder

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329

accidentally do a lot of damage so a

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.770 
accidentally do a lot of damage so a
little<00:04:22.770> trick<00:04:23.040> that<00:04:23.070> I<00:04:23.220> like<00:04:23.490> to<00:04:23.640> do<00:04:23.760> is<00:04:24.390> to<00:04:24.600> use

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
little trick that I like to do is to use

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.730 
little trick that I like to do is to use
a<00:04:25.370> tube<00:04:26.370> just<00:04:26.700> like<00:04:26.910> this<00:04:27.169> first<00:04:28.169> off<00:04:28.380> I<00:04:28.500> put

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
a tube just like this first off I put

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.810 
a tube just like this first off I put
just<00:04:29.100> a<00:04:29.280> drop<00:04:29.580> of<00:04:29.610> oil<00:04:30.800> just<00:04:31.800> a<00:04:31.979> dollop<00:04:32.430> there

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
just a drop of oil just a dollop there

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.390 
just a drop of oil just a dollop there
to<00:04:33.120> help<00:04:33.270> it<00:04:33.419> go<00:04:33.570> in<00:04:33.750> and<00:04:34.620> then<00:04:34.919> I<00:04:34.950> take<00:04:35.220> this

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
to help it go in and then I take this

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.290 
to help it go in and then I take this
old<00:04:35.610> piece<00:04:35.820> of<00:04:35.850> tube<00:04:36.150> here<00:04:36.510> and<00:04:36.690> I<00:04:37.530> sort<00:04:37.830> of<00:04:37.890> jam

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
old piece of tube here and I sort of jam

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.450 
old piece of tube here and I sort of jam
with<00:04:39.419> the<00:04:39.810> spark<00:04:40.440> plug<00:04:40.650> right<00:04:40.949> on<00:04:41.129> there<00:04:41.310> like

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
with the spark plug right on there like

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.740 
with the spark plug right on there like
that<00:04:42.199> there<00:04:43.199> you<00:04:43.289> go<00:04:43.440> what<00:04:44.220> this<00:04:44.400> does<00:04:44.639> is<00:04:45.000> this

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
that there you go what this does is this

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.020 
that there you go what this does is this
enables<00:04:46.259> me<00:04:48.949> show<00:04:49.949> you<00:04:50.009> here<00:04:50.280> it's<00:04:50.550> enables<00:04:50.909> me

from accidentally stripping accidentally
stripping<00:05:16.740> the<00:05:16.800> threads<00:05:17.069> so<00:05:17.430> here<00:05:17.819> we<00:05:17.849> go

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.340 

let's<00:05:25.530> rotate<00:05:25.740> around<00:05:26.009> just<00:05:26.820> like<00:05:26.940> that<00:05:27.350> you

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
let's rotate around just like that you

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:39.300 
let's rotate around just like that you
just<00:05:28.440> sort<00:05:28.740> of<00:05:28.800> spin<00:05:29.100> it<00:05:29.220> around<00:05:29.340> like<00:05:29.729> that

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.470 

thing<00:05:41.250> now<00:05:42.250> that<00:05:42.280> I<00:05:42.550> have<00:05:42.760> the<00:05:42.970> spark<00:05:43.270> plug

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:43.480 
thing now that I have the spark plug

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.050 
thing now that I have the spark plug
snug<00:05:43.840> firmly<00:05:44.590> in<00:05:44.770> place<00:05:44.800> by<00:05:45.130> hand<00:05:45.460> I<00:05:45.760> can

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
snug firmly in place by hand I can

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.230 
snug firmly in place by hand I can
torque<00:05:46.330> it<00:05:46.510> my<00:05:47.050> book<00:05:47.260> says<00:05:47.290> to<00:05:48.160> torque<00:05:48.910> spark

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
torque it my book says to torque spark

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.540 
torque it my book says to torque spark
plugs<00:05:49.480> to<00:05:49.750> 11<00:05:50.140> to<00:05:50.260> 14<00:05:50.500> foot<00:05:51.010> pounds<00:05:51.370> which

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
plugs to 11 to 14 foot pounds which

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.210 
plugs to 11 to 14 foot pounds which
really<00:05:51.850> isn't<00:05:52.030> very<00:05:52.210> much<00:05:52.480> at<00:05:52.630> all<00:05:52.950> and<00:05:53.950> so<00:05:54.190> i

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
really isn't very much at all and so i

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.790 
really isn't very much at all and so i
will<00:05:54.400> be<00:05:54.550> using<00:05:54.700> my<00:05:55.690> torque<00:05:56.140> wrench<00:05:56.350> here<00:05:56.590> to

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
will be using my torque wrench here to

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.930 
will be using my torque wrench here to
do<00:05:56.920> just<00:05:57.160> that<00:05:58.290> okay<00:05:59.290> spark<00:05:59.890> plug<00:06:00.100> torque<00:06:00.430> now

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
do just that okay spark plug torque now

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.470 
do just that okay spark plug torque now
it's<00:06:01.120> time<00:06:01.330> to<00:06:01.600> replace<00:06:02.640> the<00:06:03.640> wire<00:06:03.880> here<00:06:04.240> and

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:04.480 
it's time to replace the wire here and

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.160 
it's time to replace the wire here and
be<00:06:05.050> sure<00:06:05.230> to<00:06:05.260> listen<00:06:05.500> for<00:06:05.770> the<00:06:05.890> snap<00:06:07.080> there<00:06:08.080> you

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:08.170 
be sure to listen for the snap there you

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:10.170 
be sure to listen for the snap there you
go<00:06:08.290> now<00:06:08.650> you<00:06:08.680> know<00:06:08.830> it's<00:06:08.980> connected<00:06:09.400> and

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
go now you know it's connected and

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.840 
go now you know it's connected and
you're<00:06:10.300> all<00:06:10.390> done<00:06:11.070> and<00:06:12.070> that<00:06:12.370> was<00:06:12.400> the<00:06:12.610> proper

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:12.850 
you're all done and that was the proper

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.300 
you're all done and that was the proper
way<00:06:13.060> to<00:06:13.090> replace<00:06:13.540> the<00:06:13.750> spark<00:06:13.870> plugs<00:06:14.290> on<00:06:14.920> your

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
way to replace the spark plugs on your

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.170 
way to replace the spark plugs on your
