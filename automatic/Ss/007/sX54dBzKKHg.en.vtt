00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:52.690 
think that we do is they are a game like
Leonardo<00:01:51.530> da<00:01:51.649> Vinci<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.039> his<00:01:52.130> inventions

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
Leonardo da Vinci and his inventions

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.060 
Leonardo da Vinci and his inventions
there<00:01:53.210> was<00:01:53.329> a<00:01:53.390> lot<00:01:53.539> of<00:01:53.600> conspiracies<00:01:54.530> murders

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
there was a lot of conspiracies murders

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.940 
there was a lot of conspiracies murders
a<00:01:55.369> lot<00:01:55.969> of<00:01:56.090> interesting<00:01:56.509> characters<00:01:56.950> cool

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
a lot of interesting characters cool

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.590 
a lot of interesting characters cool
cities<00:01:58.310> like<00:01:58.520> Florence<00:01:58.939> and<00:01:59.090> Venice<00:01:59.119> and<00:01:59.479> all

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
cities like Florence and Venice and all

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.289 
cities like Florence and Venice and all
that<00:01:59.780> so<00:02:00.380> we<00:02:00.649> had<00:02:00.799> so<00:02:01.069> much<00:02:01.549> material<00:02:01.850> that<00:02:02.209> we

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
that so we had so much material that we

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.330 
that so we had so much material that we
could<00:02:02.450> use<00:02:02.630> like<00:02:02.929> why<00:02:03.380> not<00:02:03.409> write<00:02:03.950> it<00:02:04.189> was

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
could use like why not write it was

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.760 
could use like why not write it was
pretty<00:02:04.579> obvious<00:02:04.789> now<00:02:05.420> here<00:02:06.170> that<00:02:06.439> there<00:02:06.619> are<00:02:06.740> a

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
pretty obvious now here that there are a

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.249 
pretty obvious now here that there are a
ton<00:02:06.979> of<00:02:07.039> fun<00:02:07.369> new<00:02:07.579> gadgets<00:02:08.149> in<00:02:08.390> assassin's

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
ton of fun new gadgets in assassin's

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.530 
ton of fun new gadgets in assassin's
creed<00:02:09.500> two<00:02:09.739> because<00:02:10.160> last<00:02:10.399> time<00:02:10.640> you<00:02:10.970> only<00:02:11.180> had

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
creed two because last time you only had

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.420 
creed two because last time you only had
thus<00:02:12.049> we<00:02:12.230> had<00:02:12.319> the<00:02:12.410> sword<00:02:12.650> of<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:12.860> dagger<00:02:13.040> new

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
thus we had the sword of the dagger new

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.400 
thus we had the sword of the dagger new
so<00:02:13.610> this<00:02:13.760> time<00:02:13.790> you<00:02:14.000> have<00:02:14.150> a<00:02:14.180> whole<00:02:14.540> bunch<00:02:15.319> of

so this time you have a whole bunch of

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.930 
so this time you have a whole bunch of
other<00:02:15.530> stuff<00:02:15.680> that<00:02:15.829> you<00:02:16.010> can<00:02:16.190> use<00:02:16.340> right<00:02:16.640> a

whole bunch of other fun stuff more than

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.250 
whole bunch of other fun stuff more than
you<00:02:18.650> can<00:02:18.739> imagine<00:02:18.860> xen<00:02:19.569> we<00:02:20.569> showed<00:02:20.930> you<00:02:21.110> the

flying machine at e3 which was based off
you<00:02:24.530> know<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.769> davinci<00:02:25.130> is<00:02:25.190> drawing<00:02:25.459> so<00:02:26.329> we

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
you know the davinci is drawing so we

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.180 
you know the davinci is drawing so we
decided<00:02:26.810> with<00:02:27.019> that<00:02:27.140> in<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.290> game<00:02:27.440> you<00:02:28.069> know

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
guy with your own body and in the first

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:50.949 
guy with your own body and in the first
assassin's<00:02:49.639> creed<00:02:49.850> that<00:02:50.000> was<00:02:50.120> a<00:02:50.150> hard<00:02:50.420> move<00:02:50.720> to

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
assassin's creed that was a hard move to

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.259 
assassin's creed that was a hard move to
pull<00:02:51.170> off<00:02:51.319> right<00:02:51.799> so<00:02:52.130> so<00:02:52.639> what<00:02:52.850> did<00:02:53.000> you<00:02:53.060> do<00:02:53.180> to

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
pull off right so so what did you do to

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.340 
pull off right so so what did you do to
make<00:02:53.420> it<00:02:53.450> easier<00:02:53.690> I<00:02:53.959> guess

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
make it easier I guess

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.870 
make it easier I guess
the<00:02:55.440> assassinations<00:02:56.070> themselves<00:02:56.580> or<00:02:56.700> work

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
the assassinations themselves or work

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.820 
the assassinations themselves or work
context<00:02:57.360> sensitive<00:02:57.780> so<00:02:58.080> for<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.710> air

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
context sensitive so for the air

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.410 
context sensitive so for the air
assassination<00:02:59.460> which<00:02:59.610> was<00:02:59.820> hard<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.180> go<00:03:00.270> up

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
assassination which was hard to go up

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.940 
assassination which was hard to go up
now<00:03:00.630> all<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:00.870> have<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:01.080> do<00:03:01.170> is<00:03:01.290> log<00:03:01.500> on<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.830> guy

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
now all you have to do is log on the guy

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.980 
now all you have to do is log on the guy
