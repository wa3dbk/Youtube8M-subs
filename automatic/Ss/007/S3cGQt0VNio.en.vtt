00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.809
 Oh if woo 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:16.710
 Kim claret two generations Hello come guitar and this is the order 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:22.289
 I'm going to start a Chinese lesson today. 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:25.140
 I will be the first bar in the first class of intermediate course to learn first 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:29.310
 This year's high hasineunde code called shoe 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.070
 I'm a barcode, and I'm going to have a pain and a lesson. 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:37.079
 First, the bar code 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:41.480
 I 'll try the bottle f 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.480
 I 'll try to draw f code once. 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:54.480
 Oh, my fingers , like a stick, 1 + 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:59.760
 Next, in order 2, 3, 4 finger 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:06.060
 It's gonna be Yes. 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:09.869
 It describes the one to take the party code after you complete the picture described by one again 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.860
 I'll take a look at it. 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.600
 Let's try the code code first. 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.200
 b 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.200
 AS 5 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:29.660
 Other parties on the market this time second 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:33.320
 Tourette 3 Bar Ye Sung Japan with a finger look 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:38.350
 2, 3, 4 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.350
 This is the third 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.350
 mercy 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.220
 Minor code 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.140
 Javi minor 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:54.549
 b code and proceed similarly. 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:59.409
 There is also a look in the second column 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:02.210
 Four interns once invited me to an error 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:05.770
 Fourth 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.770
 I'll proceed with b7 . 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.610
 Ah too 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:16.120
 Go to your cell and go to the second cell. 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.519
 Can I times 3 times 2 novels 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:25.239
 Now here geuneu 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:34.410
 If you do the route, it will be the remaining tower of the f code . 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:37.010
 6 beonjul Lobby code b Maia service geuneom Haven gets the market 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.010
 Like this 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.170
 Line 5 is Grammy . 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:55.140
 6 times primarily been involved in starting a Java from the line 5 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:03:00.160
 So let's first look at the code in my code first. 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:06.370
 Let's take a look at the code 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:08.440
 Chef gf code Well, let's just hold your finger ah stick the Japanese characters 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.740
 Now press the flat. 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:16.750
 With 2 times 3 times 4 times 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:20.800
 The fingers are the fingers flat 3 4/5 l of play three times 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:23.460
 Four frets like the little finger server fingers too 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.460
 On the judicial line 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.580
 What's important here is 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:33.730
 Your left thumb should be back. 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:38.130
 Falling back 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.880
 Now that the students are coming to the market, 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.420
 Elbow 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:47.560
 I'm sticking to the sides so that if the hand 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:54.430
 Never turn off like this. 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:57.750
 When you grab a straight line and grab it, your thumb is as far back as possible. 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.750
 God then hold a private 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:07.360
 It's pretty and equally neat. 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:10.870
 Japanese fingers become sticks, but hold this flet 2+ 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:17.230
 4 I laid earn 3 times 2 times 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:18.859
 Stay abreast Lord and hold a 4 trillion Place 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:24.830
 give 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:26.460
 The wrong notes sound and 5 As I said the dog coming weeks 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.130
 To you 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:33.180
 If this sounds a little bit louder 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:37.650
 If you look good, 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:42.450
 You'll need the wit later. 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:48.150
 Because you can not thumb the 6th lute when you still have faith 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:59.340
 These Tenerife bit like Rupert Le Four Sisters caught in ordinary Java code fingers 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:05:02.340
 We will be coming out that the party even as obese Pima 6 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:07.350
 In the same Seosan 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:11.070
 This time only Finger 2 Shample 3 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:16.950
 Plus coming into this week's True 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:22.680
 Or I'll go ahead and b7 right away. 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:25.470
 It's the same as the one I used before, but it's a barcode pattern. 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.910
 I will go straight to this finger again 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.970
 character 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:32.940
 Oh Well yoreotge party 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:37.830
 4 Fleetwell Fords 3 times 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:42.840
 As it is this week, with the fingers of No. 2 and No. 3 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:46.560
 Just like that 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:52.500
 I can not catch you like this, 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:57.860
 Shake it . From that point on, let's see the whole code 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.860
 Thank you I will try to draw a lesson once in progress as a whole 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.060
