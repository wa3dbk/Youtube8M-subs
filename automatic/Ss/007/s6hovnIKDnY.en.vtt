00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.119

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.880
 question 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.770
 That was not a question but that's one 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:56.810
 negative comment from you 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:58.580
 check or cookies pauline asks where from 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.580
 is the milk well I think that 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.500
 comes from the supermarket or good there 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.360

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.429
 underlined underscore underscore 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.430
 lalalalala asks why do people like that ? 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.430
 gb so good people I know now that it 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:20.180
 since there are two such, a blonde 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.100
 dgb and the other bi who is me 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.270
 know this a few weeks I have 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.560
 already looked at it 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.810
 maybe not get it that way either 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.220
 But I think the make-up is famous 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.450
 Tips are relatively well received 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.570
 maybe I should too 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.040
 imitate people but you know why 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.840
 which are so famous then writes the 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.100
 times in the comments I mean I have 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.290
 it already noticed that the mega 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.930
 nice detours are pretty but the 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.730
 exact success virus gets the hype 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.940
 it was triggered that I know 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.130
 Of course not the dominic sanz asks 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.709
 who actually has the appeal of apple 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.660
 bitten yes dominik I think that is 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.560
 because the thing is apple for a long time 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.540
 is eaten 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.000
 no, i have to say honestly 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.410
 had an apple product but somehow 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.940
 I could install a game 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.340
 and now I could never minecraft 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.930
 gamble and that's why I bought myself now 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.580
 again a windows pc because i just 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.920
 It was too stupid that I did my crafts 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.090
 I think most people install 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.590
 do you want we have them together 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.750
 brought that they went to the apple 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.160
 but not me well it's fucking good 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.930
 Now I have my windows pc 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.530
 resist and that runs 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.950
