00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
can see it's trying to apply it which is

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:59.980 
can see it's trying to apply it which is
and<00:05:59.000> this<00:05:59.120> isn't<00:05:59.360> seeing<00:05:59.510> this<00:05:59.660> is<00:05:59.840> the

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
and this isn't seeing this is the

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.840 
and this isn't seeing this is the
another<00:06:00.170> another<00:06:00.680> annoying<00:06:01.100> aspect<00:06:01.520> of<00:06:01.760> this

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:01.850 
another another annoying aspect of this

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.460 
another another annoying aspect of this
it's<00:06:02.060> like<00:06:02.180> I<00:06:02.300> want<00:06:02.480> to<00:06:02.570> move<00:06:02.720> that<00:06:02.900> I<00:06:03.110> don't

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
it's like I want to move that I don't

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.280 
it's like I want to move that I don't
want<00:06:03.710> to<00:06:04.300> apply<00:06:05.300> it<00:06:05.360> let<00:06:05.960> me<00:06:05.990> go<00:06:06.140> ahead<00:06:06.200> and

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:06.290 
want to apply it let me go ahead and

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.730 
want to apply it let me go ahead and
undo<00:06:06.500> that<00:06:07.090> so<00:06:08.090> this<00:06:08.150> is<00:06:08.240> why<00:06:08.740> manipulating

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
undo that so this is why manipulating

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.800 
undo that so this is why manipulating

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
can be slightly annoying it's a lot

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.630 
can be slightly annoying it's a lot
faster<00:06:14.570> and<00:06:14.600> easier<00:06:14.780> to<00:06:15.290> do<00:06:15.560> it<00:06:15.740> by<00:06:15.980> utilizing

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:16.640 
faster and easier to do it by utilizing
