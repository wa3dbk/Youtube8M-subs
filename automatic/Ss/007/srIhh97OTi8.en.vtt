part<00:01:40.420> of<00:01:40.509> this<00:01:40.660> board<00:01:40.899> in<00:01:41.080> my<00:01:41.200> opinion<00:01:41.560> are<00:01:41.709> the

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
part of this board in my opinion are the

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:42.300 
part of this board in my opinion are the
bearings

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
bearings

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.760 
bearings
they're<00:01:42.700> absolutely<00:01:42.940> amazing<00:01:43.599> I've<00:01:44.229> ridden<00:01:44.500> a

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
they're absolutely amazing I've ridden a

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.859 
they're absolutely amazing I've ridden a
fair<00:01:45.160> share<00:01:45.399> of<00:01:45.429> real<00:01:45.700> and<00:01:45.940> fake<00:01:46.149> cruisers<00:01:46.690> and

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
fair share of real and fake cruisers and

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.660 
fair share of real and fake cruisers and
I<00:01:46.959> think<00:01:47.170> these<00:01:47.289> are<00:01:47.349> the<00:01:47.500> best<00:01:47.670> bearings

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
I think these are the best bearings

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.859 
I think these are the best bearings
because<00:01:48.789> they're<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.179> fastest<00:01:49.630> and<00:01:49.810> most

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
because they're the fastest and most

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.999 
because they're the fastest and most

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.469 
on a scale of 1 to 10 would I buy it
again<00:01:56.140> I<00:01:56.289> would<00:01:56.530> give<00:01:56.770> it<00:01:56.920> a<00:01:57.009> solid<00:01:57.340> 8<00:01:57.759> so<00:01:58.330> that
