resolution<00:01:03.420> frames<00:01:04.019> per<00:01:04.199> second<00:01:04.559> they<00:01:04.739> don't

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
resolution frames per second they don't

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.730 
resolution frames per second they don't
make<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.729> game<00:01:06.090> some<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> best<00:01:07.290> games<00:01:07.470> I've

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
make a game some of the best games I've

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.580 
make a game some of the best games I've
played<00:01:07.770> weren't<00:01:08.729> even<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.119> HD<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.260> think

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
played weren't even in HD so I think

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.560 
played weren't even in HD so I think
that's<00:01:10.770> probably<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.490> biggest<00:01:11.850> lesson<00:01:12.119> to

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
that's probably the biggest lesson to

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.359 
that's probably the biggest lesson to
take<00:01:12.689> away<00:01:12.770> when<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.860> comes<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.130> talking<00:01:14.220> about

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
take away when it comes to talking about

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.859 
take away when it comes to talking about
resolutions<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.150> frames<00:01:15.330> per<00:01:15.479> second<00:01:15.750> but

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
resolutions of frames per second but

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.570 
resolutions of frames per second but
let's<00:01:15.990> talk<00:01:16.229> about<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.799> for<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.189> second

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
let's talk about this for a second

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.160 
let's talk about this for a second
because<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:18.090> does<00:01:18.299> make<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.570> difference<00:01:18.990> and

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
because it does make a difference and

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.980 
because it does make a difference and
you<00:01:20.040> know<00:01:20.070> 1080p<00:01:20.790> 60<00:01:21.180> frames<00:01:21.210> per<00:01:21.450> second<00:01:21.840> not

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
you know 1080p 60 frames per second not

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.499 
you know 1080p 60 frames per second not
to<00:01:22.170> diminish<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.799> because<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:24.119> an

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
to diminish it because that is an

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.870 
to diminish it because that is an
awesome<00:01:24.840> target<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.619> hit<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.009> your<00:01:26.490> game<00:01:26.700> is

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.050 
awesome target to hit and your game is

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.590 
they're being really quiet on it and
they<00:02:04.560> could<00:02:04.740> be<00:02:04.860> quiet<00:02:05.159> because<00:02:05.490> maybe<00:02:06.390> they

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
they could be quiet because maybe they

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.880 
they could be quiet because maybe they
know<00:02:06.719> it's<00:02:06.899> true<00:02:07.079> but<00:02:07.229> looks<00:02:07.409> like<00:02:07.469> they<00:02:07.740> could

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
know it's true but looks like they could

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.889 
know it's true but looks like they could
get<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.160> out<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.459> way<00:02:08.610> if<00:02:08.910> they<00:02:09.060> just<00:02:09.270> go

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
get it out of the way if they just go

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.740 
get it out of the way if they just go
ahead<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.259> admit<00:02:10.349> it<00:02:10.560> or<00:02:11.090> maybe<00:02:12.090> they're

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
ahead and admit it or maybe they're

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.059 
ahead and admit it or maybe they're
working<00:02:13.379> on

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
working on

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.679 
working on
you<00:02:14.129> know<00:02:14.189> trying<00:02:14.609> to<00:02:14.760> up<00:02:14.849> the<00:02:14.999> resolution<00:02:15.569> as

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689 
you know trying to up the resolution as

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.449 
you know trying to up the resolution as
it<00:02:15.719> stands<00:02:16.049> right<00:02:16.200> now<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:16.560> don't<00:02:16.739> know<00:02:16.890> either

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
it stands right now I don't know either

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.610 
it stands right now I don't know either
way<00:02:17.870> you<00:02:18.870> know<00:02:18.959> we<00:02:19.109> talked<00:02:19.319> about<00:02:19.439> the

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
way you know we talked about the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.129 
way you know we talked about the
PlayStation<00:02:20.069> 4<00:02:20.099> being<00:02:20.670> more<00:02:21.569> powerful<00:02:21.780> me

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:22.139 
PlayStation 4 being more powerful me

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:24.199 
PlayStation 4 being more powerful me
than<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.799> Xbox<00:02:23.129> one<00:02:23.400> but<00:02:23.579> I<00:02:23.670> really<00:02:23.700> don't

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
than the Xbox one but I really don't

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.179 
than the Xbox one but I really don't
think<00:02:24.269> when<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.599> comes<00:02:24.749> to<00:02:24.900> this<00:02:25.109> that<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:25.980> is

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
think when it comes to this that that is

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.119 
think when it comes to this that that is
where<00:02:26.489> you<00:02:26.639> can<00:02:26.790> actually<00:02:27.209> look<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.780> say<00:02:28.129> this

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
where you can actually look and say this

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.240 
where you can actually look and say this
you<00:02:29.700> can't<00:02:30.030> look<00:02:30.329> at<00:02:30.659> lower<00:02:31.379> resolution<00:02:32.040> games

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
you can't look at lower resolution games

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.569 
you can't look at lower resolution games
on<00:02:32.609> launch<00:02:33.090> on<00:02:33.389> Xbox<00:02:33.959> one<00:02:34.079> and<00:02:34.409> say<00:02:34.950> yes

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
on launch on Xbox one and say yes

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:36.379 
on launch on Xbox one and say yes
definitely

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:36.389 
definitely

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:38.809 
definitely
that<00:02:36.840> means<00:02:37.079> the<00:02:37.260> Xbox<00:02:37.709> one<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:38.129> less<00:02:38.310> powerful

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
that means the Xbox one is less powerful

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.640 
that means the Xbox one is less powerful
that<00:02:39.150> just<00:02:39.450> doesn't<00:02:39.629> make<00:02:40.109> any<00:02:40.290> sense<00:02:40.439> I<00:02:40.620> think

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
that just doesn't make any sense I think

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.069 
that just doesn't make any sense I think
what<00:02:40.980> makes<00:02:41.219> more<00:02:41.489> sense<00:02:41.849> is<00:02:42.090> if<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:42.870> go<00:02:43.049> back

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
what makes more sense is if you go back

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.899 
what makes more sense is if you go back
and<00:02:43.499> you<00:02:43.560> look<00:02:43.590> at<00:02:43.980> what<00:02:44.280> we've<00:02:44.579> been

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
and you look at what we've been

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.459 
and you look at what we've been
reporting<00:02:45.329> you<00:02:45.629> know<00:02:45.659> I've<00:02:45.900> talked<00:02:46.200> about<00:02:46.290> it

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:46.469 
reporting you know I've talked about it

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:48.979 
reporting you know I've talked about it
here<00:02:46.889> I've<00:02:47.040> talked<00:02:47.280> about<00:02:47.489> it<00:02:47.609> on<00:02:47.700> vgn<00:02:48.239> the

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
here I've talked about it on vgn the

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.449 
here I've talked about it on vgn the
developers<00:02:49.530> have<00:02:49.680> been<00:02:49.769> saying<00:02:50.069> for<00:02:50.310> months

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
developers have been saying for months

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.149 
developers have been saying for months
that<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.879> PlayStation<00:02:51.450> 4<00:02:51.480> has<00:02:52.199> been<00:02:52.260> faster

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
that the PlayStation 4 has been faster

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.580 
that the PlayStation 4 has been faster
to<00:02:53.189> develop<00:02:53.819> for<00:02:54.060> they've<00:02:54.659> had<00:02:54.989> their<00:02:55.260> tools

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
to develop for they've had their tools

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.970 
to develop for they've had their tools

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:04.169 
ready and optimized faster than the Xbox

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:06.709 
ready and optimized faster than the Xbox
one<00:03:04.409> and<00:03:04.680> this<00:03:05.219> story<00:03:05.639> has<00:03:05.879> been<00:03:06.120> in<00:03:06.449> the<00:03:06.569> news

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
for a while so I'm not saying that

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.659 
for a while so I'm not saying that
they're<00:03:09.959> still<00:03:10.260> not<00:03:10.469> ready<00:03:10.739> I'm<00:03:11.099> not<00:03:11.430> saying

they're still not ready I'm not saying

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:13.039 
they're still not ready I'm not saying
that<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.939> developers<00:03:12.389> don't<00:03:12.510> have<00:03:12.629> the<00:03:12.840> tools

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
that the developers don't have the tools

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.809 
that the developers don't have the tools
ready<00:03:13.319> now<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:13.530> don't<00:03:13.769> know<00:03:14.099> I<00:03:14.310> haven't<00:03:14.639> heard

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
and several weeks but I'm saying that is

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.020 
and several weeks but I'm saying that is
definitely<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:18.169> possibility<00:03:19.169> and<00:03:19.349> so<00:03:19.879> you<00:03:20.879> just

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
definitely a possibility and so you just

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.360 
definitely a possibility and so you just
look<00:03:21.180> at<00:03:21.299> a<00:03:21.329> game<00:03:21.540> like<00:03:21.840> Battlefield<00:03:21.870> 4<00:03:22.620> which

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
look at a game like Battlefield 4 which

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.539 
look at a game like Battlefield 4 which
EA<00:03:24.000> has<00:03:24.419> said<00:03:24.720> or<00:03:25.019> guys<00:03:25.229> has<00:03:25.470> said<00:03:25.680> that<00:03:26.220> they

at this generation this game is going to

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.319 
at this generation this game is going to
look<00:03:33.959> a<00:03:34.139> lot<00:03:34.349> better<00:03:34.680> than<00:03:34.979> battlefield<00:03:35.759> 3<00:03:36.090> did

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
look a lot better than battlefield 3 did

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.179 
look a lot better than battlefield 3 did
now<00:03:36.780> don't<00:03:36.989> compare<00:03:37.349> it<00:03:37.439> to<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.650> beta<00:03:37.859> go

00:03:59.929 --> 00:03:59.939 
years ago no you couldn't have if you

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:01.490 
years ago no you couldn't have if you
look<00:04:00.090> at<00:04:00.239> what<00:04:00.389> these<00:04:00.509> developers<00:04:01.049> say<00:04:01.259> no

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
look at what these developers say no

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.249 
look at what these developers say no
matter<00:04:01.620> what<00:04:02.009> the<00:04:02.519> publisher<00:04:03.180> is<00:04:03.509> or<00:04:03.840> who<00:04:04.229> it

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.779 
they're developing for these games

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:14.759 
all said you know we've managed to crank

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:17.839 
all said you know we've managed to crank
out<00:04:14.909> every<00:04:15.509> last<00:04:16.229> known<00:04:16.709> trick<00:04:17.159> known<00:04:17.579> in<00:04:17.759> the

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
out every last known trick known in the

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:20.120 
out every last known trick known in the
books<00:04:18.150> in<00:04:18.359> order<00:04:18.989> to<00:04:19.139> get<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.440> last<00:04:19.799> bit<00:04:20.099> of

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
books in order to get the last bit of

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.330 
books in order to get the last bit of
power<00:04:20.370> out<00:04:20.789> of<00:04:20.820> these<00:04:21.180> systems<00:04:21.659> and<00:04:21.840> so<00:04:22.680> you

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
power out of these systems and so you

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.370 
power out of these systems and so you
couldn't<00:04:23.699> have<00:04:23.849> done<00:04:24.029> that<00:04:24.300> early<00:04:24.870> on<00:04:24.900> in<00:04:25.289> the

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
couldn't have done that early on in the

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.590 
couldn't have done that early on in the
generation<00:04:26.279> so<00:04:26.760> the<00:04:27.270> law

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
generation so the law

games on both PlayStation 4 and the Xbox

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.230 
games on both PlayStation 4 and the Xbox

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
one are not going to look near as good

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.100 
one are not going to look near as good
as<00:04:33.450> they<00:04:34.050> will<00:04:34.320> five<00:04:34.920> years<00:04:35.280> from<00:04:35.460> now<00:04:35.550> and

as they will five years from now and

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.360 
as they will five years from now and
what<00:04:37.110> really<00:04:37.350> seems<00:04:37.680> to<00:04:37.710> be<00:04:37.800> a<00:04:37.890> problem<00:04:38.190> for

what really seems to be a problem for

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.780 
what really seems to be a problem for
Xbox<00:04:38.910> one<00:04:39.000> at<00:04:39.240> this<00:04:39.390> point<00:04:39.660> is<00:04:40.170> the<00:04:40.530> SRAM<00:04:41.160> which

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
Xbox one at this point is the SRAM which

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.440 
Xbox one at this point is the SRAM which
Microsoft<00:04:42.300> believes<00:04:42.960> is<00:04:43.230> going<00:04:43.620> to<00:04:44.120> help<00:04:45.120> them

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
Microsoft believes is going to help them

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.810 
Microsoft believes is going to help them
in<00:04:45.720> the<00:04:45.870> long<00:04:46.140> run<00:04:46.440> but<00:04:47.010> in<00:04:47.070> the<00:04:47.220> short<00:04:47.610> run

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
in the long run but in the short run

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.670 
in the long run but in the short run
whenever<00:04:48.120> they<00:04:48.390> are<00:04:48.510> first<00:04:48.750> launching<00:04:49.290> they

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
whenever they are first launching they

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.520 
whenever they are first launching they
have<00:04:49.920> not<00:04:50.220> optimized<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.240> tools<00:04:51.540> so<00:04:52.230> that

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
have not optimized the tools so that

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.920 
have not optimized the tools so that
this<00:04:52.800> is<00:04:53.070> easy<00:04:53.400> to<00:04:53.730> work<00:04:53.910> with<00:04:53.970> for<00:04:54.450> developers

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
this is easy to work with for developers

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.050 
this is easy to work with for developers
and<00:04:55.170> you<00:04:55.650> can<00:04:55.800> go<00:04:55.980> google<00:04:56.370> this<00:04:56.520> there's<00:04:56.820> lots

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
and you can go google this there's lots

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.510 
and you can go google this there's lots
of<00:04:57.330> stories<00:04:57.660> about<00:04:58.010> developers<00:04:59.010> saying<00:04:59.280> this

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
of stories about developers saying this

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.000 
of stories about developers saying this
so<00:04:59.970> I<00:05:00.000> don't<00:05:00.540> necessarily<00:05:01.110> look<00:05:01.740> at<00:05:01.830> this

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
so I don't necessarily look at this

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.730 
so I don't necessarily look at this
resolution<00:05:02.370> problem<00:05:02.880> as<00:05:03.210> a<00:05:04.170> problem<00:05:04.710> that

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
resolution problem as a problem that

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.650 
resolution problem as a problem that
means<00:05:05.160> that<00:05:05.580> your<00:05:05.760> games<00:05:06.000> are<00:05:06.240> going<00:05:06.450> to<00:05:06.540> be

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
means that your games are going to be

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.340 
means that your games are going to be
any<00:05:07.110> more<00:05:08.070> suckier<00:05:08.760> because<00:05:09.690> of<00:05:09.840> the<00:05:09.900> graphics

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
any more suckier because of the graphics

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.750 
any more suckier because of the graphics
you're<00:05:10.740> never<00:05:10.980> going<00:05:11.250> to<00:05:11.280> notice<00:05:11.490> the

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
you're never going to notice the

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.220 
you're never going to notice the
difference<00:05:11.790> unless<00:05:12.270> you're<00:05:12.600> playing<00:05:12.960> them

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
difference unless you're playing them

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.580 
difference unless you're playing them
side<00:05:13.890> by<00:05:13.920> side<00:05:14.630> but<00:05:15.630> if<00:05:15.750> you<00:05:15.900> do<00:05:16.080> want<00:05:16.320> to<00:05:16.380> see<00:05:16.560> a

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
side by side but if you do want to see a

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.650 
side by side but if you do want to see a
difference<00:05:17.100> I<00:05:17.250> mean<00:05:17.400> there<00:05:17.580> is<00:05:17.610> going<00:05:17.970> to<00:05:18.270> be<00:05:18.360> a

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
difference I mean there is going to be a

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.570 
difference I mean there is going to be a
difference<00:05:19.200> and<00:05:19.380> I'll<00:05:19.800> leave<00:05:20.010> a<00:05:20.040> link<00:05:20.310> down<00:05:20.520> in

does a really good job of showing you

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.690 
does a really good job of showing you
like<00:05:24.870> a<00:05:25.110> simulation<00:05:25.710> of<00:05:25.980> what<00:05:26.190> it<00:05:26.280> would<00:05:26.550> look

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
like a simulation of what it would look

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.480 
like a simulation of what it would look
like<00:05:26.910> on<00:05:27.090> the<00:05:27.240> Xbox<00:05:27.690> one<00:05:27.810> but<00:05:28.530> here's<00:05:28.890> the<00:05:29.310> last

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
like on the Xbox one but here's the last

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.940 
like on the Xbox one but here's the last
thing<00:05:29.700> that<00:05:29.730> I<00:05:29.880> want<00:05:30.120> to<00:05:30.180> point<00:05:30.390> out<00:05:30.540> both<00:05:31.470> the

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
thing that I want to point out both the

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.090 
thing that I want to point out both the
PlayStation<00:05:32.550> 4<00:05:32.580> and<00:05:32.910> the<00:05:33.210> Xbox<00:05:33.510> one<00:05:34.020> and<00:05:34.290> the

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
PlayStation 4 and the Xbox one and the

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.330 
PlayStation 4 and the Xbox one and the
Wii<00:05:35.250> U<00:05:35.520> actually<00:05:36.210> the<00:05:36.330> Wii<00:05:36.450> U<00:05:36.630> has<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:37.080> most

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
Wii U actually the Wii U has the most

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.270 
Wii U actually the Wii U has the most
1080p<00:05:38.340> 60<00:05:38.790> frames<00:05:38.820> per<00:05:39.150> second<00:05:39.950> games<00:05:40.950> out

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
1080p 60 frames per second games out

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.630

there<00:05:41.310> so<00:05:42.210> all<00:05:42.540> three<00:05:43.020> platforms<00:05:43.740> can<00:05:44.220> achieve

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
there so all three platforms can achieve

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.980 
there so all three platforms can achieve
this<00:05:44.970> that<00:05:45.930> we<00:05:46.680> know<00:05:46.920> we<00:05:47.820> also<00:05:48.030> know<00:05:48.450> that<00:05:48.480> all

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
this that we know we also know that all

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.440 
this that we know we also know that all
three<00:05:49.500> platforms<00:05:50.370> have<00:05:50.580> games<00:05:50.880> that<00:05:51.030> aren't

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
three platforms have games that aren't

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
1080p 60 frames per second but that's

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.120 
1080p 60 frames per second but that's
probably<00:05:54.450> going<00:05:54.750> to<00:05:54.810> get<00:05:54.900> better<00:05:55.170> as<00:05:55.410> time

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
probably going to get better as time

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.610 
probably going to get better as time
rolls<00:05:56.370> along<00:05:56.820> and<00:05:57.420> as<00:05:57.750> it<00:05:57.900> stands<00:05:58.170> right<00:05:58.380> now

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
rolls along and as it stands right now

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.160 
rolls along and as it stands right now
it<00:05:58.860> seems<00:05:59.220> as<00:05:59.490> if<00:05:59.520> the<00:05:59.760> PlayStation<00:06:00.300> 4<00:06:00.510> is<00:06:00.660> out

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.170 
it seems as if the PlayStation 4 is out

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:02.870 
it seems as if the PlayStation 4 is out
in<00:06:01.350> front<00:06:01.590> and<00:06:01.770> that<00:06:01.830> is<00:06:02.100> definitely<00:06:02.610> great

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
in front and that is definitely great

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.140 
in front and that is definitely great
news<00:06:03.150> for<00:06:04.020> those<00:06:04.170> gamers<00:06:04.680> I<00:06:04.860> think<00:06:05.760> as<00:06:05.850> far<00:06:06.060> as

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
news for those gamers I think as far as

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.120 
news for those gamers I think as far as

the frames per second debate goes you

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.130 
the frames per second debate goes you

really makes a difference whenever

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.190 
really makes a difference whenever
you're<00:06:20.880> dealing<00:06:21.030> with<00:06:21.240> twitchy<00:06:21.630> games<00:06:21.930> with

you're dealing with twitchy games with

you're dealing with twitchy games with
shooters<00:06:22.770> primarily<00:06:23.550> if<00:06:23.790> you're<00:06:24.240> dealing

shooters primarily if you're dealing

shooters primarily if you're dealing
with<00:06:24.570> other<00:06:25.020> games<00:06:25.380> um<00:06:25.820> then<00:06:26.820> it<00:06:26.850> really

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:27.480 
with other games um then it really

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.930 
with other games um then it really
doesn't<00:06:27.900> make<00:06:28.410> as<00:06:28.680> much<00:06:29.160> of<00:06:29.460> a<00:06:29.550> difference

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
doesn't make as much of a difference

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.100 
doesn't make as much of a difference
especially<00:06:30.360> if<00:06:30.450> you're<00:06:30.540> looking<00:06:30.780> like<00:06:30.960> at<00:06:31.080> a

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
especially if you're looking like at a

action-adventure game I know Dead Rising
has<00:06:35.940> been<00:06:36.120> talked<00:06:36.330> about<00:06:36.620> some<00:06:37.620> people<00:06:37.860> were

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:37.979 
has been talked about some people were

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:40.070 
has been talked about some people were
complaining<00:06:38.190> that<00:06:38.729> it<00:06:38.940> wasn't<00:06:39.210> 60<00:06:39.720> frames<00:06:39.990> per

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
complaining that it wasn't 60 frames per

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.439 
complaining that it wasn't 60 frames per
second<00:06:40.620> but

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:41.449 
second but

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:43.029 
second but
if<00:06:41.689> you<00:06:41.779> look<00:06:41.960> at<00:06:42.050> the<00:06:42.139> gameplay<00:06:42.650> it<00:06:42.830> looks

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.039 
if you look at the gameplay it looks

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:45.369 
if you look at the gameplay it looks
pretty<00:06:43.370> freakin<00:06:43.759> smooth<00:06:44.029> and<00:06:44.449> they're

00:06:45.369 --> 00:06:45.379 
pretty freakin smooth and they're

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:48.580 
pretty freakin smooth and they're
creating<00:06:46.309> over<00:06:46.879> a<00:06:46.909> thousand<00:06:47.629> zombies<00:06:48.139> on<00:06:48.409> the

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:48.590 
creating over a thousand zombies on the

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.189 
creating over a thousand zombies on the
screen<00:06:48.949> at<00:06:49.129> once<00:06:49.400> and<00:06:49.729> every<00:06:50.539> single<00:06:50.749> zombie

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 
screen at once and every single zombie

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:54.670 
screen at once and every single zombie
looks<00:06:52.129> different<00:06:52.669> so<00:06:53.569> I<00:06:53.599> mean<00:06:54.050> that's<00:06:54.259> asking

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 
looks different so I mean that's asking

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.399 
looks different so I mean that's asking
a<00:06:54.800> game<00:06:54.979> to<00:06:55.159> do<00:06:55.309> a<00:06:55.339> lot<00:06:55.819> it<00:06:55.999> seems<00:06:56.210> so<00:06:56.990> I<00:06:57.020> mean

00:06:57.399 --> 00:06:57.409 
a game to do a lot it seems so I mean

00:06:57.409 --> 00:06:59.769 
a game to do a lot it seems so I mean
does<00:06:58.249> 30<00:06:58.639> frames<00:06:58.939> per<00:06:59.059> second<00:06:59.449> really<00:06:59.599> make

00:06:59.769 --> 00:06:59.779 
does 30 frames per second really make

00:06:59.779 --> 00:07:00.820 
does 30 frames per second really make
that<00:06:59.930> much<00:06:59.990> of<00:07:00.199> a<00:07:00.349> difference<00:07:00.469> in<00:07:00.800> that

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:00.830 
that much of a difference in that

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.999 
that much of a difference in that
particular<00:07:01.430> game<00:07:01.789> no<00:07:02.509> but<00:07:03.080> it<00:07:03.199> might<00:07:03.409> in<00:07:03.740> a

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:04.009 
particular game no but it might in a

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:06.249 
particular game no but it might in a
Call<00:07:04.279> of<00:07:04.309> Duty<00:07:04.460> or<00:07:05.089> a<00:07:05.240> battlefield<00:07:05.839> which

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:06.259 
Call of Duty or a battlefield which

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:08.320 
Call of Duty or a battlefield which
those<00:07:06.979> games<00:07:07.249> are<00:07:07.430> going<00:07:07.580> to<00:07:07.669> be<00:07:07.819> 60<00:07:08.120> frames

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:08.330 
those games are going to be 60 frames

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.049 
those games are going to be 60 frames
per<00:07:08.389> second<00:07:08.839> online<00:07:09.589> which<00:07:09.949> is<00:07:10.189> what<00:07:10.729> matters

00:07:11.049 --> 00:07:11.059 
per second online which is what matters

00:07:11.059 --> 00:07:13.239 
per second online which is what matters
so<00:07:11.659> I<00:07:11.689> think<00:07:11.900> both<00:07:12.319> games<00:07:12.620> can<00:07:12.830> hit<00:07:12.949> it<00:07:13.069> both

00:07:13.239 --> 00:07:13.249 
so I think both games can hit it both

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:15.640 
so I think both games can hit it both
games<00:07:13.580> can't<00:07:14.199> Playstation<00:07:15.199> further<00:07:15.379> along

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:15.650 
games can't Playstation further along

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.100 
games can't Playstation further along
Xbox<00:07:16.159> one<00:07:16.430> I<00:07:16.639> think<00:07:16.939> the<00:07:17.210> tools<00:07:17.479> are<00:07:17.839> further

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:18.110 
Xbox one I think the tools are further

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.379 
Xbox one I think the tools are further
behind<00:07:18.499> so<00:07:18.710> that's<00:07:18.949> keeping<00:07:19.460> it<00:07:19.550> further

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:20.389 
behind so that's keeping it further

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:22.149 
behind so that's keeping it further
behind<00:07:20.749> but<00:07:21.020> I<00:07:21.080> don't<00:07:21.409> believe<00:07:21.499> for<00:07:21.650> a<00:07:21.830> second

00:07:22.149 --> 00:07:22.159 
behind but I don't believe for a second

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:23.110 
behind but I don't believe for a second
that<00:07:22.189> your<00:07:22.370> game<00:07:22.550> would<00:07:22.699> be<00:07:22.789> any<00:07:23.029> less

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120 
that your game would be any less

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.739 
that your game would be any less
enjoyable<00:07:23.740> due<00:07:24.740> to<00:07:25.069> a<00:07:25.099> lower<00:07:25.550> resolution<00:07:25.849> that

00:07:26.739 --> 00:07:26.749 
enjoyable due to a lower resolution that

00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:29.950 
enjoyable due to a lower resolution that
is<00:07:26.930> being<00:07:27.169> upscaled<00:07:27.889> to<00:07:28.159> 1080p<00:07:28.810> but<00:07:29.810> that's

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:29.960 
is being upscaled to 1080p but that's

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.929

so<00:07:39.770> you<00:07:39.830> can<00:07:40.219> see<00:07:40.520> that<00:07:40.789> there<00:07:40.999> is<00:07:41.210> indeed<00:07:41.509> a

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:41.930 
so you can see that there is indeed a

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:45.040 
so you can see that there is indeed a
difference<00:07:42.490> when<00:07:43.490> it<00:07:43.610> comes<00:07:43.789> to<00:07:43.939> 1080p<00:07:44.360> versus

difference when it comes to 1080p versus
other<00:07:45.349> resolutions<00:07:46.219> it's<00:07:46.430> it's<00:07:46.669> a<00:07:46.879> much

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:47.060 
other resolutions it's it's a much

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.719 
other resolutions it's it's a much
clearer<00:07:47.870> picture<00:07:48.259> but<00:07:49.009> some<00:07:49.219> of<00:07:49.310> those<00:07:49.460> I

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:49.729 
clearer picture but some of those I

00:07:49.729 --> 00:07:51.010 
clearer picture but some of those I
guarantee<00:07:50.149> that<00:07:50.180> you're<00:07:50.449> going<00:07:50.689> to<00:07:50.719> have<00:07:50.870> to

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:51.020 
guarantee that you're going to have to

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.350 
guarantee that you're going to have to
watch<00:07:51.199> several<00:07:51.469> times<00:07:51.889> in<00:07:52.159> order<00:07:52.699> to<00:07:52.879> notice

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.360 
watch several times in order to notice

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.760 
watch several times in order to notice
the<00:07:53.509> difference<00:07:53.899> I<00:07:54.020> know<00:07:54.080> I<00:07:54.229> did

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:54.770 
the difference I know I did

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:56.649 
the difference I know I did
so<00:07:55.129> that<00:07:55.430> doesn't<00:07:55.610> for<00:07:55.759> me<00:07:55.789> the<00:07:56.029> red<00:07:56.240> dragon

00:07:56.649 --> 00:07:56.659 
so that doesn't for me the red dragon

00:07:56.659 --> 00:07:58.360 
so that doesn't for me the red dragon
