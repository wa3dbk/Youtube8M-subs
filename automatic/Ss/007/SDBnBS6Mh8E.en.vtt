00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
it was grinding a bit into second gear

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.800 
it was grinding a bit into second gear
so<00:02:36.410> had<00:02:37.220> gear<00:02:37.519> oil<00:02:37.760> in<00:02:37.910> it<00:02:38.030> I<00:02:38.150> could<00:02:38.329> smell<00:02:38.750> it

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
so had gear oil in it I could smell it

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.680 
so had gear oil in it I could smell it
in<00:02:39.109> I<00:02:39.380> was<00:02:40.370> original<00:02:40.730> but<00:02:40.760> you<00:02:41.090> see<00:02:41.269> a<00:02:41.299> bit<00:02:41.510> of<00:02:41.540> a

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
in I was original but you see a bit of a

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.460 
in I was original but you see a bit of a
metallic<00:02:43.630> sediments<00:02:44.630> floating<00:02:44.900> around<00:02:44.959> it<00:02:45.290> so

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
metallic sediments floating around it so

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:56.620 
metallic sediments floating around it so
that<00:02:45.500> we<00:02:45.769> want<00:02:45.980> to<00:02:46.040> change<00:02:52.930> great<00:02:53.930> success
