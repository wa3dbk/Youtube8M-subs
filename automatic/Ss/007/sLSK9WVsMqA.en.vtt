00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
later somewhere on january-february of

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.889 
later somewhere on january-february of
2014<00:01:53.159> however<00:01:54.030> if<00:01:54.090> somebody<00:01:54.360> could<00:01:54.540> find<00:01:54.780> a

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
2014 however if somebody could find a

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.050 
2014 however if somebody could find a
bug<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.409> actually<00:01:55.890> break<00:01:56.130> into<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.700> will<00:01:56.850> work

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
bug to actually break into it will work

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.940 
bug to actually break into it will work
throughout<00:01:57.360> iOS<00:01:57.780> 7.1<00:01:58.320> so<00:01:58.530> we'll<00:01:58.649> just<00:01:58.770> have<00:01:58.860> to

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
throughout iOS 7.1 so we'll just have to

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.219 
throughout iOS 7.1 so we'll just have to
wait<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.159> see<00:01:59.340> but<00:01:59.670> overall<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.689> still<00:02:01.049> think

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
wait and see but overall I still think

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.179 
wait and see but overall I still think
it's<00:02:01.320> going<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.500> be<00:02:01.560> one<00:02:01.740> click<00:02:01.979> jailbreak

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
it's going to be one click jailbreak

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.800 
it's going to be one click jailbreak
it's<00:02:02.579> going<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.759> be<00:02:02.880> untethered<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.659> should

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
it's going to be untethered it should

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.709 
it's going to be untethered it should
work<00:02:03.930> for<00:02:04.110> all<00:02:04.170> devices<00:02:04.469> including<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.189> 5s<00:02:05.719> as

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.570 
work for all devices including the 5s as
I<00:02:06.840> said<00:02:07.049> before<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.619> hopefully<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:08.369> was<00:02:08.459> it

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
I said before and hopefully it was it

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.339 
I said before and hopefully it was it
the<00:02:08.700> wait<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:08.970> see<00:02:09.119> hopefully<00:02:09.660> somebody<00:02:10.140> out
