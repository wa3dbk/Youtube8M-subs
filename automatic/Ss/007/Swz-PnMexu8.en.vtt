00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
ready for combining get these out of the

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:31.700 
ready for combining get these out of the
way<00:00:11.450> first<00:00:12.860> add<00:00:14.210> the<00:00:15.210> legs

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:45.500 

come<00:00:32.460> on

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:59.620 

then<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.500> arms

00:00:59.620 --> 00:00:59.630 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:11.880 

and<00:01:00.290> back<00:01:00.620> a<00:01:00.650> little<00:01:00.890> bit

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.770 

and<00:01:12.909> there<00:01:13.909> he<00:01:14.179> is

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:27.230 

bruticus<00:01:18.710> and<00:01:19.659> his<00:01:20.680> combined<00:01:21.680> moon

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:37.750 

looking<00:01:28.020> very<00:01:28.049> cool

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:02:07.570 

they're<00:01:38.270> just<00:01:38.300> head<00:01:39.640> arms<00:01:40.640> legs

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.680 

there<00:02:08.180> are<00:02:08.330> some<00:02:08.509> clearance<00:02:08.930> issues<00:02:09.759> with<00:02:10.759> the

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
there are some clearance issues with the

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.470 
there are some clearance issues with the
wings<00:02:12.020> on<00:02:12.320> vortex<00:02:12.590> we<00:02:13.580> bump<00:02:13.850> it<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.210> guns

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
wings on vortex we bump it to the guns

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.940 
wings on vortex we bump it to the guns
but<00:02:14.750> I<00:02:14.840> guess<00:02:14.990> you<00:02:15.020> can<00:02:15.290> solve<00:02:15.530> that<00:02:15.680> by<00:02:15.740> just

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
but I guess you can solve that by just

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.670 
but I guess you can solve that by just
taking<00:02:16.310> those<00:02:16.670> guns<00:02:17.030> off<00:02:19.690> we'll<00:02:20.690> just<00:02:20.930> angling

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
taking those guns off we'll just angling

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:30.800 
taking those guns off we'll just angling
the<00:02:21.830> arms<00:02:22.220> out<00:02:22.400> like<00:02:22.610> that
