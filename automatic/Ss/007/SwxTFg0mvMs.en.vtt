what<00:01:04.460> we're<00:01:04.580> about

what we're about

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.960 
what we're about
so<00:01:05.449> I<00:01:05.479> think<00:01:05.930> that's<00:01:06.260> why<00:01:06.470> my<00:01:07.430> Lincoln<00:01:07.760> Touch

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
so I think that's why my Lincoln Touch

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.120 
so I think that's why my Lincoln Touch
and<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.510> technologies<00:01:09.020> it<00:01:09.140> brings<00:01:09.350> with<00:01:09.560> it

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
and the technologies it brings with it

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.910 
and the technologies it brings with it
sync<00:01:10.640> as<00:01:10.880> a<00:01:11.420> cornerstone<00:01:11.930> of<00:01:12.380> my<00:01:12.590> Lincoln

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
sync as a cornerstone of my Lincoln

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.179 
sync as a cornerstone of my Lincoln
Touch<00:01:13.100> is<00:01:13.689> so<00:01:14.689> important<00:01:15.200> and<00:01:15.350> makes<00:01:15.920> the

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
Touch is so important and makes the

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.219 
Touch is so important and makes the
makes<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:17.270> Lincoln<00:01:17.570> technology<00:01:18.049> really

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
makes the Lincoln technology really

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.020 
makes the Lincoln technology really
credible<00:01:18.680> and<00:01:18.920> takes<00:01:19.159> it<00:01:19.310> to<00:01:19.400> that<00:01:19.430> next<00:01:19.580> step

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
credible and takes it to that next step

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.359 
credible and takes it to that next step
so<00:01:20.540> when<00:01:20.689> we<00:01:20.780> introduced<00:01:21.200> sync<00:01:21.500> is<00:01:21.890> really<00:01:22.220> one

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
so when we introduced sync is really one

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.359 
so when we introduced sync is really one
of<00:01:22.400> our<00:01:22.640> early<00:01:23.299> signature<00:01:23.900> technologies<00:01:24.590> if

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
of our early signature technologies if

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:26.950 
of our early signature technologies if
you<00:01:25.460> think<00:01:25.640> about<00:01:25.759> top<00:01:26.240> reasons<00:01:26.659> that<00:01:26.750> people

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
you think about top reasons that people

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.649 
you think about top reasons that people
you<00:01:27.259> sync<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:28.189> hands-free<00:01:28.520> calling<00:01:29.390> is<00:01:29.630> the

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
you sync the hands-free calling is the

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.330 
you sync the hands-free calling is the
number<00:01:29.930> one<00:01:30.049> reason<00:01:30.200> today<00:01:30.710> and<00:01:31.009> then<00:01:31.250> the

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
number one reason today and then the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.359 
number one reason today and then the
next<00:01:31.610> would<00:01:31.729> be<00:01:31.759> to<00:01:32.450> use<00:01:32.960> your<00:01:32.990> mp3<00:01:33.590> player<00:01:33.619> or

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
next would be to use your mp3 player or

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:35.770 
next would be to use your mp3 player or
portable<00:01:34.850> devices<00:01:35.090> you<00:01:35.299> bring<00:01:35.509> into<00:01:35.689> the

you<00:04:09.480> can<00:04:09.630> interact<00:04:09.870> with<00:04:10.080> those<00:04:10.350> in

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
you can interact with those in

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.590 
you can interact with those in
traditional<00:04:11.190> vehicles<00:04:11.459> but<00:04:11.730> what<00:04:12.240> we've<00:04:12.390> done

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
traditional vehicles but what we've done

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.300 
traditional vehicles but what we've done
is<00:04:12.780> organize<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.440> information<00:04:13.950> in<00:04:14.100> a<00:04:14.190> very

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
is organize the information in a very

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.490 
is organize the information in a very
logical<00:04:14.880> way<00:04:14.910> to<00:04:15.240> make<00:04:15.750> it<00:04:15.900> more<00:04:15.990> simple<00:04:16.410> to

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
logical way to make it more simple to

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.710 
logical way to make it more simple to
use<00:04:16.680> for<00:04:16.709> example<00:04:17.040> to<00:04:17.400> use<00:04:17.520> color<00:04:17.790> coding<00:04:18.030> to

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
use for example to use color coding to

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.680 
use for example to use color coding to
convey<00:04:19.020> the<00:04:19.260> functionality<00:04:19.950> so<00:04:20.880> color<00:04:21.480> was

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
convey the functionality so color was

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.150 
convey the functionality so color was
very<00:04:21.870> important<00:04:22.290> for<00:04:22.470> us<00:04:22.530> to<00:04:22.560> be<00:04:22.770> able<00:04:22.860> to<00:04:23.010> let

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
very important for us to be able to let

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.350 
very important for us to be able to let
people<00:04:23.490> know<00:04:23.520> where<00:04:23.790> they<00:04:23.940> are<00:04:23.970> in<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.270> user

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
people know where they are in the user

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.890 
people know where they are in the user
in

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
in

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.900 
in
so<00:04:25.530> if<00:04:25.620> I<00:04:25.710> could<00:04:25.770> Lance<00:04:26.009> down<00:04:26.280> and<00:04:26.460> it<00:04:26.520> was<00:04:26.580> blue

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
so if I could Lance down and it was blue

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.370 
so if I could Lance down and it was blue
then<00:04:27.180> I<00:04:27.240> knew<00:04:27.449> that<00:04:27.479> I<00:04:27.660> was<00:04:27.840> in<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.020> climate

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
then I knew that I was in the climate

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.990 
then I knew that I was in the climate
control<00:04:28.680> if<00:04:29.340> it<00:04:29.460> was<00:04:29.580> Green

it<00:04:30.120> was<00:04:30.240> navigation<00:04:30.870> but<00:04:31.470> it<00:04:31.560> was<00:04:31.680> red<00:04:31.889> it's

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
it was navigation but it was red it's

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.310 
it was navigation but it was red it's

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
audio benefits amber then it's the phone

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.600 
audio benefits amber then it's the phone
each<00:04:37.320> one<00:04:37.530> of<00:04:37.620> those<00:04:37.710> colors<00:04:38.009> were<00:04:38.160> set<00:04:38.370> up<00:04:38.400> so

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
each one of those colors were set up so

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.670 
each one of those colors were set up so
that<00:04:38.729> they're<00:04:38.880> quick<00:04:39.330> quickly<00:04:40.050> able<00:04:40.380> to<00:04:40.590> be

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
that they're quick quickly able to be

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.950 
that they're quick quickly able to be
recognized<00:04:41.190> we've<00:04:41.910> done<00:04:42.060> that's<00:04:42.240> unique<00:04:42.509> also

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
recognized we've done that's unique also

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.420 
recognized we've done that's unique also
as<00:04:43.110> we've<00:04:43.289> brought<00:04:43.530> that<00:04:43.560> information<00:04:44.250> into

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
as we've brought that information into

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.890 
as we've brought that information into
the<00:04:44.550> cluster<00:04:45.000> so<00:04:45.330> if<00:04:45.419> you<00:04:45.509> don't<00:04:45.690> want<00:04:45.840> to

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
just glance down it's much quicker you

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.590 
just glance down it's much quicker you
