00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
environment we practiced here in the gym

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.850 
environment we practiced here in the gym
on<00:00:44.879> foam<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:45.989> when<00:00:46.110> we<00:00:46.200> take<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.469> out<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.680> the

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
on foam so when we take it out in the

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.100 
on foam so when we take it out in the
real<00:00:47.039> world<00:00:47.070> on<00:00:47.430> cement<00:00:47.730> we<00:00:48.690> don't<00:00:48.840> get<00:00:48.930> hurt

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
real world on cement we don't get hurt

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.020 
real world on cement we don't get hurt
so<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.710> where<00:00:49.890> we<00:00:49.980> test<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.579> test<00:00:50.789> your

so this is where we test you test your
limits<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.649> can<00:00:53.660> move<00:00:54.660> out<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
limits and so you can move out in the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.959 
limits and so you can move out in the

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.749 
we start up with simple vaults a simple
move<00:01:28.530> as<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.710> wall<00:01:28.920> spin<00:01:29.189> right<00:01:29.369> there<00:01:29.579> as<00:01:29.700> a

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
move as a wall spin right there as a

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.399 
move as a wall spin right there as a
confidence<00:01:30.570> builder<00:01:30.840> because<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.200> gets<00:01:31.320> you

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
confidence builder because it gets you

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.840 
confidence builder because it gets you
off<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.650> ground<00:01:31.860> but<00:01:31.979> it's<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.640> know<00:01:32.700> you're

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
off the ground but it's you know you're

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.539 
off the ground but it's you know you're
not<00:01:33.150> up<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.450> air<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.600> then<00:01:33.720> we<00:01:33.780> start

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
not up in the air and then we start

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:36.740 
not up in the air and then we start
expanding<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.729> little<00:01:35.909> bit<00:01:36.030> on<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.240> vaults<00:01:36.540> and

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
expanding a little bit on the vaults and

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.270 
expanding a little bit on the vaults and
stretching<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.290> vaults<00:01:37.530> out<00:01:37.650> in<00:01:37.829> distance

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
stretching the vaults out in distance

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.289 
stretching the vaults out in distance
this<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.119> called<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.509> Kong<00:01:40.970> what<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.090> do<00:01:42.180> and

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
this is called a Kong what to do and

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.700 
this is called a Kong what to do and
we're<00:01:42.420> here<00:01:42.540> right<00:01:42.689> now<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.079> we<00:01:43.229> just<00:01:43.560> keep

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
we're here right now and we just keep

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.620 
we're here right now and we just keep
the<00:01:43.970> expanding<00:01:44.970> on<00:01:45.090> what<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.270> already<00:01:45.420> know

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
the expanding on what you already know

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.179 
the expanding on what you already know
and<00:01:46.079> what<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.500> said<00:01:46.619> once<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.860> get<00:01:47.009> the

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
and what you said once you get the

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.920 
and what you said once you get the
Boltzmann<00:01:47.850> under<00:01:48.030> your<00:01:48.119> belt<00:01:48.299> into<00:01:48.450> vault<00:01:48.780> so

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
Boltzmann under your belt into vault so

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.660 
Boltzmann under your belt into vault so
you<00:01:49.020> start<00:01:49.229> doing<00:01:49.350> flips<00:01:49.649> off<00:01:49.829> there<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:50.280> it's

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
you start doing flips off there so it's

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.310 
you start doing flips off there so it's
all<00:01:50.880> about<00:01:51.149> elevating<00:01:51.360> yourself<00:01:52.079> here<00:01:52.259> and

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
all about elevating yourself here and

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.139 
all about elevating yourself here and
what<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.619> guys<00:01:52.799> learn<00:01:53.220> here<00:01:53.460> at<00:01:53.549> acceleration

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
what you guys learn here at acceleration

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.270 
what you guys learn here at acceleration
that<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.720> go<00:01:54.960> ahead<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.500> apply<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.829> in

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
that you go ahead and you apply it in

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.010 
that you go ahead and you apply it in
the<00:01:56.490> street<00:01:56.759> right<00:01:57.000> sure<00:01:57.299> yeah<00:01:57.540> well<00:01:57.750> we'll

over these obstacles when we come back
after<00:02:36.130> this<00:02:36.400> next<00:02:36.970> few<00:02:37.120> breaks<00:02:37.330> all<00:02:37.750> right

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
after this next few breaks all right

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.770 
after this next few breaks all right
hold<00:02:38.500> on<00:02:38.590> oh<00:02:38.739> no<00:02:38.950> way<00:02:39.099> Joe<00:02:39.550> he<00:02:40.120> said<00:02:40.390> that<00:02:40.630> those

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
Mike's just doing a dive roll here we

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.490 
Mike's just doing a dive roll here we
start<00:03:33.130> off<00:03:33.220> fairly<00:03:33.519> simple<00:03:34.049> this<00:03:35.049> is<00:03:35.109> actually

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
start off fairly simple this is actually

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.660 
start off fairly simple this is actually
probably<00:03:35.680> little<00:03:35.980> more<00:03:36.100> advanced<00:03:36.370> than<00:03:36.459> we'd

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
probably little more advanced than we'd

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.930 
probably little more advanced than we'd
start<00:03:37.030> you<00:03:37.150> out<00:03:37.180> but<00:03:37.660> we<00:03:38.470> got<00:03:38.620> got<00:03:38.920> a<00:03:38.950> need<00:03:39.880> to

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
start you out but we got got a need to

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.500 
start you out but we got got a need to
get<00:03:40.120> you<00:03:40.269> up<00:03:41.140> to<00:03:41.350> speed<00:03:41.650> today<00:03:41.950> but<00:03:42.359> so<00:03:43.359> just

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
get you up to speed today but so just

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.690 
get you up to speed today but so just
doing<00:03:44.019> some<00:03:44.290> vaults<00:03:44.530> it's<00:03:44.859> definitely<00:03:45.579> that

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
doing some vaults it's definitely that

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.860 
doing some vaults it's definitely that
but<00:03:45.910> you<00:03:46.090> have<00:03:46.150> to<00:03:46.269> start<00:03:46.569> a<00:03:46.630> little<00:03:46.660> bit

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
but you have to start a little bit

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.030 
but you have to start a little bit
slower<00:03:47.170> than<00:03:47.380> what<00:03:47.440> these<00:03:47.620> guys<00:03:47.799> are<00:03:47.859> doing

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
slower than what these guys are doing

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.460 
slower than what these guys are doing
sure<00:03:48.430> we<00:03:48.670> start<00:03:48.910> up<00:03:49.030> with<00:03:49.060> usually<00:03:50.049> a<00:03:50.109> safety

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
sure we start up with usually a safety

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.849 
sure we start up with usually a safety
or<00:03:50.850> a<00:03:51.930> little<00:03:52.930> bit<00:03:53.019> before<00:03:53.319> so<00:03:53.470> I'm<00:03:53.590> gonna<00:03:53.680> go
