00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.029
 my channel and in this video I will share with 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.670
 you information and in one cosmetic 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.040
 a tool that I really liked 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.099
 I hope that if you try it you 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.029
 also become satisfied this is the best 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.789
 wearing mask socks for korean feet 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.650
 firms their skinlite 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.500
 Let's start with the fact that initially this product 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.080
 innovative since you can now 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.420
 do a pedicure clean them up 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.120
 to clean the corns old kid cracks 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.630
 not using a pilot using mechanical 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.600
 funds 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:41.129
 and with the help of such innovative ones 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.920
 masks looks like a mask like this 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.610
 such from polyethylene socks and inside 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.870
 fabric work on a special composition and 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.050
 these socks 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.289
 They are universal in size ie from 35 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.539
 to 40 when I used them for myself I 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.820
 put these on 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:02.730
 man soaped my feet then i put these on 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.040
 socks on top to fasten 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.229
 a mask on the badass so that it does not 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.560
 fell off my feet and acted better 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.549
 substances I wore ordinary socks and in 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.729
 In this state, I spent some minutes 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:21.060
 recommends 90-120 but I am about 90 not 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.189
 more than the last minutes probably 15 to me 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.189
 very skin burning need to 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.450
 unpleasant but tangibly burned skin was 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:32.579
 only simultaneously effect in 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.950
 cooling and warming another five 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.619
 carry this mask you need to look to 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.350
 you had no corns no 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.170
 no fresh bleeding wounds 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.960
 inflammations and here on the upper part of the foot 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.970
 which usually does not occur any 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.250
 problems I would recommend to apply 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.290
 nutritious cream 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.329
 since this part is also very strong 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.070
 may concern exfoliation i think 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.990
 it will not be very nice to go there 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.450
 no one needs it never heard of 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.500
 with rough legs or with 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:07.099
 problems with this skin so passed 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.830
 through this time by the time you take off 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:11.490
 flush Moscow and, in general, wait through 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.650
 four 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.270
 47 days after seven days 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.280
 exfoliation and dependency starts 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:23.680
 whatever your leg problems 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:26.500
 it lasts from 4 probably so up to 6 7 days 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.060
 I was not difficult to transfer because I 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.920
 recently studied from the hospital and there was 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.200
 cold base cold chamber cold 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.600
 the shower in general could not care 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.520
 behind him since i got used to it and so i 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.070
 This mask came to me very much saved 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.080
 since my feet 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.990
 suffered from the soup of antibiotics 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.600
 that I lay a lot went a little 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:53.130
 care was not like my legs used to 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:56.110
 in general, this mask saved me and more 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.360
 to say unpleasant of course because 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.670
 fit the same skin students such 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.370
 huge by 23 centimeters 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:07.300
 skin pieces they move away from go but 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.580
 This process can not be strengthened as a 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.400
 mechanical means that is sawing 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.690
 or pumice can be done let's say 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.100
 foot baths every day or through 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.120
 day or on request if possible 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.150
 use foot scrubs 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.520
 but give the skin a natural site so as not to 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.390
 it was then some 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:30.580
 inflammation or problems and more so 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.370
 say i am all these days all these five days 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.320
 walked in socks and slept in socks and 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.280
 walked in socks because so much 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.680
 the whole skin was moving away 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:45.220
 it turns out to do a pedicure yes a month before 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.280
 of this mask and in the end it was all the same 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.040
 let's say so as my hi5's feet are still very 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.110
 nice but really clean everything 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.980
 hardened calluses corns from all the old 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.950
 I was probably three years ago 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.959
 who are pedicure masters 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.850
 just did not notice they said that we 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:07.390
 now you cut it off this top only 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:09.730
 remove and you will have a problem with legs 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.739
 that is, she will inflame she will 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.260
 bleed we won't clean you at home 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:17.230
 there same as in Paris, this is something else 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.450
 have it as if they didn't clean on 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.030
 little fingers but this mask removed 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.480
 they moved off me well and now 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.820
 i'm just andris 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.630
 on the skin of the legs that let out about 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.730
 cuticle 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.230
 Someone might argue that this is not a nickname. 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.660
 full pedicure 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.850
 but I used to use the code 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.220
 time agent for cuticle length 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:41.770
 cuticle and also thanks to this means 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:43.730
 somehow it became less diminished 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:46.190
 copied do not know what to call 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.570
 the only thing that I will give this mask to you 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.950
 It won't cut but if you have 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:53.810
 any problems due with flexibility up 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.280
 it's hard for you to bend down to do yourself 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.560
 herself pedicure 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.540
 if you don't want to go to 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.700
 salon or do you want to do something more 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.730
 budget because the mask costs 150 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.290
 assistant where both rubles and general on 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.510
 two or three months you can forget about 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.910
 leg problems ie after that 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:14.720
 skin moved away to care for them to usually 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:17.920
 your favorite saws cream and so on and all 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:21.140
 It will be great and if for example 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:23.300
 do a pedicure for your husband for example you don't 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.640
 want him there especially points in this 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.140
 sawing or wants it to be smooth 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.060
 legs but don't feel like it 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:32.500
 bother here even drawn and what 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:35.300
 going on with the foot i mean that's starting 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:39.410
 yes during and after 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:41.390
 that is, the skin at the time when it comes off 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:44.030
 looks like awful legs i would 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:46.970
 recommended that not show it to anyone 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:50.600
 take off your legs and fragment the action of this 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:54.340
 masks when go crust into the skin of such 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:57.830
 unpleasant shade and in general 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.630
 but of the minuses of the minuses only local 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.550
 that the nail does not cut the damask and 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.860
 leg bakes and what 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.630
 this time is stretched 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.060
 have a regular pedicure you did 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.490
 and after some time there half an hour you 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:13.160
 already run go jump u as usual 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.800
 live and here you need to wait for it 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.800
 process stretched over time but in general 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:21.020
 and in general this is an excellent mask recommend 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.240
 try again in this company there 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.820
 moisturizing masks maybe soon I will take off 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.070
