00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
so now that you've got your carburetor

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.579 
so now that you've got your carburetor
already<00:00:03.300> built<00:00:03.510> you<00:00:03.780> want<00:00:03.959> to<00:00:04.020> put<00:00:04.140> it<00:00:04.230> back<00:00:04.380> on

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
already built you want to put it back on

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.629 
already built you want to put it back on
the<00:00:04.740> saw<00:00:04.950> and<00:00:06.890> usually<00:00:07.890> on<00:00:08.010> these<00:00:08.189> carburetors

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
the saw and usually on these carburetors

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.589 
the saw and usually on these carburetors
like<00:00:09.210> in<00:00:09.389> another<00:00:10.139> one<00:00:10.349> of<00:00:10.469> my<00:00:10.679> videos<00:00:11.599> there's

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
like in another one of my videos there's

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.540 
like in another one of my videos there's
all<00:00:12.900> these<00:00:13.280> little<00:00:14.420> plastic<00:00:15.420> retainers<00:00:16.550> the

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
all these little plastic retainers the

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.220 
all these little plastic retainers the
manufacturer<00:00:18.300> puts<00:00:18.630> them<00:00:18.810> there<00:00:18.990> still

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
manufacturer puts them there still

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.150 
manufacturer puts them there still
nobody<00:00:19.350> tampers<00:00:20.130> with<00:00:20.160> them<00:00:21.769> I've<00:00:22.769> had<00:00:23.039> to

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
nobody tampers with them I've had to

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.750 
nobody tampers with them I've had to
take<00:00:23.340> them<00:00:23.550> off<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:24.060> adjust<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.630> carburetor

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
take them off to adjust the carburetor

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.310 
take them off to adjust the carburetor
now<00:00:26.760> if<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.000> look<00:00:27.150> on<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.449> carburetor<00:00:28.050> you're

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
now if you look on the carburetor you're

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.529 
now if you look on the carburetor you're
going<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.590> see<00:00:28.800> an<00:00:28.949> H<00:00:29.220> under<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.000> screw<00:00:30.359> on<00:00:30.390> the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
going to see an H under the screw on the

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.209 
going to see an H under the screw on the
right<00:00:30.779> that's<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.230> high<00:00:31.380> speed<00:00:31.710> screw<00:00:32.009> and

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
right that's the high speed screw and

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.060 
right that's the high speed screw and
the<00:00:32.880> one<00:00:33.030> on<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.300> left<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.719> low<00:00:33.989> speed<00:00:34.320> I've

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
the one on the left is a low speed I've

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.250 
the one on the left is a low speed I've
got<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.520> low<00:00:35.640> speed<00:00:35.940> screw<00:00:36.360> at<00:00:36.570> about<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.870> turn

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
got the low speed screw at about a turn

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.299 
got the low speed screw at about a turn
and<00:00:37.559> 3/4<00:00:38.250> out<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:40.290> high<00:00:40.469> speed<00:00:40.530> I've<00:00:41.100> got

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
and 3/4 out and the high speed I've got

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.260 
and 3/4 out and the high speed I've got
it<00:00:41.430> at<00:00:41.579> about<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.850> turn<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.770> half<00:00:44.010> out<00:00:44.370> the

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
it at about a turn and a half out the

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.619 
it at about a turn and a half out the
way<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.480> measure<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:47.219> you

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
way you measure that is that you

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.420 
way you measure that is that you
basically<00:00:48.629> when<00:00:49.289> you're<00:00:49.440> tuning<00:00:50.160> your

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
basically when you're tuning your

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.220 
basically when you're tuning your
chainsaw<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:51.180> play<00:00:51.420> with<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.719> screws<00:00:52.020> either

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
chainsaw you play with the screws either

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.090 
chainsaw you play with the screws either
by<00:00:52.710> going<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.300> by<00:00:54.300> going<00:00:54.480> out<00:00:54.840> or<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.199> until<00:00:55.980> you

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
by going in by going out or in until you

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.220 
by going in by going out or in until you
feel<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.520> all<00:00:56.760> runs<00:00:57.360> better<00:00:57.690> usually<00:00:57.930> if<00:00:58.109> it

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
feel this all runs better usually if it

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.910 
feel this all runs better usually if it
runs<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.739> lean<00:00:59.390> you<00:01:00.390> would<00:01:00.629> turn<00:01:00.899> out<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.739> low

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
runs to lean you would turn out the low

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.299 
runs to lean you would turn out the low
screw<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.609> would<00:01:02.699> give<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.940> more<00:01:03.090> gas<00:01:03.329> and

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
screw that would give it more gas and

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.370 
screw that would give it more gas and
the<00:01:05.309> high<00:01:05.460> speed<00:01:05.519> may<00:01:05.970> help<00:01:06.210> adjust<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.260> at

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
the high speed may help adjust it at

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.280 
the high speed may help adjust it at
high<00:01:07.530> speeds<00:01:08.010> now<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.299> tell<00:01:09.540> how<00:01:09.689> many<00:01:09.750> turns

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
high speeds now to tell how many turns

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.899 
high speeds now to tell how many turns
you've<00:01:10.500> got<00:01:10.650> out<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:11.070> screw<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.670> screw

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
you've got out you screw in the screw

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.810 
you've got out you screw in the screw
right<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.540> end<00:01:12.890> don't<00:01:13.890> over<00:01:14.130> tighten<00:01:14.369> when

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
right to the end don't over tighten when

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.499 
right to the end don't over tighten when
it<00:01:14.939> stops<00:01:15.240> stop<00:01:15.659> then<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.350> count<00:01:17.060> half<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.270> turn

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
it stops stop then you count half a turn

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.980 
it stops stop then you count half a turn
one<00:01:19.320> turn<00:01:19.880> one<00:01:20.880> turn<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.360> half<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.840> then<00:01:21.960> a

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
one turn one turn and a half and then a

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.899 
one turn one turn and a half and then a
quarter<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:23.090> then<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.360> do<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.659> same<00:01:24.900> here<00:01:25.909> so

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
quarter and then you do the same here so

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.880 
quarter and then you do the same here so
one<00:01:27.630> half<00:01:28.640> one<00:01:29.640> turn<00:01:29.909> one<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.140> half<00:01:31.350> I'm

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
one half one turn one and a half I'm

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.990 
one half one turn one and a half I'm
going<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.100> leave<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.400> like<00:01:32.610> that

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
going to leave it like that

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.870 
going to leave it like that
and<00:01:33.170> then<00:01:34.170> when<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.380> saw<00:01:34.590> runs<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.579> cannot<00:01:35.820> I

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
and then when the saw runs you cannot I

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.810 
and then when the saw runs you cannot I
can<00:01:36.210> always<00:01:36.329> go<00:01:36.540> back<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.990> fine<00:01:37.290> tune<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.820> by

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
can always go back and fine tune it by

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.719 
can always go back and fine tune it by
holding<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.210> throttle<00:01:39.509> down<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.579> revving<00:01:41.579> it

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
holding the throttle down and revving it

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.160 
holding the throttle down and revving it
and<00:01:41.850> turning<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.240> screws<00:01:42.509> at<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.750> same<00:01:42.960> time

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
and turning the screws at the same time

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.170 
and turning the screws at the same time
so<00:01:43.829> I'm<00:01:43.890> going<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.100> put<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.430> carburetor<00:01:44.939> back

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
so I'm going to put the carburetor back

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.770 
so I'm going to put the carburetor back
on<00:01:46.070> now<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.640> first<00:01:47.909> thing<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.210> want<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.450> do<00:01:48.630> is

on now the first thing you want to do is
hook<00:01:48.899> up<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.290> fuel<00:01:49.470> lines<00:01:50.119> now<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.390> one

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
hook up the fuel lines now on this one

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.240 
hook up the fuel lines now on this one
the<00:01:53.369> tiny<00:01:53.729> fuel<00:01:54.360> line<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:55.530> goes<00:01:55.710> into<00:01:56.130> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
the tiny fuel line that goes into the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.420 
the tiny fuel line that goes into the
fuel<00:01:56.490> tank<00:01:56.579> goes<00:01:57.149> on<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.719> top

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.020 

and<00:02:02.470> then<00:02:03.470> there's<00:02:03.710> one<00:02:03.980> other<00:02:04.010> fuel<00:02:04.520> line<00:02:04.760> on

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
and then there's one other fuel line on

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.990 
and then there's one other fuel line on
this<00:02:05.300> particular<00:02:05.990> model<00:02:06.260> of<00:02:06.530> chainsaw<00:02:07.070> and<00:02:07.310> it

this particular model of chainsaw and it

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.120 
this particular model of chainsaw and it
will<00:02:08.180> go<00:02:08.360> into<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:09.110> bottom<00:02:09.470> screw<00:02:09.770> make<00:02:09.979> sure

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
will go into the bottom screw make sure

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.000 
will go into the bottom screw make sure
that<00:02:10.280> the<00:02:10.430> fuel<00:02:10.700> lines<00:02:10.910> pretty<00:02:11.240> snug<00:02:11.690> there

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
that the fuel lines pretty snug there

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.400 
that the fuel lines pretty snug there
because<00:02:13.010> it<00:02:13.160> can<00:02:13.190> actually<00:02:13.720> suck<00:02:14.720> in<00:02:14.930> sameer

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
because it can actually suck in sameer

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.340 
because it can actually suck in sameer
it's<00:02:15.650> a<00:02:15.800> bit<00:02:15.950> loose<00:02:16.720> so<00:02:17.720> what<00:02:17.900> I'm<00:02:17.960> going<00:02:18.140> to<00:02:18.170> do

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
it's a bit loose so what I'm going to do

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.790 
it's a bit loose so what I'm going to do
is<00:02:18.470> with<00:02:18.680> a<00:02:18.710> pair<00:02:19.040> of<00:02:19.070> snips<00:02:19.780> is<00:02:20.780> just<00:02:21.110> snip<00:02:21.440> a

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
is with a pair of snips is just snip a

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.960 
is with a pair of snips is just snip a
bit<00:02:22.430> off<00:02:22.700> of<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:23.180> fuel<00:02:23.540> line<00:02:24.790> make<00:02:25.790> sure

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
bit off of the fuel line make sure

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:26.590 
bit off of the fuel line make sure
you're<00:02:26.120> lying

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
you're lying

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.590 
you're lying
you've<00:02:26.720> got<00:02:27.020> enough<00:02:27.260> line<00:02:27.500> to<00:02:27.650> do<00:02:27.800> that<00:02:28.010> and

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
you've got enough line to do that and

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.700 
you've got enough line to do that and
usually<00:02:29.600> what<00:02:29.690> this<00:02:29.870> does<00:02:30.080> is<00:02:30.290> that<00:02:30.410> will<00:02:30.530> go

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
usually what this does is that will go

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.390 
usually what this does is that will go
on<00:02:30.740> tighter<00:02:31.340> because<00:02:31.880> it's<00:02:32.300> a<00:02:32.450> fresh<00:02:33.250> area<00:02:34.250> of

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
on tighter because it's a fresh area of

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.070 
on tighter because it's a fresh area of
the<00:02:34.520> fuel<00:02:34.790> line<00:02:36.070> now<00:02:37.070> you<00:02:37.490> want<00:02:37.670> to<00:02:37.760> hook<00:02:37.910> back

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
the fuel line now you want to hook back

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:44.230 
the fuel line now you want to hook back
the<00:02:39.080> throttle<00:02:40.180> linkage<00:02:41.180> on<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.780> saw<00:02:43.060> also<00:02:44.060> one

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
the throttle linkage on the saw also one

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.180 
the throttle linkage on the saw also one
thing<00:02:44.600> before<00:02:44.810> I<00:02:45.080> continue<00:02:45.440> you<00:02:45.830> want<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.070> make

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
thing before I continue you want to make

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.610 
thing before I continue you want to make
sure<00:02:46.220> this<00:02:46.550> gasket<00:02:46.850> here<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.810> intake<00:02:48.200> gasket

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
sure this gasket here the intake gasket

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.060 
sure this gasket here the intake gasket
is<00:02:48.709> in<00:02:48.890> good<00:02:49.070> condition<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:50.720> if<00:02:51.440> it<00:02:51.590> is<00:02:51.740> just

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
is in good condition and if it is just

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.580 
is in good condition and if it is just
continue<00:02:52.850> now<00:02:53.630> with<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.050> throttle<00:02:54.440> linkage

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
continue now with the throttle linkage

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.990 
continue now with the throttle linkage
you<00:02:55.190> just<00:02:56.110> move<00:02:57.110> the<00:02:57.140> carburetor<00:02:57.890> until<00:02:58.850> you

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
you just move the carburetor until you

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.080 
you just move the carburetor until you
get<00:02:59.209> it<00:02:59.360> in<00:02:59.510> and<00:03:00.040> then<00:03:01.040> move<00:03:01.310> it<00:03:01.490> like<00:03:01.670> that<00:03:01.820> so

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
get it in and then move it like that so

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.110 
get it in and then move it like that so
now<00:03:02.270> it's<00:03:02.300> in<00:03:02.890> I'm<00:03:03.890> just<00:03:03.980> going<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.430> slide<00:03:04.850> the

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
now it's in I'm just going to slide the

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.500 
now it's in I'm just going to slide the
carburetor<00:03:05.630> back<00:03:05.900> on<00:03:06.170> to<00:03:06.500> the<00:03:06.680> bolts<00:03:07.510> make

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
carburetor back on to the bolts make

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.850 
carburetor back on to the bolts make
sure<00:03:08.720> your<00:03:08.900> fuel<00:03:09.230> line<00:03:09.320> is<00:03:09.830> not<00:03:10.040> caught<00:03:10.400> behind

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
sure your fuel line is not caught behind

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.530 
sure your fuel line is not caught behind
behind<00:03:12.860> the<00:03:13.190> carburetor<00:03:13.670> and<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:14.000> manifold

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
behind the carburetor and the manifold

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.030 
behind the carburetor and the manifold
you<00:03:14.930> want<00:03:15.080> to<00:03:15.170> make<00:03:15.290> sure<00:03:15.440> that<00:03:15.590> that's<00:03:15.739> all

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
you want to make sure that that's all

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.880 
you want to make sure that that's all
clear<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:16.489> then<00:03:17.480> just<00:03:17.780> slide<00:03:18.050> the<00:03:18.290> carburetor

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
clear and then just slide the carburetor

on<00:03:19.190> to<00:03:19.910> the<00:03:20.030> bolts<00:03:24.250> so<00:03:25.250> there<00:03:25.489> it's<00:03:25.640> going<00:03:25.820> in

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
on to the bolts so there it's going in

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.460 
on to the bolts so there it's going in
it's<00:03:28.459> going<00:03:28.700> to<00:03:28.790> sit<00:03:29.030> loose<00:03:29.239> like<00:03:29.450> that<00:03:29.480> until

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
it's going to sit loose like that until

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.979 
it's going to sit loose like that until
you've<00:03:30.620> got<00:03:30.800> it<00:03:30.950> all<00:03:31.070> tightened<00:03:31.550> up<00:03:31.989> next

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
you've got it all tightened up next

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.540 
you've got it all tightened up next
thing<00:03:33.200> is<00:03:33.410> you<00:03:33.560> want<00:03:33.590> to<00:03:33.830> put<00:03:34.010> in<00:03:34.130> the<00:03:34.250> choke

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550 
thing is you want to put in the choke

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.550 
thing is you want to put in the choke
lever<00:03:34.580> and<00:03:35.120> that's<00:03:35.239> fairly<00:03:35.600> simple<00:03:35.900> you<00:03:36.320> just

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
lever and that's fairly simple you just

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.820 
lever and that's fairly simple you just
match<00:03:36.950> up<00:03:36.980> the<00:03:37.310> two<00:03:38.080> the<00:03:39.080> two<00:03:39.110> mechanisms

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
match up the two the two mechanisms

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.970 
match up the two the two mechanisms
together<00:03:40.610> and<00:03:40.940> then<00:03:41.540> push<00:03:42.140> and<00:03:42.410> you're<00:03:42.830> going

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
together and then push and you're going

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.050 
together and then push and you're going
to<00:03:43.010> feel<00:03:43.310> it<00:03:43.630> clip<00:03:44.630> back<00:03:44.780> in<00:03:45.049> there<00:03:45.820> next<00:03:46.820> thing

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
to feel it clip back in there next thing

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.900 
to feel it clip back in there next thing
is<00:03:47.299> to<00:03:47.360> put<00:03:47.750> back<00:03:48.110> the<00:03:48.830> air<00:03:48.980> breather<00:03:49.400> before

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
is to put back the air breather before

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.370 
is to put back the air breather before
you<00:03:50.239> do<00:03:50.420> that<00:03:50.600> you<00:03:50.720> want<00:03:50.840> to<00:03:50.959> make<00:03:51.110> sure<00:03:51.260> the

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
you do that you want to make sure the

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.020 
you do that you want to make sure the
throttle<00:03:51.830> is<00:03:51.890> working<00:03:52.250> so<00:03:52.459> just<00:03:52.700> hold<00:03:52.910> the

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
throttle is working so just hold the

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.170 
throttle is working so just hold the
carburetor<00:03:53.540> and<00:03:53.920> try<00:03:54.920> you<00:03:55.489> can<00:03:55.640> see<00:03:55.820> that<00:03:56.000> it

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
carburetor and try you can see that it

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.050 
carburetor and try you can see that it
works<00:03:56.390> on<00:03:56.660> the<00:03:57.019> left<00:03:57.230> there<00:03:57.580> next<00:03:58.580> thing<00:03:58.760> is<00:03:59.030> to

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
works on the left there next thing is to

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.120 
works on the left there next thing is to
put<00:03:59.239> this<00:03:59.660> back<00:03:59.930> on<00:04:01.540> just<00:04:02.540> like<00:04:02.750> that<00:04:02.780> and<00:04:03.230> then

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
put this back on just like that and then

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.930 
put this back on just like that and then
you<00:04:04.340> grab<00:04:04.700> your<00:04:04.910> two<00:04:05.090> 5/16<00:04:05.959> nuts

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
you grab your two 5/16 nuts

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.790 
you grab your two 5/16 nuts
put<00:04:08.330> those<00:04:08.540> on<00:04:08.930> and<00:04:10.930> tighten<00:04:11.930> these<00:04:12.200> fairly

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
put those on and tighten these fairly

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.130 
put those on and tighten these fairly
tight<00:04:13.190> not<00:04:13.550> overly<00:04:13.910> tight<00:04:14.150> again<00:04:14.420> but<00:04:14.720> just

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
tight not overly tight again but just

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.660 
tight not overly tight again but just
fairly<00:04:15.440> tight<00:04:15.770> because<00:04:16.040> there's<00:04:16.250> a<00:04:16.310> lot<00:04:16.519> of

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
fairly tight because there's a lot of

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:25.840 
fairly tight because there's a lot of
vibrations<00:04:17.299> you<00:04:23.620> want<00:04:24.620> to<00:04:24.770> tighten<00:04:25.460> them<00:04:25.610> as

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
vibrations you want to tighten them as

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.210 
vibrations you want to tighten them as
you<00:04:26.300> go<00:04:26.330> on<00:04:26.750> each<00:04:26.990> side<00:04:27.320> you<00:04:27.620> don't<00:04:28.010> want<00:04:28.130> to

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
tighten one really really tight on one

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.140 
tighten one really really tight on one
side<00:04:30.080> and<00:04:30.350> then<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:30.590> other<00:04:30.680> side<00:04:30.950> so<00:04:31.850> just

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
side and then the other side so just

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:38.650 
side and then the other side so just
kind<00:04:32.390> of<00:04:33.010> rotate<00:04:34.010> between<00:04:34.220> the<00:04:34.550> two<00:04:37.390> then<00:04:38.390> put

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
kind of rotate between the two then put

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.280 
kind of rotate between the two then put
your<00:04:38.840> air<00:04:39.050> breather<00:04:39.440> back<00:04:39.740> on<00:04:40.040> if<00:04:40.720> you're<00:04:41.720> just

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
your air breather back on if you're just

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.870 
your air breather back on if you're just
going<00:04:42.440> to<00:04:42.530> start<00:04:42.800> it<00:04:42.920> and<00:04:43.040> stop<00:04:43.130> it<00:04:43.580> you<00:04:43.700> can

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
going to start it and stop it you can

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.780 
going to start it and stop it you can
run<00:04:44.060> it<00:04:44.210> without<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:44.660> black<00:04:44.900> cover<00:04:45.700> but<00:04:46.700> if

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
run it without the black cover but if

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.010 
run it without the black cover but if
you're<00:04:46.940> going<00:04:47.060> to<00:04:47.180> run<00:04:47.300> out<00:04:47.450> a<00:04:47.480> long<00:04:47.720> time<00:04:47.990> I

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
you're going to run out a long time I

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.750 
you're going to run out a long time I
suggest<00:04:48.530> you<00:04:48.680> put<00:04:48.890> the<00:04:49.010> black<00:04:49.280> cover<00:04:49.550> on

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
suggest you put the black cover on

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.060 
suggest you put the black cover on
because<00:04:50.150> it<00:04:50.330> actually<00:04:50.500> helps<00:04:51.500> to<00:04:51.560> pull<00:04:51.860> the

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
because it actually helps to pull the

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:56.230 
because it actually helps to pull the
engine<00:04:52.160> down<00:04:52.600> with<00:04:53.600> the<00:04:53.720> fan<00:04:53.960> spinning<00:04:54.940> so<00:04:55.940> I'm

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
engine down with the fan spinning so I'm

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.570 
engine down with the fan spinning so I'm
going<00:04:56.420> to<00:04:56.480> put<00:04:56.660> it<00:04:56.780> back<00:04:56.930> on<00:04:57.230> anyways<00:04:57.710> there<00:04:58.490> we

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
going to put it back on anyways there we

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.420 
going to put it back on anyways there we
go<00:04:58.730> and<00:04:58.910> I<00:04:59.240> can<00:04:59.390> always<00:04:59.690> adjust<00:05:00.650> my<00:05:01.040> carburetor

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
go and I can always adjust my carburetor

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:08.530 
go and I can always adjust my carburetor
from<00:05:01.850> the<00:05:02.030> two<00:05:02.180> holes<00:05:02.390> here<00:05:02.510> so<00:05:07.300> the<00:05:08.300> slaw<00:05:08.510> is

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
from the two holes here so the slaw is

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.430 
from the two holes here so the slaw is
ready<00:05:08.870> to<00:05:09.050> go

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
ready to go

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.680 
ready to go
I<00:05:09.470> may<00:05:10.070> have<00:05:10.220> to<00:05:10.400> adjust<00:05:10.580> the<00:05:10.820> carburetor<00:05:11.060> with

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
I may have to adjust the carburetor with

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.990 
I may have to adjust the carburetor with
the<00:05:11.810> screws<00:05:12.200> down<00:05:12.230> here<00:05:12.830> once<00:05:13.580> you've<00:05:13.760> done

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
the screws down here once you've done

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.140 
the screws down here once you've done
that<00:05:14.060> if<00:05:15.050> you<00:05:15.200> don't<00:05:15.380> want<00:05:15.590> it<00:05:15.740> to<00:05:16.040> undo<00:05:16.670> itself

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
that if you don't want it to undo itself

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.420 
that if you don't want it to undo itself
the<00:05:17.390> timing<00:05:17.840> you<00:05:18.200> can<00:05:18.230> take<00:05:18.890> the<00:05:19.010> black<00:05:19.220> cover

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
the timing you can take the black cover

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.970 
the timing you can take the black cover
off<00:05:19.670> and<00:05:19.700> put<00:05:20.180> these<00:05:20.360> back<00:05:20.630> on

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:20.980 
off and put these back on

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.590 
off and put these back on
just<00:05:21.980> to<00:05:22.100> retain<00:05:22.460> the<00:05:22.640> screws<00:05:22.910> there<00:05:23.150> for

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
just to retain the screws there for

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:33.170 
just to retain the screws there for
moving<00:05:23.810> again

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:58.700 

it<00:05:34.180> stops<00:05:34.540> just<00:05:34.930> prime<00:05:35.290> it<00:05:35.470> again

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.040 

this<00:05:59.710> one's<00:05:59.980> running<00:06:00.280> a<00:06:00.490> bit<00:06:00.670> lean<00:06:00.910> so<00:06:01.900> I'm

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
this one's running a bit lean so I'm

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.850 
this one's running a bit lean so I'm
going<00:06:02.350> to<00:06:02.380> open<00:06:03.010> up<00:06:03.190> the<00:06:03.400> low<00:06:03.580> screw<00:06:04.030> on<00:06:04.210> it

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
going to open up the low screw on it

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.180 
going to open up the low screw on it
just<00:06:05.860> to<00:06:06.010> give<00:06:06.310> it<00:06:06.400> a<00:06:06.490> bit<00:06:06.670> more<00:06:06.700> fuel
