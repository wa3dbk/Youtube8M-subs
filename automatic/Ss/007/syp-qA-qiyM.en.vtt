what we're seeing behind me which is the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.600 
what we're seeing behind me which is the
PET<00:01:19.520> CT<00:01:19.790> scanner<00:01:20.360> this<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:20.899> only<00:01:21.250> pet<00:01:22.250> CT

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.649 

I<00:01:31.890> think<00:01:32.890> what<00:01:33.039> differentiates<00:01:33.819> us<00:01:34.030> is<00:01:34.270> that

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
I think what differentiates us is that

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.480 
I think what differentiates us is that
what<00:01:34.869> we<00:01:35.020> care<00:01:35.259> about<00:01:35.289> a<00:01:35.499> children<00:01:35.979> so<00:01:36.310> we

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
what we care about a children so we

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.029 
what we care about a children so we
