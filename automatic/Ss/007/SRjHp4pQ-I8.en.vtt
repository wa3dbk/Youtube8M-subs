yeah<00:01:55.790> the<00:01:56.790> edge<00:01:56.969> right<00:01:57.299> out<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.450> box

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
yeah the edge right out of box

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.370 
yeah the edge right out of box
it<00:01:58.560> had<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:59.040> burr<00:01:59.369> on<00:01:59.880> one<00:02:00.090> side<00:02:00.360> but<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:01.020> ran<00:02:01.259> it

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
it had a burr on one side but I ran it

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.130 
it had a burr on one side but I ran it
across<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:02.060> sharpening<00:02:03.060> stone<00:02:03.270> once<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:04.049> know

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
across a sharpening stone once you know

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.530 
across a sharpening stone once you know
just<00:02:04.350> one<00:02:05.250> pass<00:02:05.490> just<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.000> knock<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.360> burr

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
just one pass just to knock that burr

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.690 
just one pass just to knock that burr
off<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.079> then<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.259> got<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:07.799> off<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:08.250> cuts<00:02:08.610> a

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
off and then I got it off so it cuts a

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.850 
off and then I got it off so it cuts a
little<00:02:08.910> bit<00:02:09.000> better<00:02:09.119> now<00:02:09.330> but<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.709> know<00:02:10.830> I

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
little bit better now but you know I

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.380 
little bit better now but you know I
don't<00:02:11.129> consider<00:02:11.430> that

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
don't consider that

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.670 
don't consider that
that's<00:02:13.390> it's<00:02:13.630> literally<00:02:13.870> one<00:02:14.140> pass<00:02:14.350> on<00:02:14.650> a

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
that's it's literally one pass on a

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.640 
that's it's literally one pass on a
course<00:02:15.100> stone<00:02:15.630> but<00:02:16.630> uh<00:02:16.660> yeah<00:02:17.290> I'm<00:02:17.500> gonna

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
course stone but uh yeah I'm gonna

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.920 
course stone but uh yeah I'm gonna
sharpen<00:02:17.950> this<00:02:18.100> up<00:02:18.280> on<00:02:18.490> probably<00:02:19.390> a<00:02:19.450> Lansky

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
sharpen this up on probably a Lansky

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.670 
sharpen this up on probably a Lansky
system<00:02:20.440> I<00:02:20.530> have<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:21.220> it'll<00:02:21.810> it'll<00:02:22.810> be<00:02:23.230> awesome

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
system I have and it'll it'll be awesome

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.040 
system I have and it'll it'll be awesome
because<00:02:24.130> this<00:02:24.730> is<00:02:24.850> a<00:02:24.880> very<00:02:25.060> soft<00:02:25.360> steel<00:02:25.750> and

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
because this is a very soft steel and

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.900 
because this is a very soft steel and
it's<00:02:26.620> gonna<00:02:26.710> take<00:02:26.920> an<00:02:27.040> edge<00:02:27.160> really<00:02:27.400> well<00:02:27.490> and

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
it's gonna take an edge really well and

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.610 
it's gonna take an edge really well and
for<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.660> stuff<00:02:28.810> that<00:02:28.930> I'm<00:02:29.020> gonna<00:02:29.170> be<00:02:29.260> using<00:02:29.530> it

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
for the stuff that I'm gonna be using it

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.460 
for the stuff that I'm gonna be using it
for<00:02:29.650> it<00:02:29.980> probably<00:02:30.280> won't<00:02:30.700> dull<00:02:30.970> too<00:02:31.960> too<00:02:32.170> quick

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
for it probably won't dull too too quick

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.290 
for it probably won't dull too too quick
but<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:32.860> mean<00:02:33.070> like<00:02:33.490> I<00:02:33.580> said<00:02:33.760> it<00:02:33.850> is<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:34.000> soft

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
but I mean like I said it is a soft

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.220 
but I mean like I said it is a soft
steel<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:35.140> will<00:02:35.320> dull<00:02:36.250> pretty<00:02:36.670> quick

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
steel it will dull pretty quick

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.410 
steel it will dull pretty quick
I<00:02:38.260> like<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.010> brass<00:02:39.220> liners<00:02:39.670> on<00:02:39.790> it<00:02:39.940> I<00:02:40.090> think

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
I like the brass liners on it I think

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.790 
I like the brass liners on it I think
that<00:02:40.450> makes<00:02:40.750> for<00:02:40.930> a<00:02:40.960> smoother<00:02:41.290> opening<00:02:41.650> I

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
that makes for a smoother opening I

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.220 
that makes for a smoother opening I
don't<00:02:42.040> know<00:02:42.190> for<00:02:42.370> sure<00:02:42.400> but<00:02:42.730> I<00:02:42.820> know<00:02:42.880> that

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
don't know for sure but I know that

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.220 
don't know for sure but I know that
brass<00:02:44.230> is<00:02:44.470> a<00:02:44.530> pretty<00:02:44.860> slick<00:02:46.110> material<00:02:47.110> when

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
brass is a pretty slick material when

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.840 
brass is a pretty slick material when
used<00:02:47.410> for<00:02:47.530> threads<00:02:47.920> so<00:02:48.280> I<00:02:48.310> don't<00:02:48.490> know<00:02:48.580> if<00:02:48.670> that

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
used for threads so I don't know if that

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.260 
used for threads so I don't know if that
um<00:02:49.060> carries<00:02:49.810> over<00:02:50.080> for<00:02:50.320> pivots<00:02:50.860> at<00:02:51.130> all<00:02:51.310> but

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
um carries over for pivots at all but

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.080 
um carries over for pivots at all but
yeah<00:02:52.740> we'll<00:02:53.740> see<00:02:53.860> how<00:02:53.890> that<00:02:54.010> works<00:02:54.130> out<00:02:54.310> it<00:02:54.910> is

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
yeah we'll see how that works out it is

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.850 
yeah we'll see how that works out it is
working<00:02:55.450> in<00:02:55.570> 2d<00:02:55.690> a<00:02:55.810> lot<00:02:56.020> smoother<00:02:56.470> of<00:02:56.650> an

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
working in 2d a lot smoother of an

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.140 
working in 2d a lot smoother of an
opening<00:02:57.190> at<00:02:57.340> first<00:02:57.550> it<00:02:57.640> was<00:02:57.730> a<00:02:57.760> little<00:02:57.820> rough

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
opening at first it was a little rough

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.900 
opening at first it was a little rough
but<00:02:58.180> um<00:02:58.600> now<00:02:59.350> I've<00:02:59.890> opened<00:03:00.040> it<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.459> bunch<00:03:00.760> of

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
but um now I've opened it a bunch of

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.220 
but um now I've opened it a bunch of
times<00:03:01.020> it's<00:03:02.020> uh<00:03:02.320> it's<00:03:02.950> pretty<00:03:03.100> sturdy<00:03:04.080> see<00:03:05.080> the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
times it's uh it's pretty sturdy see the

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.900 
times it's uh it's pretty sturdy see the
only<00:03:05.350> real<00:03:05.590> complaint<00:03:05.800> I<00:03:06.010> had<00:03:06.160> about<00:03:06.550> this<00:03:06.730> so

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
only real complaint I had about this so

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.160 
only real complaint I had about this so
far<00:03:07.090> was<00:03:07.270> the<00:03:07.300> the<00:03:07.900> burr<00:03:08.050> on<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.410> edge<00:03:08.880> and

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
far was the the burr on the edge and

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.570 
far was the the burr on the edge and
when<00:03:11.170> I<00:03:11.200> first<00:03:11.440> got<00:03:11.650> it<00:03:11.800> I<00:03:11.860> thought<00:03:12.130> this<00:03:12.370> was

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
when I first got it I thought this was

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.610 
when I first got it I thought this was
like<00:03:12.610> kind<00:03:12.790> of<00:03:12.970> a<00:03:13.060> mistake<00:03:13.390> but<00:03:14.290> it<00:03:14.440> makes

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
like kind of a mistake but it makes

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.140 
like kind of a mistake but it makes
sense<00:03:14.800> to<00:03:15.010> me<00:03:15.100> now<00:03:15.310> that<00:03:15.490> I<00:03:15.670> thought<00:03:15.850> about<00:03:15.970> it

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
sense to me now that I thought about it

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.740 
sense to me now that I thought about it
as<00:03:16.239> you<00:03:16.360> can<00:03:16.450> see<00:03:16.660> right<00:03:16.870> here<00:03:16.930> is<00:03:18.000> now<00:03:19.000> crowned

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
as you can see right here is now crowned

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.360 
as you can see right here is now crowned
or<00:03:20.050> chamfered<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.650> little<00:03:20.920> bit<00:03:21.010> more<00:03:21.160> than<00:03:21.310> the

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
or chamfered a little bit more than the

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.310 
or chamfered a little bit more than the
other<00:03:21.489> side<00:03:21.670> but<00:03:22.300> what<00:03:22.420> I<00:03:22.480> think<00:03:22.570> that<00:03:22.900> is<00:03:23.050> is

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
other side but what I think that is is

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.320 
other side but what I think that is is
uh<00:03:23.640> because<00:03:24.640> most<00:03:24.820> people<00:03:25.060> are<00:03:25.150> right-handed

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
uh because most people are right-handed

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.130 
uh because most people are right-handed
their<00:03:26.260> pinky<00:03:26.650> or<00:03:27.010> their<00:03:27.250> hand<00:03:27.430> kind<00:03:27.760> of<00:03:28.140> needs

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
their pinky or their hand kind of needs

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.370 
their pinky or their hand kind of needs
that<00:03:29.350> more<00:03:30.010> of<00:03:30.100> a<00:03:30.690> chamfering<00:03:31.690> on<00:03:31.989> that<00:03:32.170> side

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
that more of a chamfering on that side

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.570 
that more of a chamfering on that side
for<00:03:32.410> it<00:03:32.650> to<00:03:32.709> be<00:03:32.800> more<00:03:32.920> comfortable<00:03:33.250> and<00:03:33.459> it

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
for it to be more comfortable and it

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.009 
for it to be more comfortable and it
definitely<00:03:34.090> is<00:03:34.150> a<00:03:34.209> very<00:03:34.420> comfortable<00:03:34.780> knife

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
definitely is a very comfortable knife

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.449 
definitely is a very comfortable knife
this<00:03:35.860> handle

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
this handle

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.180 
this handle
it's<00:03:36.790> pretty<00:03:37.060> simple<00:03:37.360> but<00:03:37.420> it's<00:03:37.600> very<00:03:38.190> very

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
it's pretty simple but it's very very

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
would be and it's definitely it's so

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:33.730 
would be and it's definitely it's so
much<00:04:32.840> bigger<00:04:32.990> than<00:04:33.230> I<00:04:33.290> thought<00:04:33.410> it<00:04:33.470> would<00:04:33.620> be

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
much bigger than I thought it would be

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.040

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:04.320 
pretty cool I'm sure I could actually

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.390
