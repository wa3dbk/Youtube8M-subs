 today 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.900
 in this case 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.220
 this series called tuto kraft where 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.590
 is going to make different constructions 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.869
 for the benefit of you and in this 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.910
 I'll teach him how to give ovens 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.070
 automatic and that consists these ovens 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.529
 consists of the materials being 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.000
 place inside the oven 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:36.070
 automatically 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.890
 up here the minerals are placed 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.900
 meals or what you want to cook in 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.630
 this side you put the coals in both 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.460
 chests these coals go to the hoppers 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.850
 come here is all accumulated in the 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.650
 hoppers and in the hoppers that furnace goes 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.410
 happening automatically as it 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.559
 spend one in train for example we take out 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.809
 this and they see that it starts to fill only 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.520
 and if we get this gold and what 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:04.100
 we have here 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.460
 start to pass for here 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.030
 and here it happens here 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.430
 that's what the short atoll consists of already 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.830
 which is cooked passes directly out 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.600
 as you can see as it goes 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.229
 cooking one goes directly to the 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.050
 another and so on is like for you 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.580
 well organized our furnace so 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.550
 go to work we will teach us

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.900
 must be active vaughn 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.940

 oven we are going to put more hoppers one here 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.560
 another here 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:04.230
 since they go well up here more 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.690
 hoppers so it's more we're all going to put 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.820
 one a chest another that offers another the 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.530
 teacher and another com and there would already be 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:15.650
 finished our automatic oven 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.180
 and then here we are going to expose to almost 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.950
 put the minerals I'm going to put everything 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.840
 to make my meat and meat is 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.660
 meat will go to the hopper directly 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.150
 Here coal charcoals are put 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.860
 coal here more coal is put in coal

 start cooking and when I finished 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.380
 cooking will happen directly to this 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.150
 I bought 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.600
 to technical separatists in those 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.330
 terms had been happening directly and it's 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.790
 too simple as making them a 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.500
 thing is this thing this tutorial I have not 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.510
 I do not know if they have already done so in 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.040
 youtube towards I was watching that tuto 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.490
 graph asia and it occurred to me to do this 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.350
 that since I found it very interesting 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.760
 do it I did not see it anywhere because 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.810
 I did not look for it directly it makes it 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.270
 there is a coincidence with others 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.560
 tutorials please do not tell them 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.850
 the cars because I do not something punishable 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.560
 because yesterday I was inventing 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.320
 practically trying to look for some 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.060
