was<00:02:18.020> when<00:02:18.500> i<00:02:18.530> reviewed<00:02:18.819> godzilla<00:02:19.819> 2000<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:20.630> he

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
was when i reviewed godzilla 2000 and he

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.550 
was when i reviewed godzilla 2000 and he
just<00:02:21.860> delivered

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
just delivered

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.710 
just delivered
he<00:02:22.620> walked<00:02:23.220> right<00:02:23.520> into<00:02:23.670> orgas<00:02:24.120> mouth<00:02:24.330> and

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
he walked right into orgas mouth and

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.420 
he walked right into orgas mouth and
there<00:02:25.380> was<00:02:25.500> something<00:02:25.739> about<00:02:25.980> that<00:02:26.190> scene

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
there was something about that scene

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.300 
there was something about that scene
that<00:02:26.640> just<00:02:26.880> not<00:02:27.360> look<00:02:27.599> appropriate<00:02:28.200> but<00:02:29.010> that

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
that just not look appropriate but that

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.140 
that just not look appropriate but that
was<00:02:29.459> more<00:02:29.580> recent<00:02:30.030> one<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.330> think<00:02:30.690> my<00:02:31.020> all-time

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
was more recent one I think my all-time

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
probably Godzilla 84 when he when he

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.100 
probably Godzilla 84 when he when he
went<00:02:38.640> when<00:02:38.880> he<00:02:38.910> fell<00:02:39.180> into<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.450> volcano<00:02:39.540> I<00:02:39.900> was

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
because prior to that every Godzilla

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.180 
because prior to that every Godzilla
movie<00:02:47.190> he's<00:02:47.340> been<00:02:47.519> almost<00:02:47.640> invincible<00:02:48.060> and

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
movie he's been almost invincible and

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.009 
movie he's been almost invincible and
you<00:02:50.190> know<00:02:50.310> even<00:02:50.550> though<00:02:50.849> in<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.060> 54<00:02:51.660> movie

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
you know even though in the 54 movie

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.590 
you know even though in the 54 movie
which<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.349> had<00:02:52.500> seen<00:02:52.739> at<00:02:52.920> that<00:02:53.069> point<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:54.060> see

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
him turn into bones at the end because I

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.259

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.460 
Godzilla movies from the last time I saw
85<00:03:53.220> to<00:03:53.459> that<00:03:53.609> point<00:03:53.900> so<00:03:54.900> I<00:03:54.930> thought<00:03:55.170> that<00:03:55.230> was

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
85 to that point so I thought that was

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.979 
85 to that point so I thought that was
it<00:03:55.620> I<00:03:55.859> thought<00:03:56.250> he<00:03:56.400> really<00:03:56.519> died<00:03:56.880> and<00:03:57.239> it's

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
it I thought he really died and it's

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.830 
it I thought he really died and it's
funny<00:03:58.319> because<00:03:58.790> there<00:03:59.790> was<00:04:00.000> no<00:04:00.209> new<00:04:00.450> Godzilla

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
funny because there was no new Godzilla

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.550 
funny because there was no new Godzilla
movie<00:04:00.870> and<00:04:01.680> so<00:04:01.799> 89<00:04:02.600> but<00:04:03.600> in<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.840> United<00:04:04.230> States

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
movie and so 89 but in the United States

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.830 
movie and so 89 but in the United States
I<00:04:04.859> didn't<00:04:05.310> see<00:04:05.579> Godzilla<00:04:06.090> versus<00:04:06.389> biollante

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
I didn't see Godzilla versus biollante

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.940 
I didn't see Godzilla versus biollante
so<00:04:07.200> 91<00:04:08.000> so<00:04:09.000> you<00:04:09.060> figure<00:04:09.540> in<00:04:09.750> 1985<00:04:10.380> I<00:04:10.410> saw<00:04:10.739> in<00:04:10.859> the

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
so 91 so you figure in 1985 I saw in the

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.289 
so 91 so you figure in 1985 I saw in the
theaters<00:04:11.310> I<00:04:11.780> saw<00:04:12.780> it<00:04:12.840> again<00:04:12.989> in<00:04:14.090> 1987<00:04:15.090> so<00:04:15.150> I<00:04:15.180> was

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
theaters I saw it again in 1987 so I was

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.909 
theaters I saw it again in 1987 so I was
probably<00:04:15.480> about<00:04:15.630> ten<00:04:16.049> nine<00:04:16.289> or<00:04:16.470> ten<00:04:16.709> and<00:04:18.919> that

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
probably about ten nine or ten and that

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.600 
probably about ten nine or ten and that
was<00:04:20.280> between<00:04:21.150> 85<00:04:21.660> and<00:04:21.840> 87<00:04:22.410> there<00:04:23.250> were<00:04:23.340> no<00:04:23.370> guys

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
was between 85 and 87 there were no guys

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.180 
was between 85 and 87 there were no guys
in<00:04:23.789> the<00:04:23.850> movies<00:04:23.970> in<00:04:24.180> between<00:04:24.479> that<00:04:24.800> soy<00:04:25.800> 85

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
in the movies in between that soy 85

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.460 
in the movies in between that soy 85
again<00:04:26.520> and<00:04:26.789> because<00:04:27.510> it<00:04:27.660> was<00:04:27.780> such<00:04:27.960> a<00:04:27.990> long<00:04:28.110> gap

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
again and because it was such a long gap

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.550 
again and because it was such a long gap
between<00:04:28.680> movies<00:04:29.220> I<00:04:29.930> that<00:04:30.930> was<00:04:30.960> it<00:04:31.169> I<00:04:31.349> thought

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
between movies I that was it I thought

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.200 
between movies I that was it I thought
it<00:04:31.620> was<00:04:31.710> done<00:04:31.950> I<00:04:31.979> thought<00:04:32.190> it<00:04:32.310> was<00:04:32.400> over<00:04:32.640> of

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
it was done I thought it was over of

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.370 
it was done I thought it was over of
course<00:04:33.450> I<00:04:33.539> was<00:04:33.630> very<00:04:33.750> happy<00:04:33.930> to<00:04:34.080> see<00:04:34.200> him
