00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.319
 it was ok geeks and geekettes these 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.840
 furious videos I hope you have 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.950
 Well, here we go for my first track 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:16.949
 on server and rate 1.29 so I'm 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.480
 fell on a bone daring souls that I have 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.369
 hounded here late we spoke a little 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.630
 little he accepted the stalking because 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.750
 that before I had a fact that but 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.080
 who had never wanted to come and bang 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.510
 above 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.099
 So, well, I'm expecting to make some 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.420
 gomer since my stock is not yet 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.950
 is not at the level yet 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.590
 simply 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.660
 but I still wanted to test 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.820
 to and each criticism from the beginning it 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.809
 it's not cool but I see you 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.210
 I said I still wanted to 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.100
 to test a little jitters 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.120
 even though here I have a pee poo stuff 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:54.360
 prout as soon as I have level 50 I had 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.739
 want to test at the glee glee 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.559
 old versions what is it 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.930
 funny to illac the critical failure also 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.339
 good so now it's gone for 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.260
 the top of sight view placement go on there 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:12.900
 go where does it stand a little bit in phase 1 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:15.140
 I feel like I have to 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.330
 content you have no resistance 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.290
 i think i will stay at are on me 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.290
 propose another hunt 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.880
 right I understand what they me 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.490
 say what I do not have the language 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:35.680
 it does not matter it's the language of 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:39.360
 arrows that I use good I have more than 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.360
 470 views in it will be hot 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.780
 from what he 's saying there 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.869
 since it seems like a pretty trick 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:02:00.070
 repetitive enough classic where I myself 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:02:01.390
 game tackles maybe from the 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.000
 influence of beauf everything is the abyss 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.920
 everything could not touch me anymore justin 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.170
 the guy spam me in a way I know 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.780
 not exactly what he wants but the 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.410
 osamodas is very very boring what there 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:20.070
 I will be invaded by the inrocks 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:22.890
 I'm pushing like shit 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.300
 damn but what happens to him there 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.110
 what is happening to him the guy he is 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.110
 all excited there 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:42.530
 so if I get hold here is if I get 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:47.209
 qualifies if there will be only two modes that 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.340
 will be able to type me here no it remains 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.010
 still 600 points of life me it remains me 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.600
 that 225 the invocations will have been right 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.160
 from me plus the little oissel boost 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:03.430
 time when daring souls to boost 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.430
 still in the area even have it cut out 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.620
 tariket what happens to him 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.549
 what happens to him is 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.549
 completely a cable 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:26.940
 we can 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.070
 2 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.800
 I think I will add to the enemies 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:41.790
 until then the guy you pay you fart 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.790
 completely a cable 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.970
 This finish has a bonus in addition he 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.820
 I had tracked so he won 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:00.120
 four pv tone the bastard but I'm 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:02.880
 well done depop good here for the little 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.580
 video of the day of course it would have to 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.740
 I 'm going to make the cradle and that should 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.360
 to be a little bit more balanced for 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.410
 the following tracks I think I can 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.450
 still find better than the premium 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.270
 crazy hospitals but at the same time I have that 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.070
 30000 cammas I do not have much or 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.630
 is what we see it's thirty thousand 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.820
 cammas so I will try to do this 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.060
 that I can with that to try to 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.650
 to make a toad table and we 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.310
