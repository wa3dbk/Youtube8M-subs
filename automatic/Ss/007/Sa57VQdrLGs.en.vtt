00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 every driver can face 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.609
 the need to tow a car 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.770
 what needs to be considered during 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.120
 car transportation on a flexible 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.400
 coupling for smoothing jerks 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.240
 it is advisable to use a soft tow 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.800
 optimal length from 4 to 5 meters for 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.539
 during movement between 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.680
 no one tried to drive in cars 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.439
 or run across the road 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.230
 useful to tie a bright flap on a cable 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.420
 matter secure towing 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.619
 eyes tape this is your question 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.390
 accuracy of sharpness 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.610
 in order to determine into place 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.980
 tow hook sometimes need to read 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.170
 instructions before driving 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.570
 be sure to check with your partner 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.140
 route avoiding bottlenecks possible 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.809
 congestion 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.730
 and sharp turns on the car traction 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.800
 be sure to turn on the dipped headlights on 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.770
 towed car emergency 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.170
 light signaling the one who pulls no 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.390
 In no case should I hurry to touch 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.609
 places and accelerating hitch should 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.010
 as smoothly as possible car driver 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.170
 tractor must move forward 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.299
 calculate the traffic situation with 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.729
 to move whenever possible not quickly 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.080
 and evenly 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.119
 always remember that the driver 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.710
 a faulty car especially if on 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.049
 motor does not work 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.090
 to sweat and strain off 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.880
 power steering and brake booster 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.130
 makes it very difficult to control who 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.770
 sitting behind the wheel of a second car need to clearly 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.659
 follow the leader trajectory right 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.329
 foot must be constantly on 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.850
 brake pedals are important not to allow 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.009
 sagging tug need for this 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.280
 a little more intense before eating 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.590
 as if holding the truck's tail but 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.570
 the driver of the car-tractor needs a lot 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.250
 smoothly pick slack which can 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.189
 form when forced to stop 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.409
 at the intersection clear agreed 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.180
 actions of two colleagues allow without 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.070
 problems transport any 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.439
 a faulty car for any 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.939
 required distance 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:00.060
 however, this rule exists as 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.860
 at least two exceptions first car with 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.939
 automatic transmission when 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.250
 engine shut off 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.380
 can be dragged at a distance of no more than 50 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.160
 kilometers at a speed not higher than 50 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.700
 kilometers per hour 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.470
 otherwise you risk ditching the box 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.120
 second strong ice 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.520
 flexible coupling on the rules 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.520
 forbidden in either case 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.380
 better to use the services 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.340
 tow truck wish you lung and 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.470
 Bon Voyage 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.650
 unassisted only by their own 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.650
 by the course
