00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.300
 especially the coupling a delicious Paul 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.309
 and he's the same 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.570
 Substitution is now 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.760
 rescues with much understanding of a more communal 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.380
 but there are games there the footballers say they have this today 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.170
 what say the same round Rudi Völler rolls so one-sided 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.590
 the number of pictures of it 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:22.109
 Jakarta dpa 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.689
 it will certainly be 

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:14.309
 different 6 

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:18.969
 since the 8th 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:22.289
 against the previous opponent 

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:25.289
 Malta in Bremen 6 to 0 in Saarbrücken 

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:30.569
 An increase certainly compared to the last performances in Saarbrücken 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.909
 2 2 1 against Albania 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:35.149
 the German team is defending it 

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:40.969
 She clearly continues to build on the lead in Group 2 from Malta 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:43.409
 far off here is the table 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:46.159
 18 0 points the Germans now in front 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:52.239
 Portugal 6 to 4 and Sweden 14 4 like Thierse Saar 2 to 2 maybe still on 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.159
 best in the race and sometimes tender 028 the next games of the German am 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.119
 Thirtieth April in the door it is kind of in the park
