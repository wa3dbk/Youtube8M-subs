simple glitch you will need the

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.719 
simple glitch you will need the
paralyzer<00:01:44.410> and<00:01:44.649> it<00:01:44.710> will<00:01:44.860> take<00:01:45.039> a<00:01:45.100> couple<00:01:45.280> of

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
paralyzer and it will take a couple of

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.120 
paralyzer and it will take a couple of
attempts<00:01:46.240> but<00:01:46.479> is<00:01:46.720> still<00:01:47.289> fairly<00:01:47.560> easy<00:01:47.770> glitch

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
attempts but is still fairly easy glitch

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.400 
attempts but is still fairly easy glitch

on this out underneath year they will
drop<00:02:08.319> power-ups<00:02:08.800> and<00:02:09.009> you<00:02:09.670> will<00:02:09.819> be<00:02:09.970> able<00:02:10.090> to

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
drop power-ups and you will be able to

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.430 
drop power-ups and you will be able to
collect<00:02:10.539> them<00:02:10.720> all<00:02:10.899> so<00:02:11.470> I<00:02:11.680> would<00:02:12.150> advise<00:02:13.150> using

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
collect them all so I would advise using

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.740 
collect them all so I would advise using
rather<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.620> paralyzer<00:02:15.100> gun<00:02:15.459> or<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.730> ray<00:02:16.450> gun

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
rather the paralyzer gun or the ray gun

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.800 
rather the paralyzer gun or the ray gun
mark<00:02:17.290> one<00:02:17.650> due<00:02:18.100> to<00:02:18.310> this<00:02:18.520> flash<00:02:18.819> range<00:02:19.390> and<00:02:19.720> you

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
mark one due to this flash range and you

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.780 
mark one due to this flash range and you
can<00:02:20.020> kill<00:02:20.740> the<00:02:20.920> zombies<00:02:21.190> underneath<00:02:21.580> here

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
otherwise using a normal gun you're not

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.839 
otherwise using a normal gun you're not
going<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:23.740> have<00:02:23.830> to<00:02:23.950> kill<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.520> zombies
