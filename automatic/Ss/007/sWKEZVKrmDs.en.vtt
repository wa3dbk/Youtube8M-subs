00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.060
 but 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.059
 and what happens people who mister who is already 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.330
 commenting and good today I bring you the 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.380
 video of the best class for the dmr 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.390
 remember that on Tuesday I brought you the 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.009
 best class for the storm rifle but 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.410
 If you have not seen the video you can see the 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:26.020
 playlist and you can see all 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.730
 the weapons in which I have this kind of 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.860
 videos so well let's start 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.559
 so that it does not get so late and I do not 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.710
 roe upload this video good as the dmr 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:40.750
 is the weapon with the lowest rate of 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:42.040
 game although this is the weapon rather than that 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.790
 more damage does 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.620
 along with the br and then this one counts 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:52.020
 also with the highest precision of the game 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:55.960
 both near and far and therefore this 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.719
 buoys and change their loaders 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:04.140
 less than the green bullets and 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:07.060
 from the eastern light rifle but this as the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.580
 like the light rifle when you put a 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.220
 shoot what would be equivalent to three 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.750
 bullets and the br also shoots three bullets 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.909
 they basically have the same 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.340
 number of shots I hope there's 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.860
 it became clear this so good 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.810
 then let's move on to the part of the 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.070
 tactical package that you can take with 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.020
 this weapon I recommend that you carry 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.649
 shielding for confrontations to 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.440
 long distance have the possibility of 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:38.530
 let's say if you drop the shield along with 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.929
 another character can come back a little 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.310
 reload the shield faster than him and 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:47.320
 to be able to go out and try to kill him 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.159
 You can also use if you do not know if you do not 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.840
 like that 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.429
 you can use efficiency skill of 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.740
 armor so that you regenerate a lot 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.330
 faster the armor skill and 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.020
 so do not waste time since sometimes 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.909
 this weapon this leaves us like nothing 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.850
 what to defend ourselves with if we stay 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.759
 close with an enemy without bullets 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.280
 in the part of improved good before 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.590
 continue in the tactical package part 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.540
 I do not use any of the two improvements that 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.670
 I mentioned them right now in all my 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.140
 classes I use mobility and it's because I do not 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.540
 I like to be preparing when I run 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.060
 I'm from Russia and if I go running 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.650
 I do not like the monkey to stop because 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.989
 it makes you lose a lot of time I always 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.450
 I am personally mobile because 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.610
 I like it but what I consider as 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.069
 best advantages of tactical packaging 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.110
 they are shielding and effectiveness weakness of 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.959
 armor so good here I leave it to your 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.959
 criteria in the support improvement part 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.280
 I recommend dexterity because then 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.200
 as I say it is a weapon with a 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.120
 very low rate and unlike the 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.090
 kobenan carbine does not allow you to control 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.930
 it's ok you press the trigger 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.790
 but this has a maximum limit of 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.620
 bullets to shoot and if we take 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.180
 Dexterity can help us seriously 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.650
 shoot faster if ever the 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.900
 they said and you took it very 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.269
 serious and said nothing because the skill 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.730
 does not specify that fire is faster 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.680
 but really yes if you have dexterity 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.810
 you can shoot faster or it increases 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.330
 the rate of fire of 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.950
 of the weapon and well it also allows you 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.870
 recharge much faster and that is that as 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.730
 I tell them then the weapon has very few 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.610
 shots and it will also change your weapon 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:24.150
 secondary if you need support 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.400
 this in case you play is like this and you go 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.230
 carlos with enemies up close and so 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.930
 but if you have a game style more 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.400
 campero and without offending anyone 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.160
 because there are people who like it 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.860
 stay in the area and start shooting 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.840
 Well, I recommend sensor because yes 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.420
 if you are from afar and you are aiming with 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.220
 the zoom does not realize if someone 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.830
 it comes from behind and that's way more 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.019
 easy to defend yourself from the people that you 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.510
 they want to kill you in the back as soon as 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:56.069
 to the secondary weapon that considered good 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:59.760
 take with the dmr well for if you 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.260
 you feel that you are a rookie with the dmr and that 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.180
 you do not control your shots very well 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.370
 remote door I recommend you 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.819
 use the ray gun because if 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:11.069
 you go like this somewhere where there 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.540
 passageways or there sometimes to people 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.180
 no coveralls are complicated to give in the 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.320
 head with this weapon so close and 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.860
 they prefer to change 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.990
 a little more let's say with a cadence a 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.090
 slightly higher and with a lower rank 

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:26.220
 but do more damage up close and so 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.930
 there we have the ray gun that yes 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.480
 well we can use it loaded is also 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.860
 very useful to use it with a simple shot and 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.080
 which has a rate of fire very 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.199
 elevated 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.240
 but if you consider that you already have a certain 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:41.509
 skill with the dmr and you can hit 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:46.189
 shots is well in the head then 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:49.490
 you can use the magnum and if we say 

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:52.460
 choose and said here in the part of 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.889
 forgiveness package of support you did not choose 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.620
 dexterity and you chose sensor as you can 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:00.860
 use the magnum that is almost the same as 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.629
 a dmr only that with less with a little 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.270
 less damage and a little less range of 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:06.860
 shot but this will help you when 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.840
 you run out of ammunition because if not 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.500
 you bring skill because the weapon sometimes 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.000
 it takes a little longer to load and that's it 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.889
 difference between the time you take 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.199
 in loading and in the time that you take in 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:20.539
 change of weapon as it can can do 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:23.120
 that they kill you or that you kill your 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:25.699
 enemy so then if you feel that 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:31.069
 already you have a little better with the wave of 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:33.110
 m &amp; r and this you did not choose the ability to 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:35.840
 dexterity that allows you to recharge more 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.330
 fast as I personally suggest 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.870
 that you use the gun 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:44.300
 the visit to the machine but also as 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.910
 that is a weapon that you can use without maps 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.040
 very broad 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.290
 let's tell him maps where there may be 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.420
 vehicles well it's also good 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.580
 yes crazy if you control it very well is very 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.020
 well they brought a plasma gun and 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.540
 that allows you to take out the 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:01.030
 problems when a vehicle is 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:03.940
 chasing or is blocking you step 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.680
 in the part of grenades because this one to me 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.500
 I personally like to use more those of 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.330
 plasma since it gives me more support 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.010
 when the enemy is near and that 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.960
 because with this type of weapon you happen to 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:17.050
 short times against an assault rifle 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.820
 against a show so I better bring 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.820
 the plasma to try to stick side 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:24.070
 give a cachazo and hit cellay run 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:26.670
 to avoid having to go through that you can 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.740
 type of fighting without dying 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:30.630
 fragmentation is also 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.360
 good but I do not know how with this 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.370
 brother does not convince me in the part of 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:40.140
 weapon skill 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:43.410
 of armor this I recommend good if 

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:46.170
 you are rouzier I recommend you vision 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:47.910
 promise to you since if you go for some 

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:50.250
 Hallways and running tours like crazy 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.440
 for you can activate the promised vision 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.150
 to see if you have someone from the 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.760
 corner and be able to anticipate since if the 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:58.350
 subject carries an automatic weapon 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.120
 has the advantage against you by being of 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:03.930
 close and that's why it's better that you see it 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:05.940
 before to prepare your shots 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:08.430
 in the event that when on a map 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.870
 great and you like to be still in 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:13.140
 a place shooting at people from 

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:16.050
 far the most recommended skill 

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.880
 it would be camouflage and this one too if you're 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.290
 on a big map and you're roger and not 

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.690
 you want to use promised vision because 

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:23.610
 times on the big maps because they are 

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:25.800
 So broad the average view does not work 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.420
 I recommend the backpack a lot 

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.930
 rocket so you can surprise them 

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.970
 from the sky 

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.860
 this has been all about the best class 

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:35.289
 for the dmr I think he has extended me a 

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:38.229
 good have been almost 7 little more than 7 

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:41.020
 minutes but then to address the issues 

00:07:38.229 --> 00:07:43.660
 that I wanted to address and I think it's all 

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:45.910
 the people who do not know much about halo 

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:47.860
 Well, it will help you greatly 

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:49.240
 measure so good you know if you think 

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.310
 that the video is just me in all the 

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.090
 freedom leave a like subscribe if 

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:53.979
 do you want the videos 

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:56.789
 every time they upload it, I'm mister grace 

00:07:53.979 --> 00:07:56.789
 jones see you later
