00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.120
 the web bar and is already open Saturday and there 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.710
 galley and to quiet the cricket and 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.529
 bringing you today as neal / afp 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.930
 Permanent life pro as you can see 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.970
 I 'm using and off the life and not 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.310
 it's over so he stays for a while 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.109
 unlimited you can walk the whole map 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.050
 with them and with that you can 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.420
 discover the secrets there from mobi.e tech 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.079
 first of all like to talk 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.940
 some theories on some things 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.200
 related to the off the dead mode that I 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.840
 I would like to spend with you in this 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.960
 moment one of them is the following I found 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.910
 the very intuitive easter egg 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:53.550
 so I really do not believe 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.160
 that we did there dodo break 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.920
 cycle convinced it is not the steroid 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.320
 I really think there's still some 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.680
 Easter egg mast hidden in this 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.659
 map because some days now already 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.270
 are also revealing some secrets 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.580
 like leaves lost during the map 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.290
 on a map everything has some leaves 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.520
 torn orders that we do not 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.070
 used yet you handle the golden is the 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.530
 spoon of gold nor to goal of the sport but only 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.840
 that you the only thing that does is 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.400
 really kill the sumitomo I believe that 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.540
 the fall also the other piece 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.380
 fundamental to lipo the easter egg greater 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.880
 premiere will mass streg this map 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.939
 discovered now also I'll bring 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.000
 also on the channel as if there is plaid 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.720
 of tomahawk then we know that rock is 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.030
 one of the main parts of streb and 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.220
 you still have how to upgrade it 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.649
 so I really still think so too 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.990
 you can use this tomahawk upgrade 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.090
 to do something else and then there's a lot 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.880
 thing still hidden on the map 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.240
 we do not find that I think 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.780
 is related to the main strep of the 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.500
 map 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.110
 so I think all this will involve you there 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.940
 a little more research I think a 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.030
 one or two weeks already 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.120
 we will be in discovering the new right 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.670
 to the new things we have had to 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.730
 we will have to do in fact within 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.400
 of this map there and I really believe 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.810
 that there is still much hidden 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.320
 so I'll talk a little bit about the office 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.800
 live permanent is the following guys this 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.380
 It's a trolling, that's a bug. 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.300
 What happened? 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.940
 I did not know the game when I was there. 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:46.500
 finishing making friends with my friends 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:49.050
 and there is our streg a person has climbed in 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.790
 her plane and then she was thrown off the 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.880
 everybody was thrown off the plane 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.100
 being there in the alcatraz part I think 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.700
 the disc the game did not help 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.970
 once and easter egg is one 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:06.090
 supposed to streg and identified in the 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.160
 offline and infinite then it was running 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.980
 by the map all by happy the life 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.020
 of love is over and will be the thing 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.239
 funny because we keep trying 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.549
 that the plane was responding 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.070
 from time to time but we tried 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:23.549
 get on the plane and it did not work 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:27.209
 black cloth appeared and he made the 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:29.760
 normal descent of the aircraft from the 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.340
 you will see there 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.549
 you wrap the black screen as if it were 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.860
 that's when he hits the haviano on the bridge and 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.880
 they stay dark everything disappears in the 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.130
 bridge 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.530
 so this is the very bizarre thing that 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.690
 happened however it was interesting that the 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.790
 We managed to explore the map all ta 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.100
 I was able to explore the whole map. 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.320
 checking there using the off mode 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.870
 lages us without spending anything so this 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:57.060
 It was interesting that I saw that it does not have 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.910
 much more to discover 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.590
 an office live all that was to have 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.459
 discovered in the fuselage has 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.220
 uncovered 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.520
 but before the whistle life I think 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.220
 there's a lot still undiscovered 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.950
 so stay there I hope you like it 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:17.340
 to hot glitch encountered this bug 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:20.519
 which actually left us even with 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.800
 I was very angry because I had already done 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:26.370
 stress plus three of my friends do not 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:29.520
 had made people arrived in the end aiea 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.560
 triatro lo more people and I hope you 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.479
 have enjoyed this video if not the beans 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.760
 and favorite please help on the street in 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:40.370
 evaluation of this video in disseminating 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.370
 I see in the next video parents and even more
