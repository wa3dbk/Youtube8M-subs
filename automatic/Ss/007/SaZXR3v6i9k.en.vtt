00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.259
 the London studio slightly mad 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.420
 studios plant face simulators like 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.210
 great tourism or forza motorsport with its 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.340
 project cars proposal founded in the year 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.590
 2009 this study developed in the dif 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.560
 for speed shift and test drive ferrari 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.600
 racing legends was in 2011 when 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.180
 they created the project community assists 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.970
 race team a proposal created and 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.020
 supported by the community of players 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.660
 passionate all to the competition of 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.760
 four wheels little by little this project 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.759
 it was getting package name and 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.039
 consistency passion quality to be what 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.190
 that we have today an excellent 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:40.350
 and awesome simulated tarte in 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.809
 studies and digital polyphony can already 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.979
 put the batteries because they are very few 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.539
 the loose points that are in this 

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:48.530
 proposal that has come to stay 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.389
 a lot of time and triumph in a big way 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.190
 project cars is not a game that you should 

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:55.469
 buy yourself if what you're looking for is a 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.899
 bet then to pass the time not 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.459
 because you're going to suffer so much for 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.529
 can advance sections before being 

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:02.460
 rammed with rivals or get out of 

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:05.729
 track 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.000
 it's not a speed arcade that you can 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:12.240
 play now a little while and then another does not 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.460
 demands dedication patience and attention 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.080
 passion in driving and to jump to 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.880
 the different races you must first 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.470
 train get good positions 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.530
 qualifiers for the grid 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.720
 exit and then if you try to win at 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.310
 the hard rivals all this while 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.470
 you try to master the weight of 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.270
 different vehicles taking curves to 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.979
 force agents spend the tires of 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.330
 the brakes the forcing the engine the 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.640
 overtaking and modified the 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.179
 parameters of your vehicle to adapt it 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.729
 better to your driving if you still follow 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:43.229
 excited this is your game 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.600
 the offer to project is based on 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.770
 different free practice options where 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.050
 we can run in any of the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.149
 circuits and stretches available using the 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.220
 vehicle that we want weekend of 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.320
 fast races as if they were mini 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.330
 time trial tournaments against 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.130
 ghost cars of two players and 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.810
 challenges of the community that at the moment 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.149
 we have seen none active at the time of 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.069
 do this analysis explore games 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.720
 online create ours by selecting 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:08.039
 circuit type of vehicles and others 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.129
 parameters 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.290
 and the main story mode the point 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.909
 strong of the game is in this mode 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.459
 where we will find all the 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:19.260
 substance to project in the first 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.030
 we will select by what level we start 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.280
 receiving notifications from 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.950
 different calendar tests in each 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.480
 proof is invited and even requires 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.760
 turn around to practice samples 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.370
 of classification and races those that 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.739
 be in a hurry to go to the race can 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.379
 simulate results although these almost 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.579
 always pull down putting us almost 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.859
 always in the back of the 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.810
 Grill in the qualifying rounds 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:45.180
 It is imperative not only to get a 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.540
 competitive time but also not be 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.400
 penalized and this costs quite a lot 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.799
 get away one iota from the margins of 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.310
 circuit or tackling not charging or being 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:58.439
 ramped respect the rules aspects 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.689
 that are not so exaggeratedly demanding 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.159
 with those seen in drive but that we 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:02.659
 obliged to give the best of us 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.280
 same 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:07.169
 as we get successes we receive 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.959
 mails with limitations to new events 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:12.540
 and teams this long and challenging way 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.370
 it rewards us not only by winning tests 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.209
 increasingly demanding 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.620
 but also maintaining our throne 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.810
 We have more than 70 routes to 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.590
 travel with the 65 vehicles of 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.120
 different categories if few regarding 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.700
 other car simulators are 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.980
 few one of the only buts that 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.090
 we have been able to put the game there 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.860
 confirmation that the number of 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.829
 vehicles will go up thanks to 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.239
 free content and paid each 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.610
 The vehicles can be customized to 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.280
 consciousness going down or moving parameters 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.230
 Pro players will put on their boots 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.959
 with so many options all 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.180
 modifications are noticed much in career 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.099
 the fidelity with which it has been 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.560
 the main protagonists of the game 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.209
 it is overwhelming all vehicles 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.129
 present a modeling and finishing 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.750
 trustworthy brutal noticing 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:02.670
 in detail in each of the pieces 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.069
 that we observe quietly in the mode 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.989
 photo that allows us to take snapshots 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.870
 of each of them and noticing the 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.700
 physical in each clash shock and mars that 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.180
 strips or shreds properly our 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.079
 vehicle with pieces jumping in the race 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.880
 between the list of circuits 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.530
 we found the officers as of 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.600
 nürbürgring hockenheimring lagoons 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.610
 circuit track spa monza le mans 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.190
 and silverstone and the catalonia circuit 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.590
 others inspired by others are added 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.600
 circuits and locations surely 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.910
 you will have seen these circuits thousands of 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.180
 times in other games but with this 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.440
 quality of detail as very few if 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.880
 we also add the effects of 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.860
 lighting with the sun giving in the 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.169
 dashboard in the helmet and not talking to us 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.090
 the view when the law enforcement is down or 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.680
 when we leave a tunnel the 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.750
 variable climatology in career with 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.860
 intense rain that affects the gameplay and 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.930
 the sensation of speed that 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.150
 transmits whatever the camera that 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.830
 select we have a game that 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.320
 simply it addresses what is 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.880
 refers to the graphic section enjoy 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.850
 the games from the pilot's camera is 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.070
 just flip the version you see 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:09.130
 on apps screen 4 to 1080 pixels 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.630
 natives that of xbox one run 900 and the 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.890
 frame rate is not to be completely stable 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.290
 60 frames per second 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.419
 staying in a little less but the 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.540
 truth is that it looks outstanding in 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:21.790
 both consoles the most 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.740
 spectacular is the pc that allows 4k 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.900
 and even 12 k with three monitors 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.889
 we can activate disable the effects 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.249
 of light the cream 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:31.629
 and others but we take away the eye 

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:33.300
 playability in a fundamental aspect 

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:35.889
 from the beginning of development 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.509
 start driving in projecting is not 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.069
 easy that will take you a good time 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:41.409
 get the hang of it and find your 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:43.599
 optimal configuration and start winning 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:45.490
 races allow you to activate or 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:47.080
 deactivate aids in driving as well as 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.599
 lower or raise the skill and 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.599
 aggressiveness of rivals 20 or 30 

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:55.659
 overcome according to the race advance the 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:57.159
 first half is relatively easy 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:59.409
 rest of rivals because not so much 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:01.930
 boasting artificial intelligence 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:05.110
 the level of demand gets that each 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.789
 triumph because he deserved we can 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.919
 enter the pits to repair our 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:11.560
 vehicle the animations of the boxes 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:12.969
 they are as accomplished as the rest of the 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.349
 control with the respective controls 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:16.479
 it responds quite well to our 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:19.060
 decisions although we can always use 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:21.400
 one of the few flyers accepted 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.710
 negative aspect that shortening of 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.659
 few flyers about the sound there 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.069
 that differentiate various parts of the music 

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:29.080
 of the menus that a music fusion 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:30.490
 electronic and orchestra information 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.650
 verbal that we saw in three or four times the 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.370
 speaker of 84 and that can be female 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.320
 when I do not know 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.870
 to each of the sections of the game or 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.100
 male when we are in career 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:41.560
 advising us informing us of our 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.540
 march and finally the noise of the 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:46.780
 engines the great protagonist of the 

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:48.430
 Sound section of removing the hat 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.750
 Regarding the multiplayer we have already said 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:51.490
 that there are different ways in which to create 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.680
 our custom online game for 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.720
 avoid who we want as well as overcome 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.460
 ghost cars of others but also 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.070
 we have special events like 24 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:02.680
 hours of le mans where we can be 24 

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.479
 real hours competing or the 500 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.150
 miles of indianapolis between 

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:08.880
 options on consoles are 18 the 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.320
 online players who can participate 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.660
 could not miss the social touch of 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.370
 game by sharing records encourage the 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.440
 Pique enhance the upload of photos or 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:18.940
 Live videos share our 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.560
 affinity with certain clues see 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.970
 other configurations that 

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.530
 competitions are what we are given 

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:25.300
 better how many victories we have achieved 

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:28.150
 online who mode of games our 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:30.100
 preferred etc. everything is shared 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.810
 although there are some small rough edges 

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.850
 that can be polished by a patch 

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:36.039
 like some physical karts little 

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:37.979
 credible some car we've seen 

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:39.940
 literally fly when you hit from behind 

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:41.260
 small bugs and 

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:44.050
 the words of the text in events the 

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:46.480
 community that are still in italy are not 

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:48.220
 projecting things are fulfilled 

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.390
 expectations and it's as good as 

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:53.310
 promised long realistic challenging 

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:58.080
 projecting is the simulator 

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:58.080
 automotive of the new generation 

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.420
 good
