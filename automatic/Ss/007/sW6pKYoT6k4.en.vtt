then<00:02:45.180> I<00:02:45.450> let<00:02:45.990> me<00:02:46.110> switch<00:02:46.320> arms<00:02:48.830> okay<00:02:50.000> then<00:02:51.000> over

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
then I let me switch arms okay then over

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.660 
then I let me switch arms okay then over
here<00:02:51.270> I<00:02:51.750> have<00:02:53.300> anti-static<00:02:54.300> wristband<00:02:55.670> for

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
here I have anti-static wristband for

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.100 
here I have anti-static wristband for
grounding<00:02:57.510> myself<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.170> case<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:59.430> clips

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
grounding myself to the case and clips

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.200 
grounding myself to the case and clips
it<00:03:01.110> clips<00:03:01.380> on<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.770> off<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.430> actual<00:03:02.760> wristband

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
it clips on and off the actual wristband

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.550 
it clips on and off the actual wristband
the<00:03:03.690> wire<00:03:03.930> that<00:03:04.890> has<00:03:05.100> alligator<00:03:05.460> clip<00:03:05.820> on<00:03:05.970> it

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
the wire that has alligator clip on it

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.770 
the wire that has alligator clip on it
then<00:03:07.560> over<00:03:08.100> in<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.370> same<00:03:08.700> compartment<00:03:09.060> I<00:03:09.420> have

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
then over in the same compartment I have

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.610 
then over in the same compartment I have
a<00:03:09.810> psu<00:03:10.440> tester<00:03:10.830> it<00:03:11.220> with<00:03:11.490> an<00:03:11.580> LCD<00:03:11.880> display<00:03:12.620> and

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
a psu tester it with an LCD display and

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.500 
a psu tester it with an LCD display and
well<00:03:13.890> maybe<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:14.790> want<00:03:15.000> to<00:03:15.030> go<00:03:15.180> over<00:03:15.210> that<00:03:15.450> a

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
well maybe I want to go over that a

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.790 
well maybe I want to go over that a
little<00:03:15.600> bit<00:03:15.810> more<00:03:16.050> with<00:03:16.170> you<00:03:16.290> guys<00:03:16.470> because

be a source of power anyways put that

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:37.420 
be a source of power anyways put that
back<00:04:32.230> okay<00:04:33.880> then<00:04:34.880> we<00:04:35.090> have<00:04:36.310> in<00:04:37.310> this

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430
