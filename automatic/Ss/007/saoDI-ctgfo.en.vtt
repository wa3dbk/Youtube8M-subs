00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello everybody also introduces you today 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.340
 our wind generator used to 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.400
 recharge 5 volt batteries as 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.620
 exposed and we have our prototype already 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.089
 everything is installed and now I'm going 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.180
 telling you 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.430
 step by step how our 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.010
 generator is looks initially we 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.380
 we used a propeller extracted from a 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.320
 there is give that this in turn will be 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.869
 being attached to a printer motor 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.099
 similar to this one is one of the best 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.350
 motors to be making 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.930
 generators is where we can get 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.000
 voltages from 7 to 10 volts 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.790
 although some use it to 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.129
 build such motor generators 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.629
 extracted from electronic toys and 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.020
 dvd drive 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.870
 but these engines do not have the load 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.420
 generated by this one extracted from 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.640
 printer then the best engine for you 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.920
 you are making your oil generator 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.780
 would initially achieve the engine 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:06.510
 similar here in the motor shaft 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.510
 ours did have a bit of hot glue 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.090
 and in turn the engine we inserted here 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.740
 cylindrical plastic packaging which is 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.960
 fixed to the base through two 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.400
 brackets on the back and 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.100
 we observed two sons here 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.229
 the right is the positive wire notes 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.030
 which is connected with positive LED and 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.820
 with our battery positive that goes 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.430
 be recharged by our generator. 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.650
 left side we have a negative wire 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.750
 is the negative is connected to a diode 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.439
 to avoid the loss of loads that, due to 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.450
 connected to a switch. 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:43.070
 led to the led and also to the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.659
 of our battery then 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.829
 we observe that initially we have 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:53.340
 here our generator is off and we 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.560
 here we are optimizing the load 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.719
 exclusively contained in the battery to 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.590
 parking here at that moment the three 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.180
 light 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.520
 we observe that the three light ones are 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.740
 triggered but with low light 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.140
 due to the amount of load that 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.910
 found in our battery then the charge 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.340
 which is relatively low 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.650
 We're going to start our generator now. 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.349
 remember that this generator 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.680
 is posted placed on the outside of the 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:22.049
 using a tripod to 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.420
 be setting up the whole structure so he 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:28.019
 is positioned on the outside 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.560
 then the air flow will rotate to move 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:34.829
 it is in high rotation producing here 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.720
 electric charges as the climate is 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:39.060
 cloudy and rainy we'll be 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.500
 demonstrating our prototype here in the 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.720
 This is where our laboratory goes. 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.370
 here use a fan that will 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.040
 sufficient air flow to 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:51.530
 be moving here to our guys and 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.970
 generating voltages of up to 7 volts 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.639
 initially we observed a low 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.689
 luminosity 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:03:04.620
 the light devices and we're going 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:07.319
 now blow our fan going 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.590
 propel our propeller into motion. 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.590
 generator 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.400
 At that moment we observed a high 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.190
 light brightness 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.269
 so we are generating there 7 volts of 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.940
 tension 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.699
 this voltage is being used to 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:30.150
 the three LEDs by activating the three 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:38.970
 lightweight and at the same time recharging 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:41.190
 Our battery, I can simply 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.659
 use all the energy generated to be 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.569
 charging the battery 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:49.229
 in this case the recharge time it is 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:52.019
 much less than the time we 

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:52.530
 we will be at the same time activating the 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.659
 light 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.109
 so in this case the time it is a little 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:04:00.299
 but if you turn off the three 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:03.269
 light then all the generated voltage is 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:05.639
 being diverted towards the battery 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.889
 favoring the recharge of the table 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:09.720
 We are going to wait a few moments and 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:12.389
 later we will observe the 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:16.560
 led light 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:20.120
 let's wait a few moments the 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.120
 generator in full operation 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.380
 the battery is being recharged 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.400
 Let's now turn off our generator. 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.600
 Let's wait for him to stop completely. 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:07.240
 so right now we're not anymore 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.770
 generating wind energy 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.690
 So all the energy we have here 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.150
 now it is confined to our battery 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:16.180
 so let's try to trigger the led 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.690
 observe the luminosity now posterior 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.690
 recharge 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.340
 we observe that the luminosity 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.890
 rose pretty 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.620
 given that we were able to recharge the 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:32.080
 Our battery is 5 volts 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.120
 so it's more a very experiment 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.880
 interesting try it today generator 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.560
 used to recharge 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.330
 5 volt batteries 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.960
 A hug and until our next meeting 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.960
 thanks
