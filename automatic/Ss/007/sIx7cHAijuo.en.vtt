00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 educate tina the education site number 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.290
 one from Latin America 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.590
 in this video I'm going to tell you a little 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.719
 as they are or how it is better said 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.090
 structure of peroxisomes and 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.470
 boxes or more and the functions that meet 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.279
 in the cell this video is very short 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.890
 first let's start with the 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.870
 peroxisomes but if we are organ 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:31.300
 vines that are auto replica before 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.300
 auto replicants 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.760
 obviously they are limited by a 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.219
 membrane yes 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.190
 in the cell they exist without their own genome 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:45.699
 do not originate from the bag complex 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.329
 but they do it by binary vision to 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.970
 from a pre-existing one 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.510
 that is, what 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:58.530
 bin to day function is to say that we have 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.440
 a peroxisome after a 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.280
 constriction 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:07.820
 in the center and two proxies originate or 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.159
 more in this way is how it originates 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.380
 the pro-exist more grows and then it's 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.790
 destroyed probably by a 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:19.220
 autophagy after four to five days 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:24.270
 that present inside present 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:28.560
 enzymes that are oxidative 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.219
 oxidative enzymes like for example the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.219
 peroxidase 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.590
 the Catalan 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.620
 among others 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.860
 well what is the function that has the 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.480
 but I exist more peroxisomes 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.480
 intervene in the metabolism 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.820
 of hydrogen peroxide 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.950
 also known as water 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:06.689
 oxygenated for it they do they use 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:11.760
 oxygen that is going to form this peroxide 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:14.970
 this peroxide that is going to be going to oxidize 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.280
 who will oxidize for example to 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.120
 phenol is that they are aromatic alcohols 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.680
 they will also oxidize for example to 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.879
 other simple alcohols 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.879
 to formaldehyde 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.800
 formaldehyde etcetera itself participates in 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.960
 oxidation process and for example 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.810
 when chain fatty acids are oxidized 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:42.010
 long they are obtained as products makes 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.010
 lime trees and hydrogen peroxide 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.569
 ok let's bet now to the pits or 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.280
 plus 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:53.379
 the deceased more are also organ vines 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:58.109
 that are surrounded by membrane by 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:58.109
 membrane that is to say they are membranous organs 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.930
 which are similar to peroxisomes but 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.360
 that are only present in cells 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:12.780
 vegetables in general there is no 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:15.240
 the deceased more in animal cells 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.550
 what is the function of the blocks 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.550
 did more intervene in the metabolism 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:27.710
 of triglycerides ie lipids 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.900
 triglycerides 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:33.800
 to turn them into that for 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.800
 turn them into sugars 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.800
 this process performs and through the 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.390
 oxidized indi cycle where for example 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.390
 two acetyl molecules 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:51.520
 up to you or over 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.520
 they become succinic acid 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.530
 then this succinic acid comes out of the 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.770
 peroxisomes and in the cytoplasm it 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:05.280
 transforms it into the sugar that 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:07.020
 correspond then what but wanted more and 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.780
 I saw them again, they are organ jdd. 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.690
 female, you are not very simple 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.850
 they intervene in very specific functions 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.650
 and well keep in mind that they and I 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.459
 I exist more are found preferably 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.459
 in plant cells 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:26.900
 educational I recommend the following 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.900
 videos so you can keep learning
