by his stats and overall rating of 90

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.610 
by his stats and overall rating of 90
means<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.300> will<00:00:57.480> be<00:00:57.660> extremely<00:00:57.930> hard<00:00:58.469> to

with Bayern Munich than with other top
teams<00:01:03.239> which<00:01:03.780> especially<00:01:04.260> when<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.860> game<00:01:05.040> is

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
teams which especially when the game is

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.630 
teams which especially when the game is
close<00:01:05.339> can<00:01:05.760> be<00:01:05.909> extremely<00:01:06.360> important<00:01:07.640> moving

Renato<00:04:38.890> you<00:04:39.460> know<00:04:39.730> what<00:04:39.910> I<00:04:39.940> mean<00:04:40.210> he's<00:04:40.540> a

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
Renato you know what I mean he's a

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.570 
Renato you know what I mean he's a
little<00:04:40.840> bit<00:04:41.020> slower<00:04:41.290> and<00:04:41.530> for<00:04:41.950> example<00:04:42.430> his

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
little bit slower and for example his

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.790 
little bit slower and for example his
long<00:04:42.850> shots<00:04:43.120> I'm<00:04:43.270> not<00:04:43.570> as<00:04:43.690> good<00:04:43.720> as<00:04:44.080> Ronaldo's

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
long shots I'm not as good as Ronaldo's

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.490 
long shots I'm not as good as Ronaldo's
but<00:04:45.430> as<00:04:45.670> I<00:04:45.910> mentioned<00:04:45.940> earlier<00:04:46.390> by<00:04:47.020> an<00:04:47.080> eunuch

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
but as I mentioned earlier by an eunuch

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.560 
but as I mentioned earlier by an eunuch
has<00:04:47.650> lots<00:04:47.920> of<00:04:48.040> other<00:04:48.280> advantages<00:04:48.940> and<00:04:49.150> I<00:04:49.270> think

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
has lots of other advantages and I think

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.960 
has lots of other advantages and I think
in<00:04:49.810> fifa15<00:04:50.320> they<00:04:51.130> are<00:04:51.280> really<00:04:51.490> able<00:04:51.790> to

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
in fifa15 they are really able to

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.210 
in fifa15 they are really able to
challenge<00:04:52.270> Real<00:04:52.600> Madrid<00:04:52.990> as<00:04:53.230> the<00:04:53.680> best<00:04:53.890> team

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
challenge Real Madrid as the best team

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.520 
challenge Real Madrid as the best team
that's<00:04:54.910> why<00:04:55.180> I<00:04:55.210> give<00:04:55.570> them<00:04:55.780> nine<00:04:56.050> point<00:04:56.320> five

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
that's why I give them nine point five

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.340 
that's why I give them nine point five
out<00:04:56.800> of<00:04:56.860> ten<00:04:57.280> points<00:04:57.790> that's<00:04:58.600> it<00:04:58.840> for<00:04:59.080> today

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350
