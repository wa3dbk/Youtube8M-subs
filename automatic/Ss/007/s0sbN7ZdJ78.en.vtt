 I have a good comp I can and 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:13.660
 more but I do not want the most normal codec 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:15.430
 The codec for me is mp1 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.600
 and put others on your 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:22.990
 old discretion but I'd rather you already 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.890

 48000 codec leave mp1 l2 bitrate i 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.660
 I put 320 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.570
 if you have a bad computer, put 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:56.320
 lower down 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:03:00.209
 Next, go to the image but here you are 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:03.580
 in principle, nothing is needed either 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:06.519
 look to the air on the program was 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:10.900
 written version without limits and here 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:13.360
 so here's a line to shoot games 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.950
 There is open game and presses on this 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.980
 joystick and 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.730
 In the game you should have such a small 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:26.440
 icon on top of the number it will be shown 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:29.530
