00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
filing cabinet which has been really

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.000

decluttered<00:00:32.899> away<00:00:33.899> from<00:00:34.200> this<00:00:34.380> corner<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
decluttered away from this corner of the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.709 
decluttered away from this corner of the
room<00:00:35.190> previously<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.790> was<00:00:35.850> in<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.210> corner<00:00:36.630> of

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
room previously it was in that corner of

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.459 
room previously it was in that corner of
the<00:00:36.870> room<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.040> find<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.550> opening<00:00:39.090> up

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
the room and so I find that opening up

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.690 
the room and so I find that opening up
the<00:00:40.469> corners<00:00:41.149> really<00:00:42.149> helps<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.750> small<00:00:43.140> room

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
the corners really helps this small room

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.889 
the corners really helps this small room
seem<00:00:44.700> larger<00:00:46.010> that<00:00:47.010> means<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.430> also

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
seem larger that means that I also

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.110 
seem larger that means that I also
opened<00:00:48.899> up<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.230> wall<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:50.520> now<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.910> only

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
painted behind there yet and then this

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.440 
painted behind there yet and then this
is<00:02:33.760> kind<00:02:33.970> of<00:02:34.030> exciting<00:02:34.200> this<00:02:35.200> chair<00:02:35.650> is

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
is kind of exciting this chair is

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.970 
is kind of exciting this chair is
another<00:02:37.450> Street<00:02:37.840> find<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:38.470> I<00:02:38.620> have<00:02:38.770> never

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
another Street find and I have never

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.440 
another Street find and I have never
picked<00:02:39.280> up<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.550> chair<00:02:39.790> from<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.090> street<00:02:40.330> before

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
picked up a chair from the street before

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.510 
picked up a chair from the street before
but<00:02:40.840> this<00:02:41.020> one<00:02:41.260> it<00:02:41.800> was<00:02:41.920> in<00:02:42.040> my<00:02:42.070> neighborhood

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
but this one it was in my neighborhood

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.890 
but this one it was in my neighborhood
so<00:02:42.730> it<00:02:42.790> wasn't<00:02:43.030> like<00:02:43.120> it<00:02:43.270> was<00:02:43.360> on<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.570> freeway

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
so it wasn't like it was on the freeway

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.820 
so it wasn't like it was on the freeway
or<00:02:44.080> something<00:02:44.550> and<00:02:45.660> it's<00:02:46.830> extremely

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
or something and it's extremely

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.660 
or something and it's extremely
comfortable<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:49.000> so<00:02:49.780> I<00:02:49.810> covered<00:02:50.290> it<00:02:50.350> up<00:02:50.470> with

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
comfortable and so I covered it up with

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:59.280 
comfortable and so I covered it up with
with<00:02:51.670> a<00:02:51.700> blanket<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:56.220> and<00:02:57.390> I<00:02:58.390> I<00:02:58.420> mean<00:02:58.750> I<00:02:58.840> irie

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
with a blanket and and I I mean I irie

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.660 
with a blanket and and I I mean I irie
covered<00:02:59.590> it<00:02:59.710> with<00:02:59.890> it<00:03:00.070> with<00:03:00.100> a<00:03:00.400> blanket

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
covered it with it with a blanket

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.520 
covered it with it with a blanket
unfortunately<00:03:01.450> i<00:03:01.480> went<00:03:01.930> to<00:03:02.080> see<00:03:02.260> if<00:03:02.350> that<00:03:02.500> I

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
unfortunately i went to see if that I

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.780 
unfortunately i went to see if that I
could<00:03:02.650> find<00:03:02.800> another<00:03:03.100> one<00:03:03.250> of<00:03:03.340> these<00:03:03.430> blankets

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
could find another one of these blankets

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.220 
could find another one of these blankets
so<00:03:04.000> I<00:03:04.030> could<00:03:04.270> cover<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.600> other<00:03:04.750> one<00:03:04.990> of<00:03:05.110> these

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
so I could cover the other one of these

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.160 
so I could cover the other one of these
two<00:03:05.410> chairs<00:03:05.650> and<00:03:06.180> with<00:03:07.180> a<00:03:07.210> matching<00:03:07.450> color<00:03:07.840> and

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
two chairs and with a matching color and

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.170 
two chairs and with a matching color and
I<00:03:08.290> can't<00:03:08.620> find<00:03:08.920> that<00:03:09.160> particular<00:03:09.670> blanket<00:03:10.030> but

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
I can't find that particular blanket but

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.750 
I can't find that particular blanket but
that's<00:03:10.300> okay<00:03:10.570> and<00:03:11.560> so<00:03:11.800> that<00:03:11.830> blanket<00:03:12.370> is<00:03:12.520> the

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
that's okay and so that blanket is the

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.640 
that's okay and so that blanket is the
same<00:03:13.000> as<00:03:13.240> what's<00:03:13.960> used<00:03:14.200> to<00:03:14.410> cover<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.830> stool

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
same as what's used to cover the stool

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.490 
same as what's used to cover the stool
in<00:03:17.650> my<00:03:18.130> previous<00:03:18.610> video<00:03:19.180> on<00:03:19.630> decluttering<00:03:20.170> I

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
in my previous video on decluttering I

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.460 
in my previous video on decluttering I
did<00:03:20.709> talk<00:03:21.190> about<00:03:21.250> how<00:03:21.880> I<00:03:21.910> put<00:03:22.570> the<00:03:22.750> stereo<00:03:23.170> in

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
did talk about how I put the stereo in

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.430 
did talk about how I put the stereo in
this<00:03:23.500> stand<00:03:24.160> up<00:03:24.280> desk<00:03:24.459> so<00:03:24.910> that<00:03:25.440> eliminated

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
this stand up desk so that eliminated

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.960 
this stand up desk so that eliminated
another<00:03:26.680> piece<00:03:26.920> of<00:03:27.130> furniture<00:03:27.280> that<00:03:27.550> was<00:03:27.760> over

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
another piece of furniture that was over

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.840 
another piece of furniture that was over
to<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.150> left<00:03:28.330> I<00:03:28.540> also<00:03:28.989> put<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.410> printer

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
to the left I also put the printer

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:38.580 
to the left I also put the printer
inside<00:03:30.850> of<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:32.760> filing<00:03:33.760> cabinet<00:03:34.180> and<00:03:37.590> finally

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
inside of the filing cabinet and finally

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.670 
inside of the filing cabinet and finally
out<00:03:39.160> on<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.400> deck<00:03:39.640> you<00:03:40.600> can<00:03:40.810> see<00:03:41.140> it's<00:03:41.410> not

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
out on the deck you can see it's not

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.290 
out on the deck you can see it's not
very<00:03:41.860> attractive<00:03:42.010> but<00:03:42.580> this<00:03:42.760> will<00:03:42.910> be<00:03:43.030> one<00:03:43.209> of

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
very attractive but this will be one of

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.100 
very attractive but this will be one of
my<00:03:43.390> next<00:03:43.600> projects<00:03:44.140> connery<00:03:45.840> that<00:03:46.840> is<00:03:47.019> a

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
my next projects connery that is a

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.090 
my next projects connery that is a
bulletin<00:03:47.500> board<00:03:47.530> and<00:03:47.950> that<00:03:48.060> bulletin<00:03:49.060> board

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
bulletin board and that bulletin board

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.280 
bulletin board and that bulletin board
previously<00:03:51.420> was<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.600> first<00:03:52.840> thing<00:03:53.050> that<00:03:53.080> you

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
previously was the first thing that you

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.009 
previously was the first thing that you
saw<00:03:53.500> when<00:03:53.800> you<00:03:53.830> walked<00:03:54.130> in<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.370> room<00:03:55.019> right

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
saw when you walked in the room right

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.530 
saw when you walked in the room right
here<00:03:56.050> it<00:03:56.380> was<00:03:56.470> hanging<00:03:56.739> hanging<00:03:56.950> right<00:03:57.220> here

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
here it was hanging hanging right here

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.710 
here it was hanging hanging right here
so<00:03:58.540> this<00:03:59.050> space<00:03:59.320> has<00:03:59.500> now<00:03:59.680> been<00:03:59.890> opened<00:04:00.040> up<00:04:00.340> and

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
so this space has now been opened up and

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.330 
so this space has now been opened up and
I<00:04:01.720> might<00:04:01.930> put<00:04:02.170> it<00:04:02.260> back<00:04:02.410> I<00:04:02.440> might<00:04:02.800> relocate

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
I might put it back I might relocate

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.770 
I might put it back I might relocate
that<00:04:03.700> bulletin<00:04:04.060> board<00:04:04.269> somewhere<00:04:04.510> else

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
that bulletin board somewhere else

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.270 
that bulletin board somewhere else
because<00:04:05.320> I<00:04:05.500> think<00:04:05.560> it's<00:04:05.739> really<00:04:05.890> true<00:04:06.250> that

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
because I think it's really true that

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.400 
because I think it's really true that
you<00:04:07.000> know<00:04:07.120> even<00:04:07.390> though<00:04:07.660> things<00:04:07.930> feel<00:04:08.290> like

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
you know even though things feel like

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.430 
you know even though things feel like
mementos<00:04:09.010> and<00:04:09.510> in<00:04:10.510> my<00:04:10.720> case<00:04:10.780> some<00:04:11.260> of<00:04:11.290> the

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
mementos and in my case some of the

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.540 
mementos and in my case some of the
things<00:04:11.620> that<00:04:11.680> are<00:04:11.830> on<00:04:11.890> those<00:04:12.040> bullets<00:04:12.370> that

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
things that are on those bullets that

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.259 
things that are on those bullets that
bulletin<00:04:12.940> board<00:04:13.180> contains<00:04:14.640> it<00:04:15.640> contains<00:04:16.060> some

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
bulletin board contains it contains some

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.659 
bulletin board contains it contains some
race<00:04:16.600> numbers<00:04:17.200> then<00:04:17.890> that<00:04:18.040> makes<00:04:18.220> me<00:04:18.430> feel

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
race numbers then that makes me feel

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.460 
race numbers then that makes me feel
motivated<00:04:18.940> that<00:04:19.390> I've<00:04:19.480> run<00:04:19.690> races<00:04:19.930> because<00:04:20.290> it

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
motivated that I've run races because it
