there's the upgraded 21 and a half inch

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.030 
there's the upgraded 21 and a half inch
model<00:02:45.099> with<00:02:45.280> a<00:02:46.080> peers<00:02:47.080> to<00:02:47.230> be<00:02:47.349> a<00:02:47.380> larger<00:02:47.890> hard

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
model with a peers to be a larger hard

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.839 
model with a peers to be a larger hard
drive<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:48.610> upgraded<00:02:49.269> graphics<00:02:50.760> there's<00:02:51.760> a

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
drive and upgraded graphics there's a

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.780 
drive and upgraded graphics there's a
point<00:02:52.060> 7<00:02:52.360> inch<00:02:52.480> model<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:53.019> a<00:02:53.829> quad-core<00:02:54.099> 27

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
point 7 inch model and a quad-core 27

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.360 
point 7 inch model and a quad-core 27
inch<00:02:54.910> model<00:02:55.239> so<00:02:56.110> i<00:02:56.140> think<00:02:56.709> this<00:02:57.040> one<00:02:57.250> right

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
inch model so i think this one right

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.720 
inch model so i think this one right
here<00:02:57.459> the<00:02:57.970> first<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:59.260> base<00:02:59.440> model<00:02:59.730> probably

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
here the first the base model probably

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.870 
here the first the base model probably
offers<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.239> best<00:03:01.360> value<00:03:01.959> i<00:03:01.989> mean<00:03:02.380> like<00:03:03.220> if<00:03:03.430> you

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
offers the best value i mean like if you

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.490 
offers the best value i mean like if you
want<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.180> go<00:03:04.269> all<00:03:04.480> out<00:03:04.510> and<00:03:04.720> have<00:03:05.049> a<00:03:05.079> huge

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
want to go all out and have a huge

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.250 
want to go all out and have a huge
screen<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:06.340> huge<00:03:06.700> hard<00:03:06.910> drive<00:03:07.260> you're

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
screen and huge hard drive you're

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.500 
screen and huge hard drive you're
probably<00:03:08.500> going<00:03:08.709> to<00:03:08.769> be<00:03:08.950> either<00:03:09.849> someone<00:03:10.420> who

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
probably going to be either someone who

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.809 
probably going to be either someone who
uses<00:03:10.660> this<00:03:10.870> for<00:03:11.079> your<00:03:11.200> job<00:03:11.470> or<00:03:11.799> you<00:03:12.430> just<00:03:12.579> like

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
everyday computing this thing can do

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.190 
everyday computing this thing can do
some<00:03:21.190> powerful<00:03:21.430> stuff<00:03:21.579> but<00:03:22.480> just<00:03:22.720> just<00:03:22.959> for

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
you can watch HD movies on it I do some

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.270 
you can watch HD movies on it I do some
of<00:03:48.819> that<00:03:48.850> and<00:03:49.269> it<00:03:50.139> has<00:03:50.350> IPS<00:03:51.069> technology

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
of that and it has IPS technology

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.550 
of that and it has IPS technology
according<00:03:52.180> to<00:03:52.359> Apple<00:03:52.630> which<00:03:53.019> stands<00:03:53.500> for

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
according to Apple which stands for

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.610 
according to Apple which stands for
in-plane<00:03:54.160> switching<00:03:54.190> and<00:03:54.819> it<00:03:55.780> basically<00:03:56.230> just

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
in-plane switching and it basically just

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.920 
in-plane switching and it basically just
makes<00:03:56.829> so<00:03:57.130> if<00:03:57.370> you<00:03:57.489> look<00:03:57.670> at<00:03:57.819> it<00:03:57.849> one<00:03:58.030> from<00:03:58.420> one

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
makes so if you look at it one from one

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.180 
makes so if you look at it one from one
side<00:03:59.139> say<00:03:59.380> to<00:03:59.440> the<00:03:59.560> right<00:03:59.709> side<00:03:59.889> or<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.130> left

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
side say to the right side or the left

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.809 
side say to the right side or the left
side<00:04:00.549> you<00:04:01.680> won't<00:04:02.680> see<00:04:02.920> any<00:04:03.040> color<00:04:03.280> distortion

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:03.819 
side you won't see any color distortion

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:06.089 
side you won't see any color distortion
it'll<00:04:04.060> look<00:04:04.180> perfect<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:04.870> whole<00:04:05.019> way<00:04:05.200> it's

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
it'll look perfect the whole way it's

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.930 
it'll look perfect the whole way it's
also<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.430> LED<00:04:06.790> backlit<00:04:07.180> and<00:04:07.389> it<00:04:07.989> comes<00:04:08.200> in

yeah<00:04:23.020> if<00:04:23.410> you<00:04:23.620> select<00:04:23.830> the<00:04:24.100> base<00:04:24.280> model<00:04:25.230> you

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
yeah if you select the base model you

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.430 
yeah if you select the base model you
can<00:04:26.380> really<00:04:26.650> like<00:04:27.370> go<00:04:28.120> go<00:04:28.870> crazy<00:04:29.110> with<00:04:29.350> all

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
can really like go go crazy with all

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.840 
can really like go go crazy with all
this<00:04:29.650> stuff<00:04:30.630> faster<00:04:31.630> processor<00:04:32.140> more<00:04:32.380> memory

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
this stuff faster processor more memory

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.450 
this stuff faster processor more memory
keyboard<00:04:33.850> my<00:04:34.030> standard<00:04:34.570> can<00:04:34.810> get<00:04:34.930> all<00:04:35.080> this

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
keyboard my standard can get all this

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:43.170 
keyboard my standard can get all this
software<00:04:39.390> so<00:04:40.390> yeah<00:04:40.540> I<00:04:40.570> think<00:04:40.810> the<00:04:41.910> imac<00:04:42.910> does<00:04:43.150> a

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
software so yeah I think the imac does a

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.510 
software so yeah I think the imac does a
good<00:04:43.360> job<00:04:43.420> of<00:04:43.630> what<00:04:43.930> it<00:04:44.020> does<00:04:44.170> it's<00:04:44.520> definitely

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
good job of what it does it's definitely

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.270 
good job of what it does it's definitely
like<00:04:46.390> it<00:04:47.380> could<00:04:47.560> be<00:04:47.650> used<00:04:47.770> as<00:04:47.890> a<00:04:47.950> work<00:04:48.100> computer

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
like it could be used as a work computer
