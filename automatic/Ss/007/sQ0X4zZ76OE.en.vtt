than<00:00:55.489> the<00:00:56.409> garage<00:00:57.409> door<00:00:57.859> so<00:00:58.579> let's<00:00:59.479> show<00:00:59.659> you

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
than the garage door so let's show you

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:05.520 
than the garage door so let's show you
what<00:00:59.870> we've<00:01:00.019> got<00:01:00.049> here<00:01:02.229> got<00:01:03.229> the<00:01:03.469> punch<00:01:03.829> 45<00:01:04.760> and

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
what we've got here got the punch 45 and

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:12.250 
what we've got here got the punch 45 and
we<00:01:06.530> are<00:01:06.740> bridged<00:01:08.950> into<00:01:09.950> mono<00:01:10.220> and<00:01:11.080> each<00:01:12.080> of

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
we are bridged into mono and each of

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.680 
we are bridged into mono and each of
these<00:01:12.350> subwoofers<00:01:12.710> is<00:01:13.310> 4<00:01:13.700> ohms<00:01:13.850> so<00:01:14.210> that's<00:01:14.420> 2

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
these subwoofers is 4 ohms so that's 2

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.420 
these subwoofers is 4 ohms so that's 2
ohms<00:01:14.930> mono<00:01:15.620> equals<00:01:16.190> 1<00:01:16.490> ohm<00:01:16.640> stereo<00:01:17.560> no<00:01:18.560> problem

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
ohms mono equals 1 ohm stereo no problem

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.090 
ohms mono equals 1 ohm stereo no problem
for<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:19.730> punch<00:01:19.940> 45<00:01:20.510> although<00:01:21.320> Rockford<00:01:21.860> never

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
for the punch 45 although Rockford never

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.580 
for the punch 45 although Rockford never
rated<00:01:22.490> at<00:01:22.700> this<00:01:23.740> everybody<00:01:24.740> knows<00:01:25.540> that<00:01:26.590> this

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
rated at this everybody knows that this

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.830 
rated at this everybody knows that this
amp<00:01:27.890> is<00:01:28.130> fully<00:01:28.610> capable<00:01:30.340> so<00:01:31.360> how<00:01:32.360> about<00:01:32.510> we<00:01:32.660> get

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
amp is fully capable so how about we get

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.090 
amp is fully capable so how about we get
a<00:01:32.900> little<00:01:33.170> demonstration<00:01:33.560> of<00:01:34.520> some<00:01:34.790> food

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
a little demonstration of some food

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:44.340 
a little demonstration of some food
you

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:02:39.750 

you

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:03:51.920 

she<00:02:40.760> is<00:02:40.910> bumpin

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.410 

these<00:03:52.930> two<00:03:53.260> subs<00:03:53.680> are<00:03:54.070> shaking<00:03:54.850> my<00:03:55.120> whole

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
these two subs are shaking my whole

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:40.550 
these two subs are shaking my whole
garage<00:03:56.520> just<00:03:57.520> jerks<00:04:02.790> let's<00:04:03.790> fill<00:04:04.210> the<00:04:04.360> base

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.200 

you<00:04:41.040> might<00:04:41.190> have<00:04:41.280> heard<00:04:41.490> some<00:04:41.730> bottoming<00:04:42.090> out

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
you might have heard some bottoming out

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.860 
you might have heard some bottoming out
there<00:04:42.510> so<00:04:43.050> we<00:04:43.919> took<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:44.750> amplifier<00:04:45.750> to<00:04:45.780> its

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
there so we took the amplifier to its

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.710 
there so we took the amplifier to its
extreme<00:04:48.870> there<00:04:49.169> and<00:04:49.410> maxed<00:04:50.340> it<00:04:50.400> out<00:04:50.550> so<00:04:51.180> it

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
extreme there and maxed it out so it

00:04:51.720 --> 00:05:01.060 
extreme there and maxed it out so it
kicks<00:04:52.020> though<00:04:52.350> you<00:04:52.410> can<00:04:52.740> hear
