00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.080 
powerful I think it looks good and
that's<00:04:58.800> been<00:04:58.979> an<00:04:59.070> issue<00:04:59.160> for<00:04:59.340> Acura<00:04:59.880> in<00:05:00.000> the

that's been an issue for Acura in the

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.430 
that's been an issue for Acura in the
past<00:05:00.330> they've<00:05:00.570> had<00:05:00.690> you<00:05:00.960> know<00:05:01.050> some<00:05:01.260> people

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
past they've had you know some people

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.900 
past they've had you know some people
called<00:05:01.620> him<00:05:01.710> the<00:05:01.830> chrome<00:05:02.039> beak<00:05:02.310> you<00:05:02.550> know<00:05:02.669> they

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
called him the chrome beak you know they

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.000 
called him the chrome beak you know they
had<00:05:03.030> a<00:05:03.060> little<00:05:03.390> too<00:05:03.960> aggressive<00:05:04.080> styling<00:05:04.740> in

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
had a little too aggressive styling in

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.070 
had a little too aggressive styling in
the<00:05:05.039> grill<00:05:05.280> area<00:05:05.460> but<00:05:05.940> this<00:05:06.210> car<00:05:06.479> I<00:05:06.510> think<00:05:06.660> it

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
the grill area but this car I think it

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.719 
the grill area but this car I think it
puts<00:05:07.200> it<00:05:07.349> all<00:05:07.440> together<00:05:07.560> really<00:05:07.979> well<00:05:08.130> very

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
puts it all together really well very

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.089 
puts it all together really well very
functional<00:05:09.180> space<00:05:09.630> to<00:05:09.960> you<00:05:10.200> know<00:05:10.320> again<00:05:10.890> this

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099 
functional space to you know again this

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:12.980 
functional space to you know again this
car<00:05:11.400> springs<00:05:11.970> from<00:05:12.210> the<00:05:12.330> same<00:05:12.479> platform<00:05:12.900> that

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
car springs from the same platform that

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.570 
car springs from the same platform that
the<00:05:13.110> CRV<00:05:13.530> comes<00:05:13.740> from<00:05:13.919> and<00:05:14.099> both<00:05:14.280> of<00:05:14.310> those

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
the CRV comes from and both of those

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.270 
the CRV comes from and both of those
cars<00:05:14.880> can<00:05:15.450> make<00:05:15.599> a<00:05:15.630> real<00:05:15.840> claim<00:05:16.140> to<00:05:16.470> interior

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
cars can make a real claim to interior

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.969 
cars can make a real claim to interior
functionality<00:05:18.120> and<00:05:18.300> space<00:05:19.080> despite<00:05:19.560> a

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
functionality and space despite a

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:22.430 
functionality and space despite a
relatively<00:05:20.700> small<00:05:20.820> exterior<00:05:21.570> but<00:05:21.990> I<00:05:22.050> think

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
relatively small exterior but I think

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.589 
relatively small exterior but I think
even<00:05:22.650> as<00:05:22.979> much<00:05:23.130> as<00:05:23.310> the<00:05:23.430> CRV<00:05:23.880> sells<00:05:24.180> well<00:05:24.419> and

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:24.599 
even as much as the CRV sells well and

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:27.110 
even as much as the CRV sells well and
is<00:05:24.690> it<00:05:24.840> well<00:05:25.050> done<00:05:25.289> mainstream<00:05:25.950> SUV<00:05:26.340> I<00:05:26.550> think

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
is it well done mainstream SUV I think

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.640 
is it well done mainstream SUV I think
the<00:05:27.210> accurate<00:05:27.660> version<00:05:27.810> is<00:05:28.169> a<00:05:28.229> better

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
the accurate version is a better

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.770 
the accurate version is a better
execution<00:05:29.160> in<00:05:29.460> terms<00:05:29.700> of<00:05:29.820> overall<00:05:29.970> value<00:05:30.360> and

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
execution in terms of overall value and

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.060 
execution in terms of overall value and
what<00:05:31.050> you<00:05:31.140> paying<00:05:31.380> what<00:05:31.530> you<00:05:31.650> get<00:05:31.830> there<00:05:32.039> just

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.260 
know I think you can get them in that
mid<00:06:01.110> to<00:06:01.260> high<00:06:01.380> 30s<00:06:01.410> mid<00:06:02.250> to<00:06:02.400> high<00:06:02.460> 30s<00:06:02.490> yeah<00:06:03.060> and

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
mid to high 30s mid to high 30s yeah and

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.170 
mid to high 30s mid to high 30s yeah and
the<00:06:03.630> con<00:06:03.810> again<00:06:04.490> you've<00:06:05.490> gotta<00:06:05.669> get<00:06:05.880> into<00:06:06.000> the

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
the con again you've gotta get into the

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.790 
the con again you've gotta get into the
40's<00:06:06.570> before<00:06:06.750> you<00:06:07.020> get<00:06:07.169> even<00:06:07.349> the<00:06:07.440> cheapest

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
40's before you get even the cheapest

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.710 
40's before you get even the cheapest
one<00:06:07.919> because<00:06:08.220> i<00:06:08.610> think<00:06:08.669> it's<00:06:08.820> like<00:06:08.910> 48<00:06:09.360> base

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
one because i think it's like 48 base

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.350 
one because i think it's like 48 base
because<00:06:10.440> even<00:06:10.680> the<00:06:10.770> base<00:06:10.950> one<00:06:11.220> it's<00:06:11.610> a<00:06:11.789> makan<00:06:12.150> s

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
because even the base one it's a makan s

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.850 
because even the base one it's a makan s
it's<00:06:12.599> called<00:06:12.810> there's<00:06:13.050> no<00:06:13.169> like<00:06:13.349> non<00:06:13.650> s

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
it's called there's no like non s

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.350 
it's called there's no like non s
version<00:06:14.280> of<00:06:14.340> the<00:06:14.400> makan<00:06:14.669> which<00:06:14.910> is<00:06:15.060> typically

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
version of the makan which is typically

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.810 
version of the makan which is typically
they're<00:06:15.660> kind<00:06:15.990> of<00:06:16.080> elevation<00:06:16.890> in<00:06:17.130> terms<00:06:17.669> of

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 
they're kind of elevation in terms of

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.640 
they're kind of elevation in terms of
hierarchy<00:06:18.479> there<00:06:18.840> probably<00:06:19.020> is<00:06:19.229> in<00:06:19.260> europe

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
hierarchy there probably is in europe

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.080 
hierarchy there probably is in europe
but<00:06:20.010> in<00:06:20.130> America<00:06:20.220> the<00:06:20.580> cheapest<00:06:20.970> version

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
but in America the cheapest version

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.530 
but in America the cheapest version
still<00:06:21.479> has<00:06:21.539> a<00:06:21.720> powerful<00:06:22.140> 6-cylinder<00:06:22.680> engine

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:23.540 
still has a powerful 6-cylinder engine
