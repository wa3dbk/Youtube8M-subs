00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:29.359
 had just stayed like this 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:39.270
 I feel like eating, the recipe is 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.440
 very practical and easy if you 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.740
 mouth watering 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.780
 the result is only the animal's stage and 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.780
 I have a step by step, let's go. 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.380
 first let's start mixing 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:40.800
 Solid ingredients play flour all over the 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.800
 flour then comes with salt 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:50.610
 after baking powder and lastly the 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.610
 sugar spoons 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.610
 Now we go to a liquid butter 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:08.820
 is not net plus includes here as well 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:25.080
 Let's start playing uht milk milk. 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:25.080
 then the last butter 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:45.790
 now this mix mix slowly 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:48.340
 all ingredients to incorporate 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.490
 There's going to be a mass to 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.560
 This way liquid will not get so 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:56.560
 consistent and just mix until 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.020
 everything will be more or less 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.440
 consistency of rain 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:07.720
 the housekeeper more or less the same 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:09.220
 consistency is very strong but let me 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.290
 see all the butter 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.640
 now it's arrived at the ideal point we're going 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.120
 take to the frying pan 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.910
 now you have it, you have it. 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.950
 a quarter or so it's here until 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.020
 Inner bottom cover or skillet 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.000
 Because this mass and stay a little bit 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:29.110
 more gross than in the normal season 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.709
 salty catches a little a quarter more 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.950
 or less and covers the entire 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.950
 frying pan 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.050
 Then you'll turn the oven on the fire. 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.450
 I mean, do not you? 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.450
 and leave to be proud 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.150
 now from the same time on the other side 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.680
 to brown on the other side 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:04:05.100
 now we are going to try to 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:08.320
 master-cuca the blog follow her ready 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:11.940
 What will you fill her with like you 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:17.519
 saw in the beginning we chose nutella and 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:22.180
 confetti but because of fat and then 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:25.120
 also the way you want to put it 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:44.410
 very filling little filling quite 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:53.790
 full nutella active is a bit bad and in the 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:53.790
 ice cream and chocolate corner and ice cream 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.980
 there you choose the way you 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:04.530
 wants to make a movie as it is easy to see 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:11.260
 fast practical new cheap licentious 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:12.529
 Screen competes and cheaper coconut fish 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.829
 grated 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:16.969
 Because he did not have this 

00:05:14.829 --> 00:06:13.069
 being a brigadeiro 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:06:17.979

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:17.979
