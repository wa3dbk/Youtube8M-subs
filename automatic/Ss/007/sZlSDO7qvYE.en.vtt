here's<00:00:01.680> a<00:00:01.740> quick<00:00:02.010> tip<00:00:02.220> on<00:00:02.399> machining<00:00:03.680> inside

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
here's a quick tip on machining inside

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.240 
here's a quick tip on machining inside
faces<00:00:05.069> of<00:00:05.160> Chuck<00:00:05.370> jaws<00:00:05.609> or<00:00:06.000> Chuck<00:00:06.330> which<00:00:06.509> is

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.250 
faces of Chuck jaws or Chuck which is

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.910 
faces of Chuck jaws or Chuck which is
got<00:00:08.250> a<00:00:08.280> bit<00:00:08.370> of<00:00:08.460> wear<00:00:08.610> in<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:08.940> scroll<00:00:09.210> plate

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:09.920 
got a bit of wear in the scroll plate

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.060 
got a bit of wear in the scroll plate
and<00:00:10.920> possibly<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:12.000> jaws<00:00:12.530> the<00:00:13.530> normal<00:00:13.799> method

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
and possibly the jaws the normal method

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.279 
and possibly the jaws the normal method
would<00:00:14.160> be<00:00:14.219> that<00:00:14.519> you<00:00:14.639> put<00:00:15.599> a<00:00:15.630> load<00:00:15.870> up<00:00:16.139> the

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
would be that you put a load up the

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.560 
would be that you put a load up the
backer<00:00:16.500> put<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:16.890> big<00:00:17.520> washer<00:00:17.910> or<00:00:18.000> something<00:00:18.359> in

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
backer put a big washer or something in

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.189 
backer put a big washer or something in
the<00:00:18.690> back<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:20.150> jaws<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.359> what

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
the back of the jaws to what

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.460 
the back of the jaws to what
pull<00:00:22.500> up<00:00:22.619> against<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:24.019> the<00:00:25.019> jaw<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.410> the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
pull up against the the jaw and the

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.900 
pull up against the the jaw and the
scroll<00:00:25.769> plate<00:00:26.039> for<00:00:26.250> some<00:00:26.400> tension<00:00:26.789> on<00:00:26.849> it

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
scroll plate for some tension on it

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.759 
scroll plate for some tension on it
because<00:00:27.869> obviously<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.230> got<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.410> take<00:00:28.560> any

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
because obviously you got to take any

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.030 
because obviously you got to take any
slop<00:00:29.070> out<00:00:29.279> when<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.150> grind<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.510> jaws<00:00:31.040> problem

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
slop out when you grind the jaws problem

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.170 
slop out when you grind the jaws problem
with<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.399> though<00:00:32.579> they<00:00:32.700> put<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.000> all<00:00:33.090> the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
with that is though they put it all the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.819 
with that is though they put it all the
load<00:00:33.300> up<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.540> back<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:33.989> jaw<00:00:34.170> when<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:34.739> go

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
load up the back of the jaw when you go

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.170 
load up the back of the jaw when you go
to<00:00:34.890> use<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:36.170> jack<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:38.040> course<00:00:38.280> you'll<00:00:39.149> be

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
to use the jack of course you'll be

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.850 
to use the jack of course you'll be
gripping<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.660> up<00:00:39.780> neither<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.440> front<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.770> the

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
jaw and of course is that putting the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.600 
jaw and of course is that putting the
wash<00:00:43.050> up<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.320> backs<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.710> wrong<00:00:43.890> end<00:00:44.129> but<00:00:44.489> then

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
wash up the backs the wrong end but then

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.639 
wash up the backs the wrong end but then
how<00:00:44.789> do<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:44.969> drew<00:00:45.180> how<00:00:45.420> do<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.660> put<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.320> load<00:00:46.500> up

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
how do you drew how do you put a load up

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.740 
how do you drew how do you put a load up
the<00:00:46.770> front<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.190> check<00:00:47.430> without<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.660> getting

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
the front of a check without it getting

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.979 
the front of a check without it getting
in<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.020> way<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.170> your<00:00:49.379> tool<00:00:49.559> post<00:00:49.739> grinder

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
in the way of your tool post grinder

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.299 
in the way of your tool post grinder
well<00:00:51.989> jaws<00:00:52.199> are<00:00:52.410> majorly<00:00:52.680> made<00:00:52.890> out<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.100> hard

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
well jaws are majorly made out of hard

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.369 
well jaws are majorly made out of hard
stuff<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.969> if<00:00:54.059> it's<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.270> good<00:00:54.449> English<00:00:54.719> chuck

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
stuff and if it's a good English chuck

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.959 
stuff and if it's a good English chuck
like<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:55.770> Bernhard<00:00:56.280> it's<00:00:56.460> going<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.670> be<00:00:56.760> that

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
like this Bernhard it's going to be that

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.439 
like this Bernhard it's going to be that
hard<00:00:57.090> you're<00:00:57.329> never<00:00:57.539> going<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:58.940> do<00:00:59.940> much<00:01:00.210> as

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
hard you're never going to do much as

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.330 
hard you're never going to do much as
far<00:01:00.719> as<00:01:00.930> drilling<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.469> putting<00:01:01.770> pins<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.309> to

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
far as drilling and putting pins in to

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.119 
far as drilling and putting pins in to
put<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.609> washer<00:01:02.940> there<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.390> what<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.690> do<00:01:03.860> on<00:01:04.860> an

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
put a washer there so what I do on an

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.420 
put a washer there so what I do on an
old<00:01:05.309> Chuck<00:01:05.519> like<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:05.970> easy<00:01:06.540> way<00:01:06.810> out<00:01:06.990> is

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
old Chuck like this easy way out is

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.859 
old Chuck like this easy way out is
you're<00:01:08.430> basically<00:01:08.549> machine<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:11.360> slot<00:01:12.360> into<00:01:12.689> the

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
you're basically machine a slot into the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.670 
you're basically machine a slot into the
face<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.409> jaw<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:15.509> use<00:01:16.200> carbide

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
face of the jaw so you use carbide

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.700 
face of the jaw so you use carbide
cutter<00:01:17.659> car<00:01:18.659> by<00:01:18.780> tooling<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.409> your<00:01:19.560> machine

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
cutter car by tooling and your machine

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.920 
cutter car by tooling and your machine
and<00:01:20.310> when<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.790> machine<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.720> main<00:01:21.900> thing

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
and when you machine it the main thing

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.620 
and when you machine it the main thing
to<00:01:22.170> do<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.500> get<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.729> 90<00:01:23.729> degree<00:01:24.000> face<00:01:24.299> on<00:01:24.509> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
to do is get a 90 degree face on the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.749 
to do is get a 90 degree face on the
outside<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.830> groove<00:01:26.070> you're<00:01:26.310> machining

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
outside of the groove you're machining

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.760 
outside of the groove you're machining
in<00:01:26.880> there<00:01:28.280> you<00:01:29.900> machine<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.140> groove<00:01:31.590> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
in there you machine that groove the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.190 
in there you machine that groove the
same<00:01:31.979> diameter<00:01:32.340> as<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.729> piece<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.210> tube<00:01:33.570> that

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
same diameter as a piece of tube that

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.749 
same diameter as a piece of tube that
you've<00:01:34.350> got<00:01:34.560> which<00:01:34.740> but<00:01:34.920> it's<00:01:35.250> just<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.579> right

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
you've got which but it's just the right

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.910 
you've got which but it's just the right
size<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.360> basically<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.140> allow<00:01:37.350> those<00:01:37.590> jaws

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
size to basically and allow those jaws

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.590 
size to basically and allow those jaws
to<00:01:38.509> stand<00:01:39.509> proud<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.600> internal

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
to stand proud of the of the internal

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.719 
to stand proud of the of the internal
core<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.740> chucks<00:01:44.130> they've<00:01:44.310> got<00:01:44.490> room<00:01:44.700> to

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
core of that chucks they've got room to

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.370 
core of that chucks they've got room to
actually<00:01:45.149> grind<00:01:45.450> through<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:45.990> hitting<00:01:46.259> the

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
actually grind through that hitting the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.999 
actually grind through that hitting the
Chuck<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.340> then<00:01:48.090> basically<00:01:48.740> once<00:01:49.740> you've

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
Chuck and then basically once you've

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.039 
Chuck and then basically once you've
made<00:01:50.310> up<00:01:50.490> this<00:01:50.610> little<00:01:50.670> setup<00:01:51.210> done<00:01:51.630> your<00:01:51.810> slot

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
made up this little setup done your slot

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.499 
made up this little setup done your slot
then<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.649> groove<00:01:53.390> you<00:01:54.390> just<00:01:54.570> put<00:01:54.960> in<00:01:55.140> your

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
then you groove you just put in your

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.870 
then you groove you just put in your
piece<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.659> tubing

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
piece of tubing

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:07.420 
piece of tubing
tighten<00:01:59.570> up<00:01:59.630> your<00:01:59.780> chat<00:02:06.010> and<00:02:07.010> you're<00:02:07.130> good<00:02:07.310> to

tighten up your chat and you're good to

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.730 
tighten up your chat and you're good to
go

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
go

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.830 
go
put<00:02:09.740> in<00:02:09.860> your<00:02:10.009> grinder<00:02:10.429> and<00:02:12.190> do<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.310> grinding

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
put in your grinder and do the grinding

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.500 
put in your grinder and do the grinding
easy<00:02:15.490> okay<00:02:16.520> max<00:02:16.820> the<00:02:16.970> end<00:02:17.090> of<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.210> chocolate

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
easy okay max the end of the chocolate

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.430 
easy okay max the end of the chocolate
bit<00:02:17.690> but<00:02:17.810> there's<00:02:17.930> nothing<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.200> worry<00:02:18.260> about

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
bit but there's nothing to worry about

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.040 
bit but there's nothing to worry about
because<00:02:18.740> the<00:02:18.920> Chuck<00:02:19.130> is<00:02:19.280> still<00:02:19.490> with<00:02:19.670> it<00:02:20.050> still

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
because the Chuck is still with it still

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.050 
because the Chuck is still with it still
got<00:02:21.200> a<00:02:21.230> plain<00:02:21.950> face<00:02:22.220> on<00:02:22.520> that<00:02:22.610> so<00:02:22.850> you<00:02:22.910> can

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
got a plain face on that so you can

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.870 
got a plain face on that so you can
still<00:02:23.300> get<00:02:23.450> right<00:02:23.750> up<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:23.960> the<00:02:24.140> very<00:02:24.290> edge<00:02:24.880> you

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
still get right up to the very edge you

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.210 
still get right up to the very edge you
can<00:02:26.030> clean<00:02:26.240> it<00:02:26.270> up<00:02:26.450> out<00:02:26.600> if<00:02:26.840> you<00:02:26.960> want<00:02:27.170> to<00:02:27.380> and

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
can clean it up out if you want to and

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.449 
can clean it up out if you want to and
they<00:02:28.790> say<00:02:28.940> you<00:02:29.000> do<00:02:29.180> it<00:02:29.300> now<00:02:29.870> I<00:02:30.260> will<00:02:31.220> see<00:02:31.340> if<00:02:31.400> a

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
they say you do it now I will see if a

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.440 
they say you do it now I will see if a
scrolls<00:02:31.760> worn<00:02:32.290> or<00:02:33.520> or<00:02:34.520> loose<00:02:34.790> you<00:02:35.150> know<00:02:35.180> it

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
scrolls worn or or loose you know it

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.000 
scrolls worn or or loose you know it
can't<00:02:35.750> be<00:02:35.840> shimmed<00:02:36.080> easily<00:02:36.410> or<00:02:36.530> whatever<00:02:36.800> if

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
can't be shimmed easily or whatever if

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.680 
can't be shimmed easily or whatever if
there's<00:02:37.190> where<00:02:37.400> in<00:02:37.610> there<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:41.060> various<00:02:41.480> size

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
there's where in there the various size

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.230 
there's where in there the various size
jobs<00:02:42.080> are<00:02:42.230> going<00:02:42.350> to<00:02:42.410> be<00:02:42.760> have<00:02:43.760> varying

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
jobs are going to be have varying

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.990 
jobs are going to be have varying
degrees<00:02:44.300> of<00:02:44.780> wear<00:02:45.170> in<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.709> scroll<00:02:46.010> plate<00:02:46.820> so

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
degrees of wear in the scroll plate so

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.949 
degrees of wear in the scroll plate so
you're<00:02:47.120> never<00:02:47.270> going<00:02:47.420> to<00:02:47.450> get<00:02:47.630> a<00:02:47.660> hundred

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
you're never going to get a hundred

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.449 
you're never going to get a hundred
percent<00:02:48.200> but<00:02:48.500> this<00:02:48.620> will<00:02:48.770> get<00:02:48.920> it<00:02:48.950> as<00:02:49.160> good<00:02:49.190> as

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
percent but this will get it as good as

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.520 
percent but this will get it as good as
you're<00:02:49.610> going<00:02:49.730> to<00:02:49.820> get<00:02:50.000> it<00:02:50.120> and<00:02:50.270> also<00:02:51.080> nothing

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
you're going to get it and also nothing

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.410 
you're going to get it and also nothing
little<00:02:51.860> tip<00:02:52.070> is<00:02:52.250> when<00:02:52.430> you<00:02:52.580> do<00:02:52.730> your<00:02:52.910> grinding

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
little tip is when you do your grinding

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.979 
little tip is when you do your grinding
make<00:02:54.260> sure<00:02:54.500> you<00:02:54.830> put<00:02:55.760> some<00:02:55.790> texture<00:02:56.630> pen<00:02:56.870> on

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
make sure you put some texture pen on

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.490 
make sure you put some texture pen on
the<00:02:57.110> faces<00:02:57.530> before<00:02:57.650> you<00:02:57.890> grind<00:02:58.190> them<00:02:59.320> then<00:03:00.320> you

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
the faces before you grind them then you

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.990 
the faces before you grind them then you
can<00:03:00.620> see<00:03:00.830> how<00:03:01.010> you're<00:03:01.160> going<00:03:01.340> because<00:03:01.730> you<00:03:01.820> may

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
can see how you're going because you may

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.460 
can see how you're going because you may
only<00:03:02.120> have<00:03:02.570> to<00:03:02.750> do<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.080> one<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.890> one<00:03:04.040> jaw

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
only have to do the one the one jaw

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.630 
only have to do the one the one jaw
heavily<00:03:06.470> and<00:03:06.709> then<00:03:06.920> I<00:03:07.130> mean<00:03:07.280> you<00:03:07.370> don't<00:03:07.459> be

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
heavily and then I mean you don't be

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.370 
heavily and then I mean you don't be
growing<00:03:07.910> off<00:03:08.120> more<00:03:08.330> than<00:03:08.360> you<00:03:08.570> have<00:03:08.810> to<00:03:09.050> so

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
growing off more than you have to so

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.580 
growing off more than you have to so
basically<00:03:10.360> run<00:03:11.360> the<00:03:11.540> lathe<00:03:11.720> at<00:03:11.989> a<00:03:12.050> very<00:03:12.320> slow

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
basically run the lathe at a very slow

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:20.640 
basically run the lathe at a very slow
speed<00:03:12.620> so<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.519> know<00:03:13.880> 100<00:03:14.830> rpm<00:03:15.830> good<00:03:16.489> speed<00:03:16.790> and

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.620 

put<00:03:21.650> in<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:21.799> reverse<00:03:22.070> direction<00:03:22.100> to<00:03:22.549> the<00:03:22.670> the

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
put in the reverse direction to the the

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.410 
put in the reverse direction to the the
stone<00:03:24.400> spinning<00:03:25.400> all<00:03:25.519> those<00:03:25.700> at<00:03:26.030> that<00:03:26.209> speed

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
stone spinning all those at that speed

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.220 
stone spinning all those at that speed
it's<00:03:26.510> not<00:03:26.540> going<00:03:26.720> to<00:03:26.780> make<00:03:26.900> a<00:03:26.930> massive

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
it's not going to make a massive

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.860 
it's not going to make a massive
differences<00:03:27.799> this<00:03:27.950> is<00:03:28.070> doing<00:03:28.310> like<00:03:28.870> 30,000

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
differences this is doing like 30,000

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.590 
differences this is doing like 30,000
rpm<00:03:30.380> and<00:03:30.530> the<00:03:31.340> Chukchi<00:03:31.640> during<00:03:32.030> 100<00:03:32.180> so<00:03:32.570> you

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
rpm and the Chukchi during 100 so you

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.060 
rpm and the Chukchi during 100 so you
can<00:03:32.780> basically<00:03:32.900> go<00:03:33.410> either<00:03:33.560> direction<00:03:33.860> up

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
can basically go either direction up

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.590 
can basically go either direction up
tonight<00:03:34.310> I<00:03:34.340> make<00:03:34.580> a<00:03:34.610> big<00:03:34.910> difference<00:03:35.060> that<00:03:35.360> all

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
tonight I make a big difference that all

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.449 
tonight I make a big difference that all
really<00:03:35.900> but<00:03:36.590> anyway<00:03:36.680> generally<00:03:37.130> you<00:03:37.190> go<00:03:37.310> in

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
really but anyway generally you go in

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.789 
really but anyway generally you go in
reverse<00:03:37.610> so<00:03:38.030> yeah<00:03:38.870> put<00:03:39.049> your<00:03:39.080> texture<00:03:39.470> pen<00:03:39.650> on

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
reverse so yeah put your texture pen on

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:41.500 
reverse so yeah put your texture pen on
there<00:03:40.040> weather<00:03:40.640> then<00:03:40.820> when<00:03:40.940> you're<00:03:41.090> grinding

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
there weather then when you're grinding

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.420 
there weather then when you're grinding
you<00:03:42.080> can<00:03:42.230> see<00:03:42.500> how<00:03:42.680> you're<00:03:42.799> going<00:03:42.980> and<00:03:43.250> once

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
you can see how you're going and once

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.160 
you can see how you're going and once
you<00:03:43.760> just<00:03:44.000> stop<00:03:44.209> it<00:03:44.330> every<00:03:44.480> so<00:03:44.600> often<00:03:44.750> and<00:03:45.019> once

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
you just stop it every so often and once

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.710 
you just stop it every so often and once
you've<00:03:45.410> got<00:03:45.680> all<00:03:45.920> the<00:03:46.190> texture<00:03:46.489> pent<00:03:46.700> up<00:03:46.790> on<00:03:47.000> on

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
you've got all the texture pent up on on

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.620 
you've got all the texture pent up on on
all<00:03:47.900> three<00:03:48.200> jaws<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:49.130> full<00:03:49.370> length<00:03:49.610> jobs<00:03:50.360> done

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
all three jaws the full length jobs done

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.400 
all three jaws the full length jobs done
there<00:03:51.470> you<00:03:51.530> go<00:03:51.620> hope<00:03:51.950> that<00:03:52.070> helps
