00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.510
 hello you love to welcome 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.210
 a new episode of my series 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:19.080
 beautiful skin in this episode I speak 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.820
 over almond oil one oil works eleven 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.500
 lying and calming on the skin it 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.150
 makes dry and wrinkled skin again 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.939
 soft and supple and it calms down 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.279
 irritated and sensitive skin almond oil should 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.990
 so do not cause irritation 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.820
 It is very suitable for everyone 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.180
 skin type also for people with sensitive 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.010
 skin 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.440
 it's so mild it even for 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.200
 baby skin is suitable and for allergy sufferers 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.660
 and people with neurodermatitis is almond oil 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.390
 Rich in vitamin A vitamin E contains 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.910
 Many vitamins are folic acid and biotin 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.740
 vitamin e, for example, ensures that 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.200
 the skin better moisture storage 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.840
 can and thereby make you firmer and 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.120
 Plumper appears oil is also rich 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.610
 on minerals and trace elements it 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.760
 contains magnesium potassium calcium 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.189
 phosphorus sulfur iron zinc copper 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.409
 manganese and corridor it also has a high 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.479
 proportion of unsaturated fatty acids like this 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.970
 For example, it contains linoleic acid and 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.439
 which influences the cornification predecessor 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.869
 the skin it makes the skin 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.369
 more resistant to infections and 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.920
 builds up with a certain protection 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.289
 light effect on so if you the 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.299
 The sun is shining and then a bit UV protection 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.249
 If oil is still contained, it also contains paul metin 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.350
 acid and which ensures a good one 

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:30.569
 Training into the skin and the skin 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.700
 one makes equally advantageous because the 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:34.079
 all good inner city 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.999
 loud and not just as a movie 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:40.200
 stay on it because that's the skin 

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:41.460
 just nice and soft and smooth so me 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.850
 I have two different ones here now 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.810
 I have almond oil as almond oil 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.810
 from primavera 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.840
 That's 100 % almond oil now 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:56.999
 and it has all these too 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.549
 certificates so this bunny for 

00:01:56.999 --> 00:02:01.950
 animal welfare and just this certificate 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.659
 for natural cosmetics and so that's it 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.609
 already organic 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.780
 that's why it's supposed to be a bit 

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:12.240
 expensive so that oil now has about 12 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.550
 euro cost you can but also 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.890
 be sure of what you are so you know 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.840
 here is really only organic almond oil 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.090
 at least that's what it should be 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.790
 stands nicely on it that first beautiful 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.590
 I also give certificates and everything 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.020
 like to spend some money on it 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.000
 yes read aloud basta so it says that 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.430
 classic oil for gentle care of 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.430
 Skin works well with essential oil 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.560
 mix the pale yellow gives the skin 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.450
 Damp moisture makes them 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.640
 Supple and protects it promotes the 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.410
 circulation and has a calming effect 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.140
 irritated skin for all skin types 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.900
 suitable especially effective in dry 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.420
 sensitive and brittle skin yes how 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.150
 As you know where you are 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:03:00.140
 but then I have this too 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:04.970
 change and that is from katy almen and 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:08.760
 yes there is not so much here today 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.810
 but it only cost two euros 99 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.510
 I have that now in an Indian 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.650
 shop bought and the saleswoman has 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.830
 I also assured that that 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.690
 100% almond oil is 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.280
 Unfortunately, nothing stands on it 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.620
 not even 100 percent somewhere 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.970
 that's why you can not quite do it 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.290
 be sure what is there now 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.840
 really is in it 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.600
 that's why I use this primavera 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.340
 almond oil for the face and this one 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.739
 I use it more for the body 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.870
 So it is best to apply it 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.280
 if you take the almond oil after the shower 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.470
 or after washing in the still 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.000
 then damp skin can be massaged 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.010
 Moisture along with the almond oil 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.360
 nice to move into the skin and then 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.430
 is she just nice and soft 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.170
 Almond oil is generally supple 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.030
 of course, more suitable for people with 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.100
 dry skin or so for dry skin 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.110
 Provide as for example at the elbow at 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.940
 too brittle or something but I can do it 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.090
 Also very recommendable as a face care 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.910
 Personally, I have such a skin on me 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.230
 with a few pimples here and there and me 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.459
 still think it's very nice 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.920
 I also have facial care 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.150
 nothing somehow notices that it pimples 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.709
 would cause 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.570
 I even believe my house through 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.579
 This one is still lately 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.260
 got better I also have the 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.720
 forum read that manuel pimple 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.850
 should cause so 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.370
 I think especially if you pimple 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.930
 and you with strong aggressive 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:28.550
 mean death dries that one 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.100
 calming care with change behind 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.330
 That would be quite advantageous because of that I can 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.730
 in any case as well 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:39.560
 he may recommend face care 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:41.150
 then such a certified one wants and 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.100
 not like where else maybe 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.290
 be any other oils in it 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.670
 he could know something could happen there 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.630
 still be mixed to what now 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.300
 maybe not bad for the skin 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.670
 is what could induce beijing 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.620
 That's why I do not advise you this way 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.450
 being stingy but always like that 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.200
 spend a bit more money for that 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:02.780
 a organic almond oil yes you can almond oil 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.370
 also in the nail bed and in the nails 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.680
 Massage and that really makes a lot 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.420
 beautiful strong nails and that makes them 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.140
 so shine a bit I know 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.370
 as you can see it 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.930
 So it's really a beautiful one 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.300
 nail care I think I was too 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.280
 quite like so it was already too 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.460
 almond oil I hope you can get one 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.280
 good tip give further help you 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.990
 and then I wish you one more 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.440
 nice week and see you in the 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.440
 next video 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:42.259
 almond oil should not cause skin irritation 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:44.149
 cause it makes it dry 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:46.689
 dry and wrinkled skin again soft 

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:49.759
 and supple and it calms down 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:53.449
 irritated sensitive and it is even so 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:55.459
 mild almond oil also contains many 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:59.869
 minerals and trace elements it 

00:05:55.459 --> 00:06:03.349
 contains magnesium powder that is only the 

00:05:59.869 --> 00:06:05.860
 traces of the world entirely new dect kuhlmann 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:10.599
 contain oil 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:14.289
 It contains magnesium potassium calcium 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:18.619
 phosphor boots iron 10 copper manganese 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:24.439
 and thereby the skin is generally complained 

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:26.809
 and certificates so this bunny for 

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:30.860
 nature conservation of course the bunny 

00:06:26.809 --> 00:06:32.240
 stands for nature conservation so clearly thinks there 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.330
 Do you ever drop a drop 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.969
 1000 made out 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:41.019
 otherwise I have my nose turns 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:44.300
 to set the whole society 

00:06:41.019 --> 00:06:47.050
 Do you recognize my face? 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.050
 Do not face it here
