00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:04.519 

so<00:00:00.989> we<00:00:01.170> just<00:00:01.350> talked<00:00:01.620> about<00:00:02.240> preload<00:00:03.410> and<00:00:04.410> we

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
so we just talked about preload and we

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.880 
so we just talked about preload and we
talked<00:00:04.740> about<00:00:04.859> afterload<00:00:06.170> so<00:00:07.170> I<00:00:07.200> want<00:00:07.589> to<00:00:07.680> just

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
talked about afterload so I want to just

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.620 
talked about afterload so I want to just
kind<00:00:08.189> of<00:00:08.220> explain<00:00:08.340> proof<00:00:09.150> actually<00:00:09.389> we<00:00:09.599> just

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
kind of explain proof actually we just

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.270 
kind of explain proof actually we just
talked<00:00:09.929> about<00:00:10.019> pre<00:00:10.320> low<00:00:10.469> so<00:00:11.010> I<00:00:11.070> want<00:00:11.219> to

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
talked about pre low so I want to

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.190 
talked about pre low so I want to
explain<00:00:11.639> what<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.269> preload<00:00:12.690> about<00:00:12.960> with<00:00:13.110> the

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
explain what the preload about with the

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.880 
explain what the preload about with the
rubberband<00:00:13.559> so<00:00:13.769> remember<00:00:14.160> preload<00:00:14.700> is

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:15.890 
rubberband so remember preload is

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.140 
rubberband so remember preload is
basically<00:00:16.890> you're<00:00:17.130> loading<00:00:17.520> up<00:00:17.730> the

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
basically you're loading up the

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.150 
basically you're loading up the
ventricles<00:00:18.930> with<00:00:19.080> blood<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.650> again<00:00:20.010> we're

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
ventricles with blood and again we're

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.290 
ventricles with blood and again we're
mainly<00:00:20.430> going<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.640> talk<00:00:20.789> about<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.150> left

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
mainly going to talk about the left

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.580 
mainly going to talk about the left
ventricle<00:00:21.779> because<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.020> left<00:00:22.199> ventricle

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
ventricle because the left ventricle

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.019 
ventricle because the left ventricle
gets<00:00:22.769> all<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.070> glory<00:00:23.189> because<00:00:23.580> it's<00:00:23.730> pumping

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
gets all the glory because it's pumping

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.099 
gets all the glory because it's pumping
the<00:00:24.119> blood<00:00:24.300> out<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.570> rest<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.900> body

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
the blood out to the rest of the body

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.500 
the blood out to the rest of the body
but<00:00:25.890> both<00:00:26.039> ventricles<00:00:26.310> are<00:00:26.699> being<00:00:27.119> loaded<00:00:27.300> up

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
but both ventricles are being loaded up

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.359 
but both ventricles are being loaded up
with<00:00:27.720> their<00:00:27.869> blood<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.230> preload<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.949> as<00:00:29.099> the

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
with their blood so preload is as the

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.209 
with their blood so preload is as the
during<00:00:30.240> diastole<00:00:30.810> as<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.529> ventricles<00:00:31.740> are

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
during diastole as the ventricles are

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.810 
during diastole as the ventricles are
filling<00:00:32.850> with<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:34.079> blood<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:35.040> we<00:00:35.579> talked

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
filling with that blood and we talked

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.880 
filling with that blood and we talked
about<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.149> frank-starling<00:00:36.540> law<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.620> greater

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
about the frank-starling law the greater

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.580 
about the frank-starling law the greater
the<00:00:38.100> stretch<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:39.149> more<00:00:39.480> powerful<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.320> force

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
the stretch the more powerful the force

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.350 
the stretch the more powerful the force
of<00:00:40.770> contraction<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.879> can<00:00:42.030> use<00:00:42.180> that

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
of contraction and you can use that

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.030 
of contraction and you can use that
concept<00:00:42.600> with<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.050> rubber<00:00:43.230> bands<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.800> if<00:00:43.920> you

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
concept with the rubber bands so if you

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.069 
concept with the rubber bands so if you
take<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.250> rubber<00:00:44.460> band<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.090> really<00:00:45.809> kind

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
take a rubber band and you really kind

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.049 
take a rubber band and you really kind
of<00:00:46.110> pull<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.469> back<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.890> further<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.700> pull<00:00:47.910> it

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
of pull it back the further you pull it

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.220 
of pull it back the further you pull it
back<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.840> then<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.860> go<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.070> let<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.610> go<00:00:51.230> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
back and then you go to let it go the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.139 
back and then you go to let it go the
further<00:00:52.559> it's<00:00:52.800> going<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.070> fly<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.910> pretty

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
further it's going to fly and it pretty

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.670 
further it's going to fly and it pretty
much<00:00:54.239> almost<00:00:54.629> hit<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.840> wall<00:00:55.260> there<00:00:55.469> if<00:00:55.559> you

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
much almost hit that wall there if you

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.010 
much almost hit that wall there if you
didn't<00:00:55.890> quite<00:00:56.070> see<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.449> but<00:00:57.449> if<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.809> don't

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
didn't quite see that but if you don't

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.420 
didn't quite see that but if you don't
pull<00:00:58.289> back<00:00:58.500> as<00:00:58.710> far<00:01:00.859> then<00:01:01.859> it's<00:01:01.890> not<00:01:02.219> going<00:01:02.340> to

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
pull back as far then it's not going to

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.670 
pull back as far then it's not going to
go<00:01:02.550> as<00:01:02.730> far<00:01:02.940> right<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.780> same<00:01:04.080> concept<00:01:04.589> with

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
go as far right and same concept with

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.580 
go as far right and same concept with
preload<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.820> more<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:07.080> load<00:01:07.350> up<00:01:07.380> that

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
preload the more you load up that

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.380 
preload the more you load up that
ventricle<00:01:08.460> with<00:01:08.610> blood<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.090> more<00:01:09.270> it

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
ventricle with blood the more it

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.500 
ventricle with blood the more it
stretches<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.200> fills<00:01:10.500> with<00:01:10.710> blood<00:01:11.360> then<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
stretches and fills with blood then the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.060 
stretches and fills with blood then the
more<00:01:12.720> powerful<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.439> force<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.920> contraction

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
more powerful that force of contraction

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.670 
more powerful that force of contraction
is<00:01:14.670> going<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.970> be<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.960> more<00:01:16.229> that's<00:01:16.500> going

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
is going to be and the more that's going

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.109 
is going to be and the more that's going
to<00:01:16.740> be<00:01:16.830> injected<00:01:17.310> out<00:01:17.460> or<00:01:17.759> you're<00:01:17.909> going<00:01:18.000> to

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
to be injected out or you're going to

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.240 
to be injected out or you're going to
increase<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.659> stroke<00:01:18.960> volume<00:01:19.200> or<00:01:19.799> includes

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
increase that stroke volume or includes

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.789 
increase that stroke volume or includes
that<00:01:20.400> cardiac<00:01:20.759> output<00:01:21.270> now<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.439> under

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
that cardiac output now this is under

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.700 
that cardiac output now this is under
normal<00:01:23.240> physiologic<00:01:24.240> conditions<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:25.560> you've

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
normal physiologic conditions so you've

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.880 
normal physiologic conditions so you've
got<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> normal<00:01:26.460> healthy<00:01:27.380> ventricle<00:01:28.380> that's

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
got a normal healthy ventricle that's

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.950 
got a normal healthy ventricle that's
able<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.310> stretch<00:01:29.640> well<00:01:30.000> well<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.750> then

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
able to stretch well well and then

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.290 
able to stretch well well and then
recoil<00:01:31.560> well

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
recoil well

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.560 
recoil well
pumps<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:32.990> blood<00:01:33.260> out<00:01:33.970> but<00:01:34.970> there's<00:01:35.300> things

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
pumps the blood out but there's things

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.810 
pumps the blood out but there's things
that<00:01:35.780> can<00:01:35.930> happen<00:01:36.320> that<00:01:36.590> can<00:01:36.950> change<00:01:37.280> that

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
that can happen that can change that

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.000 
that can happen that can change that
ventricle<00:01:38.480> that<00:01:38.930> could<00:01:39.080> certainly<00:01:39.350> affect

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
ventricle that could certainly affect

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.380 
ventricle that could certainly affect
its<00:01:40.310> ability<00:01:40.460> to<00:01:40.850> pump<00:01:41.690> and<00:01:42.620> to<00:01:43.390> forget

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
its ability to pump and to forget

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.540 
its ability to pump and to forget
cardiac<00:01:44.810> outfit<00:01:45.260> so<00:01:45.650> let's<00:01:45.860> say<00:01:46.040> over<00:01:46.520> a

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
cardiac outfit so let's say over a

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.400 
cardiac outfit so let's say over a

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
lifetime we've been really stretching

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.730 
lifetime we've been really stretching

stretch<00:01:52.250> recoil<00:01:52.910> stretch<00:01:53.360> recoil<00:01:53.990> what

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
stretch recoil stretch recoil what

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.050 
stretch recoil stretch recoil what
starts<00:01:54.860> to<00:01:54.920> happen<00:01:55.010> to<00:01:55.460> that<00:01:55.490> rubber<00:01:55.970> band

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
starts to happen to that rubber band

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.060 
starts to happen to that rubber band
what<00:01:56.810> starts<00:01:57.050> to<00:01:57.080> happen<00:01:57.140> to<00:01:57.500> that<00:01:57.530> elasticity

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
what starts to happen to that elasticity

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.120 
what starts to happen to that elasticity
yeah<00:01:58.850> it<00:01:59.060> start<00:01:59.390> it<00:01:59.930> starts<00:02:00.290> to<00:02:00.530> lose<00:02:00.950> that

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
yeah it start it starts to lose that

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.100 
yeah it start it starts to lose that
elasticity<00:02:01.700> so<00:02:02.420> when<00:02:02.570> you<00:02:02.630> start<00:02:02.870> to<00:02:02.990> lose

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
elasticity so when you start to lose

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.410 
elasticity so when you start to lose
that<00:02:03.170> elasticity<00:02:03.830> the<00:02:04.520> same<00:02:04.820> thing<00:02:05.060> happens

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
that elasticity the same thing happens

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.300 
that elasticity the same thing happens
to<00:02:05.480> the<00:02:05.660> stretch<00:02:05.960> fibers<00:02:06.410> and<00:02:06.620> the<00:02:06.980> muscle

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
to the stretch fibers and the muscle

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.460 
to the stretch fibers and the muscle
fibers<00:02:07.700> of<00:02:07.940> the<00:02:08.270> heart<00:02:08.540> it<00:02:08.899> starts<00:02:09.230> to<00:02:09.320> lose

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
fibers of the heart it starts to lose

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.070 
fibers of the heart it starts to lose
that<00:02:09.649> elasticity<00:02:10.429> so<00:02:10.640> then<00:02:11.630> when<00:02:11.750> you<00:02:11.840> start

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
that elasticity so then when you start

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.170 
that elasticity so then when you start
to<00:02:12.140> lose<00:02:12.260> that<00:02:12.320> elasticity<00:02:12.890> when<00:02:13.730> you<00:02:13.850> stretch

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
to lose that elasticity when you stretch

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.420 
to lose that elasticity when you stretch
it<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.660> goes<00:02:14.810> to<00:02:14.990> recoil<00:02:15.410> it's<00:02:15.980> not<00:02:16.220> going

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
it and it goes to recoil it's not going

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.160 
it and it goes to recoil it's not going
to<00:02:16.490> recoil<00:02:16.940> as<00:02:17.120> much<00:02:17.390> because<00:02:17.600> it's<00:02:17.810> lost<00:02:17.990> that

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
to recoil as much because it's lost that

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.260 
to recoil as much because it's lost that
elasticity<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:19.370> that's<00:02:19.640> even<00:02:20.060> have

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
elasticity and that's even have

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.030 
elasticity and that's even have
decreased<00:02:20.720> stroke<00:02:20.990> volume<00:02:21.170> decrease<00:02:21.770> cardiac

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
decreased stroke volume decrease cardiac

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.980 
decreased stroke volume decrease cardiac
output<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:22.820> the<00:02:23.210> heart's<00:02:23.510> not<00:02:23.690> going<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:23.930> be

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
output and the heart's not going to be

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.360 
output and the heart's not going to be
able<00:02:24.080> to<00:02:24.200> pump<00:02:24.530> as<00:02:24.830> well<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:25.160> you're<00:02:25.250> not

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
able to pump as well and you're not

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.400 
able to pump as well and you're not
going<00:02:25.580> to<00:02:25.640> have<00:02:25.790> that<00:02:25.970> frank-starling<00:02:26.390> law<00:02:26.720> or

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
going to have that frank-starling law or

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.380 
going to have that frank-starling law or
that<00:02:27.440> increased<00:02:28.010> force<00:02:28.580> of<00:02:28.730> construction

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
that increased force of construction

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.770 
that increased force of construction
happening<00:02:31.000> now<00:02:32.000> some<00:02:32.270> things<00:02:32.480> that<00:02:32.660> can

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
happening now some things that can

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.160 
happening now some things that can
affect<00:02:32.870> that<00:02:33.230> age<00:02:33.560> can<00:02:34.040> affect<00:02:34.370> that<00:02:34.580> so<00:02:35.360> when

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
affect that age can affect that so when

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.540 
affect that age can affect that so when
we<00:02:36.350> start<00:02:36.650> to<00:02:36.800> right<00:02:37.160> now<00:02:37.280> we're<00:02:37.459> just

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
we start to right now we're just

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.420 
we start to right now we're just
explaining<00:02:37.970> normal<00:02:38.780> concepts<00:02:39.320> but<00:02:40.070> when<00:02:40.310> we

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
explaining normal concepts but when we

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.699 
explaining normal concepts but when we
talk<00:02:40.640> about<00:02:40.670> heart<00:02:41.360> failure

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
talk about heart failure

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.530 
talk about heart failure
the<00:02:43.010> majority<00:02:43.550> of<00:02:43.580> cases<00:02:43.850> of<00:02:44.180> heart<00:02:44.360> failure

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
the majority of cases of heart failure

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.720 
the majority of cases of heart failure
but<00:02:44.750> 85%<00:02:45.260> in<00:02:45.620> cases<00:02:45.950> of<00:02:46.040> heart<00:02:46.220> failure<00:02:46.400> are

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
but 85% in cases of heart failure are

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.900 
but 85% in cases of heart failure are
related<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.420> old<00:02:48.200> age<00:02:48.380> so<00:02:48.709> most<00:02:49.160> mostly<00:02:49.700> people

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
related to old age so most mostly people

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.280 
related to old age so most mostly people
that<00:02:50.150> are<00:02:50.270> older<00:02:50.450> that<00:02:50.660> you<00:02:50.840> see<00:02:51.020> them<00:02:51.170> with

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
that are older that you see them with

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.630 
that are older that you see them with
heart<00:02:51.470> failure<00:02:51.940> also<00:02:53.050> hyper<00:02:54.250> tension<00:02:55.250> you

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
heart failure also hyper tension you

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.949 
heart failure also hyper tension you
know<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.910> heart<00:02:56.150> happen<00:02:56.450> to<00:02:56.510> really<00:02:56.660> work

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
know the heart happen to really work

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.170 
know the heart happen to really work
hard<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.380> pump<00:02:57.680> blood<00:02:57.860> out<00:02:58.190> into<00:02:58.730> a<00:02:58.760> system

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
hard to pump blood out into a system

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.240 
hard to pump blood out into a system
where<00:02:59.239> it's<00:02:59.420> more<00:02:59.540> constricted<00:03:00.230> that<00:03:01.070> can

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
where it's more constricted that can

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.550 
where it's more constricted that can
cause<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:01.850> ventricles<00:03:02.660> to<00:03:02.810> over<00:03:03.080> stretch<00:03:03.260> and

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
cause the ventricles to over stretch and

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.900 
cause the ventricles to over stretch and
over<00:03:03.739> stretch<00:03:04.010> over<00:03:04.280> time<00:03:04.489> they<00:03:04.640> start<00:03:04.670> to

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
over stretch over time they start to

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.060 
over stretch over time they start to
lose<00:03:05.120> its<00:03:05.270> elasticity<00:03:05.720> if<00:03:06.530> someone<00:03:06.860> has<00:03:07.040> a

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
lose its elasticity if someone has a

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.420 
lose its elasticity if someone has a
damaged<00:03:07.790> area<00:03:08.209> in<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.959> ventricles<00:03:09.830> let's<00:03:10.310> say

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
damaged area in the ventricles let's say

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.030 
damaged area in the ventricles let's say

excusa they've had an mi and they have a
damaged<00:03:18.100> area<00:03:18.520> that<00:03:18.850> area<00:03:19.060> would<00:03:19.360> have<00:03:19.480> lost

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
damaged area that area would have lost

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.420 
damaged area that area would have lost
its<00:03:19.960> elasticity<00:03:20.440> or<00:03:20.800> no<00:03:20.950> longer<00:03:21.250> has

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
its elasticity or no longer has

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.670 
its elasticity or no longer has
elasticity<00:03:21.970> and<00:03:22.450> that's<00:03:22.930> gonna<00:03:23.110> affect<00:03:23.320> its

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
elasticity and that's gonna affect its

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.970 
elasticity and that's gonna affect its
ability<00:03:23.770> to<00:03:24.130> stretch<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:25.270> fill<00:03:25.450> blood<00:03:25.980> and

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
ability to stretch and fill blood and

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.500 
ability to stretch and fill blood and
then<00:03:27.190> it's<00:03:27.490> going<00:03:27.640> to<00:03:27.700> overall<00:03:28.060> affect<00:03:28.360> its

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
then it's going to overall affect its

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.320 
then it's going to overall affect its
ability<00:03:28.600> when<00:03:29.140> it<00:03:29.260> pumps<00:03:29.950> what<00:03:30.250> so<00:03:30.820> that's<00:03:30.970> a

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
ability when it pumps what so that's a

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.920 
ability when it pumps what so that's a
preload<00:03:31.959> and<00:03:32.230> then<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:32.830> other<00:03:33.190> one<00:03:33.730> is<00:03:34.150> after

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
preload and then the other one is after

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.290 
preload and then the other one is after
load<00:03:35.470> and<00:03:35.800> I'm<00:03:36.130> going<00:03:36.310> to<00:03:36.370> use<00:03:36.520> the<00:03:36.700> door<00:03:37.000> here

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
load and I'm going to use the door here

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.720 
load and I'm going to use the door here
to<00:03:37.510> explain<00:03:37.930> a<00:03:38.200> preload<00:03:38.590> that<00:03:38.860> after<00:03:39.490> load

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
to explain a preload that after load

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.260 
to explain a preload that after load
preload<00:03:40.630> is<00:03:41.020> your<00:03:41.620> during<00:03:42.130> diastole<00:03:42.700> they're

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
preload is your during diastole they're

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.030 
preload is your during diastole they're
loading<00:03:43.600> up<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:43.840> ventricle<00:03:44.350> with<00:03:44.530> blood<00:03:44.800> and

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
loading up the ventricle with blood and

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.890 
loading up the ventricle with blood and
it's<00:03:45.190> basically<00:03:45.610> help<00:03:45.940> all<00:03:46.120> those<00:03:46.270> ventricles

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
it's basically help all those ventricles

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.440 
it's basically help all those ventricles
can<00:03:47.080> really<00:03:47.350> stretch<00:03:47.830> and<00:03:48.190> fill<00:03:48.459> with<00:03:49.090> blood

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
can really stretch and fill with blood

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.510 
can really stretch and fill with blood
so<00:03:50.020> that<00:03:50.050> they<00:03:50.290> can<00:03:50.709> have<00:03:50.830> a<00:03:50.860> nice<00:03:51.130> powerful

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
so that they can have a nice powerful

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.090 
so that they can have a nice powerful
contraction<00:03:52.300> to<00:03:52.390> pump<00:03:52.630> the<00:03:52.750> blood<00:03:52.959> out<00:03:53.100> after

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
contraction to pump the blood out after

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.710 
contraction to pump the blood out after
load<00:03:54.340> is<00:03:54.489> when<00:03:54.670> the<00:03:54.760> blood<00:03:55.000> is<00:03:55.030> actually<00:03:55.570> being

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
load is when the blood is actually being

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.440 
load is when the blood is actually being
pumped<00:03:56.140> out<00:03:56.410> so<00:03:56.709> you<00:03:56.800> can<00:03:56.950> think<00:03:57.190> of<00:03:57.340> it<00:03:57.489> as<00:03:57.730> the

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
pumped out so you can think of it as the

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.199 
pumped out so you can think of it as the
heart<00:03:58.989> is<00:03:59.200> offloading<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:00.430> blood<00:04:00.730> or<00:04:01.030> it<00:04:01.120> is

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
heart is offloading the blood or it is

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.300 
heart is offloading the blood or it is
pumping<00:04:01.660> the<00:04:01.810> blood<00:04:01.930> so<00:04:02.410> preload<00:04:02.860> it<00:04:03.010> is<00:04:03.100> it's

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
pumping the blood so preload it is it's

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.130 
pumping the blood so preload it is it's
stretching<00:04:03.640> and<00:04:03.910> filling<00:04:04.270> with<00:04:04.420> blood<00:04:04.450> and

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
stretching and filling with blood and

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.630 
stretching and filling with blood and
frank-starling<00:04:05.500> law<00:04:05.860> the<00:04:06.250> greater<00:04:06.489> the

in order to open up that air to go and

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.020 
in order to open up that air to go and

pump the blood out into the rest of the

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.890 
pump the blood out into the rest of the
system<00:04:50.340> so<00:04:51.340> do<00:04:52.030> you<00:04:52.180> think<00:04:52.390> are<00:04:52.510> some<00:04:52.630> things

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
system so do you think are some things

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.140 
system so do you think are some things
that<00:04:53.080> could<00:04:53.169> affect<00:04:53.290> after<00:04:53.979> load<00:04:54.190> yes<00:04:54.729> so<00:04:55.060> we

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
that could affect after load yes so we

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.060 
that could affect after load yes so we
talked<00:04:55.360> about<00:04:55.450> hypertension<00:04:56.070> hypertension

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
talked about hypertension hypertension

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.450 
talked about hypertension hypertension
can<00:04:57.220> indirectly<00:04:57.790> affect<00:04:58.210> preload<00:04:58.810> that<00:04:59.710> when

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
can indirectly affect preload that when

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.640 
can indirectly affect preload that when
the<00:05:00.550> heart<00:05:01.210> has<00:05:01.270> to<00:05:01.419> work<00:05:01.900> really<00:05:02.169> hard<00:05:02.470> to

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
the heart has to work really hard to

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:03.580 
the heart has to work really hard to
pump<00:05:03.010> out

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
pump out

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.760 
pump out
blood<00:05:03.950> it<00:05:04.220> can<00:05:04.340> lose<00:05:04.460> a<00:05:04.520> stretch<00:05:04.850> over<00:05:05.150> time

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
blood it can lose a stretch over time

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.660 
blood it can lose a stretch over time
hypertension<00:05:06.770> can<00:05:06.950> directly<00:05:07.490> affect

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670 
hypertension can directly affect

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.960 
hypertension can directly affect
afterload<00:05:08.600> so<00:05:08.840> think<00:05:09.110> about<00:05:09.200> out<00:05:09.500> here<00:05:09.970> our

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
afterload so think about out here our

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.240 
afterload so think about out here our
Cheerilee<00:05:11.510> your<00:05:11.900> aorta<00:05:12.620> and<00:05:12.890> then<00:05:13.010> most<00:05:13.190> of

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
Cheerilee your aorta and then most of

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.790 
Cheerilee your aorta and then most of
your<00:05:13.370> arteries<00:05:13.700> are<00:05:13.730> more<00:05:14.060> constricted<00:05:14.800> that

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
your arteries are more constricted that

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.180 
your arteries are more constricted that
sucks<00:05:16.040> ventricle<00:05:16.640> have<00:05:17.330> to<00:05:17.630> pump<00:05:18.470> harder<00:05:18.770> and

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
sucks ventricle have to pump harder and

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.800 
sucks ventricle have to pump harder and
it's<00:05:19.370> going<00:05:19.550> to<00:05:19.640> be<00:05:19.790> a<00:05:19.970> lot<00:05:20.210> more<00:05:20.240> resistance

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
it's going to be a lot more resistance

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.640 
it's going to be a lot more resistance
and<00:05:21.380> as<00:05:22.130> it<00:05:22.430> opens<00:05:22.580> up<00:05:22.910> they<00:05:23.030> are<00:05:23.060> at<00:05:23.330> valve<00:05:23.650> the

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
and as it opens up they are at valve the

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.500 
and as it opens up they are at valve the
pump<00:05:24.920> blood<00:05:25.130> out<00:05:25.370> into<00:05:25.700> a<00:05:25.730> system<00:05:26.120> that's<00:05:26.180> more

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
pump blood out into a system that's more

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.270 
pump blood out into a system that's more
constricted<00:05:26.930> that<00:05:27.560> would<00:05:27.710> definitely

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
constricted that would definitely

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.790 
constricted that would definitely
increase<00:05:28.820> the<00:05:29.270> after<00:05:29.630> load<00:05:29.780> so<00:05:30.290> someone<00:05:30.650> had

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
increase the after load so someone had

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.150 
increase the after load so someone had
hypertension<00:05:31.610> that<00:05:32.500> left<00:05:33.500> ventricles<00:05:33.950> going

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
hypertension that left ventricles going

it's<00:05:48.650> a<00:05:48.830> preload<00:05:49.160> yeah<00:05:50.150> if<00:05:50.630> this<00:05:50.870> Eric<00:05:51.350> valve

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
it's a preload yeah if this Eric valve

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.580 
it's a preload yeah if this Eric valve
is<00:05:52.010> stiff<00:05:52.640> or<00:05:52.970> stenotic<00:05:53.390> we<00:05:53.810> call<00:05:54.020> that<00:05:54.170> Eric

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.590 
is stiff or stenotic we call that Eric

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
more stiff as stenotic it's not going to

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.000 
more stiff as stenotic it's not going to
stretch<00:06:05.030> as<00:06:05.180> well<00:06:05.210> and<00:06:06.080> basically<00:06:06.200> that<00:06:06.800> left
