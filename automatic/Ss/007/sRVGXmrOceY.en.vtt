twice a day I teach them to behave no

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.289

fighting no bad manners and they learn

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.830

to<00:01:34.049> sit<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.829> wait<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.460> then<00:01:35.880> their<00:01:36.090> release<00:01:36.509> I

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
to sit and wait and then their release I

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.710 
to sit and wait and then their release I
think<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.560> dogs<00:01:37.890> are<00:01:38.369> quite<00:01:38.909> strong<00:01:39.479> in

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
think that dogs are quite strong in

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.140 
think that dogs are quite strong in
human<00:01:40.320> psyche<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.340> think<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:42.000> it's

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
human psyche and I think that it's

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.389 
human psyche and I think that it's
really<00:01:42.570> important<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.079> dogs<00:01:43.860> are<00:01:44.040> part<00:01:44.220> of

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
really important that dogs are part of

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.399 
really important that dogs are part of
family<00:01:44.729> life<00:01:44.909> whether<00:01:45.479> there<00:01:45.720> be<00:01:45.869> pets<00:01:46.170> or

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
family life whether there be pets or

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.200 
family life whether there be pets or
working<00:01:46.740> dogs<00:01:46.979> they<00:01:47.729> give<00:01:48.000> that

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
working dogs they give that

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.840 
working dogs they give that
unconditional<00:01:49.049> love<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.530> at<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.490> end<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.759> the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850
