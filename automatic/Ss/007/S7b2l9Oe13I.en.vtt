choice<00:02:36.370> I<00:02:36.700> made<00:02:37.060> it<00:02:37.239> in<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:38.879> play<00:02:39.879> through

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
choice I made it in the play through

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.699 
choice I made it in the play through
videos<00:02:40.390> where<00:02:40.629> I<00:02:40.659> don't<00:02:40.870> have<00:02:40.989> commentary<00:02:41.439> and

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
videos where I don't have commentary and

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.550 
videos where I don't have commentary and
this<00:02:42.579> here<00:02:43.000> is<00:02:43.030> why<00:02:43.420> we<00:02:43.569> made<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.840> backup<00:02:44.260> save
