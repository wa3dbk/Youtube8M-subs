I'll<00:02:24.170> go<00:02:24.470> through<00:02:24.740> some<00:02:24.950> of<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.190> flags<00:02:26.020> it's

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
I'll go through some of the flags it's

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.080 
I'll go through some of the flags it's
very<00:02:27.290> it's<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.830> self-explanatory<00:02:28.430> once<00:02:28.970> you

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
very it's a self-explanatory once you

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.990 
very it's a self-explanatory once you
once<00:02:29.360> you<00:02:29.450> start<00:02:29.510> using<00:02:29.960> it<00:02:30.260> we<00:02:31.250> put<00:02:31.460> it<00:02:31.580> down

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
once you start using it we put it down

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.730 
once you start using it we put it down
just<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:32.750> one<00:02:33.820> create<00:02:34.820> your<00:02:35.000> zone<00:02:35.440> which<00:02:36.440> can

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
just the one create your zone which can

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.640 
just the one create your zone which can
overlap<00:02:37.190> so<00:02:37.610> I<00:02:37.640> could<00:02:37.880> put<00:02:38.030> another<00:02:38.210> one<00:02:38.450> here

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610 
that's got all of the information you

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.269 
that's got all of the information you
might<00:06:15.759> need<00:06:15.819> outside<00:06:16.719> of<00:06:17.199> this<00:06:17.379> we're

00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:18.279 
might need outside of this we're

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:20.459 
might need outside of this we're
hopefully<00:06:19.120> going<00:06:19.300> to<00:06:19.389> add<00:06:19.599> some<00:06:19.900> other<00:06:20.050> ores

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:20.469

and iron ore in the future but that's

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:33.360 
and iron ore in the future but that's
something<00:06:32.020> we're<00:06:32.139> working<00:06:32.349> on<00:06:32.740> but<00:06:32.979> until
