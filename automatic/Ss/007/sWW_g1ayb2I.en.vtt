00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
ones I have really tiny nail so I had to

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.630 
ones I have really tiny nail so I had to
file<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.140> edges<00:01:01.590> down<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.039> sides<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.489> my

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.200 
file the edges down the sides of my
nails<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.750> make<00:01:03.930> them<00:01:04.170> skinnier<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.850> then<00:01:06.150> I

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
nails to make them skinnier and then I

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.450 
nails to make them skinnier and then I
also<00:01:06.390> trimmed<00:01:06.930> them<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.470> cut<00:01:07.830> them<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.369> then

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
also trimmed them so I cut them and then

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.100 
also trimmed them so I cut them and then
filed<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.659> edges<00:01:11.450> because<00:01:12.450> they<00:01:12.659> were<00:01:12.720> way

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
filed the edges because they were way

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.719 
filed the edges because they were way
too<00:01:13.140> long<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:16.130> didn't<00:01:17.130> file<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
too long and so I didn't file the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.050 
too long and so I didn't file the
thumbnail<00:01:18.180> that's<00:01:18.420> how<00:01:18.630> long<00:01:18.869> they<00:01:19.830> can<00:01:20.100> so

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
pretty quickly and they feel pretty

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.380 
pretty quickly and they feel pretty
solid<00:01:41.280> on<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.700> one<00:01:41.850> thing<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.090> do<00:01:42.150> like<00:01:42.329> about

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
solid on the one thing I do like about

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.889 
solid on the one thing I do like about
these<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.140> they're<00:01:43.560> kind<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.920> flexible

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
these is that they're kind of flexible

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.950 
these is that they're kind of flexible
like<00:01:45.899> my<00:01:46.049> natural<00:01:46.200> nail<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.770> flexible<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.549> so

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
like my natural nail is flexible and so

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.630 
like my natural nail is flexible and so
instead<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:49.110> having<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.350> high<00:01:49.590> arch<00:01:49.890> which<00:01:50.460> I

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
instead of having that high arch which I

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.069 
instead of having that high arch which I
don't<00:01:50.700> have<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.360> they're<00:01:51.479> always<00:01:51.689> into<00:01:52.049> a

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
don't have so they're always into a

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.670 
don't have so they're always into a
bubble<00:01:52.649> right<00:01:52.920> there<00:01:53.570> in<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.659> center<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:55.200> was

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
bubble right there in the center I was

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.740 
bubble right there in the center I was
able<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.890> smoosh<00:01:56.280> them<00:01:56.549> down<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.240> feel<00:01:57.570> like

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
able to smoosh them down so I feel like

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.889 
able to smoosh them down so I feel like
they're<00:01:57.899> on<00:01:58.110> really<00:01:59.070> well<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.579> feel<00:01:59.729> like<00:01:59.899> the

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
they're on really well I feel like the

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.859 
they're on really well I feel like the
entire<00:02:01.259> surface<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:02.159> glued<00:02:02.579> down<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.270> my<00:02:03.689> nail

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
entire surface is glued down to my nail

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.469

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
was scratching my leg and it bent so I

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.259 
was scratching my leg and it bent so I
did<00:04:18.959> into<00:04:19.320> filing<00:04:20.280> these<00:04:20.609> down<00:04:20.820> a<00:04:20.850> little<00:04:21.090> bit

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
did into filing these down a little bit

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.990 
did into filing these down a little bit
and<00:04:21.450> when<00:04:21.600> you<00:04:21.690> file<00:04:21.989> it<00:04:22.229> the<00:04:22.410> end<00:04:22.590> feels<00:04:22.979> a<00:04:23.280> lot

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
and when you file it the end feels a lot

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.430 
and when you file it the end feels a lot
more<00:04:24.210> sturdy<00:04:24.570> and<00:04:25.169> it's<00:04:25.470> not<00:04:25.620> as<00:04:25.800> bendy<00:04:27.169> but<00:04:28.169> I

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
more sturdy and it's not as bendy but I

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.230 
more sturdy and it's not as bendy but I

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.180 
think they're holding up pretty well I
think<00:04:31.169> it<00:04:31.380> may<00:04:31.470> be<00:04:31.500> I<00:04:31.620> just<00:04:31.800> didn't<00:04:32.010> have

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
think it may be I just didn't have

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.340 
think it may be I just didn't have
enough<00:04:32.220> glue<00:04:32.760> and<00:04:33.210> maybe<00:04:34.020> I<00:04:34.140> had<00:04:34.260> a<00:04:34.289> little

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
enough glue and maybe I had a little

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.130 
enough glue and maybe I had a little
pocket<00:04:35.340> of<00:04:35.610> air<00:04:35.789> in<00:04:36.120> there<00:04:36.360> and<00:04:36.660> it<00:04:36.780> got<00:04:36.870> water

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
pocket of air in there and it got water

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.230 
pocket of air in there and it got water
in<00:04:37.260> it<00:04:37.500> because<00:04:37.740> if<00:04:38.039> they've<00:04:38.190> come<00:04:38.430> the<00:04:39.060> ones

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
in it because if they've come the ones

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.990 
in it because if they've come the ones
that<00:04:39.390> have<00:04:39.479> come<00:04:39.660> off<00:04:39.690> have<00:04:40.610> wrinkly<00:04:41.610> three

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
that have come off have wrinkly three

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.850 
that have come off have wrinkly three
Evan<00:04:42.240> well<00:04:42.570> this<00:04:42.660> will<00:04:42.780> be<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:42.870> third<00:04:43.140> one<00:04:43.169> and

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
Evan well this will be the third one and

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.750 
Evan well this will be the third one and
then<00:04:44.660> they've<00:04:45.660> come<00:04:46.560> off<00:04:46.800> after<00:04:47.250> I've<00:04:47.370> washed

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
then they've come off after I've washed

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.659 
then they've come off after I've washed
dishes<00:04:48.030> or<00:04:48.450> I've<00:04:48.600> taken<00:04:48.870> a<00:04:48.930> shower<00:04:49.110> so<00:04:49.710> I<00:04:50.160> think

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
dishes or I've taken a shower so I think

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.100 
dishes or I've taken a shower so I think
they're<00:04:50.850> getting<00:04:50.940> moisture<00:04:51.479> up<00:04:51.780> underneath

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
they're getting moisture up underneath

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.850 
they're getting moisture up underneath
there<00:04:52.470> but<00:04:53.450> other<00:04:54.450> than<00:04:54.750> that<00:04:54.810> I<00:04:55.350> think<00:04:55.440> that

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
there but other than that I think that

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:02.090 
there but other than that I think that
they're<00:04:56.010> doing<00:04:56.280> cream<00:04:56.729> pretty<00:04:57.600> good<00:04:58.850> I<00:05:01.100> guess

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
they're doing cream pretty good I guess

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.710 
they're doing cream pretty good I guess
I<00:05:02.250> will<00:05:02.550> leave<00:05:02.580> them<00:05:02.850> on<00:05:03.000> and<00:05:03.240> see<00:05:03.419> how<00:05:03.450> they<00:05:03.600> go

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
I will leave them on and see how they go

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.110 
I will leave them on and see how they go
or<00:05:04.200> I'll<00:05:04.560> either<00:05:04.740> leave<00:05:05.100> them<00:05:05.160> on<00:05:05.310> until<00:05:05.580> they

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
or I'll either leave them on until they

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.070 
or I'll either leave them on until they
start<00:05:06.630> looking<00:05:06.720> really<00:05:07.110> crappy<00:05:07.530> like<00:05:09.050> can<00:05:10.050> you

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
start looking really crappy like can you

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.909 
start looking really crappy like can you
see<00:05:10.380> how<00:05:10.590> that<00:05:10.650> gold<00:05:11.100> is<00:05:11.490> kind<00:05:11.760> of<00:05:11.910> peeling<00:05:12.150> off

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
see how that gold is kind of peeling off

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.850 
see how that gold is kind of peeling off
in<00:05:13.919> there

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
in there

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.760 
in there
so<00:05:16.860> either<00:05:17.130> leave<00:05:17.550> them<00:05:17.639> on<00:05:17.789> until<00:05:18.530> they<00:05:19.530> start

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
so either leave them on until they start

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.310 
so either leave them on until they start
looking<00:05:19.860> really<00:05:20.220> crappy<00:05:20.580> or<00:05:20.760> I<00:05:20.789> will<00:05:21.450> or<00:05:21.900> until

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
day three and that happened yep

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.090 
day three and that happened yep
it<00:05:36.060> made<00:05:36.270> a<00:05:36.300> big<00:05:36.389> chip<00:05:36.840> out<00:05:37.080> of<00:05:37.320> the<00:05:37.530> middle<00:05:37.860> of

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
it made a big chip out of the middle of

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.610 
it made a big chip out of the middle of
this<00:05:38.220> fingernail<00:05:38.699> and<00:05:39.389> so<00:05:39.810> I<00:05:39.840> have<00:05:40.169> decided<00:05:40.500> to

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
this fingernail and so I have decided to

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.279 
this fingernail and so I have decided to
pull<00:05:41.250> them<00:05:41.430> all<00:05:41.580> off<00:05:41.930> luckily<00:05:42.930> though<00:05:43.110> they

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289 
pull them all off luckily though they

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:45.529 
pull them all off luckily though they
are<00:05:43.500> coming<00:05:43.770> off<00:05:43.889> really<00:05:44.190> easily<00:05:44.490> and<00:05:45.000> then

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
are coming off really easily and then

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:49.159 
are coming off really easily and then
I'm<00:05:45.660> using<00:05:45.810> my<00:05:46.110> little<00:05:46.259> buffer<00:05:46.970> square<00:05:48.169> to

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.169 
I'm using my little buffer square to

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:51.529 
I'm using my little buffer square to
buff<00:05:49.350> the<00:05:49.500> glue<00:05:49.740> that<00:05:50.180> was<00:05:51.180> left<00:05:51.360> on<00:05:51.479> my

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
buff the glue that was left on my

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:55.100 
buff the glue that was left on my
fingernail<00:05:51.990> so<00:05:52.259> um<00:05:53.750> you<00:05:54.750> know<00:05:54.840> I<00:05:54.870> think<00:05:54.960> a

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
fingernail so um you know I think a

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.659 
fingernail so um you know I think a
couple<00:05:55.289> of<00:05:55.500> swipes<00:05:55.740> of<00:05:56.070> fingernail<00:05:56.520> polish

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 
couple of swipes of fingernail polish

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:58.159 
couple of swipes of fingernail polish
remover<00:05:57.210> and<00:05:57.240> I<00:05:57.419> should<00:05:57.570> be<00:05:57.660> able<00:05:57.720> to<00:05:57.810> get<00:05:57.960> all

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 
remover and I should be able to get all

00:05:58.169 --> 00:05:59.540 
remover and I should be able to get all
the<00:05:58.289> rest<00:05:58.470> of<00:05:58.590> the<00:05:58.680> glue<00:05:58.860> residue<00:05:59.009> off<00:05:59.520> of

the rest of the glue residue off of
there<00:05:59.880> and<00:06:00.360> it<00:06:01.169> didn't<00:06:01.410> seem<00:06:01.560> to<00:06:01.710> damage<00:06:02.039> my

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
there and it didn't seem to damage my

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:07.670 
there and it didn't seem to damage my
nails<00:06:02.430> too<00:06:03.210> much<00:06:03.360> at<00:06:03.599> all<00:06:03.840> but<00:06:04.800> yeah<00:06:06.650> I'm<00:06:07.650> not

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680

nails too much at all but yeah I'm not
even<00:06:07.830> really<00:06:08.039> sure<00:06:08.160> how<00:06:08.460> that<00:06:08.490> happened<00:06:09.000> I

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
even really sure how that happened I

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.670 
even really sure how that happened I
just<00:06:09.090> felt<00:06:09.300> that<00:06:09.630> it<00:06:09.780> was<00:06:09.900> scratchy<00:06:10.289> and<00:06:10.650> I

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
just felt that it was scratchy and I

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.080 
just felt that it was scratchy and I
looked<00:06:10.919> at<00:06:11.070> it<00:06:11.250> and<00:06:11.370> it's<00:06:11.460> got<00:06:11.639> this<00:06:11.759> little

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
looked at it and it's got this little

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.830 
looked at it and it's got this little
chunk<00:06:12.240> missing<00:06:12.509> out<00:06:12.870> of<00:06:12.990> it<00:06:13.169> so<00:06:14.690> I'm<00:06:15.690> gonna

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
chunk missing out of it so I'm gonna

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.510 
chunk missing out of it so I'm gonna
give<00:06:16.050> these<00:06:16.229> about<00:06:16.560> three<00:06:16.889> days<00:06:17.039> worth<00:06:17.370> of

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
give these about three days worth of

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.320 
give these about three days worth of
wear<00:06:17.759> for<00:06:18.180> me<00:06:18.830> and<00:06:19.830> they<00:06:20.160> sure<00:06:20.370> were<00:06:20.520> fun<00:06:20.910> and

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
wear for me and they sure were fun and

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.659 
wear for me and they sure were fun and
so<00:06:21.840> I<00:06:22.139> guess<00:06:22.380> three<00:06:22.680> days<00:06:22.830> for<00:06:23.400> a<00:06:23.430> dollar

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:23.669 
so I guess three days for a dollar

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:27.020 
so I guess three days for a dollar
pretty<00:06:24.389> good<00:06:24.599> and<00:06:25.500> so<00:06:26.009> anyway<00:06:26.280> that's<00:06:26.580> my
