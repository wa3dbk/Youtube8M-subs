by<00:00:23.650> tapping<00:00:24.010> the<00:00:24.580> spacebar<00:00:25.020> now<00:00:26.020> here<00:00:26.350> we<00:00:26.560> have

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
by tapping the spacebar now here we have

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.820 
by tapping the spacebar now here we have
all<00:00:26.980> four<00:00:27.280> views<00:00:27.640> from<00:00:28.480> our<00:00:28.690> cameras<00:00:29.110> we<00:00:29.800> have

can just scroll with that wheel in order
to<00:01:18.000> zoom<00:01:18.180> in<00:01:18.390> now<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:19.860> perspective<00:01:20.520> view<00:01:20.789> is

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
to zoom in now the perspective view is

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.060 
to zoom in now the perspective view is
the<00:01:21.179> only<00:01:21.329> viewport<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.020> allows<00:01:22.530> us<00:01:22.560> to

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
the only viewport that allows us to

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.190 
the only viewport that allows us to
tumble<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:24.270> instance<00:01:24.630> I'm<00:01:24.780> going<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.020> switch

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
tumble for instance I'm going to switch

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.980 
tumble for instance I'm going to switch
to<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.649> front<00:01:26.039> viewport<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.539> do<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:27.780> we

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
to the front viewport and to do this we

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.559 
to the front viewport and to do this we
just<00:01:28.170> move<00:01:28.439> our<00:01:28.679> mouse<00:01:29.130> over<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:29.909> viewport

00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:30.569 
just move our mouse over that viewport

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:33.410 
just move our mouse over that viewport
can<00:01:30.720> tap<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:30.990> space<00:01:31.470> bar<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.060> here<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.240> can

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
can tap that space bar and here I can

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.719 
can tap that space bar and here I can
hold<00:01:33.569> alt<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.170> middle<00:01:34.860> Mouse<00:01:35.039> and<00:01:35.310> pan<00:01:35.549> and

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
hold alt and middle Mouse and pan and

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.370 
hold alt and middle Mouse and pan and
zoom<00:01:36.710> but<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.860> top<00:01:38.250> front<00:01:38.789> and<00:01:38.939> side<00:01:39.479> cameras

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
zoom but the top front and side cameras

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.770 
zoom but the top front and side cameras
are<00:01:40.560> considered<00:01:41.159> orthographic<00:01:42.149> cameras

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
are considered orthographic cameras

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.999 
are considered orthographic cameras
they're<00:01:43.619> locked<00:01:44.099> to<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> specific<00:01:45.569> angle

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
they're locked to a specific angle

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.800 
they're locked to a specific angle
therefore<00:01:47.009> when<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.280> try<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.700> hit<00:01:48.149> alt<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.780> left

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
therefore when I try to hit alt and left

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.499 
therefore when I try to hit alt and left
mouse<00:01:49.740> button<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:50.579> gives<00:01:50.789> me<00:01:50.909> an<00:01:51.030> error<00:01:51.240> and

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
mouse button it gives me an error and

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.020 
mouse button it gives me an error and
says<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:52.110> cannot<00:01:52.439> be<00:01:52.649> tumbled<00:01:53.009> if<00:01:53.220> we<00:01:53.819> want

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
says this cannot be tumbled if we want

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.969 
says this cannot be tumbled if we want
to<00:01:54.060> tumble<00:01:54.390> around<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.869> model<00:01:55.049> we<00:01:55.590> need<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.860> go

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
to tumble around a model we need to go

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.740 
to tumble around a model we need to go
back<00:01:56.220> to<00:01:56.640> our<00:01:56.759> perspective

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
back to our perspective

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.420 
back to our perspective
I'm<00:01:59.230> going<00:01:59.380> to<00:01:59.440> create<00:01:59.620> a<00:01:59.740> model<00:02:00.010> here<00:02:00.250> real

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
I'm going to create a model here real

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.890 
I'm going to create a model here real
quick<00:02:00.670> and<00:02:00.850> we'll<00:02:00.970> just<00:02:01.180> go<00:02:01.270> with<00:02:01.300> our<00:02:01.570> trusty

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
quick and we'll just go with our trusty

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.830 
quick and we'll just go with our trusty
polygon<00:02:02.890> sphere

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.680 

and<00:02:05.960> we<00:02:06.109> can<00:02:06.320> zoom<00:02:06.560> in<00:02:06.799> and<00:02:07.219> out<00:02:07.460> now<00:02:08.060> if<00:02:08.300> we

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
and we can zoom in and out now if we

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.040 
and we can zoom in and out now if we
want<00:02:08.929> to<00:02:09.200> frame<00:02:09.679> up<00:02:10.039> an<00:02:10.310> object<00:02:11.090> we<00:02:11.269> hit<00:02:11.480> F<00:02:11.750> and

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
next to that I have the bookmarks icon

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.780 
next to that I have the bookmarks icon
this<00:02:59.720> allows<00:03:00.140> me<00:03:00.380> to<00:03:00.410> bookmark<00:03:01.160> a<00:03:01.340> certain

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
this allows me to bookmark a certain

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.150 
this allows me to bookmark a certain
view<00:03:02.150> so<00:03:02.660> let's<00:03:02.690> just<00:03:03.080> move<00:03:03.290> this<00:03:03.560> over<00:03:03.740> here

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160

and I'll choose the bookmark icon and
then<00:03:07.850> we<00:03:07.940> can<00:03:08.090> change<00:03:08.300> our<00:03:08.570> view<00:03:08.720> to<00:03:08.840> something

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
then we can change our view to something

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.420 
then we can change our view to something
else<00:03:09.380> we'll<00:03:09.590> just<00:03:09.770> kind<00:03:09.980> of<00:03:10.040> go<00:03:10.100> to<00:03:10.280> the
