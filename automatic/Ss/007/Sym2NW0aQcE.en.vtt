00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
bare metal on the underside and then

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.439 
bare metal on the underside and then
it's<00:00:51.960> primed<00:00:52.289> and<00:00:53.250> then<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.850> protective

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
it's primed and then this protective

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.900 
nice as it is but what we'll do is leave
it<00:00:59.640> for<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.059> good<00:01:00.329> two<00:01:00.930> or<00:01:00.960> three<00:01:01.260> days<00:01:01.760> let<00:01:02.760> it

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
it for a good two or three days let it

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.660 
it for a good two or three days let it
dry<00:01:03.409> and<00:01:04.409> then<00:01:04.619> we'll<00:01:04.769> run<00:01:04.890> primer<00:01:05.250> over<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
dry and then we'll run primer over the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.080 
dry and then we'll run primer over the
top<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.420> then<00:01:07.229> our<00:01:07.380> body<00:01:07.560> color<00:01:07.939> and<00:01:08.939> it's

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
top and then our body color and it's

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.289 
top and then our body color and it's
actually<00:01:09.450> going<00:01:09.630> blue<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.799> car<00:01:11.180> looks<00:01:12.180> a

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
actually going blue so the car looks a

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.960 
actually going blue so the car looks a
little<00:01:12.450> really<00:01:12.990> really<00:01:13.229> nice<00:01:13.409> when<00:01:13.650> it's<00:01:13.799> done

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
little really really nice when it's done

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.289 
little really really nice when it's done
this<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.180> triumph<00:01:15.600> tr4<00:01:15.869> E<00:01:16.939> and<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.090> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
this is a triumph tr4 E and this is the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.670 
this is a triumph tr4 E and this is the
underneath<00:01:18.810> getting<00:01:19.560> ready<00:01:19.770> for<00:01:20.100> paint

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
underneath getting ready for paint

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:31.340 
underneath getting ready for paint
looking<00:01:22.680> rather<00:01:22.830> nice<00:01:23.130> as<00:01:23.369> well

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.320 

so<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.980> next<00:01:32.190> step<00:01:32.460> will<00:01:32.880> show<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.150> were

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
so the next step will show you were

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.180 
so the next step will show you were
going<00:01:33.570> into<00:01:33.720> coal<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.200> underside<00:01:34.680> and

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
going into coal on the underside and

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.120 
going into coal on the underside and
then<00:01:35.820> we'll<00:01:36.030> lock<00:01:36.240> her<00:01:36.420> as<00:01:36.630> well<00:01:36.800> to<00:01:37.800> bring<00:01:37.979> out

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
then we'll lock her as well to bring out

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.180 
then we'll lock her as well to bring out
the<00:01:38.280> shine<00:01:39.140> but<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.260> is<00:01:40.410> a<00:01:40.440> protective<00:01:41.010> coat

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
the shine but this is a protective coat

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.780 
the shine but this is a protective coat
and<00:01:41.400> I'll<00:01:41.460> seal<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.000> underside<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:43.790> just

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
and I'll seal the underside that just

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.280 
and I'll seal the underside that just
means<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.150> next<00:01:45.390> time<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:45.750> car<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.140> on<00:01:46.260> the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
means that next time this car is on the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.560 
means that next time this car is on the
road<00:01:46.619> don't<00:01:47.400> have<00:01:47.550> to<00:01:47.700> worry<00:01:47.910> about<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.300> salt

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
road don't have to worry about the salt

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.200 
road don't have to worry about the salt
the<00:01:49.290> storm<00:01:49.560> chips<00:01:50.000> anything<00:01:51.000> like<00:01:51.180> that

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
the storm chips anything like that

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.820 
the storm chips anything like that
because<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.750> underside<00:01:52.080> is<00:01:52.200> completely

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
because the underside is completely

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.550 
because the underside is completely
sealed<00:01:54.470> so<00:01:55.470> here<00:01:55.680> we<00:01:55.770> go<00:01:56.360> next<00:01:57.360> up<00:01:57.509> primer<00:01:58.350> and

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
sealed so here we go next up primer and

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.740 
sealed so here we go next up primer and
paint
