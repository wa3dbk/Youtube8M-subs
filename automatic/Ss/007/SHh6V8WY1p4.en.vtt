up the sound quite a bit it's not going
to<00:02:04.069> particularly<00:02:04.579> help<00:02:04.909> you<00:02:05.119> play<00:02:05.749> the<00:02:05.869> third

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
to particularly help you play the third

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.609 
to particularly help you play the third
register<00:02:06.590> and<00:02:06.770> you<00:02:06.859> better<00:02:07.069> in<00:02:07.310> tune<00:02:07.579> per<00:02:07.999> se

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
formula might be good for a jazz player

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.820
