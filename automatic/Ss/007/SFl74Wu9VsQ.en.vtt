00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.810
 swim stuffy when to airbag 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.200
 so that the air can compensate for the departed 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.200
 ink 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:29.300
 and crankcase ready for use 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.800
 installed on the area on which 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.010
 chips are installed 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:38.710
 installed once and 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.710
 on the life of the cartridges 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:51.850
 price pad card also take turns 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.850
 need to install 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.920
 the printer once took in the same case 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:29.209
 head cleaning starts 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:32.420
 I bet this filling ink CISS 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:37.209
 different there are two kinds they 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:40.579
 different dumping there slavochka reset 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:45.890
 single reset of the entire system and in stages 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:49.129
 reset a single difference in what they have snc with 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.780
 single reset case ends 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.099
 ink of a certain color for example 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.190
 yellow yellow 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:59.120
 the printer will display a message ended 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:01.810
 yellow ink rarely comes out in position 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.489
 replacing cartridges you change carter 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.920
 update the counter while updating 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:10.640
 not only the yellow color is updated all 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.640
 colors are better to avoid 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.640
 barley airing 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:19.190
 better top up tomorrow to fill the crankcase 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.450
 the rest of the carter ink was not 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.819
 call to take snfc with a phased reset 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.200
 resets only 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:31.430
 ink counter of the housing which 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.989
 there has been been replaced which 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.819
 that he is empty which you 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.819
 replaced that sump will form
