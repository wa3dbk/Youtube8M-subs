00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
go k well i'm trying to get it i try to

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.420 
go k well i'm trying to get it i try to
get<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.309> theme<00:00:50.579> right<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:52.170> got<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.129> windows

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
get a theme right so I got the windows

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.580 
get a theme right so I got the windows
seven<00:00:53.820> things<00:00:53.969> just<00:00:54.510> went<00:00:54.660> straight<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.379> safe

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
seven things just went straight to safe

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.310 
seven things just went straight to safe
mode<00:00:55.789> so<00:00:56.789> you're<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.149> restart<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.050> it's

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
mode so you're the restart it and it's

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:06.920 
mode so you're the restart it and it's
going<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.530> restart<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.980> whole<00:00:59.250> thing<00:01:05.930> well

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
going to restart the whole thing well

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.050 
going to restart the whole thing well
for<00:01:07.140> me<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.439> does<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.159> lot<00:01:08.310> when<00:01:08.820> you

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
for me it does that a lot when you

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.679 
for me it does that a lot when you
switch<00:01:09.330> names<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.900> stuff<00:01:10.020> like<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:11.240> but<00:01:12.240> it

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
switch names and stuff like that but it

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.149 
switch names and stuff like that but it
basically<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:13.140> can<00:01:13.290> say<00:01:13.439> fo<00:01:13.650> for<00:01:13.799> everything

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
basically you can say fo for everything

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.429 
basically you can say fo for everything
so<00:01:14.549> safe<00:01:15.000> mode<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.619> off<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.950> could<00:01:17.159> see<00:01:18.439> you

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
so safe mode is off you could see you

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.929 
so safe mode is off you could see you
can<00:01:19.619> see<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.920> off<00:01:20.659> go<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:23.580> got<00:01:23.790> my

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
can see it off go to it and I got my

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.170 
can see it off go to it and I got my
thing<00:01:24.180> well<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.560> could<00:01:25.680> do<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:25.920> for<00:01:26.159> apps<00:01:26.790> to

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
thing well you could do this for apps to

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.370 
thing well you could do this for apps to
like<00:01:27.450> apps<00:01:28.110> can<00:01:28.740> be<00:01:29.360> can<00:01:30.360> make<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.750> safe<00:01:31.079> mode

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
like apps can be can make it safe mode

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.690 
like apps can be can make it safe mode
so<00:01:31.619> let<00:01:31.740> me<00:01:31.860> show<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.130> how<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.549> know

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
so let me show you how that you know

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.940 
so let me show you how that you know
step<00:01:33.060> 2<00:01:34.070> none<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.100> my<00:01:35.220> apps<00:01:35.520> gave<00:01:35.909> me<00:01:36.090> safe<00:01:36.329> mode

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
step 2 none of my apps gave me safe mode

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.679 
step 2 none of my apps gave me safe mode
right<00:01:37.950> now<00:01:38.009> but<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.909> did<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.470> while<00:01:40.470> back<00:01:41.689> so

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
right now but it did a while back so

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.960 
right now but it did a while back so
let's<00:01:43.200> say<00:01:43.290> out<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:43.890> has<00:01:44.070> safe<00:01:44.310> mode<00:01:44.549> from<00:01:44.909> a

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
let's say out this has safe mode from a

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.190 
let's say out this has safe mode from a
you<00:01:45.720> just<00:01:45.930> download<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.409> something<00:01:47.899> well<00:01:48.899> in

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
you just download it something well in

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.590 
you just download it something well in
and<00:01:49.649> if<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.040> restart<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.790> still<00:01:51.119> go<00:01:51.329> safe

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
and if you restart it in a still go safe

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.370 
and if you restart it in a still go safe
mode<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:52.740> means<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:53.369> have<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:54.320> go<00:01:55.320> to

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
mode that means you have to go to

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.749 
mode that means you have to go to
changes<00:01:56.130> i<00:01:56.340> think<00:01:57.170> little<00:01:58.170> manage<00:01:58.500> manage<00:01:58.950> and

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
really bad so hopefully those two will

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.559 
really bad so hopefully those two will
work<00:02:51.989> so<00:02:52.380> first<00:02:52.650> we<00:02:52.800> started<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.150> doesn't

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
work so first we started and it doesn't

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.990 
work so first we started and it doesn't
work<00:02:54.720> delete<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.290> thing<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.769> made<00:02:56.519> a<00:02:56.550> crash
