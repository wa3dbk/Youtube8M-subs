 that private aircraft pilots must 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.019
 follow but they drive drones 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.300
 civilians

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.090
 the use of these small devices 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.710
 were deficient 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.170
 that's why with the center 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.880

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.619

 relation to the security of donations 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.899
 how to spot donations how do 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.579
 operate safety these flying devices 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.260
 uninhabited must still be 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.660
 submit to many requirements 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.559
 it is forbidden to fly them in 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.820

 special aerial authorization 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.329
 last years and a half four times more 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.100
 943 we will never do an operation 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.519
 directly above the world or 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.380
 property to precisely prevent that if there is 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.780
 a sound a failure of the device 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.150
 falls relies on the world or on a 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.729
 house or on a self these rules are only

 canada this year 14 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.159
 incident involving a drone is a 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.680
 commercial airplane 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.610
 a lot of drone users on the 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.110
 funds for pleasure 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.909
 this is the case of this technician in 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.060
 geomatics then me that I use 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.939
 to make beautiful panoramas 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:36.030
 river speeds right fraser 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.950
 it's for the cinema to appease it but 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.150
 for most students it's mostly 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.350
 in order to make use of it 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.640
 commercial 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.740
 I am developing my 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.930
 company for eventually doing the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.640
 photogrammetry will lose that's why 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.659
 that I'm a course right now we 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.070
 can expect that the 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.890
 regulations surrounding the use 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.350
 civil drones be reinforced in the short 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.570
 term canada and the united states have 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.189
 set up a committee to supervise 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.310
 drone flights that if alex levasseur
