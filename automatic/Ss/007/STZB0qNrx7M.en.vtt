00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.340
 were welcome with these lesson tips and tricks 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.030
 but giving way will have to be taken 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:12.639
 is done 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.269
 mh especially in which order 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.529
 order is of course very important 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:19.630
 wemmel bavaria 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.800
 first few races where it already painted the painting 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.050
 invented 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.089
 you actually know everything works from back to front 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.789
 a bit of thickness qurius goes through a few things 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.510
 let the club fade into the distance 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.679
 especially to leave messages about 

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:39.140
 today in the distance 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.400
 creates a little perspective 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.440
 by putting lower transport together each time down again by shift knob 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.440
 that ensures that the painting is dead 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.510
 and so first painted the sky 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.540
 probably directors and qatar 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.890
 let us know all the details and everything with water according to the mountains 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.650
 painted 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.610
 and then I have that 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.850
 painted this boat 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.750
 m and then I painted it the island with a lot of trees 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.230
 as you can see this is one 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.800
 a bit of a sort of bird's eye view has nothing to do with the 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.150
 focus 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.230
 but it has to do with ppo fruit 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.660
 in the field of time shelves 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.760
 and that must be so 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.270
 breeder 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.200
 well the left side against may over the swans 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.319
 is that you have a swan in principle that starts with education 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.580
 according to knack 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.960
 the head 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.799
 and then the wings and do your own in principle all in 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:48.830
 weed 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.310
 so we actually make a kind of bottom layer 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.310
 to then bring Paul Brook House together 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.119
 but the details that ultimately entail are the shadows 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.119
 the regime in tehran 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.910
 what's further afield is very interesting about these paintings that are very whole 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.329
 on the lines 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:12.289
 but how can you do something like that? 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:16.799
 What you do is wait until the painting is completely dry, because of that 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.229
 create very thin lines between 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:22.559
 take your clear adhesive tape that says 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.509
 along the line that would like to go there 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:27.939
 on the other hand too 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.789
 then paint 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:31.609
 this starts 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:34.609
 and you then immediately keep the tape away 

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:39.839
 and the line states if you will be a little further alongside this solo career 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:43.199
 so you just have to wait a few days until it is dry 

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:46.459
 before you can put it in again for this 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:47.749
 Paint 

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:50.749
 so some paintings and ask quite some patience 

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:53.050
 well what will succeed 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.780
 given is that you get the idea that you are on that last time 

00:02:57.479 --> 00:03:00.269
 still creates a lot of extra depth 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.749
 because you actually cancel this mountain set more 

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:06.039
 then you will not sit out some trees 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:09.519
 then your teacher and a bit of forest sit 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.680
 and here too they are all layers and they actually all offer offers 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.069
 the painting all those layers 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:17.739
 new set for each other 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.979
 the makers for paintings 

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:22.449
 vivid remembering found perspective
