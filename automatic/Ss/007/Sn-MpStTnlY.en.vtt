00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
things like that so a very sensibly he's

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.600 
things like that so a very sensibly he's
he's<00:00:48.450> questioning<00:00:49.260> whether<00:00:49.440> he<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:50.039> safe<00:00:50.340> to

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
he's questioning whether he is safe to

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.290 
he's questioning whether he is safe to
drive<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:52.079> course<00:00:52.550> well<00:00:53.550> he's<00:00:54.059> been

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
driving for over seventy years now I

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.680 
driving for over seventy years now I
think<00:00:58.079> without<00:00:58.590> an<00:00:58.980> accident<00:00:59.640> so<00:00:59.940> he<00:00:59.969> has<00:01:00.420> been

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
think without an accident so he has been

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.500 
think without an accident so he has been
a<00:01:00.750> good<00:01:01.020> driver<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.280> probably<00:01:02.879> probably

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
a good driver and the probably probably

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.170 
a good driver and the probably probably
is<00:01:04.019> still<00:01:04.199> quite<00:01:04.650> safe<00:01:04.979> but<00:01:05.339> he's<00:01:05.580> questioning

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
is still quite safe but he's questioning

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.859 
is still quite safe but he's questioning
it<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.100> end<00:01:08.400> he<00:01:08.610> has<00:01:09.150> arranged

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
it and and to that end he has arranged

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.830 
it and and to that end he has arranged
to<00:01:10.200> have<00:01:10.710> an<00:01:11.070> assessment<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.030> his<00:01:12.240> driving

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
to have an assessment of his driving

parallel parking and all that rubbish
but<00:01:39.600> just<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.079> see<00:01:40.290> if<00:01:40.590> you're<00:01:41.100> considered

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
but just to see if you're considered

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.580 
but just to see if you're considered
safe<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.890> going<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.399> happen<00:01:44.700> and

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
safe and so that is going to happen and

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.350 
safe and so that is going to happen and
well<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.220> hope<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.850> know<00:01:48.030> how<00:01:48.299> he

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
well and I hope that you know how he

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.480 
well and I hope that you know how he
gets<00:01:48.720> on<00:01:48.930> but<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:50.810> think<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.259> whole<00:01:52.439> secret<00:01:53.310> of

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
gets on but I think the whole secret of

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.889 
gets on but I think the whole secret of
driving<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.270> being<00:01:54.829> relaxed<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:56.670> don't<00:01:57.240> be<00:01:57.450> mean

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
driving is being relaxed I don't be mean

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.609 
driving is being relaxed I don't be mean
relaxed<00:01:58.770> by<00:01:58.979> putting<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.670> rear<00:02:00.290> angle<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.469> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
relaxed by putting the rear angle of the

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.649 
relaxed by putting the rear angle of the
seat<00:02:01.860> down<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.490> you're<00:02:02.700> nearly<00:02:02.909> lying<00:02:03.299> down

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
seat down so you're nearly lying down

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.319 
seat down so you're nearly lying down
and<00:02:03.960> listening<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.710> radio<00:02:04.740> but<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.700> must

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
and listening to the radio but you must

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.320 
and listening to the radio but you must
be<00:02:06.630> relaxed<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.429> have<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.330> have

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
be relaxed and I I have I have

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.630 
be relaxed and I I have I have
experience<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.570> that<00:02:12.780> because<00:02:13.290> when<00:02:13.530> I<00:02:13.740> was<00:02:13.770> 70

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
experience of that because when I was 70

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.180 
experience of that because when I was 70
although<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:15.810> was<00:02:16.050> still<00:02:16.320> driving<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.040> I

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
although I was still driving and I

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.340 
although I was still driving and I
thought<00:02:17.430> quite<00:02:17.670> well<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.060> was<00:02:18.420> doing<00:02:18.780> motorways

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
thought quite well I was doing motorways

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.170 
thought quite well I was doing motorways
and<00:02:19.380> long-distance<00:02:20.070> isn't<00:02:20.670> going<00:02:20.940> through

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
and long-distance isn't going through

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.980 
and long-distance isn't going through
cities<00:02:21.630> without<00:02:22.470> any<00:02:22.740> problem<00:02:23.460> I<00:02:23.910> thought<00:02:24.780> it

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
cities without any problem I thought it

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.520 
cities without any problem I thought it
would<00:02:25.170> be<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.380> good<00:02:25.590> idea<00:02:25.830> to<00:02:26.510> to<00:02:27.510> have<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.720> have<00:02:28.500> a

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530

was happening of her ahead so that one

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.370 
was happening of her ahead so that one
could<00:02:59.490> I<00:03:00.110> could<00:03:01.110> take<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.130> appropriate

thoughts of what you were looking at

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.880 
thoughts of what you were looking at
what<00:03:12.390> you<00:03:12.600> were<00:03:12.720> observing<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.560> what<00:03:13.680> you

what you were observing and what you
were<00:03:14.040> thinking<00:03:14.520> I<00:03:16.400> did<00:03:17.400> achieve<00:03:17.970> that<00:03:18.239> and<00:03:18.570> by

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
were thinking I did achieve that and by

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.640 
were thinking I did achieve that and by
achieving<00:03:19.350> it<00:03:19.739> I<00:03:19.920> was<00:03:20.580> very<00:03:20.880> very<00:03:21.120> much<00:03:21.420> more

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
achieving it I was very very much more

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.310 
achieving it I was very very much more
relaxed<00:03:22.650> and<00:03:22.970> have<00:03:23.970> been<00:03:24.270> ever<00:03:24.600> since<00:03:24.930> with

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
relaxed and have been ever since with

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.729 
relaxed and have been ever since with
that<00:03:25.860> method<00:03:26.310> of<00:03:26.459> that<00:03:27.360> method<00:03:27.870> of<00:03:27.989> driving<00:03:28.500> so

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
that method of that method of driving so

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.070 
that method of that method of driving so
I<00:03:28.920> hope<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.550> same<00:03:29.760> will<00:03:29.820> happen<00:03:30.239> to<00:03:30.420> him<00:03:30.780> and

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
I hope the same will happen to him and

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.880 
I hope the same will happen to him and
the<00:03:31.410> instructor<00:03:32.130> can<00:03:32.300> give<00:03:33.300> him<00:03:33.540> the

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
the instructor can give him the

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.830 
the instructor can give him the
confidence<00:03:34.890> and<00:03:35.520> I<00:03:35.700> think<00:03:36.030> if<00:03:36.209> he<00:03:36.330> gives<00:03:36.600> him

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
confidence and I think if he gives him

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.710 
confidence and I think if he gives him
the<00:03:37.100> sort<00:03:38.100> of<00:03:38.250> confidence<00:03:38.820> at<00:03:39.090> all<00:03:39.270> as<00:03:39.510> well

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
the sort of confidence at all as well

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.620 
the sort of confidence at all as well
then<00:03:40.620> he<00:03:40.860> will<00:03:41.070> drive<00:03:41.640> in<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:42.000> more<00:03:42.209> relaxed

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
then he will drive in the more relaxed

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.810 
then he will drive in the more relaxed
manner<00:03:42.959> and<00:03:43.290> I<00:03:43.410> hope<00:03:43.620> he'll<00:03:43.890> be<00:03:43.920> able<00:03:44.100> to<00:03:44.550> drive

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
manner and I hope he'll be able to drive

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:51.050 
manner and I hope he'll be able to drive
for<00:03:44.989> a<00:03:45.989> long<00:03:46.530> while<00:03:46.739> in<00:03:47.610> the<00:03:48.420> future<00:03:48.600> so<00:03:50.060> we're

about<00:04:10.580> driving<00:04:11.580> instructor<00:04:12.650> but<00:04:13.650> I<00:04:15.530> think

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
about driving instructor but I think

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.560 
about driving instructor but I think
that<00:04:16.769> isn't<00:04:16.950> possible<00:04:17.310> to<00:04:17.730> do<00:04:18.090> that<00:04:18.359> and

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
that isn't possible to do that and

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.570 
that isn't possible to do that and
that's<00:04:18.720> something<00:04:19.019> I<00:04:19.350> probably<00:04:19.620> like<00:04:20.160> to<00:04:20.340> talk

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580
