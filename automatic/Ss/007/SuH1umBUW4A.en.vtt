00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
think I am ready to fly this time I

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.439 
think I am ready to fly this time I
waited<00:00:26.579> went<00:00:26.789> through<00:00:26.970> all<00:00:27.060> my<00:00:27.090> pre-flight

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
waited went through all my pre-flight

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.049 
waited went through all my pre-flight
checks<00:00:27.930> got<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.199> lot<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.410> cameras<00:00:28.770> going<00:00:28.919> on<00:00:29.130> so

00:00:30.049 --> 00:00:30.059 
checks got a lot of cameras going on so

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:31.850 
checks got a lot of cameras going on so
I<00:00:30.119> want<00:00:30.239> to<00:00:30.300> do<00:00:30.419> everything<00:00:30.630> right<00:00:30.860> normally

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:31.860 
I want to do everything right normally

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.819 
I want to do everything right normally
like<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.099> do<00:00:32.399> all<00:00:32.610> this<00:00:33.320> we<00:00:34.320> probably<00:00:34.590> still

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
like to do all this we probably still

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.360 
like to do all this we probably still
have<00:00:34.890> voltage<00:00:35.550> on<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.820> OSD<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:37.190> first<00:00:38.190> thing

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
have voltage on the OSD so first thing

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.560 
have voltage on the OSD so first thing
we<00:00:38.430> do<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.700> turn<00:00:39.000> on<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.390> old<00:00:40.430> jrx<00:00:41.430> p90<00:00:41.969> 303

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
we do is turn on this old jrx p90 303

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.410 
we do is turn on this old jrx p90 303
it's<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.230> nine<00:00:43.410> channel<00:00:43.800> transmitter<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.520> am

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
it's a nine channel transmitter I am

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:53.139 
it's a nine channel transmitter I am
using<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:47.449> on<00:00:48.449> channel<00:00:48.960> 72<00:00:50.269> 72<00:00:51.269> megahertz

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
using it on channel 72 72 megahertz

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.009 
using it on channel 72 72 megahertz
channel<00:00:54.769> that's<00:00:55.769> what<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.069> channel<00:00:56.280> at<00:00:56.429> all

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019 
channel that's what the channel at all

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:05.929 
channel that's what the channel at all
so

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:14.240 

I<00:01:07.909> think<00:01:12.409> believe<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.560> Mobius<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:13.979> now

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
I think believe the Mobius is now

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.160 
I think believe the Mobius is now
recorded<00:01:15.170> let's<00:01:16.170> do<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.439> sink<00:01:17.369> or<00:01:17.549> something

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
recorded let's do a sink or something

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:25.130 
recorded let's do a sink or something
so<00:01:20.840> don't<00:01:21.840> have<00:01:22.219> playing<00:01:23.219> on<00:01:23.399> yet<00:01:23.959> let's<00:01:24.959> do

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
so don't have playing on yet let's do

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.149 
so don't have playing on yet let's do
that

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.289 

kick<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.189> on<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.549> already<00:01:29.849> plugged<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.179> in

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
kick that on I already plugged it in

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.260 
kick that on I already plugged it in
shows<00:01:30.569> my<00:01:30.750> voltage<00:01:31.109> I<00:01:31.229> got<00:01:31.349> 12<00:01:31.909> 12<00:01:32.909> volts<00:01:33.179> just

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
shows my voltage I got 12 12 volts just

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.469 
shows my voltage I got 12 12 volts just
charged<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.899> up<00:01:34.640> no<00:01:35.640> way<00:01:35.819> I'm<00:01:35.880> draw<00:01:36.149> really

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
charged it up no way I'm draw really

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.649 
charged it up no way I'm draw really
everything's<00:01:37.349> really<00:01:37.560> minuscule<00:01:38.250> here<00:01:38.659> these

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
everything's really minuscule here these

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.109 
everything's really minuscule here these
don't<00:01:39.869> really<00:01:40.049> start<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.439> until<00:01:40.770> over<00:01:41.069> a<00:01:41.099> 1<00:01:41.969> amp

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
don't really start so until over a 1 amp

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.059 
here's my my AMA approved copilot she
keeps<00:02:46.050> an<00:02:46.170> eye<00:02:46.260> on<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.470> plane<00:02:46.680> wherever<00:02:46.980> it

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
keeps an eye on the plane wherever it

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.220 
keeps an eye on the plane wherever it
goes<00:02:47.190> down<00:02:47.450> she<00:02:48.450> knows<00:02:48.630> where<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:48.959> is<00:02:49.050> even

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
goes down she knows where it is even

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.670 
goes down she knows where it is even

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
is our primary source of in the area

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.440 
is our primary source of in the area
information<00:02:56.280> she's<00:02:56.700> also<00:02:56.849> watching<00:02:57.360> today<00:02:57.660> a

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
information she's also watching today a

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.080 
information she's also watching today a
flight<00:03:00.450> path<00:03:00.660> from<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.349> nearby<00:03:01.650> airport<00:03:02.130> so

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
flight path from the nearby airport so

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.339 
flight path from the nearby airport so
we're<00:03:03.269> gonna<00:03:03.360> be<00:03:03.569> conscious<00:03:04.530> of<00:03:04.650> that<00:03:06.319> okay<00:03:07.319> I

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
we're gonna be conscious of that okay I

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.890
