00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.930
 I would like to share with you 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.099
 recipe she will take your favorite salads 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.820
 this is mimosa 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:22.439
 we will need canned food for her 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:28.119
 oil 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:31.649
 green dill eggs boiled hard cheese 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:34.570
 Parmesan type boiled potatoes 

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:36.520
 boiled carrots and mayonnaise 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.410
 let's get it ready 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:44.070
 salad lettuce is laid out in layers 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:49.900
 the first layer is canned fish 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:52.030
 for this we need fish in oil 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.590
 who have already leaked fluid 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:01:01.630
 preliminary and now about 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:06.009
 remove it from the spine and good 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:08.079
 knead fork of our spine can 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:12.579
 not clean in principle but i like 

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:15.190
 softer consistency fish masses for 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:16.750
 This salad will go, in principle, any 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:21.790
 canned saury 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.830
 savaco cod tuna now this 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:30.010
 yourself 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:34.510
 not the fish, we pushed our raze and 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:42.490
 so more or less neatly following 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:45.390
 layer we will go yolks from eggs now 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.939
 on our yolks gently level and 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.780
 we rub on top carrots my record on 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.780
 pre- opened 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.500
 to mimosa soaked well 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:02.710
 mayonnaise and cook well 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:06.490
 ten hours before seven 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:12.880
 always one day before use now 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:16.050
 we can this layer mayonnaise and this 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:20.230
 time decided layer for the next layer 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:25.209
 i will need green onions so much i think 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:29.650
 translator will be enough 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:33.040
 used mafia lover later 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:37.540
 let's see his mom we just add me 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.900
 the white part can also be used 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.050
 unsalted taste word science or ordinary 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.760
 well so that the mixture of fuel will need to either 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.480
 run a few minutes droplets 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.730
 or me, these percentages have to stick your nose 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.300
 add our white pieces such a handful 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.820
 It turns out a little much much of course not 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.120
 I put it turned out so thin good 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.640
 layer now the next layer will go us 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.840
 boiled potatoes and you rub too 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:13.090
 grated and this layer is the only syllable 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:18.570
 brownie salt it says I already say 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:22.170
 you press a little too good 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.170
 with smeared mayonnaise 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:33.390
 Now let's rub our squirrels who are wearing 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.390
 from yolks 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:41.370
 so in the end 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:44.470
 the last layer we ask our parmesan 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:49.989
 many will say that a layer of yolks and 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:52.480
 proteins they would swap i did 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:56.349
 just so because this 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.290
 interpretations we get as 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.629
 snow hill 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.160
 but still outside the window is busy soon new 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.629
 year 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.400
 connection with this i decided to move exactly 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:11.799
 so run our last layer 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.540
 parmesan but learning lettuce is ready left 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:15.549
 just decorate give them brew 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.100
 a few hours in the fridge and you can 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:20.199
 serve it on the holiday table 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.389
