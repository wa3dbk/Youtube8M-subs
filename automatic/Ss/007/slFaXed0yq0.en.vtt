00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
which is amazing I don't think the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.429 
which is amazing I don't think the
format's<00:01:15.000> failing<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:15.810> much<00:01:15.990> i<00:01:16.170> think<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
format's failing so much i think the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.140 
format's failing so much i think the
site<00:01:16.680> went<00:01:16.860> down<00:01:16.950> due<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.310> traffic<00:01:17.700> but<00:01:18.030> this

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
site went down due to traffic but this

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.820 
site went down due to traffic but this
is<00:01:18.299> kind<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.750> rare<00:01:18.990> occurrence<00:01:19.290> we<00:01:19.560> haven't

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
is kind of a rare occurrence we haven't

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.950 
is kind of a rare occurrence we haven't
seen<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.040> for<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.430> while<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.330> think<00:01:21.750> if<00:01:21.840> this

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
seen that for a while so I think if this

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.660 
seen that for a while so I think if this
happens<00:01:22.320> every<00:01:22.560> once<00:01:22.860> out<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.340> couple

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
happens every once out of a couple

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.950 
happens every once out of a couple
months<00:01:23.790> it's<00:01:24.030> really<00:01:24.270> not<00:01:24.420> something<00:01:24.630> that's

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
months it's really not something that's

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.679 
months it's really not something that's
gonna<00:01:25.080> hurt<00:01:25.710> nike<00:01:26.460> site<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:26.970> i<00:01:27.000> would<00:01:27.360> just<00:01:27.509> say

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689
