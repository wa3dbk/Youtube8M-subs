should do it if you have a less a fog
machine<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.670> puts<00:01:11.820> out<00:01:11.939> less<00:01:12.119> repelling<00:01:12.570> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
machine it puts out less repelling the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.280 
machine it puts out less repelling the
Mongol<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.320> smaller<00:01:13.979> hole<00:01:14.250> level

Mongol of a a smaller hole level
high-demand<00:01:16.290> fog<00:01:16.560> machine<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.180> it<00:01:18.180> work<00:01:18.330> where

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
high-demand fog machine so it work where

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.140 
high-demand fog machine so it work where
you<00:01:18.600> guys<00:01:22.369> see<00:01:23.369> how<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.580> just<00:01:23.700> shoots<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.119> right

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
you guys see how it just shoots it right

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.920 
you guys see how it just shoots it right
