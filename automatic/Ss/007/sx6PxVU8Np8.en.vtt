00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.619 
has a little bit of a dry brush on top
of<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.870> steel<00:00:43.260> but<00:00:43.980> it's<00:00:44.250> pretty<00:00:44.430> bland<00:00:44.760> so

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
of the steel but it's pretty bland so

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.930 
of the steel but it's pretty bland so
not<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.170> best<00:00:46.379> accessory<00:00:46.890> but<00:00:47.190> he<00:00:47.399> does<00:00:47.640> have

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
not the best accessory but he does have

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.260 
not the best accessory but he does have
it<00:00:48.149> he<00:00:48.989> can't<00:00:49.230> really<00:00:49.379> fit<00:00:49.680> his<00:00:49.980> hand<00:00:50.460> into<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
it he can't really fit his hand into the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.630 
it he can't really fit his hand into the
trigger<00:00:51.510> guard<00:00:51.719> very<00:00:51.989> well<00:00:52.320> that's<00:00:53.309> because

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
trigger guard very well that's because

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.779 
trigger guard very well that's because
he<00:00:53.820> doesn't<00:00:53.940> have<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.239> trigger<00:00:54.570> finger<00:00:55.730> so<00:00:56.730> it

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
he doesn't have a trigger finger so it

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.790 
he doesn't have a trigger finger so it
has<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.000> go<00:00:57.030> underneath<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.629> guard<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.350> then

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
has to go underneath the guard and then

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.069 
has to go underneath the guard and then
it<00:00:58.949> doesn't<00:00:59.070> fit<00:00:59.280> well<00:00:59.489> it'll<00:01:00.120> it'll<00:01:00.780> stay<00:01:00.930> in

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
it doesn't fit well it'll it'll stay in

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.990 
it doesn't fit well it'll it'll stay in
there<00:01:01.289> but<00:01:01.620> he<00:01:01.890> can't<00:01:02.039> hold<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.399> as<00:01:02.550> well<00:01:02.730> as<00:01:02.879> I

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
there but he can't hold it as well as I

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.140 
there but he can't hold it as well as I
would<00:01:03.180> have<00:01:03.239> liked<00:01:03.619> headsculpt<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.979> lacking<00:01:05.850> a

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150

little<00:01:06.270> bit<00:01:06.420> it's<00:01:06.840> not<00:01:07.110> terrible<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.939> don't

like<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.590> but<00:01:11.010> maybe<00:01:11.430> they<00:01:11.700> all<00:01:11.880> do<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.330> don't

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
like that but maybe they all do I don't

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.740 
like that but maybe they all do I don't
know<00:01:13.820> personally<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:15.119> don't<00:01:15.299> think<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:15.630> that

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
know personally I don't think it's that

a<00:02:01.649> smooth<00:02:01.950> disjoint<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.030> then<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.719> has<00:02:03.840> the

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
a smooth disjoint and then it has the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.200 
a smooth disjoint and then it has the
full<00:02:04.140> range<00:02:04.380> motion<00:02:04.530> there<00:02:05.040> no<00:02:05.310> bicep<00:02:05.850> swivel

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
full range motion there no bicep swivel

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.650 
full range motion there no bicep swivel
built<00:02:06.450> in<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:07.409> elbow<00:02:07.829> rotates<00:02:08.489> just<00:02:09.330> like<00:02:09.509> the

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
built in the elbow rotates just like the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.180 
built in the elbow rotates just like the
reach<00:02:09.869> figures<00:02:10.319> but<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.649> doesn't<00:02:10.890> have<00:02:11.009> the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
reach figures but it doesn't have the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.540 
reach figures but it doesn't have the
four

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
four

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.970 
four
armed<00:02:11.730> rotation<00:02:12.360> down<00:02:12.570> here<00:02:12.960> so<00:02:13.710> it's<00:02:13.860> just

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
armed rotation down here so it's just

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.420 
armed rotation down here so it's just
the<00:02:14.190> rotation<00:02:14.460> and<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.450> pivot<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:17.010> wrist<00:02:17.280> is

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
the rotation and the pivot the wrist is

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.890 
the rotation and the pivot the wrist is
actually<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.940> exact<00:02:18.210> same<00:02:18.390> as<00:02:18.570> the<00:02:18.750> reach

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
actually the exact same as the reach

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.210 
actually the exact same as the reach
figures<00:02:19.260> I<00:02:19.350> don't<00:02:19.500> know<00:02:19.560> if<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.710> can<00:02:19.830> see<00:02:20.040> in

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
figures I don't know if you can see in

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.940 
figures I don't know if you can see in
there<00:02:20.400> all<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.760> way<00:02:21.380> but<00:02:22.380> you<00:02:22.410> can<00:02:22.590> see<00:02:22.800> the

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
there all the way but you can see the

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.730 
there all the way but you can see the
little<00:02:23.130> graduated<00:02:23.940> disc<00:02:24.260> inside<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.500> ball

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
little graduated disc inside the ball

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.010 
little graduated disc inside the ball
joint<00:02:26.100> so<00:02:27.000> it's<00:02:27.150> a<00:02:27.270> ball<00:02:27.510> joint<00:02:27.690> with<00:02:27.930> the

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
joint so it's a ball joint with the

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.510 
joint so it's a ball joint with the
ratchet<00:02:28.170> just<00:02:28.530> like<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.830> regular<00:02:29.100> reach

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
ratchet just like the regular reach

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.570 
ratchet just like the regular reach
Spartans<00:02:30.350> so<00:02:31.350> that's<00:02:31.500> kind<00:02:31.650> of<00:02:31.680> nice<00:02:31.830> but<00:02:32.160> the

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
Spartans so that's kind of nice but the

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.510 
Spartans so that's kind of nice but the
cuff<00:02:33.330> of<00:02:33.480> his<00:02:33.630> sleeve

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
cuff of his sleeve

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.010 
cuff of his sleeve
pretty<00:02:35.520> much<00:02:35.610> inhibits<00:02:36.060> all<00:02:36.180> articulation

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
pretty much inhibits all articulation

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.340 
pretty much inhibits all articulation
other<00:02:37.260> than<00:02:37.740> rotation<00:02:38.780> so<00:02:39.780> that's<00:02:39.960> a<00:02:40.020> problem

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
other than rotation so that's a problem

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.140 
other than rotation so that's a problem
for<00:02:40.410> me<00:02:40.560> next<00:02:41.130> problem<00:02:41.430> is<00:02:41.610> there's<00:02:41.790> no<00:02:41.910> waist

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
for me next problem is there's no waist

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.940 
for me next problem is there's no waist
articulation<00:02:42.390> they<00:02:43.110> could<00:02:43.350> have<00:02:43.500> had<00:02:43.830> the

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
articulation they could have had the

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.340 
articulation they could have had the
Jackie<00:02:44.220> be<00:02:44.820> a<00:02:44.850> separate<00:02:45.270> part<00:02:45.540> oh<00:02:45.720> I<00:02:45.960> take<00:02:46.200> it

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
Jackie be a separate part oh I take it

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.730 
Jackie be a separate part oh I take it
back

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
back

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.320 
back
it<00:02:46.950> was<00:02:47.100> stuck<00:02:47.340> before<00:02:47.520> so<00:02:47.850> I<00:02:47.880> didn't<00:02:48.210> notice

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
it was stuck before so I didn't notice

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.610 
it was stuck before so I didn't notice
it<00:02:48.540> but<00:02:48.690> there's<00:02:48.900> a<00:02:48.990> little<00:02:49.140> bit<00:02:49.320> of<00:02:49.350> waist

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
it but there's a little bit of waist

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.520 
it but there's a little bit of waist
rotation<00:02:49.800> so<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:51.060> take<00:02:51.450> that<00:02:51.630> back<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:52.140> can

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
rotation so I take that back you can

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.160 
rotation so I take that back you can
rotate<00:02:52.710> it<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.430> he<00:02:54.060> does<00:02:54.240> have<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.480> little<00:02:54.840> bit

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
rotate it and he does have a little bit

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.880 
rotate it and he does have a little bit
of<00:02:55.200> an<00:02:55.380> AB<00:02:55.530> crunch<00:02:55.890> kind<00:02:56.250> of<00:02:57.260> it'll<00:02:58.260> move<00:02:58.470> a

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
of an AB crunch kind of it'll move a

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.650 
of an AB crunch kind of it'll move a
little<00:02:59.400> bit<00:02:59.670> so<00:02:59.850> that's<00:02:59.970> nice<00:03:00.240> touch<00:03:00.480> I'm

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
little bit so that's nice touch I'm

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.050 
little bit so that's nice touch I'm
happy<00:03:00.930> about<00:03:01.020> that<00:03:01.280> but<00:03:02.280> one<00:03:02.670> of<00:03:02.700> my<00:03:02.850> biggest

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
happy about that but one of my biggest

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.460 
happy about that but one of my biggest
complaints<00:03:03.570> is<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:04.110> hips

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
complaints is the hips

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.060 
complaints is the hips
there's<00:03:04.830> no<00:03:05.750> lateral<00:03:06.750> movement<00:03:07.470> they<00:03:07.590> only<00:03:07.770> go

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
there's no lateral movement they only go

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.860 
there's no lateral movement they only go
forward<00:03:08.580> in<00:03:08.700> backwards<00:03:09.150> like<00:03:09.300> an<00:03:09.480> old-school

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
forward in backwards like an old-school

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.040 
forward in backwards like an old-school
figure<00:03:10.640> and<00:03:11.640> there's<00:03:12.240> not<00:03:12.330> a<00:03:12.390> great<00:03:12.690> range<00:03:12.930> of

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
figure and there's not a great range of

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.450 
figure and there's not a great range of
motion<00:03:13.110> so<00:03:13.620> he's<00:03:13.860> really<00:03:14.040> just<00:03:14.190> gonna<00:03:14.370> be

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
motion so he's really just gonna be

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.540 
motion so he's really just gonna be
standing<00:03:14.970> straight<00:03:15.330> up<00:03:15.890> the<00:03:16.890> knees<00:03:17.070> is<00:03:17.280> my

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
standing straight up the knees is my

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.270 
standing straight up the knees is my
next<00:03:17.820> complaint<00:03:18.150> they're<00:03:18.750> really<00:03:19.590> ugly<00:03:19.860> I

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
next complaint they're really ugly I

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.340 
next complaint they're really ugly I
don't<00:03:20.400> get<00:03:20.670> why<00:03:20.790> they<00:03:20.850> made<00:03:21.150> them<00:03:21.270> this<00:03:22.140> way

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
don't get why they made them this way

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.800 
don't get why they made them this way
and<00:03:22.739> all<00:03:22.980> they're<00:03:23.250> terrible<00:03:23.670> looking<00:03:24.030> they

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
and all they're terrible looking they

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.860 
and all they're terrible looking they
have<00:03:25.050> a<00:03:25.080> hinge<00:03:25.950> there<00:03:26.450> but<00:03:27.450> you<00:03:27.540> really<00:03:27.570> will

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
have a hinge there but you really will

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.900 
have a hinge there but you really will
never<00:03:28.050> use<00:03:28.320> it<00:03:28.470> because<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.860> feet<00:03:29.100> have

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
never use it because the feet have

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.330 
never use it because the feet have
almost<00:03:30.570> no<00:03:30.810> range<00:03:31.080> of<00:03:31.230> motion<00:03:31.620> they<00:03:31.860> do<00:03:31.920> have<00:03:32.310> a

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
almost no range of motion they do have a

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.520 
almost no range of motion they do have a
ball<00:03:32.700> joint<00:03:32.970> on<00:03:33.209> them<00:03:33.390> just<00:03:33.480> like<00:03:33.600> the<00:03:33.900> Marine

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
ball joint on them just like the Marine

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.490 
ball joint on them just like the Marine
figures<00:03:34.980> from<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.030> reach<00:03:36.180> line<00:03:36.450> but<00:03:37.110> there's

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
figures from the reach line but there's

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.060 
figures from the reach line but there's
almost<00:03:37.739> no<00:03:38.070> motion<00:03:38.280> due<00:03:38.610> to<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:38.880> pant<00:03:39.720> leg<00:03:40.070> so

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
almost no motion due to the pant leg so

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.680 
almost no motion due to the pant leg so
you'll<00:03:41.520> never<00:03:41.610> use<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.060> knee<00:03:42.180> joint<00:03:42.510> really

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
you'll never use the knee joint really

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.020 
you'll never use the knee joint really
and<00:03:43.350> it's<00:03:43.560> really<00:03:43.950> ugly<00:03:44.100> and<00:03:44.430> then<00:03:44.670> of<00:03:44.790> course

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
and it's really ugly and then of course

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.720 
and it's really ugly and then of course
it<00:03:45.209> has<00:03:45.239> this<00:03:45.660> swivel<00:03:45.930> built<00:03:46.320> in<00:03:46.530> which<00:03:47.430> again

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
it has this swivel built in which again

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.000 
it has this swivel built in which again
you're<00:03:48.120> probably<00:03:48.390> not<00:03:48.750> going<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:49.020> use<00:03:49.080> so<00:03:49.800> it's

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
you're probably not going to use so it's

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.920 
you're probably not going to use so it's
really<00:03:50.160> ugly<00:03:50.370> and<00:03:50.820> you<00:03:51.480> really<00:03:51.660> don't<00:03:51.780> get

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
really ugly and you really don't get

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.510 
really ugly and you really don't get
much<00:03:52.110> out<00:03:52.350> of<00:03:52.380> it<00:03:54.020> because<00:03:55.020> of<00:03:55.050> that<00:03:55.380> I<00:03:55.739> I<00:03:56.070> don't

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
much out of it because of that I I don't

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.630 
much out of it because of that I I don't
necessarily<00:03:56.760> like<00:03:57.510> the<00:03:57.780> figure<00:03:58.110> as<00:03:58.380> much<00:03:58.770> but

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
necessarily like the figure as much but

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.520 
necessarily like the figure as much but
it's<00:03:59.820> still<00:04:00.030> captain<00:04:00.540> keys<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.170> it<00:04:01.290> still

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
it's still captain keys and it still

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.500 
it's still captain keys and it still
looks<00:04:01.560> pretty<00:04:01.920> good<00:04:02.370> so<00:04:02.430> it'll<00:04:03.030> make<00:04:03.209> for<00:04:03.270> a

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
looks pretty good so it'll make for a

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.199 
looks pretty good so it'll make for a
nice<00:04:03.690> piece<00:04:03.989> to<00:04:04.170> go<00:04:04.320> on<00:04:04.410> display<00:04:04.739> with<00:04:05.209> the

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
nice piece to go on display with the

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.290 
nice piece to go on display with the
other<00:04:06.570> halo<00:04:07.560> figures<00:04:08.010> and<00:04:08.310> really<00:04:09.030> all<00:04:09.180> you

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
other halo figures and really all you

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.400 
other halo figures and really all you
need<00:04:09.450> to<00:04:09.510> do<00:04:09.630> is<00:04:09.780> have<00:04:09.930> him<00:04:10.050> standing<00:04:10.320> there

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
need to do is have him standing there

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.670 
need to do is have him standing there
holding<00:04:10.590> his<00:04:10.830> pistol<00:04:11.310> and<00:04:11.790> he<00:04:11.880> looks<00:04:12.090> fine

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
holding his pistol and he looks fine

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.650 
holding his pistol and he looks fine
or<00:04:13.680> you<00:04:14.130> can<00:04:14.280> have<00:04:14.489> them<00:04:16.010> just<00:04:17.570> racking<00:04:18.570> the

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
or you can have them just racking the

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.029 
or you can have them just racking the
slide<00:04:18.690> or<00:04:19.109> something<00:04:19.260> whatever<00:04:19.710> you<00:04:19.830> want<00:04:19.979> to

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
slide or something whatever you want to

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.680 
slide or something whatever you want to
do<00:04:20.160> I<00:04:20.190> mean<00:04:20.430> it's<00:04:20.760> not<00:04:20.880> a<00:04:20.940> bad<00:04:21.150> figure<00:04:21.510> it's

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
do I mean it's not a bad figure it's

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
do I mean it's not a bad figure it's
just<00:04:21.870> not<00:04:22.049> nearly<00:04:22.289> as<00:04:22.500> nice<00:04:22.710> as<00:04:22.950> it<00:04:23.100> could<00:04:23.310> be

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
just not nearly as nice as it could be

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.279 
just not nearly as nice as it could be
so<00:04:24.860> it<00:04:25.669> doesn't<00:04:26.030> get<00:04:26.120> the<00:04:26.300> highest<00:04:26.479> marks<00:04:27.080> but

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
so it doesn't get the highest marks but

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.740 
so it doesn't get the highest marks but
it<00:04:27.440> is<00:04:27.650> probably<00:04:28.039> worth<00:04:28.340> picking<00:04:28.699> up<00:04:29.030> for<00:04:29.389> 11

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
it is probably worth picking up for 11

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.320 
it is probably worth picking up for 11
bucks<00:04:29.960> so<00:04:30.770> there<00:04:30.919> is<00:04:31.100> there's<00:04:31.370> captain<00:04:32.060> Keyes

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
bucks so there is there's captain Keyes

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.760 
bucks so there is there's captain Keyes
really<00:04:33.550> an<00:04:34.550> average<00:04:35.300> figure<00:04:35.509> I<00:04:35.900> would<00:04:36.259> say<00:04:36.470> but

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
really an average figure I would say but

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.219 
really an average figure I would say but
because<00:04:37.039> of<00:04:37.069> who<00:04:37.280> he<00:04:37.430> is<00:04:37.460> and<00:04:37.849> the<00:04:38.569> price<00:04:38.810> tag<00:04:39.020> I

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
because of who he is and the price tag I

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:40.659 
because of who he is and the price tag I
do<00:04:39.289> recommend<00:04:39.710> it<00:04:39.979> thanks<00:04:40.190> for<00:04:40.280> watching<00:04:40.520> guys
