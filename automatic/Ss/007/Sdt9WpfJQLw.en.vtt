00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
when I first got the glyph is how well

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.249 
when I first got the glyph is how well
is<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:08.910> actually<00:02:09.030> going<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.300> hold<00:02:09.569> my<00:02:09.720> iphone4

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
is it actually going to hold my iphone4
