00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.750
 Y 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.119
 good 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.940
 all right 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.250
 remember that sweat is also a 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.020
 chemical response that our 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.730
 body that 's why we should 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.750
 hydrate each time we work in 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.820
 a sport or we just walk 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.190
 but what do we complain about 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.130
 farmers every day do this 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.170
 same and they do not complain about being right 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.930
 but good but remember that we came 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.660
 for three fundamental reasons one do 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.090
 exercise two remember the work of the 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.340
 farmers and 3 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.830
 the most important thing is to expand the 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.070
 knowledge that we saw in class link 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.170
 dynamic and metallic but I tried to govern 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.820
 in which won home calm 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.070
 since federer won a birdie 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.600
 while we were here because 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.680
 It takes advantage that not only are the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.570
 won 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.000
 you know precisely why they 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.979
 they throw salt to the cattle we have seen it 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.530
 but we really do not know why they give 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.090
 room to the cattle because it is not precisely 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.140
 because cattle need to consume salt 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.140
 regularly to keep thanks 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.140
 boys 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.680
 and here is not that good plays is 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.130
 sticking one put calorones 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.960
 there are far the heifers I leave the salt and 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.210
 to continue with the class guys that 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.860
 it's going very well, he explained the 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.540
 professor the importance of consumption 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.720
 salt for animals and for beings 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.960
 humans yes clear in smaller proportion 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.789
 but it's always important 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.340
 because it is one of the main causes 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.170
 of the increase in blood pressure but 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.720
 well let's see how the link is presented 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.970
 ionic in salt for example that I tried 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.260
 it's lab work by little 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.260
 for a little bit of this a little bit 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.319
 if we take a spoonful of salt and the 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.319
 mix in water observe that this 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.319
 Dissolve 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.700
 on the other hand if the same sample of 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.670
 salt water we place it in the sun 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.099
 we are going to observe that this city 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.800
 evaporate and we will be left with crystals 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.360
 of salt in the background the beginner yes 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.890
 Exactly remember boys when 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.420
 we see in stress like that 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.790
 they observed some small crystals in 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.019
 cube shape those characteristics are 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.019
 proper of the ionic bond 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.820
 for example in this case the sun 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.280
 profession is chloride and sodium true 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.740
 correct the years remember that are the 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.180
 who win elections and are represented 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.489
 with the minus sign 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.409
 instead the cations are those that 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.930
 they lose elections and are represented with 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:22.609
 the plus sign very well to understand it 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.489
 better let's look at the chemical formula of 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:28.269
 Sodium chloride is formed by ions 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.219
 sodium chloride in the same proportion 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:34.159
 forming a crystalline network that's a 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:36.280
 example link only but because they have 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:38.599
 formed their songs and on their airplanes 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.629
 good you have to do first the 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:45.739
 electronic configuration in the case of 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:49.730
 sodium that is on the other hand that of chlorine 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:52.370
 it is state that is to say once the 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.879
 link the sodium configuration is and 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:59.350
 its electronics with the neon noble gas and 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:01.930
 the chlorine with argon noble gas 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.770
 sodium loses an electron of this 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.140
 way both acquire greater stability 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:11.200
 the ions are going to bring the cations and 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.120
 vice versa this process generates forces 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.870
 electrostatic that produce a 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.870
 crystal structure 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.670
 they understood ironic boys and the 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.900
 metallic of this frame can serve us 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.570
 just in the metallic art is a 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.280
 Chemical link example and most 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.720
 metals boys are used to 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.050
 do the important lessons like the 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.050
 bronze 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.090
 in the art metallic atoms 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.560
 hold together for a large amount 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.770
 of elections that move in the 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.260
 surface the nuclei are grouped together 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.120
 way close to one with order and those 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.820
 electrons move towards the 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.950
 surface producing a compact network 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.310
 that is known with the sea model of 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:23.740
 elections the elections valence 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.780
 metals tend to move between 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.510
 empty orbitals of the other atoms 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.120
 said mobility is due to its low 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:33.790
 ionization energy that is energy 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.110
 necessary to detach an electron from 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.180
 valence of a neutral atom 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.330
 Here are some of the properties of 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.580
 metal bonds are solid to 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.560
 mercury exception and possibly the 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.960
 franz also possess a high 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.540
 electrical conductivity lead 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.760
 easily the heat are materials that 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.860
 They present brightness because they reflect great 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.440
 amount of light that falls on your 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.120
 surfaces are variable what 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.670
 means that they can be extended in 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.010
 relatively thin plates are 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:07.010
 Ductile that is used to produce 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:09.740
 very thin wires and most 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:12.620
 the metals are used to train 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.220
 important injuries such as bronze and 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.220
 steel 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.990
 i 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.650
 they understood that it is an ionic bond and 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.270
 a metallic link yes clear see 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.800
 boys like such a beautiful activity 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:46.300
 like agriculture and livestock 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:49.180
 allows to study are the ski micos 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:51.260
 well, to see well either well 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.720
 we finish the job here at the end 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.190
 all good that said that they could 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.680
 learn a lot in boys and that 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.720
 you really applied it in class what 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.580
 come and apply here in the field because 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.020
 because if you see the examples and see 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.790
 the needs and the things that are 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.560
 sold to livestock in agriculture and 

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.760
 in the field for you the day 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.100
 tomorrow they become 

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.660
 professionals come to help us with 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.370
 better technology so that they were our 

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.460
 animal boys that makes me happy 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.460
 quite
