know<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.790> kind<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.090> like<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.890> timings<00:01:25.890> a

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
know this is kind of like the timings a

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.100 
know this is kind of like the timings a
little<00:01:26.070> weird<00:01:26.490> for<00:01:26.729> this<00:01:26.909> but<00:01:27.509> if<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.869> do<00:01:27.990> it

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
little weird for this but if you do it

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.260 
little weird for this but if you do it
the<00:01:28.229> way<00:01:28.320> i<00:01:28.350> said<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.400> do<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.700> i<00:01:29.850> think<00:01:29.909> it

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
the way i said to do it i think it

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.210 
the way i said to do it i think it
should<00:01:30.450> work<00:01:30.570> every<00:01:30.990> time<00:01:31.020> but<00:01:31.920> there<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.189> go

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
should work every time but there you go

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.160 
should work every time but there you go
