something<00:02:06.780> like<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.170> but<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.710> just<00:02:08.190> find<00:02:08.310> it

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
something like that but I just find it

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.380 
something like that but I just find it
easier<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.789> use<00:02:08.879> this<00:02:09.000> because<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.330> don't

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
easier to use this because I don't

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.089 
easier to use this because I don't
really<00:02:09.569> care<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:09.989> don't<00:02:10.140> really<00:02:10.289> need<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.860> name

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
really care I don't really need the name

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:11.550 
really care I don't really need the name
of<00:02:11.129> the

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
of the

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.839 
of the
because<00:02:11.920> it's<00:02:12.010> going<00:02:12.099> to<00:02:12.160> be<00:02:12.340> in<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.670> game

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
because it's going to be in the game

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.790 
because it's going to be in the game
anyways<00:02:13.209> and<00:02:13.420> plus<00:02:14.140> usually<00:02:14.560> with<00:02:14.680> the

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
anyways and plus usually with the

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.199 
anyways and plus usually with the
instructions<00:02:15.310> there<00:02:15.520> are<00:02:15.700> like<00:02:15.910> little

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
instructions there are like little

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.089 
instructions there are like little
symbols<00:02:16.750> that<00:02:16.930> symbolize<00:02:17.470> with<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.770> gayness

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
symbols that symbolize with the gayness

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:23.160 
symbols that symbolize with the gayness
or<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.400> little<00:02:18.610> apples<00:02:19.060> on<00:02:20.020> it<00:02:20.500> so<00:02:21.450> yeah<00:02:22.450> I'm

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
or the little apples on it so yeah I'm

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.690 
or the little apples on it so yeah I'm
just<00:02:23.620> going<00:02:23.860> to<00:02:23.890> get<00:02:24.099> started

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
um next are going to be needing the

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.420 
um next are going to be needing the
instruction<00:03:11.170> manual<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:13.860> you're<00:03:14.860> going<00:03:15.190> to

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
instruction manual and you're going to

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:22.590 
instruction manual and you're going to
need<00:03:15.640> to<00:03:15.910> cut<00:03:16.239> out<00:03:16.510> this<00:03:18.299> logo<00:03:19.799> and<00:03:21.390> you<00:03:22.390> want

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
need to cut out this logo and you want

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.460 
need to cut out this logo and you want
to<00:03:22.690> make<00:03:22.870> sure<00:03:22.900> that<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.739> logo<00:03:24.040> can<00:03:24.640> fit<00:03:25.150> on

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
to make sure that the logo can fit on

to make sure that the logo can fit on
the<00:03:26.470> lid<00:03:27.430> of<00:03:27.730> the<00:03:27.790> box<00:03:28.329> because<00:03:28.750> it's<00:03:28.900> going<00:03:29.049> to

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
the lid of the box because it's going to

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.660 
the lid of the box because it's going to
that's<00:03:29.530> going<00:03:29.680> to<00:03:29.799> that's<00:03:30.010> where<00:03:30.370> it's<00:03:30.489> going

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
that's going to that's where it's going

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.740 
that's going to that's where it's going
to<00:03:30.790> be<00:03:32.340> so<00:03:33.340> I<00:03:33.370> will<00:03:33.760> be<00:03:33.880> back<00:03:34.060> once<00:03:34.390> I<00:03:34.510> have

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
to be so I will be back once I have

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.020 
to be so I will be back once I have
finished<00:03:35.200> cutting<00:03:35.620> it<00:03:35.859> out<00:03:36.010> so<00:03:36.760> I<00:03:36.790> just

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
finished cutting it out so I just

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.559 
finished cutting it out so I just
finished<00:03:37.359> cutting<00:03:37.600> out<00:03:38.079> the<00:03:38.590> little<00:03:39.040> um

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
finished cutting out the little um

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.830 
finished cutting out the little um
apples<00:03:40.569> to<00:03:40.690> apples'<00:03:41.079> ein<00:03:41.319> and<00:03:42.389> I<00:03:43.389> just<00:03:43.569> cut<00:03:43.810> it

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
apples to apples' ein and I just cut it

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.449 
apples to apples' ein and I just cut it
up<00:03:44.109> right<00:03:44.620> to<00:03:45.069> the<00:03:45.100> lime<00:03:46.170> so<00:03:47.170> yeah<00:03:47.410> and<00:03:47.680> this<00:03:48.400> is

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
up right to the lime so yeah and this is

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.090 
up right to the lime so yeah and this is
the<00:03:49.000> instruction<00:03:49.569> manual<00:03:50.139> just<00:03:50.470> cut<00:03:50.739> out<00:03:50.920> like

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
the instruction manual just cut out like

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.180 
the instruction manual just cut out like
that<00:03:51.280> and<00:03:52.079> the<00:03:53.079> back<00:03:53.290> just<00:03:53.560> looks<00:03:53.769> like<00:03:53.829> that

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
that and the back just looks like that

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.740 
that and the back just looks like that
so<00:03:54.579> it<00:03:54.670> just<00:03:54.700> has<00:03:54.970> some<00:03:55.150> writing<00:03:55.389> on<00:03:55.480> it<00:03:55.540> and

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
so it just has some writing on it and

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.910 
so it just has some writing on it and
you<00:03:55.989> want<00:03:56.170> to<00:03:56.230> make<00:03:56.319> sure<00:03:56.500> that<00:03:56.620> you're<00:03:56.769> not

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
you want to make sure that you're not

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.280 
you want to make sure that you're not
cutting<00:03:57.280> because<00:03:58.000> like<00:03:58.180> the<00:03:58.569> instruction

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
cutting because like the instruction

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.410 
cutting because like the instruction
manual<00:03:59.680> is<00:03:59.799> most<00:04:00.310> likely<00:04:00.670> going<00:04:00.850> to<00:04:00.940> be<00:04:01.030> double

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
manual is most likely going to be double

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.770 
manual is most likely going to be double
sided<00:04:03.180> like<00:04:04.180> that

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
sided like that

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.190 
sided like that
this<00:04:05.079> one's<00:04:05.319> double-sided<00:04:06.870> like<00:04:07.870> that<00:04:08.019> and

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
this one's double-sided like that and

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.030 
this one's double-sided like that and
you<00:04:08.260> want<00:04:08.380> to<00:04:08.440> make<00:04:08.530> sure<00:04:08.680> that<00:04:08.799> you're<00:04:08.920> not

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
you want to make sure that you're not

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.280 
you want to make sure that you're not
cutting<00:04:09.370> out<00:04:09.549> any<00:04:09.760> important<00:04:10.420> information<00:04:11.139> on

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
cutting out any important information on

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.140 
cutting out any important information on
the<00:04:11.470> instruction<00:04:11.920> manual<00:04:12.280> or<00:04:12.670> if<00:04:12.940> you<00:04:13.030> like

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
the instruction manual or if you like

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.190 
the instruction manual or if you like
already<00:04:13.329> know<00:04:13.480> how<00:04:13.569> to<00:04:13.660> play<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.900> game<00:04:14.049> or

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
already know how to play the game or

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.879 
already know how to play the game or
something<00:04:14.530> so<00:04:14.799> I<00:04:15.269> don't<00:04:16.269> know<00:04:16.359> but<00:04:16.600> yeah<00:04:17.200> so<00:04:17.859> I

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
something so I don't know but yeah so I

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:19.640 
something so I don't know but yeah so I
make<00:04:18.100> sure<00:04:18.130> it's<00:04:18.340> not<00:04:18.430> important<00:04:18.910> information

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
make sure it's not important information

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.730 
make sure it's not important information
so<00:04:20.650> now<00:04:20.890> I'm<00:04:21.130> just<00:04:21.340> going<00:04:21.609> to<00:04:22.000> tape<00:04:22.630> it<00:04:22.870> on<00:04:23.080> to

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
so now I'm just going to tape it on to

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.660 
so now I'm just going to tape it on to
the<00:04:23.860> box

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.470 

like<00:04:27.670> that<00:04:28.230> it<00:04:29.230> looks<00:04:29.620> super<00:04:30.040> cute<00:04:30.340> so<00:04:31.330> yeah

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
like that it looks super cute so yeah

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.330 
like that it looks super cute so yeah
I'm<00:04:31.600> just<00:04:31.660> going<00:04:31.870> to<00:04:32.380> tape<00:04:32.860> it<00:04:32.890> on<00:04:33.100> camera

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
I'm just going to tape it on camera

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.920 
I'm just going to tape it on camera
because<00:04:33.670> it<00:04:33.760> doesn't<00:04:33.970> line<00:04:34.060> either<00:04:34.180> it's<00:04:34.780> not

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
because it doesn't line either it's not

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.680 
because it doesn't line either it's not
going<00:04:35.080> to<00:04:35.140> take<00:04:35.260> too<00:04:35.410> long<00:04:35.700> so<00:04:36.700> for<00:04:37.120> the<00:04:37.270> tape<00:04:37.480> I

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
going to take too long so for the tape I

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:44.690 
going to take too long so for the tape I
just<00:04:38.050> I<00:04:39.840> roll<00:04:40.840> it<00:04:40.990> up<00:04:41.170> into<00:04:41.620> those<00:04:42.130> little<00:04:43.650> um

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
just I roll it up into those little um

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.080 
just I roll it up into those little um
cylinder<00:04:45.700> things<00:04:46.510> and<00:04:47.160> yeah<00:04:48.160> turns<00:04:48.940> out

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
cylinder things and yeah turns out

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.390 
cylinder things and yeah turns out
pretty<00:04:49.210> good<00:04:49.420> and<00:04:49.630> then<00:04:50.260> you<00:04:50.410> just<00:04:50.680> stick<00:04:51.250> it

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
pretty good and then you just stick it

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:57.570 
pretty good and then you just stick it
on<00:04:51.550> like<00:04:52.320> that<00:04:53.850> so<00:04:55.710> that's<00:04:56.710> really<00:04:56.800> simple<00:04:57.160> and

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
on like that so that's really simple and

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.700 
on like that so that's really simple and
I<00:04:57.700> just<00:04:57.850> find<00:04:58.030> it<00:04:58.150> quicker<00:04:58.360> than<00:04:58.510> tape<00:04:58.960> plus

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
I just find it quicker than tape plus

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.220 
I just find it quicker than tape plus
also<00:05:00.160> doing<00:05:00.520> it<00:05:00.670> like<00:05:00.850> this<00:05:01.120> on<00:05:01.390> the<00:05:01.660> back<00:05:01.930> it

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
also doing it like this on the back it

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:07.890 
also doing it like this on the back it
doesn't<00:05:02.650> show<00:05:03.250> the<00:05:04.620> shiny<00:05:06.150> stuff<00:05:07.150> that<00:05:07.660> the

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
doesn't show the shiny stuff that the

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.350 
doesn't show the shiny stuff that the
tape<00:05:08.200> leaves<00:05:08.710> if<00:05:09.100> you<00:05:09.220> know<00:05:09.340> what<00:05:09.640> I<00:05:09.670> mean

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
tape leaves if you know what I mean

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.230 
tape leaves if you know what I mean
shiny<00:05:11.350> surface<00:05:11.800> but<00:05:12.370> if<00:05:12.550> something<00:05:13.060> just

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
shiny surface but if something just

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.490 
shiny surface but if something just
isn't<00:05:13.450> marketing<00:05:13.840> that<00:05:13.960> I<00:05:14.020> obviously<00:05:14.350> just

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
isn't marketing that I obviously just

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.150 
isn't marketing that I obviously just
kind<00:05:14.830> of<00:05:14.860> have<00:05:15.100> to<00:05:15.370> do<00:05:15.490> it<00:05:15.520> on<00:05:15.700> the<00:05:15.820> outside<00:05:15.850> so

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
kind of have to do it on the outside so

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.330 
kind of have to do it on the outside so
yeah<00:05:18.160> I'm<00:05:18.340> just<00:05:18.550> trying<00:05:19.120> to<00:05:19.360> tape<00:05:19.600> into<00:05:20.230> a

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
yeah I'm just trying to tape into a

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:26.040 
yeah I'm just trying to tape into a
square<00:05:21.340> and<00:05:24.180> whenever<00:05:25.180> I<00:05:25.330> try<00:05:25.630> it<00:05:25.690> with<00:05:25.810> glue

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
square and whenever I try it with glue

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.290 
square and whenever I try it with glue
without<00:05:26.290> the<00:05:26.440> glue<00:05:26.650> never<00:05:26.890> sticky<00:05:27.790> enough<00:05:28.030> so

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
without the glue never sticky enough so

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:34.590 
without the glue never sticky enough so
that's<00:05:29.080> why<00:05:29.290> I<00:05:29.320> use<00:05:29.500> tape<00:05:30.150> so<00:05:31.150> I<00:05:31.770> just<00:05:32.770> um<00:05:33.600> put

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
that's why I use tape so I just um put

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.420 
that's why I use tape so I just um put
the<00:05:34.960> tape<00:05:35.350> until<00:05:35.680> I<00:05:35.800> like<00:05:35.890> a<00:05:35.950> little<00:05:36.190> square

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
the tape until I like a little square

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.790 
the tape until I like a little square
you<00:05:36.460> can't<00:05:36.700> really<00:05:36.850> see<00:05:37.030> it<00:05:37.150> but<00:05:37.590> yeah<00:05:38.590> I'm

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
you can't really see it but yeah I'm

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.590 
you can't really see it but yeah I'm
just<00:05:39.040> going<00:05:39.250> to<00:05:39.340> tape<00:05:40.180> it<00:05:40.450> on

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
just going to tape it on

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:48.680 
just going to tape it on
make<00:05:43.600> sure<00:05:43.780> it's<00:05:43.960> in<00:05:44.170> the<00:05:44.440> center<00:05:46.890> so<00:05:47.890> that's

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
make sure it's in the center so that's

00:05:48.690 --> 00:06:00.840 
make sure it's in the center so that's
the<00:05:49.690> apples-to-apples<00:05:50.050> sign<00:05:50.740> on<00:05:52.620> the<00:05:53.620> box<00:05:59.850> so

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
the apples-to-apples sign on the box so

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.570 
the apples-to-apples sign on the box so
I<00:06:00.910> just<00:06:01.300> put<00:06:01.630> the<00:06:01.840> lid<00:06:02.050> of<00:06:02.200> the<00:06:02.350> Box<00:06:02.590> on<00:06:02.920> and<00:06:03.220> it

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
I just put the lid of the Box on and it

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.150 
I just put the lid of the Box on and it
was<00:06:03.760> a<00:06:03.790> little<00:06:04.090> bit<00:06:04.300> tricky<00:06:04.480> I'm<00:06:04.930> not<00:06:05.170> sure<00:06:05.770> why

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 
was a little bit tricky I'm not sure why

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.040 
was a little bit tricky I'm not sure why
it<00:06:06.220> was<00:06:06.550> and<00:06:06.940> might<00:06:07.120> be<00:06:07.150> because<00:06:07.690> of<00:06:07.780> the<00:06:07.870> paper

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
it was and might be because of the paper

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.350 
it was and might be because of the paper
and<00:06:08.380> stuff<00:06:08.620> now<00:06:08.860> because<00:06:09.280> it's<00:06:09.940> a<00:06:10.060> little<00:06:10.210> bit

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
and stuff now because it's a little bit

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.350 
and stuff now because it's a little bit
thick<00:06:10.660> just<00:06:10.930> because<00:06:11.170> it's<00:06:11.290> cardstock<00:06:12.360> so

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
thick just because it's cardstock so

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.180 
thick just because it's cardstock so
yeah<00:06:13.540> just<00:06:13.840> take<00:06:14.020> a<00:06:14.050> little<00:06:14.230> bit<00:06:14.350> of<00:06:14.410> force<00:06:14.740> but

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
yeah just take a little bit of force but

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.640 
yeah just take a little bit of force but
that's<00:06:15.400> okay<00:06:15.730> I'm<00:06:16.360> not<00:06:16.420> gonna<00:06:16.960> be<00:06:17.170> taking<00:06:17.530> the

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.650 
that's okay I'm not gonna be taking the

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:20.550 
that's okay I'm not gonna be taking the
lid<00:06:17.860> off<00:06:18.040> in<00:06:18.220> time<00:06:18.490> soon<00:06:19.170> so<00:06:20.170> that's<00:06:20.230> what<00:06:20.470> it

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
lid off in time soon so that's what it

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.410 
lid off in time soon so that's what it
looks<00:06:20.740> like<00:06:20.950> once<00:06:21.310> it's<00:06:21.550> all<00:06:21.730> finished<00:06:21.760> and<00:06:22.390> I

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:22.420 
looks like once it's all finished and I

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.960 
looks like once it's all finished and I
just<00:06:22.690> didn't<00:06:22.930> wrap<00:06:23.110> the<00:06:23.320> bottom<00:06:23.710> so<00:06:24.580> I<00:06:24.610> really

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:24.970
