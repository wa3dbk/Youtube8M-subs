right<00:04:25.289> here<00:04:25.560> it's<00:04:25.830> pretty<00:04:26.099> good<00:04:26.310> you<00:04:26.460> know<00:04:26.490> it

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
right here it's pretty good you know it

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.840 
right here it's pretty good you know it
along<00:04:27.430> in<00:04:27.610> depth<00:04:27.880> and<00:04:28.150> we<00:04:29.080> all<00:04:29.200> know<00:04:29.380> um

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850

webinars<00:04:30.850> right<00:04:31.030> now<00:04:31.180> are<00:04:31.330> hot<00:04:31.630> they<00:04:32.590> convert

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
webinars right now are hot they convert

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.670 
webinars right now are hot they convert
really<00:04:33.340> well<00:04:33.520> I<00:04:33.790> think<00:04:34.420> for<00:04:34.870> an<00:04:34.960> average<00:04:35.140> sales

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
really well I think for an average sales

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.350 
really well I think for an average sales
page<00:04:35.980> is<00:04:36.160> something<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:36.760> conversion<00:04:37.240> rate

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
page is something the conversion rate

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.910 
page is something the conversion rate
for<00:04:37.510> a<00:04:37.540> sales<00:04:37.780> page<00:04:38.020> is<00:04:38.230> something<00:04:38.500> like<00:04:38.620> one's

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
for a sales page is something like one's

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.900 
for a sales page is something like one's
a<00:04:39.070> three<00:04:39.280> percent<00:04:39.640> for<00:04:39.940> um<00:04:41.610> you<00:04:42.610> know<00:04:42.730> just

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
a three percent for um you know just

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.670 
a three percent for um you know just
normal<00:04:43.060> traffic<00:04:43.450> to<00:04:43.750> a<00:04:43.810> sales<00:04:44.110> page<00:04:44.320> but

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
normal traffic to a sales page but

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.650 
normal traffic to a sales page but
whereas<00:04:44.980> a<00:04:45.010> webinar<00:04:45.430> convincin<00:04:46.120> I<00:04:46.240> think<00:04:46.540> it's

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
whereas a webinar convincin I think it's

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.300 
whereas a webinar convincin I think it's
over<00:04:46.990> ten<00:04:47.200> percent<00:04:47.560> so<00:04:47.770> you<00:04:47.830> know<00:04:47.980> you<00:04:48.040> got

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
over ten percent so you know you got

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.830 
over ten percent so you know you got
more<00:04:48.460> up<00:04:48.700> you<00:04:48.880> got<00:04:49.030> more<00:04:49.150> chance<00:04:49.330> of<00:04:49.540> making

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
more up you got more chance of making

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.540 
more up you got more chance of making
the<00:04:49.870> sale<00:04:50.140> so<00:04:50.800> I<00:04:50.830> just<00:04:50.980> wanted<00:04:51.220> to<00:04:51.250> make<00:04:51.400> this
