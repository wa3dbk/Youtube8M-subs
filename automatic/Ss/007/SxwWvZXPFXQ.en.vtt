00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.200
 let's make a series of videos about 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.179
 money and economy for beginners who 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.680
 well said may sound a bit dense but 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.010
 let's try to make it as easy as possible 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.830
 possible and fun 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.300
 it is important that now with the crisis and 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.430
 with these economic problems that 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.869
 we have learn a little about it 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.490
 so that we are prepared and so that 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.520
 we can protect ourselves now let's 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.910
 compare what is the value of this that is 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:32.090
 a silver coin with this what is a 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.340
 20 euro bill to start the 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.320
 Silver coin has always been for 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.809
 more than 5,000 years has been used to 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.480
 the exchange then apart from that from the 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.360
 value for your change has a value of 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.180
 Metal is a precious metal production 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.610
 limited this is going to give us the land that 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.400
 by itself it has value while the 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.949
 value of the tickets has to be 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.019
 backed by the government in this case 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.059
 the euro bill is backed by 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:02.330
 the European economic community and that of 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.360
 dollar for the government of the us but 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.400
 what happens when the value of money is 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.920
 devalue we have a very clear example 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.260
 about 2000 years ago in the 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.799
 Roman empire them in their eagerness for 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.690
 expand your empire began to spend 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.230
 and spend money because we already know that 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.360
 war 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.580
 to money until they had no more 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.290
 then they began to mix the gold and the 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.770
 silver they used for the coins 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.390
 with other not so precious minerals 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.770
 they mixed it so much and they did not dilute it 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.100
 that ultimately ended up losing for 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:37.440
 complete its value this resulted in a 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.010
 hyperinflation and a monetary crisis 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.420
 is to take all the time to the Roman Empire 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:46.140
 we also have a very clear example 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.000
 do nothing more than a year in the USA and in 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.800
 europe has also happened to us that we have 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.420
 had an economic crisis that 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.250
 we hope that it does not reach the crisis 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.350
 monetary but this will be another issue 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.310
 which we will talk about later are the 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.820
 on inflation inflation occurs 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.200
 when you create more currency in circulation 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.770
 existing the same amount of goods 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.000
 It should be noted that it is not the same 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.860
 inflation that price rise the 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.080
 price rise is usually a 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.480
 consequence of inflation 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.970
 the government is not usually responsible with 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.460
 your expenses usually spend more than the money 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.100
 What do you have to solve this? 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.140
 make more money print if we do 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.690
 we are counterfeiters and we are going to 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.820
 the jail however the government what 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.590
 habitually do to solve the 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.620
 problems they have creating in turn 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.290
 major problems in the future the 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.330
 politicians instead of letting the 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.080
 market do what you have to do in 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.720
 this case fall and die usually try to 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.170
 stay in his position giving the 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.599
 pill 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.160
 they are creating more money by keeping 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.099
 happy people and keeping the people 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.750
 quiet and this create problems very much 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.630
 older and it leads to fatal 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.360
 consequences in the USA for example have 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.220
 been living beyond their 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.340
 possibilities at the expense of other countries 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.350
 like for example china that created a lot 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.670
 but this is a very complex issue of 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.670
 that we're going to talk about later
