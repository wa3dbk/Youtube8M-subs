first<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.500> got<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.740> figure<00:01:07.979> out<00:01:08.040> who<00:01:08.310> did<00:01:08.520> it

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
first I got to figure out who did it

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.929 
first I got to figure out who did it
unfortunately<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.229> think<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.799> know<00:01:10.860> because<00:01:11.790> all

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
unfortunately I think I know because all

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.219 
the words are spelled right it's got to
be<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.340> key<00:01:14.520> keeper<00:01:15.020> however<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.110> only

be the key keeper however the only
problem<00:01:16.740> with<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.100> as<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.580> can<00:01:17.759> see

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
problem with that is as you can see

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.719 
problem with that is as you can see
there's<00:01:19.350> really<00:01:19.500> not<00:01:19.710> enough<00:01:19.770> snow<00:01:20.340> on<00:01:20.549> his

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
and what goes around most definitely

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.569 
and what goes around most definitely
comes<00:01:46.079> around<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.770> see<00:01:46.920> he<00:01:47.070> hasn't<00:01:47.280> been
