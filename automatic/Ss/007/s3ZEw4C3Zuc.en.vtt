actual thing that you actually stick on
your<00:01:33.630> bathtub<00:01:34.460> so<00:01:35.460> um<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.930> came<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.439> think

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
your bathtub so um and it came I think

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.440 
your bathtub so um and it came I think
with<00:01:37.979> screws<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.549> if<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.729> wanted<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.119> hang<00:01:39.299> it

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
with screws so if you wanted to hang it

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.010 
with screws so if you wanted to hang it
to<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.689> wall<00:01:39.869> then<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.680> could<00:01:40.950> although<00:01:42.020> you

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
to the wall then you could although you

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.539 
to the wall then you could although you
want<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.500> drain<00:01:43.770> into<00:01:44.100> your<00:01:44.369> bathtub

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
want it to drain into your bathtub

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.789 
want it to drain into your bathtub
because<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.329> toys<00:01:45.570> are<00:01:45.689> still<00:01:46.049> kind<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.649> wet

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
because the toys are still kind of wet

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.800 
because the toys are still kind of wet
so<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.189> don't<00:01:47.460> see<00:01:48.180> how<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.570> would<00:01:48.600> happen

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
so I don't see how that would happen

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.120

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
and the actual plastic and that does

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:09.139 
and the actual plastic and that does
hell

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
hell

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.390 
hell
here<00:02:09.569> better<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.709> just<00:02:10.979> on<00:02:11.220> with

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
here better so this is just on with

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.780 
here better so this is just on with
double<00:02:11.700> sided<00:02:11.849> sticky<00:02:12.239> tape<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.379> I<00:02:14.220> have<00:02:14.549> not

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
double sided sticky tape and I have not

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.880 
double sided sticky tape and I have not
yet<00:02:15.150> had<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.569> fall<00:02:15.780> down<00:02:15.989> and<00:02:16.230> I've<00:02:16.349> had<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.680> for

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
yet had it fall down and I've had it for

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.360 
yet had it fall down and I've had it for
years<00:02:16.920> this<00:02:17.640> just<00:02:17.930> lays<00:02:18.930> back<00:02:19.230> down<00:02:19.290> on<00:02:20.129> that

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
years this just lays back down on that

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.850 
years this just lays back down on that
so<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.239> weight<00:02:21.420> is<00:02:21.450> actually<00:02:22.019> just<00:02:22.530> on<00:02:22.680> this

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
so the weight is actually just on this

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.470 
so the weight is actually just on this
little<00:02:23.010> piece<00:02:23.250> right<00:02:23.370> here<00:02:23.519> and<00:02:24.110> then<00:02:26.480> cool

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
little piece right here and then cool

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.030 
little piece right here and then cool
because<00:02:27.569> the<00:02:27.750> kids<00:02:27.989> can<00:02:28.200> take<00:02:28.439> it<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:28.680> just

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
because the kids can take it and just

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.190 
because the kids can take it and just
kind<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.370> scoop<00:02:29.609> up<00:02:29.790> their<00:02:29.939> toys<00:02:30.150> clean<00:02:31.079> up

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
clean up everybody everywhere and then

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.789 
clean up everybody everywhere and then
they<00:02:33.030> just<00:02:33.060> hang<00:02:33.390> it<00:02:33.540> back<00:02:33.659> up<00:02:33.720> like<00:02:34.079> that<00:02:34.579> so

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
they just hang it back up like that so

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.960

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:40.859 
would probably knowing now what i know i

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:42.819

would<00:02:40.980> go<00:02:41.159> ahead<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.400> spend<00:02:41.819> the<00:02:41.909> money<00:02:42.090> on<00:02:42.359> it

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
would go ahead and spend the money on it

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.520 
would go ahead and spend the money on it
anyways<00:02:43.829> it's<00:02:44.010> by<00:02:44.220> Boone<00:02:44.599> frog<00:02:45.599> I've<00:02:45.989> seen

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
anyways it's by Boone frog I've seen

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.599 
anyways it's by Boone frog I've seen
generic<00:02:47.010> ones<00:02:47.220> at<00:02:47.370> walmart<00:02:47.519> that<00:02:47.940> may<00:02:49.549> may<00:02:50.549> be

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
generic ones at walmart that may may be

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.460 
generic ones at walmart that may may be
a<00:02:50.730> little<00:02:50.879> bit<00:02:51.030> cheaper<00:02:51.389> third<00:02:51.930> in<00:02:52.170> different

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
a little bit cheaper third in different

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.580 
a little bit cheaper third in different
shapes<00:02:52.680> I<00:02:52.859> think<00:02:53.010> there<00:02:53.099> was<00:02:53.220> like<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.370> ladybug

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
shapes I think there was like a ladybug

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.839 
shapes I think there was like a ladybug
but<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:55.620> don't<00:02:55.920> know<00:02:56.099> I<00:02:56.129> haven't<00:02:56.489> reviewed

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
but I don't know I haven't reviewed

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.849 
but I don't know I haven't reviewed
those<00:02:57.060> I<00:02:57.389> haven't<00:02:57.810> used<00:02:58.139> those<00:02:58.379> so<00:02:58.590> i'm<00:02:58.709> not

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
those I haven't used those so i'm not

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.250 
those I haven't used those so i'm not
sure<00:02:59.069> if<00:02:59.189> it<00:02:59.310> works<00:02:59.489> as<00:02:59.700> well<00:02:59.730> or<00:03:00.060> not<00:03:00.120> but<00:03:00.810> the

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
sure if it works as well or not but the

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.960 
sure if it works as well or not but the
concept<00:03:01.739> is<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.069> same<00:03:02.099> so<00:03:02.430> i<00:03:02.459> think<00:03:02.579> i<00:03:02.790> would

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
concept is the same so i think i would

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.369 
concept is the same so i think i would
think<00:03:03.150> it<00:03:03.329> would<00:03:03.450> work<00:03:03.480> just<00:03:03.629> as<00:03:03.959> well<00:03:04.019> and

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
think it would work just as well and

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.819 
think it would work just as well and
that<00:03:04.829> way<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:05.010> could<00:03:05.159> save<00:03:05.790> some<00:03:06.030> money<00:03:06.620> if<00:03:07.620> it

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
that way you could save some money if it

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.940 
that way you could save some money if it
works<00:03:08.569> anyways<00:03:09.569> so<00:03:09.900> i<00:03:09.930> wanted<00:03:10.200> to<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:10.769> know<00:03:10.799> to
