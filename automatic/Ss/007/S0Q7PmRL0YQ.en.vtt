00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.200
 in this video we will see how to record 

00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:09.169
 as sorry how to put a photo in 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:13.539
 our résumé the first thing that there is 

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:13.539
 what to have is a picture here I have a 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:20.910
 ok and let's see how to put this photo 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:24.190
 in our good curriculum logically 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.510
 we should put our photo 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:29.740
 and the photo we have on the desk 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.900
 so when it comes to searching, you have to 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.020
 keep in mind where we have saved the 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.100
 Photo 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:40.460
 we open the word document the photo what 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.200
 we are going to insert here in this area it 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.140
 can also put here in the part of 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.430
 above remember that if we put it in the 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.800
 part of top you have to leave 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.550
 logically the corresponding space 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.460
 for the photo we are going to put in this one in 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.260
 this area we put the insertion point 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:03.120
 here by clicking with the mouse 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:06.320
 we click on insert image and here 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.320
 let's find 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.760
 the image that we are going to put in the 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.710
 that we are going to put in the curriculum 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.160
 we click on desktop that is where 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:23.900
 I have selected the image and click 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:27.920
 in inserting the picture you put on 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.910
 this part we click on adjust text 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.710
 and we chose the square option 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.479
 later we select the image 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.850
 we leave it more or less like this without being 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.190
 completely stuck to the part of 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.790
 above but only one 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.040
 fine line between the top table and the 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.850
 image and it is important that the image 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:53.090
 is aligned to the right margin of the 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:02:01.450
 page and then we reduce the 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:06.070
 size until the image is there 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.690
 we see how the line of the table should 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.550
 arrive 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:14.470
 at the end and there we would have the image 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.130
 put on the resume to reduce 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.590
 it would be necessary to simply click on the 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:25.230
 lower left corner of the image 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.230
 and adjust it to the size of the course
