00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.140
 for today again had another interesting application that I think that 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.069
 we should have all in our device 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.279
 the Sevillian as it happened with screen 

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:14.939
 and the function that this application has is to make a copy of 

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:18.630
 security was our man like him other 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.839
 co 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:21.439
 fountain ap Madrid 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.339
 in which the necessary enclosure and that did not commit this has a great advantage 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:30.519
 since apart from contacts local calendars that try not to 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:31.539
 sync up 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.910
 the one of the applications decide 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.920
 hopefully 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.350
 we feel the debates of life afterwards, needless to say, has as its only method 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.590
 of alves we have to have the phone in this case with the pnv and with what face 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.180
 well once we talk about life min we want now 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.770
 in this way to vote 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.720
 yvo de boer the name of the writing the goal is called country 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.100
 OK 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.070
 bad as you see I get enough because I already have enough repository but I have 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.890
 chosen the apple iphone 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.690
 more than anything because all the arrests do not what position are in 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:12.780
 Spanish 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.030
 i a man 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.270
 it was serious 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.850
 well once we should 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.800
 to me it puts me as always modify and because I do not have installed a famous 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.070
 everything with caracas 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.750
 and he knows it once we have it on our device 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.840
 we will win 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.280
 to the program but now it's pretty simple to look up and what this does 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.060
 framework agreement that gives security to a virtual server can be a server 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.730
 virtual there was so much in own vox iron door 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.950
 We want to recommend or what will consist of an account where you click when you 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.360
 applies removed leaves and 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.740
 from there because he paid but good 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.040
 dogi beat her enough 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.710
 i 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.580
 and I think it's a very good program in Ecuador I do not know if it knows but it lasted 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.330
 little what it does is 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.360
 everything you want to you 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.329
 a wine to the private cloud so that when 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:13.060
 I do not doubt that 14 you do not want 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.390
 get back soon after the device moment on the computer at any 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.300
 site the virtual cloud tandil and since last night there are few democrats we do not want 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.290
 codere in another computer 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.500
 everything we do today 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.450
 well then 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.939
 how we have achieved 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:31.439
 from there it goes and has four options 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.929
 the bar for percent 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:39.399
 take it the proceeds that we have done Bakartxo Tejería to lose along 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:42.579
 of your life securities to be able to vary with reason 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:48.599
 and estimated the eye with that and because that way we can erase something I'm not positive 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:54.319
 let's make an example 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.039
 b a backup as we see and we will give all kinds of low 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.500
 It's not worth saying on the menu what we want to do as a copy of 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:07.499
 security is worth what we see them for 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.529
 well in an easy example 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:13.799
 let's put it in touch 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.059
 ok and here in the tendon of the foot not to host Mexico's bank 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.159
 p 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.309
 I recommend as I said in the cathedral hoffman age would have to be 

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:27.409
 registered but good if you do not have 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:31.529
 the 105th Brigade Carlos Calvi in ​​which 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:36.719
 local server that has the same application to be able to us 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:38.269
 Oscar Najera added 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:40.639
 but I recommend you 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.110
 with which we are going to do it 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.110
 wherever I could not get on the crazy train 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:50.299
 As you will see, all contact is already happening, making the backup 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.100
 Iran has said that 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.740
 is over but one thing is that the agents in 

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:02.579
 andina barragán we are going to meet as low as the adjustment which if you 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:03.899
 we give 

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:04.980
 if we win 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.259
 Moratinos will put on this v 

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:11.689
 not to put that we put our group password so that the 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:14.669
 automatically when talking about the backup 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:18.160
 no does not ask for any connotation the napoles because of what he had done 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:20.720
 you before doing all that 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.340
 nevertheless cibaeñas of the backup so little to say 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.850
 that by having to put before colo colo 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.620
 and it took me to get 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.960
 well for her as she says I have a backup of all my 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.479
 contacts to check it 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.479
 let's go I'll see my contract 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:40.500
 lidia borda dunn 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.310
 phone 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.310
 according to the operator 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.219
 the term war 

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:49.550
 p 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.849
 we eliminate 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:54.279
 vl is no longer such 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:57.279
 the contact of the active mouth cairn 

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:05.309
 the love that in a lost all contact so it's over because we've 

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:06.849
 realized our 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:10.690
 device the amount requested the most recent version here 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.290
 well I know what at the time one is going to have if to me it is a backup 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.290
 but I say the good thing about this program is that 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:22.949
 the application is to say that it has changed but denied that it was and nothing 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:26.080
 it would simply be of all the business lines of the applications 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.080
 Needless to say, he has to be with the tiger and dragon again 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:31.139
 for now 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.159
 as I said already moral contact 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:37.219
 and now what I want to do in the contest when running 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.020
 state 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.789
 no contact let's tell everything where the degree of security will have little one goal 

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:52.780
 and already part of the comedy 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.780
 his image we have lost by all contact for whatever 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:00.289
 for me it loses positive detail 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:03.819
 is going to pay the phone do not worry because exporting either 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:08.629
 OK 

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:11.900
 or if everything goes well we should have 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.110
 again the contact that we have deleted 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.110
 to see a little bit 

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:21.129
 moral lawyer criteria 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:24.939
 lemos 

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:26.240
 and we'll see 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.419
 the fashion the script 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:32.290
 I'd like vice as a lawyer had I share it and if it comes to homes 

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:37.400
 read 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.699
 not like that I would not do it with everything I share and I insist on how good it is 

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:43.889
 this bull 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:45.939
 already in october 

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:51.210
 The good thing about this program is that they can make a copy of their life 

00:06:51.209 --> 00:06:54.899
 application the decision of 900 the rich notes 

00:06:56.509 --> 00:06:57.990
 brito 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.199
 or nothing was simply I just wanted to comment because I think some 

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:01.879
 application 

00:07:01.879 --> 00:07:04.190
 very very good and interesting 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.960
 positive reads 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.490
 I remind you that 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:15.020
 he adds that I have several videos about everything in the period, and I would like to 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.199
 ask to go 

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:20.400
 has a lot to say that by the way since we have subscribed it has also been 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.669
 a miracle of facts I think the criteria for 

00:07:24.349 --> 00:07:25.949
 for these people 

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:28.949
 and scrubbers there's simply no solution and 

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:32.619
 yes thereafter thank you
