all the way across until the end of the
row<00:03:24.280> row<00:03:25.280> four<00:03:25.549> we're<00:03:26.000> going<00:03:26.120> to<00:03:26.180> begin<00:03:26.269> by

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:26.629 
row row four we're going to begin by

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:35.710 
row row four we're going to begin by
purling<00:03:27.230> two<00:03:34.389> next<00:03:35.389> we're<00:03:35.480> going<00:03:35.569> to<00:03:35.629> start

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
purling two next we're going to start

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.869 
purling two next we're going to start
our<00:03:36.019> repeat<00:03:36.500> by<00:03:36.680> slipping<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.370> next<00:03:37.700> two

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:37.879 
our repeat by slipping the next two

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:40.720 
our repeat by slipping the next two
stitches<00:03:38.120> to<00:03:38.540> a<00:03:38.569> cable<00:03:38.900> needle<00:03:39.370> so<00:03:40.370> we'll<00:03:40.549> grab

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
stitches to a cable needle so we'll grab

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:47.870 
stitches to a cable needle so we'll grab
our<00:03:40.940> cable<00:03:41.720> needle<00:03:41.959> here

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.030 

so<00:03:48.750> this<00:03:48.870> is<00:03:49.050> a<00:03:49.080> knit<00:03:49.380> stitch<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:49.770> a<00:03:49.800> purl
