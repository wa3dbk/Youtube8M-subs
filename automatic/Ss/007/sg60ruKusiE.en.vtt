00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
the SodaStream I can just make this

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.810 
the SodaStream I can just make this
really<00:01:30.509> quickly<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.170> go<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:32.159> retail

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
really quickly on the go in so retail

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.280 
really quickly on the go in so retail
tail<00:01:33.060> lights<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.360> these<00:01:33.479> go<00:01:33.630> for<00:01:33.659> about<00:01:33.869> a

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
tail lights and these go for about a

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.990 
tail lights and these go for about a
hundred<00:01:34.920> dollars<00:01:35.430> or<00:01:35.640> something<00:01:35.850> like<00:01:35.939> that

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
hundred dollars or something like that

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.670 
hundred dollars or something like that
I'm<00:01:36.720> sure<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.170> find<00:01:37.200> them<00:01:37.470> at<00:01:37.500> different

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
I'm sure you can find them at different

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.160 
I'm sure you can find them at different
places<00:01:37.890> but<00:01:38.400> um<00:01:38.640> I'm<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.659> think<00:01:39.930> they're<00:01:40.049> about

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
places but um I'm I think they're about

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.200 
places but um I'm I think they're about
a<00:01:40.229> hundred<00:01:40.409> dollars<00:01:40.829> but<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.549> in<00:01:41.820> my<00:01:41.970> opinion

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
a hundred dollars but I in my opinion

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.210 
a hundred dollars but I in my opinion
it's<00:01:42.420> definitely<00:01:42.899> worth<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.259> because<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:44.070> can

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
it's definitely worth it because you can

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.830 
it's definitely worth it because you can
make<00:01:44.399> your<00:01:44.520> own<00:01:44.579> soda<00:01:44.909> at<00:01:45.119> home<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.450> saves<00:01:45.689> you

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
going to show you a little bit of how it

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.150 
going to show you a little bit of how it
works<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:23.760> let's<00:02:24.420> get<00:02:24.600> into<00:02:24.930> that<00:02:25.050> okay<00:02:25.800> so

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
works and let's get into that okay so

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.710 
works and let's get into that okay so
this<00:02:26.430> is<00:02:26.580> basically<00:02:26.730> what<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.240> SodaStream

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
this is basically what the SodaStream

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.570 
this is basically what the SodaStream
looks<00:02:27.930> like<00:02:28.110> it's<00:02:28.530> really<00:02:28.740> compact<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.460> I'll

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
looks like it's really compact and I'll

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.070 
looks like it's really compact and I'll
basically<00:02:29.760> just<00:02:30.180> fit<00:02:30.360> right<00:02:30.390> in<00:02:30.660> your<00:02:30.750> counter

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
basically just fit right in your counter

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.540 
basically just fit right in your counter
if<00:02:31.170> it's<00:02:31.320> right<00:02:31.470> on<00:02:31.500> my<00:02:31.590> counter<00:02:31.980> perfectly

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
if it's right on my counter perfectly

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.160 
if it's right on my counter perfectly
but<00:02:33.000> I'm<00:02:33.150> stopping<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.540> my<00:02:33.630> room<00:02:33.840> right<00:02:33.930> now<00:02:34.020> so

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
but I'm stopping to my room right now so

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.260 
but I'm stopping to my room right now so
I<00:02:34.200> can<00:02:34.350> assure<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:34.530> guys<00:02:34.740> um<00:02:35.010> basically<00:02:35.790> it's

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
I can assure you guys um basically it's

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.330 
I can assure you guys um basically it's
really<00:02:36.810> small<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.440> know<00:02:37.560> it<00:02:37.680> fits<00:02:37.890> basically

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
really small you know it fits basically

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.130 
really small you know it fits basically
anywhere<00:02:38.640> in<00:02:38.790> comparison<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.570> flip-flop

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
anywhere in comparison to a flip-flop

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.750 
anywhere in comparison to a flip-flop
this<00:02:40.380> one's<00:02:40.560> broken<00:02:40.920> but<00:02:41.280> I<00:02:41.310> had<00:02:41.550> it<00:02:41.670> right

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
this one's broken but I had it right

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.120 
this one's broken but I had it right
here<00:02:42.000> it's<00:02:42.630> like<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:43.140> size<00:02:43.470> is<00:02:43.680> about<00:02:43.770> a<00:02:43.890> size

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
here it's like that size is about a size

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.160 
here it's like that size is about a size
nine<00:02:44.400> flip<00:02:44.760> flops<00:02:44.970> that's<00:02:45.180> what<00:02:45.330> I<00:02:45.360> am<00:02:45.570> but

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
nine flip flops that's what I am but

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.590 
nine flip flops that's what I am but
that's<00:02:46.320> trigger<00:02:46.770> a<00:02:46.800> little<00:02:46.950> comparison<00:02:47.820> but

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
that's trigger a little comparison but

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.270 
that's trigger a little comparison but
let<00:02:48.840> me<00:02:48.870> show<00:02:49.080> you<00:02:49.110> guys<00:02:49.260> I'm<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:49.950> brains

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
let me show you guys I'm the brains

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.610 
let me show you guys I'm the brains
behind<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:50.910> whole<00:02:50.940> machine<00:02:51.210> basically<00:02:52.110> what

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
behind the whole machine basically what

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.890 
behind the whole machine basically what
it<00:02:52.650> is<00:02:52.770> if<00:02:53.070> you<00:02:53.190> turn<00:02:53.430> this<00:02:53.580> around<00:02:53.790> on<00:02:54.420> the

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
it is if you turn this around on the

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.900 
it is if you turn this around on the
side<00:02:55.110> there<00:02:55.350> are<00:02:55.380> two<00:02:55.590> little<00:02:55.770> things<00:02:56.520> that

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
side there are two little things that

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.610 
side there are two little things that
you<00:02:57.000> press<00:02:57.450> on<00:02:57.600> to<00:02:57.750> like<00:02:57.900> this<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.470> whole

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
you press on to like this and the whole

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.750 
you press on to like this and the whole
back<00:02:59.010> we'll<00:02:59.460> remove<00:03:00.290> very<00:03:01.290> simple<00:03:01.800> and<00:03:02.070> so<00:03:02.580> at

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
back we'll remove very simple and so at

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.300 
back we'll remove very simple and so at
the<00:03:02.940> back<00:03:03.150> of<00:03:03.330> it<00:03:03.450> is<00:03:03.750> this<00:03:03.990> carbon<00:03:04.500> dioxide

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
the back of it is this carbon dioxide

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.450 
the back of it is this carbon dioxide
tube<00:03:05.900> and<00:03:06.900> um<00:03:07.200> you<00:03:07.680> put<00:03:07.860> this<00:03:07.950> in<00:03:08.130> and<00:03:08.220> this<00:03:08.340> is

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
tube and um you put this in and this is

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.030 
tube and um you put this in and this is
basically<00:03:08.670> what<00:03:09.180> this<00:03:09.540> is<00:03:09.600> what<00:03:10.200> your<00:03:10.470> drinks

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
basically what this is what your drinks

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.060 
basically what this is what your drinks
become<00:03:11.430> fizzy<00:03:11.910> from<00:03:12.240> it<00:03:13.050> just<00:03:13.230> sends<00:03:13.470> some

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
become fizzy from it just sends some

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.370 
become fizzy from it just sends some
carbon<00:03:14.490> dioxide<00:03:14.940> into<00:03:15.210> your<00:03:15.330> water<00:03:15.600> so<00:03:16.200> then

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
carbon dioxide into your water so then

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.160 
carbon dioxide into your water so then
it's<00:03:16.590> really<00:03:16.860> simple<00:03:17.070> to<00:03:17.220> just<00:03:17.310> be<00:03:17.670> able<00:03:17.730> to

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
it's really simple to just be able to

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.740 
it's really simple to just be able to
clip<00:03:19.170> that<00:03:19.380> back<00:03:19.710> right<00:03:20.250> on<00:03:20.460> nice<00:03:21.270> and<00:03:21.330> in

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
clip that back right on nice and in

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.690 
clip that back right on nice and in
place<00:03:22.670> so<00:03:23.780> they<00:03:24.780> also<00:03:25.020> give<00:03:25.380> you<00:03:25.620> on<00:03:25.860> this

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
place so they also give you on this

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.790 
place so they also give you on this
bottle<00:03:27.180> right<00:03:27.210> here<00:03:27.390> and<00:03:28.080> this<00:03:28.230> is<00:03:28.290> it's

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
bottle right here and this is it's

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.130 
bottle right here and this is it's

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.530 
i'm going to show you guys how to work
the<00:03:46.530> machine<00:03:46.650> so<00:03:47.580> what<00:03:47.910> you<00:03:48.060> do<00:03:48.240> is<00:03:48.270> you<00:03:48.510> take

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
the machine so what you do is you take

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.720 
the machine so what you do is you take
your<00:03:48.810> water<00:03:49.350> right<00:03:49.830> here<00:03:50.070> you<00:03:50.280> take<00:03:50.430> cold

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
your water right here you take cold

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.920 
your water right here you take cold
water<00:03:50.970> because<00:03:51.270> this<00:03:51.360> is<00:03:51.450> actually<00:03:51.570> going<00:03:51.870> to

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
water because this is actually going to

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.960 
water because this is actually going to
be<00:03:51.990> what<00:03:52.320> your<00:03:52.470> water<00:03:52.740> is<00:03:53.010> so<00:03:53.640> if<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:53.790> want

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
be what your water is so if you want

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.490 
be what your water is so if you want
warm<00:03:54.270> water<00:03:54.540> you<00:03:54.750> fill<00:03:54.930> it<00:03:55.020> with<00:03:55.110> warm<00:03:55.380> water

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
warm water you fill it with warm water

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.230 
warm water you fill it with warm water
but<00:03:55.980> i'm<00:03:56.130> guessing<00:03:56.340> most<00:03:56.670> people<00:03:56.880> would<00:03:57.030> want

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.180 
but i'm guessing most people would want
cold<00:03:57.570> water<00:03:57.810> and<00:03:58.080> there's<00:03:58.650> a<00:03:58.710> little<00:03:58.860> water

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
cold water and there's a little water

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.560 
cold water and there's a little water
line<00:03:59.550> if<00:03:59.730> you<00:03:59.790> can<00:03:59.910> see<00:04:00.060> right<00:04:00.090> there<00:04:00.390> it<00:04:00.450> has<00:04:00.540> a

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
little bit of it has a faucet and then

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.380 
little bit of it has a faucet and then

twist it on until it's nice and in place

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.350 
twist it on until it's nice and in place
which<00:04:35.130> is<00:04:35.160> actually<00:04:35.520> really<00:04:35.880> simple<00:04:36.090> when<00:04:36.330> you

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
which is actually really simple when you

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.760 
which is actually really simple when you
have<00:04:36.540> two<00:04:36.750> hands<00:04:36.960> and<00:04:37.080> you're<00:04:37.230> not<00:04:37.350> trying<00:04:37.620> to

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
have two hands and you're not trying to

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.040 
have two hands and you're not trying to
film<00:04:37.980> but<00:04:38.550> it's<00:04:38.790> a<00:04:39.180> little<00:04:39.360> bit<00:04:39.450> wobbling<00:04:39.840> sits

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
film but it's a little bit wobbling sits

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.600 
film but it's a little bit wobbling sits
standing<00:04:40.320> on<00:04:40.410> my<00:04:40.440> Backstreet<00:04:40.920> Boys<00:04:41.130> books<00:04:41.370> but

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
standing on my Backstreet Boys books but

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.730 
standing on my Backstreet Boys books but
that's<00:04:41.760> another<00:04:41.940> story<00:04:42.090> so<00:04:43.050> now<00:04:43.320> it's<00:04:43.620> a

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
that's another story so now it's a

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.320 
that's another story so now it's a
really<00:04:43.950> really<00:04:44.160> really<00:04:44.370> simple<00:04:44.730> part<00:04:45.060> is<00:04:45.210> is

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
really really really simple part is is

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.700 
really really really simple part is is
right<00:04:45.510> up<00:04:45.690> at<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:45.870> top<00:04:45.960> there's<00:04:46.350> a<00:04:46.410> button

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
right up at the top there's a button

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.830 
right up at the top there's a button
right<00:04:47.100> here<00:04:47.130> and<00:04:47.550> I<00:04:48.120> couldn't<00:04:48.390> get<00:04:48.570> this<00:04:48.720> at

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
right here and I couldn't get this at

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.360 
right here and I couldn't get this at
first<00:04:49.050> it<00:04:49.320> was<00:04:49.410> a<00:04:49.440> little<00:04:49.500> bit<00:04:49.800> troubling

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
first it was a little bit troubling

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.890 
first it was a little bit troubling
because<00:04:50.520> I<00:04:50.670> wasn't<00:04:51.000> I<00:04:51.240> didn't<00:04:51.630> know<00:04:51.660> you<00:04:51.750> had

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
because I wasn't I didn't know you had

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.630

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
to press down so hard but what you do is

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.190 
to press down so hard but what you do is
you<00:04:53.760> press<00:04:53.940> down<00:04:54.000> hardly<00:04:54.720> for<00:04:54.870> about<00:04:55.050> two

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
you press down hardly for about two

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.680 
you press down hardly for about two
seconds<00:04:55.650> each<00:04:55.830> time<00:04:56.190> and<00:04:56.520> it's<00:04:57.210> gonna<00:04:57.390> send

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
seconds each time and it's gonna send

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.660 
seconds each time and it's gonna send
carbon<00:04:58.020> dioxide<00:04:58.500> into<00:04:58.890> your<00:04:59.070> water<00:04:59.280> so<00:04:59.520> let's

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
carbon dioxide into your water so let's

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.850 
carbon dioxide into your water so let's
just<00:04:59.850> do<00:05:00.000> that<00:05:00.120> and<00:05:00.390> you<00:05:00.960> until<00:05:01.440> it<00:05:01.590> makes<00:05:01.680> the
