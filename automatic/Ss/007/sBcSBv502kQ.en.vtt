00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
we got electrolyzer we've got a heater

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.360 
we got electrolyzer we've got a heater
the<00:00:55.020> co<00:00:55.199> comes<00:00:55.469> off<00:00:55.590> heat<00:00:55.860> comes<00:00:56.070> off<00:00:56.219> the

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.030 
about same miles per gallon unless you
recycle<00:02:38.390> water<00:02:38.600> mostly<00:02:39.530> what<00:02:39.650> comes<00:02:39.830> out<00:02:39.980> of

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
recycle water mostly what comes out of

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.530 
recycle water mostly what comes out of
the<00:02:40.100> tailpipe<00:02:40.490> is<00:02:40.640> team<00:02:40.880> so<00:02:41.180> I<00:02:41.240> could<00:02:41.450> be

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
the tailpipe is team so I could be

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.780 
the tailpipe is team so I could be
recycled<00:02:41.890> to<00:02:42.890> recycle<00:02:43.370> it<00:02:43.460> you<00:02:43.520> can<00:02:43.610> get<00:02:43.670> about

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
recycled to recycle it you can get about

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.910 
recycled to recycle it you can get about
250<00:02:44.780> miles<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:46.910> gallon<00:02:47.060> of<00:02:47.660> water<00:02:48.580> and

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
250 miles to the gallon of water and

00:02:50.920 --> 00:03:14.750 
250 miles to the gallon of water and
hopefully<00:02:51.920> everything's<00:02:52.520> set<00:02:53.150> up<00:02:53.180> right

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.899 

so<00:03:15.690> he's<00:03:15.870> gotta<00:03:16.140> fly<00:03:16.349> another<00:03:16.650> seconds

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:20.909 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:28.220 

take<00:03:21.909> care<00:03:22.150> breather<00:03:22.420> offered<00:03:22.870> like<00:03:23.049> this

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:39.960 

to<00:03:28.530> go

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.920 

like<00:03:40.600> there<00:03:40.900> you<00:03:41.080> don't

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
like there you don't

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.479 
like there you don't
you<00:03:43.079> don't<00:03:43.260> see<00:03:43.500> it<00:03:43.530> but<00:03:43.799> you<00:03:43.859> definitely<00:03:44.129> feel

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
you don't see it but you definitely feel

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:56.300 
you don't see it but you definitely feel
it<00:03:44.519> it's

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:13.100 

via<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.690> water<00:03:58.140> dollars

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.850 

water<00:04:13.710> is<00:04:13.950> hydrogen<00:04:14.460> and<00:04:14.580> oxygen<00:04:15.090> and

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
water is hydrogen and oxygen and

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.820 
water is hydrogen and oxygen and
basically<00:04:18.110> hydrogen<00:04:19.110> it's<00:04:19.320> very<00:04:19.530> combustible

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
basically hydrogen it's very combustible

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:41.720 
basically hydrogen it's very combustible
and<00:04:20.250> I<00:04:20.370> can<00:04:20.730> make<00:04:20.910> device

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.070 

the<00:04:42.180> power<00:04:42.420> water<00:04:42.690> in<00:04:43.590> Kerala
