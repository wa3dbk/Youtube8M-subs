00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.929
 about 

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:10.670

 beams that are on the trailer of the 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.390
 truck low 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.320
 a bizarre accident involving a miracle 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.720
 above miracle 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.679
 only three slightly injured traffic jams and that 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.480
 was caused by a 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:22.850
 truck driver who stood the 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.380
 maneuver on the just adjusted 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.910
 Railroad crossing 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.830

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.689

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.970
 he couldn't get the truck fast anymore 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.190
 get enough off the track and has 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.620
 chosen to get out of the truck 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.649
 jump and yes ultimately it is 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.130
 havoc by us on the train at the 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:45.050
 ticking question where the manga come from 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.660
 about 200 people were on the train 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.129
 who was on his way from Weert to Eindhoven 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.050
 three people had to go after the accident 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.640
 treated for grazes and wounds 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.129
 light cuts 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.820

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.739
 to get a very big shock I was 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.840

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.670
 the big shock big game full I challenge it 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.389
 end of the world 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.310
 such a terrible noise it is all 

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:19.249

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.599

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:30.469
 feel or something 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.619
 well once it was quiet one was 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:36.919
 quite a shock and then the train stopped 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.389
 so just at the road where I sat and 

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:40.609
 I saw a driver there by now 

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:42.020
 already walking that was unharmed to you 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:45.349

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:53.179
