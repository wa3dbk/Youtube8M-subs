hey guys this is mr. herb steer and this

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.309 
hey guys this is mr. herb steer and this
is<00:00:02.340> transcription<00:00:03.090> and<00:00:03.270> translation<00:00:03.600> in

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
is transcription and translation in

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.470 
is transcription and translation in
plain<00:00:04.680> English<00:00:05.549> now<00:00:06.029> one<00:00:06.210> of<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.390> most

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
plain English now one of the most

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.030 
plain English now one of the most
important<00:00:06.960> things<00:00:07.140> that<00:00:07.230> we<00:00:07.440> need<00:00:07.470> to<00:00:07.859> make

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
important things that we need to make

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.100 
important things that we need to make
sure<00:00:08.069> that<00:00:08.370> we<00:00:08.490> know<00:00:08.700> is<00:00:08.940> what<00:00:09.450> is<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.630> purpose

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
sure that we know is what is the purpose

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.440 
sure that we know is what is the purpose
of<00:00:10.230> DNA<00:00:10.769> well<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.250> purpose<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:11.670> DNA<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.210> to

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
of DNA well the purpose of DNA is to

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.129 
of DNA well the purpose of DNA is to
make<00:00:13.019> proteins<00:00:13.980> now<00:00:14.790> our<00:00:15.000> story<00:00:15.299> begins<00:00:15.750> right

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
make proteins now our story begins right

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.680 
make proteins now our story begins right
here<00:00:16.170> with<00:00:16.619> silly<00:00:16.920> susan<00:00:17.670> this<00:00:17.850> cell<00:00:18.119> look<00:00:18.539> how

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
here with silly susan this cell look how

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.269 
here with silly susan this cell look how
happy<00:00:18.990> she<00:00:19.170> is<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:19.680> know<00:00:19.710> what<00:00:19.949> she's<00:00:20.160> so

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
happy she is you know what she's so

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.460 
happy she is you know what she's so
happy<00:00:20.490> because<00:00:21.240> today<00:00:21.300> she<00:00:21.840> gets<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.170> make<00:00:22.439> a

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
happy because today she gets to make a

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.220 
happy because today she gets to make a
protein<00:00:23.039> so<00:00:23.460> she's<00:00:23.640> going<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.850> use<00:00:24.060> her<00:00:24.090> DNA<00:00:24.779> to

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
protein so she's going to use her DNA to

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.950 
protein so she's going to use her DNA to
make<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.410> protein<00:00:25.920> but<00:00:26.099> whoa<00:00:26.279> watch<00:00:27.029> out<00:00:27.359> she

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
make a protein but whoa watch out she

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.750 
make a protein but whoa watch out she
doesn't<00:00:28.349> actually<00:00:28.470> know<00:00:28.710> how<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:28.949> do<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.369> so

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
doesn't actually know how to do that so

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.769 
doesn't actually know how to do that so
let's<00:00:29.880> see<00:00:30.060> if<00:00:30.119> we<00:00:30.150> can<00:00:30.330> help<00:00:30.480> her<00:00:30.630> out<00:00:30.720> a

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
let's see if we can help her out a

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.479 
let's see if we can help her out a
little<00:00:31.019> bit<00:00:31.230> well<00:00:31.470> silly<00:00:31.890> susan<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.369> know

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
little bit well silly susan you know

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.250 
little bit well silly susan you know
it's<00:00:32.640> really<00:00:32.790> not<00:00:32.969> all<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.300> complicated<00:00:33.600> it

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
it's really not all that complicated it

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.470 
it's really not all that complicated it
begins<00:00:35.130> right<00:00:35.309> here<00:00:35.520> with<00:00:35.640> process<00:00:36.149> one

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
begins right here with process one

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.600 
begins right here with process one
called<00:00:36.989> transcription<00:00:37.649> where<00:00:38.370> we're<00:00:38.489> going

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
called transcription where we're going

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.600 
called transcription where we're going
to<00:00:38.670> make<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.969> copy<00:00:39.480> of<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.899> section<00:00:40.379> of<00:00:40.530> DNA<00:00:40.610> so

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
to make a copy of a section of DNA so

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.630 
to make a copy of a section of DNA so
here<00:00:41.850> we<00:00:42.000> have<00:00:42.239> silly<00:00:42.840> Susan's<00:00:43.350> DNA<00:00:43.920> she's

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
here we have silly Susan's DNA she's

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.400 
here we have silly Susan's DNA she's
going<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.879> happen<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.210> open<00:00:45.390> up<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.930> DNA<00:00:46.379> a

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
going to happen to open up that DNA a

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.990 
going to happen to open up that DNA a
little<00:00:46.710> bit<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.070> we<00:00:47.219> can<00:00:47.250> copy<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.850> little

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
little bit so we can copy a little

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.630 
little bit so we can copy a little
section<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:48.660> which<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:49.430> highlighted<00:00:50.430> in

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
section of it which I highlighted in

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.270 
section of it which I highlighted in
purple<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:52.140> ultimately<00:00:52.440> her<00:00:52.890> DNA<00:00:53.219> is

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
purple and so ultimately her DNA is

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.590 
purple and so ultimately her DNA is
going<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.520> close<00:00:53.730> up<00:00:53.940> again<00:00:54.090> we're<00:00:54.420> going<00:00:54.539> to

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
going to close up again we're going to

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.630 
going to close up again we're going to
be<00:00:54.690> left<00:00:54.899> with<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.110> copy<00:00:55.440> although<00:00:56.280> we<00:00:56.489> no

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
be left with this copy although we no

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.970 
be left with this copy although we no
longer<00:00:56.670> call<00:00:57.300> this<00:00:57.480> copy<00:00:57.780> DNA<00:00:58.170> we<00:00:58.620> actually

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
longer call this copy DNA we actually

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.099 
longer call this copy DNA we actually
call<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.219> RNA<00:00:59.789> one<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> most<00:01:00.570> important

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
call it RNA one of the most important

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.619 
call it RNA one of the most important
things<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.500> know<00:01:01.680> Allah<00:01:02.129> by<00:01:02.430> algae<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.120> can

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
things to know Allah by algae you can

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.780 
things to know Allah by algae you can
sort<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.110> think<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.530> Krantz<00:01:05.010> transcription

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
sort of think of Krantz transcription

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.179 
sort of think of Krantz transcription
like<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.270> where<00:01:06.840> we<00:01:06.930> have<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.170> paper<00:01:07.650> really

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
like this where we have a paper really

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.710 
like this where we have a paper really
important<00:01:08.520> paper<00:01:08.729> with<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.970> lot<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.270> important

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
important paper with a lot of important

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.170 
important paper with a lot of important
words<00:01:09.900> e<00:01:10.170> equals<00:01:10.740> mc-squared<00:01:11.549> pretty

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
words e equals mc-squared pretty

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.870 
words e equals mc-squared pretty
important<00:01:12.720> run<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.560> through<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:14.159> copier<00:01:14.640> and

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
important run that through a copier and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.390 
important run that through a copier and
boom<00:01:15.630> whoa<00:01:15.990> we're<00:01:16.500> left<00:01:16.650> with<00:01:16.830> two<00:01:17.100> copies

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
boom whoa we're left with two copies

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.480 
boom whoa we're left with two copies
only<00:01:18.030> one<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.720> little<00:01:19.259> bit<00:01:19.860> different<00:01:20.369> than

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
only one is a little bit different than

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.880 
only one is a little bit different than
the<00:01:20.640> original<00:01:21.229> the<00:01:22.229> next<00:01:22.500> thing<00:01:22.650> we're<00:01:22.799> going

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
the original the next thing we're going

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.510 
the original the next thing we're going
to<00:01:22.979> have<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.250> do<00:01:23.400> silly<00:01:23.700> susan<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.330> right<00:01:25.170> here

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
to have to do silly susan is right here

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.100 
to have to do silly susan is right here
translation<00:01:26.520> we're<00:01:26.939> going<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.119> turn<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.420> RNA

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
translation we're going to turn that RNA

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.219 
translation we're going to turn that RNA
copy<00:01:28.439> into<00:01:28.890> an<00:01:29.159> amino<00:01:29.460> acid<00:01:29.610> chain<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.900> here<00:01:31.079> we

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
copy into an amino acid chain so here we

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.060 
copy into an amino acid chain so here we
go<00:01:31.439> with<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.909> silly<00:01:32.909> Susan's<00:01:33.479> RNA<00:01:34.140> we're<00:01:34.740> going

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
go with a silly Susan's RNA we're going

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.530 
go with a silly Susan's RNA we're going
to<00:01:35.159> bind<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.880> this<00:01:35.970> thing<00:01:36.210> called<00:01:36.240> a

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
to bind that to this thing called a

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.240 
to bind that to this thing called a
ribosome<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:37.259> red<00:01:37.470> where<00:01:37.950> it's<00:01:38.100> actually

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
ribosome in red where it's actually

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.460 
ribosome in red where it's actually
going<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.670> read<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.210> like<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.420> book<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.380> you

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
going to read it like a book and you

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.870 
going to read it like a book and you
know<00:01:40.590> what<00:01:40.770> else<00:01:40.920> it's<00:01:41.130> going<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.340> do<00:01:41.520> more

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
know what else it's going to do more

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.510 
know what else it's going to do more
importantly<00:01:42.509> it's<00:01:43.320> going<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.710> use<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.250> words

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
importantly it's going to use the words

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.569 
importantly it's going to use the words
or<00:01:45.000> use<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.659> code<00:01:45.930> that's<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.740> RNA<00:01:47.250> and

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
or use the code that's in that RNA and

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.210 
or use the code that's in that RNA and
create<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.420> little<00:01:48.869> growing<00:01:49.229> amino<00:01:49.799> acid

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
create this little growing amino acid

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.859 
create this little growing amino acid
chain<00:01:50.490> right<00:01:50.700> here<00:01:50.759> otherwise<00:01:51.360> known<00:01:51.659> as<00:01:51.689> a

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
chain right here otherwise known as a

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.319 
chain right here otherwise known as a
protein<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.649> can<00:01:53.399> sort<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.700> think<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.119> like

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
protein you can sort of think of it like

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.800 
protein you can sort of think of it like
this<00:01:55.009> where<00:01:56.009> we<00:01:56.159> have<00:01:56.189> bread<00:01:56.820> with<00:01:57.360> this<00:01:57.600> would

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
this where we have bread with this would

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.649 
this where we have bread with this would
be<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.469> RNA<00:01:59.070> where<00:01:59.670> we're<00:01:59.880> going<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.360> run<00:02:00.540> it

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
be the RNA where we're going to run it

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.600 
be the RNA where we're going to run it
through<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.840> toaster<00:02:01.530> it's<00:02:01.829> going<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.399> is

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
through a toaster it's going to this is

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.490 
through a toaster it's going to this is
the<00:02:02.729> this<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.360> ribosome<00:02:03.899> right<00:02:04.110> here<00:02:04.320> at

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
the this is the ribosome right here at

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.859 
the this is the ribosome right here at
the<00:02:04.680> wall<00:02:05.009> we're<00:02:05.579> left<00:02:05.790> with<00:02:06.060> toast<00:02:06.390> once<00:02:06.719> it's

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
the wall we're left with toast once it's

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.300 
the wall we're left with toast once it's
a<00:02:06.960> little<00:02:07.229> bit<00:02:07.350> different<00:02:07.920> than<00:02:08.039> our<00:02:08.069> original

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
a little bit different than our original

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.850 
a little bit different than our original
thing<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:09.929> would<00:02:10.110> be<00:02:10.289> our<00:02:10.319> amino

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
thing and so this would be our amino

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.640 
thing and so this would be our amino
acid<00:02:11.340> chain<00:02:11.640> which<00:02:12.239> is<00:02:12.450> which<00:02:12.780> is<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:12.959> little

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
acid chain which is which is a little

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.440 
acid chain which is which is a little
a different<00:02:14.250> thing<00:02:14.519> that<00:02:14.760> what<00:02:14.909> we<00:02:15.060> began

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
a different thing that what we began

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.869 
a different thing that what we began
with<00:02:15.689> so<00:02:16.560> ultimately<00:02:16.890> let's<00:02:17.340> go<00:02:17.519> ahead<00:02:17.640> and

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
with so ultimately let's go ahead and

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.990 
with so ultimately let's go ahead and
sum<00:02:18.150> up<00:02:18.360> what<00:02:18.540> happens<00:02:18.959> we<00:02:19.560> have<00:02:19.829> DNA<00:02:20.370> which<00:02:20.849> is

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
sum up what happens we have DNA which is

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.390 
sum up what happens we have DNA which is
going<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.209> be<00:02:21.360> transcribed<00:02:22.319> into<00:02:23.040> this<00:02:23.189> thing

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
going to be transcribed into this thing

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.429 
going to be transcribed into this thing
called<00:02:23.640> RNA<00:02:24.209> which<00:02:24.989> is<00:02:25.019> going<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.349> be

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:25.439 
called RNA which is going to be

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.649 
called RNA which is going to be
translated<00:02:26.069> into<00:02:26.670> this<00:02:27.000> thing<00:02:27.269> called<00:02:27.569> a

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
translated into this thing called a

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.140 
translated into this thing called a
protein<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.439> that<00:02:28.470> protein<00:02:28.829> can<00:02:29.579> serve<00:02:29.849> many

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
protein and that protein can serve many

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.920 
protein and that protein can serve many
function<00:02:30.659> in<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.900> cell<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:32.420> here<00:02:33.420> is<00:02:33.599> silly

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
function in the cell so here is silly

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.050 
function in the cell so here is silly
susan<00:02:34.500> she's<00:02:34.769> really<00:02:35.220> happy<00:02:35.459> because<00:02:35.909> you

know what she did today
she<00:02:37.349> created<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:37.859> protein<00:02:38.340> let's<00:02:38.609> go<00:02:38.790> ahead<00:02:38.909> and

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
she created a protein let's go ahead and

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.610 
she created a protein let's go ahead and
give<00:02:39.269> her<00:02:39.390> a<00:02:39.450> round<00:02:39.659> of<00:02:39.870> applause
