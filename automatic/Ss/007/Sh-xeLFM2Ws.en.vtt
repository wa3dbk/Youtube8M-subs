still works for today I think they did a
good<00:02:16.440> job<00:02:16.500> with<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:16.830> so<00:02:17.220> anyway<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.510> two

here let you see the difference between
the<00:03:15.150> two<00:03:15.329> there's<00:03:16.049> really<00:03:16.230> not<00:03:16.500> in<00:03:16.680> terms<00:03:16.859> of

the two there's really not in terms of

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.440 
the two there's really not in terms of
the<00:03:17.159> performance<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.879> the<00:03:17.969> two<00:03:18.120> different

the performance of the two different

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.409 
the performance of the two different
papers<00:03:19.349> there's<00:03:19.680> really<00:03:19.829> no<00:03:20.069> difference<00:03:20.419> in

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419 
papers there's really no difference in

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.949 
papers there's really no difference in

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
terms of what the end result is there's

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.050 
terms of what the end result is there's
no<00:03:25.139> feathering<00:03:25.590> no<00:03:26.159> bleed<00:03:26.489> through<00:03:26.669> of<00:03:26.909> any

the<00:03:30.659> pens

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
the pens

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.459 
the pens
the<00:03:32.069> the<00:03:32.430> calligraphy<00:03:33.150> pen<00:03:33.389> the<00:03:33.569> scripts<00:03:33.930> is<00:03:34.169> a

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:34.469 
the the calligraphy pen the scripts is a

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:36.679 
the the calligraphy pen the scripts is a
little<00:03:34.769> bit<00:03:34.919> of<00:03:35.010> a<00:03:35.099> wet<00:03:35.280> writer<00:03:35.549> so<00:03:36.540> it's

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:36.689 
little bit of a wet writer so it's

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:37.909 
little bit of a wet writer so it's
putting<00:03:36.840> a<00:03:36.959> little<00:03:37.109> more<00:03:37.349> ink<00:03:37.560> down<00:03:37.709> on<00:03:37.859> the

putting a little more ink down on the

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:41.360 
putting a little more ink down on the
page<00:03:39.560> probably<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.650> only<00:03:40.859> difference<00:03:41.310> that

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
page probably the only difference that

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.619 
page probably the only difference that
you<00:03:41.579> would<00:03:41.699> see<00:03:41.849> in<00:03:42.000> terms<00:03:42.150> of<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.389> actual

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
you would see in terms of the actual

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:44.000 
you would see in terms of the actual
performance<00:03:43.139> of<00:03:43.199> the<00:03:43.290> paper<00:03:43.500> this<00:03:43.769> is<00:03:43.889> the

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
performance of the paper this is the

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.619 
performance of the paper this is the

there's<00:03:46.379> very<00:03:46.620> little<00:03:46.919> echo<00:03:47.340> or<00:03:47.519> ghosting<00:03:48.030> or

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
there's very little echo or ghosting or

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.569 
there's very little echo or ghosting or
show<00:03:49.049> through<00:03:49.379> as<00:03:49.530> it's<00:03:49.680> sometimes<00:03:49.859> called<00:03:50.189> in

show through as it's sometimes called in
the<00:03:50.639> back<00:03:50.879> and<00:03:51.389> then<00:03:51.629> on<00:03:51.719> the<00:03:51.840> Rodya<00:03:52.169> there's<00:03:53.129> a

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:53.189 
the back and then on the Rodya there's a

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:55.819 
the back and then on the Rodya there's a
little<00:03:53.730> bit<00:03:53.879> more<00:03:54.120> but<00:03:54.930> probably<00:03:55.319> not<00:03:55.560> enough

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
little bit more but probably not enough

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.030 
little bit more but probably not enough
where<00:03:56.010> you<00:03:56.099> would<00:03:56.189> even<00:03:56.340> really<00:03:56.639> notice<00:03:56.939> it

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
where you would even really notice it

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.039 
where you would even really notice it
you<00:03:59.040> know<00:03:59.189> so<00:03:59.459> there<00:03:59.759> you<00:03:59.879> go<00:04:00.030> that's<00:04:00.269> that's

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
you know so there you go that's that's

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.689 
you know so there you go that's that's
the<00:04:01.290> difference<00:04:01.620> between<00:04:01.799> the<00:04:02.069> two<00:04:02.250> it's<00:04:02.549> just

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
the difference between the two it's just

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:04.759 
the difference between the two it's just
a<00:04:02.759> little<00:04:03.000> bit<00:04:03.090> thinner<00:04:03.269> paper<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:04.319> is<00:04:04.349> feel<00:04:04.709> a

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
a little bit thinner paper it is feel a

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.140 
a little bit thinner paper it is feel a
little<00:04:05.009> different<00:04:05.310> when<00:04:05.400> you<00:04:05.489> write<00:04:05.759> on

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
little different when you write on

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.869 
little different when you write on
because<00:04:06.959> the<00:04:07.620> Rodya<00:04:07.949> paper<00:04:08.220> is<00:04:08.489> a<00:04:08.519> little<00:04:08.609> more

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
because the Rodya paper is a little more

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:11.420 
because the Rodya paper is a little more
textured<00:04:09.389> so<00:04:09.930> if<00:04:10.169> you<00:04:10.290> like<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.829> little<00:04:11.099> texture

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
textured so if you like a little texture

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.129 
textured so if you like a little texture
or<00:04:11.759> if<00:04:11.849> you'd<00:04:12.030> like<00:04:12.060> to<00:04:12.239> use<00:04:12.449> pencils<00:04:12.930> too

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
or if you'd like to use pencils too

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.469 
or if you'd like to use pencils too
especially<00:04:13.379> the<00:04:13.709> Rodya<00:04:14.099> is<00:04:14.459> a<00:04:14.909> little<00:04:15.359> better

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:15.479 
especially the Rodya is a little better

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:18.499 
especially the Rodya is a little better
for<00:04:15.720> that<00:04:15.780> texture<00:04:16.259> kind<00:04:16.470> of<00:04:16.650> kind<00:04:17.639> of<00:04:17.729> feel<00:04:18.000> I

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:18.509 
for that texture kind of kind of feel I

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:20.659 
for that texture kind of kind of feel I
personally<00:04:19.500> prefer<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:19.829> smoothness<00:04:20.519> of<00:04:20.609> the

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
personally prefer the smoothness of the

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.939 
personally prefer the smoothness of the
Clairefontaine<00:04:21.139> so<00:04:22.139> that's<00:04:22.470> that's<00:04:22.770> about

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:22.949 
Clairefontaine so that's that's about

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:24.610 
Clairefontaine so that's that's about
the<00:04:23.190> only<00:04:23.220> difference<00:04:23.639> between<00:04:23.699> the<00:04:23.909> two<00:04:24.090> same

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
the only difference between the two same

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.159 
the only difference between the two same
same<00:04:25.620> paper<00:04:25.830> manufacturer<00:04:26.580> Clairefontaine

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169
