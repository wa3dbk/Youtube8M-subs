hey<00:00:00.690> guys<00:00:00.900> today<00:00:01.709> I'm<00:00:01.890> going<00:00:02.040> to<00:00:02.100> show<00:00:02.250> you<00:00:02.340> too

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
hey guys today I'm going to show you too

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.490 
hey guys today I'm going to show you too
little<00:00:03.270> minecraft<00:00:03.720> machine<00:00:04.080> guns<00:00:04.290> I've

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
little minecraft machine guns I've

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.860 
little minecraft machine guns I've
caught<00:00:04.770> with<00:00:05.009> one<00:00:05.940> of<00:00:06.060> them<00:00:06.180> didn't<00:00:06.450> work<00:00:06.600> too

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
caught with one of them didn't work too

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.440 
caught with one of them didn't work too
well<00:00:06.899> and<00:00:07.290> i'm<00:00:07.350> going<00:00:07.470> to<00:00:07.529> show<00:00:07.710> you<00:00:07.740> why<00:00:08.040> now

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.450 
well and i'm going to show you why now

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.850 
well and i'm going to show you why now
so<00:00:09.450> this<00:00:09.630> is<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:09.870> first<00:00:10.080> one<00:00:10.260> i<00:00:10.290> came<00:00:10.530> up<00:00:10.679> with

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
so this is the first one i came up with

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.020 
so this is the first one i came up with
this<00:00:10.950> is<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.250> one<00:00:11.400> that<00:00:11.490> does<00:00:11.639> not<00:00:11.670> work<00:00:11.940> very

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
this is the one that does not work very

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.520 
this is the one that does not work very
well<00:00:12.240> as<00:00:12.450> you<00:00:12.570> can<00:00:12.719> see<00:00:12.870> I've<00:00:12.990> loaded<00:00:13.259> it<00:00:13.469> with

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
well as you can see I've loaded it with

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.660 
well as you can see I've loaded it with
some<00:00:13.710> arrows<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:14.809> I'll<00:00:15.809> just<00:00:15.929> turn<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.170> on<00:00:16.670> as

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
some arrows and I'll just turn it on as

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.230 
some arrows and I'll just turn it on as
you<00:00:17.850> can<00:00:17.940> see<00:00:18.439> well<00:00:19.439> it's<00:00:19.560> not<00:00:19.710> see<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.400> it

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
you can see well it's not see it it

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.880 
you can see well it's not see it it
looks<00:00:21.630> as<00:00:21.840> though<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.230> going<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.470> rapidly

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
looks as though it is going to rapidly

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.130 
looks as though it is going to rapidly
fire<00:00:23.160> them<00:00:23.400> but<00:00:23.670> as<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.480> can<00:00:24.539> see<00:00:24.779> it's<00:00:24.960> not

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
fire them but as you can see it's not

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.320 
fire them but as you can see it's not
firing<00:00:25.439> on<00:00:25.680> that<00:00:25.740> rapid<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.970> reason<00:00:27.180> for

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
firing on that rapid and the reason for

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.660 
firing on that rapid and the reason for
this<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.480> because<00:00:27.630> this<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.740> flashing<00:00:29.010> so<00:00:29.369> fast

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
this is because this is flashing so fast

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.970 
this is because this is flashing so fast
that<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:30.179> basically<00:00:30.570> just<00:00:30.929> thinks<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.470> there

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
that it basically just thinks is there

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.580 
that it basically just thinks is there
that<00:00:32.309> but<00:00:32.700> there<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:32.940> one<00:00:33.750> redstone<00:00:34.079> pulse

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
that but there is one redstone pulse

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.410 
that but there is one redstone pulse
going<00:00:34.920> into<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.460> then<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.940> just<00:00:36.000> kind<00:00:36.300> of

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
going into it and then it just kind of

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.470 
going into it and then it just kind of
auto<00:00:37.020> updates<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.739> rest<00:00:37.920> owner<00:00:38.129> every<00:00:38.820> every

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
auto updates the rest owner every every

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.590 
auto updates the rest owner every every
now<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.719> again<00:00:39.860> so<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.300> simple<00:00:42.300> fix<00:00:42.510> for

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
now and again so that simple fix for

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.139 
now and again so that simple fix for
that<00:00:42.750> was<00:00:43.789> knowing<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.000> things<00:00:45.320> like<00:00:46.320> Pistons

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
that was knowing the things like Pistons

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.660 
that was knowing the things like Pistons
do<00:00:48.149> not<00:00:48.300> have<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.450> same<00:00:48.600> logic<00:00:49.020> as<00:00:49.170> a

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
do not have the same logic as a

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.000 
do not have the same logic as a
dispenser<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> piston<00:00:52.050> will<00:00:52.620> always

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
dispenser so that a piston will always

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.209 
dispenser so that a piston will always
retract<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.230> you<00:00:55.230> know<00:00:55.350> move<00:00:55.559> move<00:00:55.890> forward

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
retract and you know move move forward

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.299 
retract and you know move move forward
and<00:00:56.309> back<00:00:56.430> no<00:00:57.329> matter<00:00:57.539> how<00:00:57.989> fast<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.890> pit<00:00:59.070> the

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
and back no matter how fast the pit the

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.420 
and back no matter how fast the pit the
pulse<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.989> going<00:01:00.989> into<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.980> then<00:01:02.190> we<00:01:02.280> can

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
pulse is going into it so then we can

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.679 
pulse is going into it so then we can
use<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.609> simple<00:01:03.090> piston<00:01:03.510> piston<00:01:04.290> clock<00:01:04.769> to

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
use a simple piston piston clock to

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:07.820 
use a simple piston piston clock to
transfer<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.840> energy<00:01:06.960> from<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.710> it

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
transfer the energy from it so it

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.130 
transfer the energy from it so it
basically<00:01:07.920> be<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.280> same<00:01:08.580> speed<00:01:08.880> but<00:01:09.240> ten

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
basically be the same speed but ten

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.740 
basically be the same speed but ten
times<00:01:10.350> faster<00:01:10.799> so<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.939> same<00:01:12.210> design

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
times faster so this is the same design

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.859 
times faster so this is the same design
option<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.439> opal<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.950> up<00:01:14.220> until<00:01:14.670> here<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.720> we

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
option to opal to up until here that we

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.899 
option to opal to up until here that we
replace<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.530> dispenser<00:01:16.950> with<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> piston

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
replace this dispenser with a piston

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.810 
replace this dispenser with a piston
sticky<00:01:18.330> piston<00:01:18.720> which<00:01:19.500> then<00:01:19.740> has<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.009> block

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
sticky piston which then has a block

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.810 
sticky piston which then has a block
which<00:01:21.090> conducts<00:01:21.619> redstone<00:01:22.619> power<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.189> then

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
which conducts redstone power and then

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.789 
which conducts redstone power and then
that<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.180> has<00:01:24.420> restoran<00:01:25.290> going<00:01:25.500> through

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
that just has restoran going through

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.380 
that just has restoran going through
here<00:01:26.009> which<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.280> unconnected<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.299> if

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
here which is unconnected to this so if

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.690 
here which is unconnected to this so if
we<00:01:27.509> turn<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:27.840> on<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.530> showed<00:01:28.860> fire<00:01:29.220> rapidly

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
we turn this on it showed fire rapidly

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.590 
we turn this on it showed fire rapidly
rapidly<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.770> this<00:01:31.770> these<00:01:32.369> haven't<00:01:33.240> burned

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
rapidly and this these haven't burned

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.200 
rapidly and this these haven't burned
out<00:01:33.810> for<00:01:33.990> me<00:01:34.110> yet<00:01:34.350> because<00:01:34.740> I've<00:01:35.210> hopefully

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
out for me yet because I've hopefully

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.920 
out for me yet because I've hopefully
got<00:01:36.810> them<00:01:36.960> right<00:01:37.200> like<00:01:37.500> this<00:01:37.970> but<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.030> i<00:01:39.390> think

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
got them right like this but I i think

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.230 
got them right like this but I i think
if<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.200> update<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.770> Redstone<00:01:41.220> by<00:01:42.030> just

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
if you update the Redstone by just

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.609 
if you update the Redstone by just
simply<00:01:42.360> pressing<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.869> button<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.259> should<00:01:43.439> just

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
simply pressing a button it should just

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.219 
simply pressing a button it should just
you<00:01:44.430> know<00:01:44.460> also<00:01:44.700> update<00:01:45.090> itself<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.720> let's

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
you know also update itself so let's

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.469 
you know also update itself so let's
turn<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.890> as<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:47.909> can<00:01:48.030> see<00:01:48.060> it's

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
turn this on and as you can see it's

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.380 
turn this on and as you can see it's
firing<00:01:48.720> much<00:01:49.079> more<00:01:49.350> fast<00:01:49.680> now<00:01:50.670> if<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:50.970> can

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
firing much more fast now if you can

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.240 
firing much more fast now if you can
imagine<00:01:51.479> if<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.869> had<00:01:51.930> about<00:01:52.290> ten<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.740> these<00:01:52.890> I

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
imagine if you had about ten of these I

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.179 
imagine if you had about ten of these I
mean<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.759> could<00:01:53.880> fire<00:01:54.420> more<00:01:54.810> than<00:01:54.840> one<00:01:55.229> you

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
mean you could fire more than one you

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.880 
mean you could fire more than one you
for<00:01:56.670> sure<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.969> could<00:01:57.119> find<00:01:57.299> more<00:01:57.630> than<00:01:57.659> one

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
for sure you could find more than one

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.760 
for sure you could find more than one
dispenser<00:01:58.890> on<00:01:59.070> this<00:02:00.259> trail<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.380> redstone<00:02:01.649> I

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
dispenser on this trail of redstone I

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.999 
dispenser on this trail of redstone I
mean<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.040> could<00:02:02.159> carry<00:02:02.430> on<00:02:02.750> for<00:02:03.750> 15<00:02:04.740> blocks

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
mean you could carry on for 15 blocks

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.440 
mean you could carry on for 15 blocks
that<00:02:05.700> which<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.750> limit<00:02:08.270> we<00:02:09.270> could<00:02:09.420> use

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
that which is the the limit we could use

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.210 
that which is the the limit we could use
something<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:09.989> Josh<00:02:10.259> came<00:02:10.560> up<00:02:10.709> with<00:02:10.950> which

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
something that Josh came up with which

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.480 
something that Josh came up with which
was<00:02:11.550> a

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
was a

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.410 
was a
pulse<00:02:13.470> short<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:14.650> I<00:02:14.740> think<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.130> was<00:02:15.250> oh<00:02:15.580> that's

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
pulse short and I think it was oh that's

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.970 
pulse short and I think it was oh that's
run<00:02:16.630> out<00:02:16.750> I'm<00:02:17.200> not<00:02:17.380> really<00:02:17.500> sure<00:02:17.620> but

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
run out I'm not really sure but

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.860 
run out I'm not really sure but
basically<00:02:18.370> makes<00:02:18.760> you<00:02:19.000> makes<00:02:19.390> your<00:02:19.540> pulse

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
basically makes you makes your pulse

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.470 
basically makes you makes your pulse
endless<00:02:20.500> so<00:02:21.160> if<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:21.340> can<00:02:21.460> get<00:02:21.610> used<00:02:21.880> that<00:02:22.360> and

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
endless so if you can get used that and

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.420 
endless so if you can get used that and
incorporate<00:02:23.140> i'll<00:02:23.230> leave<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:24.100> link<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.400> that

incorporate i'll leave the link to that

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.220 
incorporate i'll leave the link to that
video<00:02:24.670> in<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:24.970> description<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:25.720> you<00:02:26.170> can

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
video in the description and you can

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.080 
video in the description and you can
kind<00:02:26.470> of<00:02:26.590> incorporate<00:02:27.250> it<00:02:27.370> but<00:02:27.520> you<00:02:27.940> can

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
kind of incorporate it but you can

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.580 
kind of incorporate it but you can
imagine<00:02:28.270> if<00:02:28.510> you<00:02:28.600> have<00:02:28.720> about<00:02:28.900> 10<00:02:29.170> of<00:02:29.200> these<00:02:29.350> in

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
imagine if you have about 10 of these in

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.230 
imagine if you have about 10 of these in
you're<00:02:29.770> playing<00:02:30.460> a<00:02:30.520> game<00:02:30.700> of<00:02:30.820> your<00:02:30.940> friends

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
you're playing a game of your friends

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.940 
you're playing a game of your friends
you're<00:02:31.360> trying<00:02:31.570> to<00:02:31.660> kind<00:02:32.110> of<00:02:32.230> defend<00:02:32.710> a<00:02:32.800> base

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
you're trying to kind of defend a base

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.370 
you're trying to kind of defend a base
or<00:02:33.220> something<00:02:33.670> how<00:02:34.360> devastating<00:02:35.050> this<00:02:35.170> is

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
or something how devastating this is

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.220 
or something how devastating this is
going<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.590> be<00:02:35.770> and<00:02:36.190> I<00:02:36.910> mean<00:02:37.540> that<00:02:37.810> has<00:02:37.960> fired

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
going to be and I mean that has fired

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.650 
going to be and I mean that has fired
that<00:02:38.590> pretty<00:02:39.010> fast<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:39.640> I'm<00:02:40.450> going<00:02:40.630> to

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
that pretty fast and I'm going to

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.140 
that pretty fast and I'm going to
actually<00:02:40.870> try<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.320> perfect<00:02:41.980> this<00:02:42.190> I<00:02:42.460> am<00:02:42.580> this

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
actually try and perfect this I am this

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.520 
actually try and perfect this I am this
is<00:02:43.270> going<00:02:43.360> to<00:02:43.420> be<00:02:43.570> kind<00:02:43.780> of<00:02:43.810> a<00:02:43.900> mini<00:02:44.080> project

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
is going to be kind of a mini project

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.070 
is going to be kind of a mini project
for<00:02:44.680> me<00:02:44.800> not<00:02:45.640> really<00:02:45.940> like<00:02:46.150> on<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.690> channel

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
for me not really like on the channel

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.500 
for me not really like on the channel
but<00:02:47.260> just<00:02:47.410> generally<00:02:47.620> in<00:02:47.980> general<00:02:48.490> then<00:02:48.700> you

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
but just generally in general then you

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.480 
but just generally in general then you
know<00:02:49.630> if<00:02:49.750> I<00:02:49.870> ever<00:02:49.990> get<00:02:50.200> any<00:02:50.380> any<00:02:50.740> closer<00:02:51.310> to

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
know if I ever get any any closer to

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.110 
know if I ever get any any closer to
making<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:52.210> rate<00:02:52.360> of<00:02:52.390> fire<00:02:52.660> faster<00:02:53.290> and<00:02:54.120> you

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
making the rate of fire faster and you

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.270 
making the rate of fire faster and you
know<00:02:55.240> i'll<00:02:55.510> just<00:02:56.110> post<00:02:56.320> that<00:02:56.620> video<00:02:57.070> on<00:02:57.250> the

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
know i'll just post that video on the

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.130 
know i'll just post that video on the
channel<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.790> basically<00:02:58.720> tell<00:02:58.960> you<00:02:59.020> how<00:02:59.080> to

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
channel and basically tell you how to

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.720 
channel and basically tell you how to
build<00:02:59.380> it<00:02:59.530> but<00:02:59.620> i<00:02:59.680> don't<00:03:00.250> really<00:03:00.370> think<00:03:00.610> you

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
build it but i don't really think you

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.190 
build it but i don't really think you
need<00:03:00.910> to<00:03:00.970> be<00:03:01.090> told<00:03:01.450> how<00:03:01.690> to<00:03:01.720> build<00:03:02.050> this

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
need to be told how to build this

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.710 
need to be told how to build this
basically<00:03:02.680> it's<00:03:03.610> just<00:03:03.670> two<00:03:04.000> conductive

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
basically it's just two conductive

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.350 
basically it's just two conductive
blocks<00:03:05.130> so<00:03:06.130> just<00:03:06.280> use<00:03:06.400> clean<00:03:06.610> stone<00:03:06.910> or<00:03:07.150> I

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
blocks so just use clean stone or I

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.960 
blocks so just use clean stone or I
think<00:03:07.690> cobblestone<00:03:08.050> works<00:03:08.260> just<00:03:08.410> as<00:03:08.590> fine<00:03:08.970> and

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
think cobblestone works just as fine and

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.900 
think cobblestone works just as fine and
then<00:03:10.150> one<00:03:10.810> two<00:03:11.080> three<00:03:11.380> redstone<00:03:11.830> there<00:03:12.160> one

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
then one two three redstone there one

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.220 
then one two three redstone there one
piece<00:03:13.090> of<00:03:13.210> redstone<00:03:13.360> there<00:03:13.780> one<00:03:13.960> piece<00:03:14.110> of

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
piece of redstone there one piece of

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.350 
piece of redstone there one piece of
redstone<00:03:14.380> their<00:03:14.830> torch<00:03:15.550> on<00:03:15.760> each<00:03:15.910> bit<00:03:16.180> they

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
redstone their torch on each bit they

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.560 
redstone their torch on each bit they
should<00:03:16.600> turn<00:03:16.870> off<00:03:17.610> know<00:03:18.610> if<00:03:18.850> you<00:03:19.030> don't<00:03:19.240> ha

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
should turn off know if you don't ha

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.740 
should turn off know if you don't ha
they<00:03:20.140> sure<00:03:20.260> to<00:03:20.530> start<00:03:20.830> spamming<00:03:21.130> like<00:03:21.460> that

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
they sure to start spamming like that

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.000 
they sure to start spamming like that
then<00:03:22.750> you<00:03:22.900> put<00:03:23.110> a<00:03:23.140> leaver<00:03:23.350> on<00:03:23.470> it<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:23.770> you<00:03:23.860> can

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
then you put a leaver on it and you can

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.800 
then you put a leaver on it and you can
turn<00:03:24.190> it<00:03:24.340> on<00:03:24.400> to<00:03:24.610> the<00:03:24.730> rest<00:03:24.880> owns<00:03:25.120> just<00:03:25.360> on<00:03:25.480> so

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
turn it on to the rest owns just on so

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.050 
turn it on to the rest owns just on so
it<00:03:25.930> can't<00:03:26.140> physically<00:03:26.710> can't<00:03:27.010> spam<00:03:27.310> then<00:03:27.910> this

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
it can't physically can't spam then this

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.730 
it can't physically can't spam then this
button<00:03:28.330> shouldn't<00:03:28.570> you<00:03:28.810> know<00:03:29.320> actually<00:03:29.500> do

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
button shouldn't you know actually do
