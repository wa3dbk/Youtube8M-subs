so<00:00:12.280> awesome<00:00:13.950> here<00:00:14.950> we<00:00:15.160> are<00:00:15.369> just<00:00:15.760> sort<00:00:15.969> of

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150 
so awesome here we are just sort of

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.620 
so awesome here we are just sort of
gambling<00:00:16.930> about<00:00:17.170> space<00:00:17.560> and<00:00:17.830> I<00:00:18.699> thought<00:00:19.509> it

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
gambling about space and I thought it

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.359 
gambling about space and I thought it
would<00:00:19.720> be<00:00:19.869> good<00:00:20.019> to<00:00:20.080> sort<00:00:20.529> of<00:00:20.650> do<00:00:20.769> a<00:00:20.800> video<00:00:21.070> on

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
would be good to sort of do a video on

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.669 
would be good to sort of do a video on
stuff<00:00:22.199> not<00:00:23.199> to<00:00:23.800> do<00:00:24.990> unless<00:00:25.990> you<00:00:26.259> really<00:00:26.529> want

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:26.679 
stuff not to do unless you really want

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:30.900 
stuff not to do unless you really want
to<00:00:26.980> but<00:00:27.869> for<00:00:28.869> starters<00:00:29.230> let's<00:00:29.800> go<00:00:30.519> to<00:00:30.580> this

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
to but for starters let's go to this

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.440 
to but for starters let's go to this
interesting<00:00:31.539> button<00:00:31.960> that's<00:00:32.349> labeled

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
interesting button that's labeled

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.230 
interesting button that's labeled
destroy<00:00:34.710> there's<00:00:35.710> some<00:00:36.010> instances<00:00:36.940> where<00:00:37.180> you

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:37.240 
destroy there's some instances where you

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.070 
destroy there's some instances where you
probably<00:00:37.540> want<00:00:37.720> to<00:00:37.780> use<00:00:37.840> this<00:00:38.200> but<00:00:40.080> generally

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
probably want to use this but generally

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.730 
probably want to use this but generally
it<00:00:41.980> will<00:00:42.400> result<00:00:43.000> in<00:00:43.300> them<00:00:43.570> yeah<00:00:44.170> you<00:00:44.590> know

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:44.740 
it will result in them yeah you know

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:51.280 
it will result in them yeah you know
someone<00:00:45.700> being<00:00:45.970> shot<00:00:46.660> to<00:00:46.690> death<00:00:46.900> Blazers

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.260 

another<00:00:52.160> thing<00:00:52.400> you<00:00:52.430> probably<00:00:52.670> don't<00:00:52.970> want<00:00:53.180> to

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
another thing you probably don't want to

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.450 
another thing you probably don't want to
do<00:00:53.420> is<00:00:53.690> set<00:00:54.020> an<00:00:54.110> automatic<00:00:54.260> course<00:00:54.950> through<00:00:55.430> a

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
do is set an automatic course through a

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.010 
do is set an automatic course through a
large<00:00:55.790> part<00:00:56.150> of<00:00:56.240> asteroid<00:00:56.750> field<00:00:59.020> generally

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
large part of asteroid field generally

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.730 
large part of asteroid field generally
because<00:01:00.500> there<00:01:00.860> are<00:01:00.950> a<00:01:00.980> lot<00:01:01.220> of<00:01:01.250> asteroids<00:01:01.970> and

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:02.740 
because there are a lot of asteroids and

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.110 
because there are a lot of asteroids and
automatically<00:01:03.740> flying<00:01:04.160> at<00:01:04.370> high<00:01:04.640> speed

through<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:05.480> entire<00:01:05.780> belt<00:01:06.050> will<00:01:06.230> almost

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
through the entire belt will almost

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.790 
through the entire belt will almost
certainly<00:01:07.010> result<00:01:07.700> in<00:01:08.120> your<00:01:08.840> ship<00:01:09.080> exploding

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
certainly result in your ship exploding

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.750 
certainly result in your ship exploding
into<00:01:10.400> a<00:01:10.430> thousand<00:01:11.090> tiny<00:01:11.330> fragmented<00:01:12.290> pieces

back into the constituent atoms from

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:28.990 
back into the constituent atoms from
once<00:01:21.170> they<00:01:21.410> came<00:01:27.369> also<00:01:28.369> when<00:01:28.610> trying<00:01:28.910> to

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
once they came also when trying to

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.109 
once they came also when trying to
manually<00:01:29.690> connect<00:01:30.080> with<00:01:30.500> a<00:01:30.740> station<00:01:31.280> ership

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:43.130 

slow<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:37.130> not<00:01:38.130> add<00:01:38.729> too<00:01:39.210> hard<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.720> name

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.230 

that's<00:01:43.409> bad<00:01:44.690> you<00:01:46.040> you<00:01:47.040> don't<00:01:47.370> want<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.700> do<00:01:47.850> that

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:57.020 

or<00:01:53.810> yeah<00:01:54.810> now<00:01:55.290> see<00:01:55.680> that's<00:01:55.920> that's<00:01:56.369> just<00:01:56.790> not

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
or yeah now see that's that's just not

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.410 
or yeah now see that's that's just not
good

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.630

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.010 

fine

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.280 

son<00:02:40.830> is

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
son is

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.330 
son is
Oh

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:55.910 

definitely<00:02:49.340> does<00:02:50.230> problems

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.140 

one<00:02:56.459> it<00:02:56.610> starts<00:02:56.849> to<00:02:56.970> catch<00:02:57.120> on<00:02:57.330> fire<00:02:57.599> near<00:02:59.150> fuel

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
one it starts to catch on fire near fuel

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.870 
one it starts to catch on fire near fuel
barrels<00:03:00.569> and<00:03:01.099> stuff<00:03:02.099> like<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:03.530> so<00:03:04.790> there's<00:03:05.790> a

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
barrels and stuff like that so there's a

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.559 
barrels and stuff like that so there's a
lot<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.330> learn<00:03:06.360> a<00:03:06.780> lot<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.440> things<00:03:07.590> that<00:03:08.569> you

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
lot to learn a lot of things that you

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.440 
lot to learn a lot of things that you
will<00:03:09.660> find<00:03:09.900> out<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.230> hard<00:03:10.380> way<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:11.270> most<00:03:12.270> of

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
will find out the hard way and most of

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.559 
will find out the hard way and most of
the<00:03:12.600> time<00:03:12.810> they'll<00:03:13.050> be<00:03:13.080> pretty<00:03:13.709> entertaining

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
the time they'll be pretty entertaining

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.580 
the time they'll be pretty entertaining
like<00:03:15.569> this<00:03:16.470> guy<00:03:16.709> here<00:03:17.040> slowly<00:03:18.170> slowly<00:03:19.170> burning

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
like this guy here slowly slowly burning

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.140 
like this guy here slowly slowly burning
to<00:03:19.890> death<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:22.739> reactor<00:03:23.220> slowly<00:03:23.940> burning

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
to death and the reactor slowly burning

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.070 
to death and the reactor slowly burning
to<00:03:24.450> death<00:03:24.600> and<00:03:25.099> subsequent<00:03:26.510> explosion<00:03:27.510> which

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
to death and subsequent explosion which

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.200 
to death and subsequent explosion which
will

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.220
