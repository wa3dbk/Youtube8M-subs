00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.439
 and our engine that is totally 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:21.480
 horizontal none of these three you 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.939
 offers stability since all 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.470
 they have a higher severity point and 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.689
 likewise to bring the strength of the 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.119
 engine to the transmission all use a 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.099
 game of arrows and our car has it 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.110
 directly connected to the motor of 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.000
 engine and transmission are united what 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.010
 it also allows you to save fuel 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.679
 and better performance 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.320
 what I told you completely symmetrical 

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:45.649
 this is the car if we split it in half 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.600
 it's 50-50 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:51.149
 thing that none of the other 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.250
 engine configurations or coges is the 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.100
 version that we are going to manage is the forest 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.530
 the xsl that would be the third version that 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.920
 we manage within the advantages that 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.920
 offers 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.080
 you have audio controls at the wheel 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.600
 they have hands-free systems you have 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.040
 cruise control speed what you 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.900
 allows when you go on the road and 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.110
 reaches the desired speed 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.310
 programs you take your foot off the accelerator 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.870
 and it has a very easy way of 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.640
 driving since here you choose and 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.980
 increases the speed or reduces the 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.980
 speed the cluster of the board is 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.010
 the information you need for the 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.540
 trip 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:34.610
 stock footage gas tank 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.330
 and you also have the configuration of the 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.530
 computer on the central dashboard like 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.360
 that shows you the functions of the air 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.130
 conditioned in this case the air is 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.090
 visual both the driver and the 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.090
 passenger choose the 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:52.070
 and there we have what the computer 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.120
 offers information from consumption 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.730
 average average speed 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.280
 this icon of the brand that shows that 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.840
 the four wheels have traction of 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.240
 input the characteristic is that of a 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.180
 vehicle wheel drive which means that 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.890
 has interior traction at 20 reais 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.840
 in a matter of security that allows 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.120
 the four wheels are always going to have the 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.460
 necessary traction regardless of the 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.460
 surface over the existing rolling 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.630
 and also as a lower consumption benefit 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.280
 Lower gasoline engine wear 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.280
 since the four wheels are the ones 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.720
 here in this part can be 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.960
 total and I will put the application of 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.960
 exmo 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.810
 and in this case the van is going to 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.140
 order to help us raise it to the 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.140
 pending 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.880
 what advantage has here no longer you 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.040
 you worry about accelerating or slowing down 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.610
 the comunitat is in charge of doing it 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.980
 alone 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.930
 she the only thing you have to go is the 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.700
 flyer but I'm the regular the 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.500
 speed according to the type of road 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.080
 according to type d 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.300
 Independent 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:14.040
 I have the same 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.040
 in life 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.540
 go down at a safe speed 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.700
 the advantage is that regardless of the 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.220
 any version offers the same engine 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.680
 the same technology locality is going 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.420
 changing between one pressure and another are 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.720
 only some comfort details 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.370
 like the sunroof skin the camera 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.400
 reverse but in matter of motor 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.930
 traction drive all offer what 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.180
 same except for the turbo that already 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.450
 has the benefit of being a turbo engine 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.220
 as is a four-cylinder engine the 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.440
 by itself yes it offers a very good 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.060
 performance has a consumption by means 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.710
 of 13 kilometers per liz something that you 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.830
 help to achieve that consumption is the type 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.830
 d 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.140
 allow us with five stars the 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.850
 stars but any car of the 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.850
 Brand has the highest rating
