00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.930
 where was computer hard 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.019
 the engine that is 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.910
 three-phase brushless using as 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.910
 if you copied them to determine the phases 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.740
 we are going to generate 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.100
 a waves in solitude when he flips the 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.100
 disk 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.430
 the one with only two channels fingers 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.790
 and their own when it ends which 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:42.940
 is presiding over certain state 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.940
 phases 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.880
 being here move a disk motor 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:03.120
 hard the hard drives engine does not 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:06.420
 they have a brush where they have three phases 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.380
 Three-phase motor coil is operating 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.330
 to 5 volts and I'm controlling it with 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.500
 micro control your wine that programs it 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.830
 to pull three sequences of the 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.050
 three phases between the bird phase and there are 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.180
 120 degrees of phase shift 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.180
 using three transistors in the pn 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.770
 that is blown 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.310
 this type of signal a wave 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.259
 with 120 degrees of phase between each 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.140
 is a sine wave but with a 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.380
 controller what I'm suffering is 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.619
 a square wave 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.490
 0 or logical 1 that in this case are 5 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:55.119
 volts however you want between each 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.840
 phase of 120 degrees of lag between each 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.840
 Mrs 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.090
 I'm going to analyze him 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.090
 why plan 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.800
 initially you may not have control of 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:16.010
 address until it is located see it on 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.530
 time of the previous generation leds in 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.950
 the position of the engine 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:26.330
 but I'm increasing the speed 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.330
 take the direction as tolon 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.630
 We have motor type but large scale 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.220
 which is used in hybrid cars is 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.280
 the three-phase motors that work with 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.040
 voltage does although the battery wishes 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.870
 but has an inverted but makes 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:12.000
 do when using three-phase motors 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.640
 playing brakes as you can use the 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.950
 motor as generator between modes 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:21.580
 regenerative and recharges the battery 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:25.120
 normally to test a concept 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.210
 that can be controlled from a source 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.580
 s 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.860
 and a microcontroller and three 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.430
 transistors without moving a source towards 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.430
 three-phase 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.770
 the program k tells you 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.400
 what I designed was this 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.000
 so simple and short these are 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.000
 comments 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.770
 uses a potentiometer 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.480
 the analog inputs to control the 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:02.909
 weather 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.909
 the delay between each phase change 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.750
 until each phase 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:14.110
 turn on a big one the other then turn off what 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.110
 previous 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.169
 the scale the movements
