the<00:00:25.590> time<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:26.269> essentially<00:00:27.269> ting<00:00:27.650> comes<00:00:28.650> down

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
the time is essentially ting comes down

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.709 
the time is essentially ting comes down
to<00:00:28.980> two<00:00:29.189> core<00:00:29.550> things<00:00:30.080> coverage<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.579> devices

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
to two core things coverage and devices

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.690 
to two core things coverage and devices
that<00:00:33.719> we<00:00:33.840> do<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.440> we<00:00:35.070> look<00:00:35.280> at<00:00:35.399> lots<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.640> things

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
that we do and we look at lots of things

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.610 
that we do and we look at lots of things
beyond<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.660> we're<00:00:36.930> excited<00:00:37.230> about<00:00:37.380> some

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
beyond that and we're excited about some

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.990 
beyond that and we're excited about some
things<00:00:37.860> we're<00:00:38.010> due<00:00:38.129> next<00:00:38.280> year<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.579> are<00:00:38.790> way

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
things we're due next year that are way

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.639 
things we're due next year that are way
beyond<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.480> but<00:00:39.629> we<00:00:40.050> have<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.290> have<00:00:40.440> those

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
beyond that but we have to have those

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.790 
beyond that but we have to have those
bases<00:00:41.309> covered<00:00:41.780> in<00:00:42.780> order<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.079> offer<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.379> solid

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
bases covered in order to offer a solid

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.479 
bases covered in order to offer a solid
product<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.370> it's<00:00:44.850> easy<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.420> be<00:00:46.190> romanced<00:00:47.190> by

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
product and it's easy to be romanced by

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.990 
product and it's easy to be romanced by
chasing<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.450> next<00:00:48.890> innovative<00:00:49.890> really<00:00:50.700> cool

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
chasing the next innovative really cool

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.510 
chasing the next innovative really cool
wizzy<00:00:51.629> thing<00:00:51.899> but<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> truth<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:53.100> if<00:00:53.250> we<00:00:53.370> don't

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
wizzy thing but the truth is if we don't

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.389 
wizzy thing but the truth is if we don't
have<00:00:53.809> network<00:00:54.809> coverage<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.649> device<00:00:56.190> is

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
have network coverage and device is

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.660 
have network coverage and device is
covered<00:00:56.820> were<00:00:57.570> dead<00:00:58.070> so<00:00:59.070> we<00:00:59.190> spend<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.460> lot<00:00:59.489> of

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
covered were dead so we spend a lot of

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.930 
covered were dead so we spend a lot of
time<00:00:59.760> focusing<00:01:00.210> on<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:01.640> specifically<00:01:02.640> with

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
time focusing on that specifically with

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.840 
time focusing on that specifically with
coverage<00:01:03.710> you'll<00:01:04.710> see<00:01:04.979> some<00:01:05.309> things<00:01:05.549> in<00:01:05.760> the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
coverage you'll see some things in the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.770 
coverage you'll see some things in the
new<00:01:06.000> year<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.479> terms<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.810> how<00:01:07.020> we<00:01:07.100> communicate

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
new year in terms of how we communicate

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.570 
new year in terms of how we communicate
coverage<00:01:09.780> expectations<00:01:10.619> in<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.159> particular

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
coverage expectations in a particular

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.539 
coverage expectations in a particular
market<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:12.090> think<00:01:12.810> it's<00:01:12.960> really<00:01:13.560> well-known

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
market I think it's really well-known

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.999 
market I think it's really well-known
public<00:01:14.970> knowledge<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.720> sprint<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.500> building

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
public knowledge that sprint is building

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.280 
public knowledge that sprint is building
out<00:01:17.299> significant<00:01:18.299> improvements<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.170> their

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
out significant improvements to their

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.200 
out significant improvements to their
network<00:01:19.470> under<00:01:19.890> their<00:01:20.369> network<00:01:20.820> vision

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
network under their network vision

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.440 
network under their network vision
program<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:22.670> we<00:01:23.670> want<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.030> make<00:01:24.060> sure<00:01:24.180> that

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
program and we want to make sure that

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.330 
program and we want to make sure that
our<00:01:24.479> customers<00:01:24.780> understand<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.860> impact<00:01:26.189> of

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
our customers understand the impact of

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.160 
our customers understand the impact of
that<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:27.049> get<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.200> benefit<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:30.170> so

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
that and get the benefit of that and so

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.600 
that and get the benefit of that and so
that's<00:01:31.350> what<00:01:31.530> we're<00:01:31.740> focused<00:01:32.159> on<00:01:32.280> at<00:01:32.490> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
that's what we're focused on at the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.230 
that's what we're focused on at the
moment<00:01:32.759> from<00:01:33.090> a<00:01:33.210> coverage<00:01:33.600> perspective

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
moment from a coverage perspective

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.319 
moment from a coverage perspective
secondly<00:01:36.950> whenever<00:01:37.950> we<00:01:38.400> decide<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.180> do

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
secondly whenever we decide to do

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.160 
secondly whenever we decide to do
something<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.470> team<00:01:40.680> product<00:01:41.220> we<00:01:42.020> we<00:01:43.020> have

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
something to the team product we we have

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.830 
something to the team product we we have
another<00:01:43.530> test<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.610> test<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.420> we<00:01:45.570> make

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
another test in that test is can we make

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.080 
another test in that test is can we make
it<00:01:45.869> good<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:47.009> there's<00:01:47.189> lots<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.490> things<00:01:47.549> that

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
it good so there's lots of things that

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.010 
it good so there's lots of things that
we<00:01:48.180> can<00:01:48.390> do<00:01:49.700> that<00:01:50.700> we<00:01:50.729> say<00:01:51.090> no<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.390> because<00:01:51.899> we

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
we can do that we say no to because we

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.990 
we can do that we say no to because we
just<00:01:52.200> couldn't<00:01:52.710> when<00:01:53.009> we<00:01:53.130> did<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.490> we<00:01:53.579> would<00:01:53.820> do

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
just couldn't when we did it we would do

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.760 
just couldn't when we did it we would do
it<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.360> be<00:01:54.570> okay<00:01:55.399> we<00:01:56.399> want<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.729> do<00:01:56.909> things<00:01:57.770> you

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
it and be okay we want to do things you

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.800 
it and be okay we want to do things you
know<00:01:58.860> well<00:01:59.130> or<00:01:59.430> as<00:01:59.670> we<00:01:59.850> say<00:01:59.880> around<00:02:00.210> here<00:02:00.390> good

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
know well or as we say around here good

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.359 
know well or as we say around here good
do<00:02:01.259> it<00:02:01.290> good<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:03.140> so<00:02:04.140> sometimes<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.189> means

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
do it good and so sometimes that means

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.880 
do it good and so sometimes that means
we<00:02:05.579> say<00:02:05.759> no<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.000> things<00:02:06.270> for<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.899> while<00:02:07.229> until<00:02:07.680> we

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
we say no to things for a while until we

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.910 
we say no to things for a while until we
can<00:02:08.270> you<00:02:09.270> know<00:02:09.360> negotiate<00:02:10.050> or<00:02:10.289> find<00:02:10.560> a<00:02:10.709> way<00:02:10.860> to

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
can you know negotiate or find a way to

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.760

particular suggestion about offering
data<00:02:16.540> roaming<00:02:17.010> we<00:02:18.010> would<00:02:18.160> have<00:02:18.340> some<00:02:18.640> work<00:02:18.970> to

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
data roaming we would have some work to

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.750 
data roaming we would have some work to
do<00:02:19.420> in<00:02:19.780> terms<00:02:20.080> of<00:02:20.470> looking<00:02:21.010> at<00:02:21.220> where<00:02:21.460> coverage

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
do in terms of looking at where coverage

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.210 
do in terms of looking at where coverage
was<00:02:21.910> going<00:02:22.150> next<00:02:22.300> year<00:02:22.540> and<00:02:22.930> our<00:02:23.590> agreements

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
was going next year and our agreements

was going next year and our agreements
for<00:02:24.610> data<00:02:24.820> roaming<00:02:25.090> or<00:02:25.600> to<00:02:25.750> offer<00:02:25.960> a<00:02:26.440> a<00:02:27.540> good<00:02:28.540> a

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
for data roaming or to offer a a good a

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.590 
for data roaming or to offer a a good a
good<00:02:28.870> offering<00:02:29.850> so<00:02:30.850> I<00:02:30.880> think<00:02:31.300> it's<00:02:31.450> a<00:02:31.510> great

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
good offering so I think it's a great

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.040 
good offering so I think it's a great
suggestion<00:02:32.050> it's<00:02:32.620> probably<00:02:33.390> down<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.690> list<00:02:34.900> a

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
suggestion it's probably down the list a

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.240 
suggestion it's probably down the list a
bit<00:02:35.230> in<00:02:35.440> terms<00:02:35.620> of<00:02:35.800> what<00:02:35.950> we're<00:02:36.040> going<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:36.220> be

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
bit in terms of what we're going to be

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.580 
bit in terms of what we're going to be
doing<00:02:36.400> for<00:02:36.610> coverage<00:02:37.260> but<00:02:38.260> it's<00:02:38.440> actually

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
doing for coverage but it's actually

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.390 
doing for coverage but it's actually
consistent<00:02:39.310> with<00:02:39.490> our<00:02:39.700> pricing<00:02:40.270> model<00:02:40.600> and

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
consistent with our pricing model and

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.070 
consistent with our pricing model and
will<00:02:42.400> definitely<00:02:42.880> think<00:02:43.120> about<00:02:43.690> it<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:43.990> see

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
will definitely think about it and see

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.500 
will definitely think about it and see
if<00:02:44.140> we<00:02:44.230> can<00:02:44.380> do
