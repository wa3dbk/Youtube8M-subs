00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.070
 Ghosts welcome to the 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.440
 historic meeting of reister and 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.490
 Today we try with the independent ones 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.279
 waste thanks mecking give both 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.890
 series and a single malt whiskey 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.390
 from the distillery better a bottle 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:31.410
 is it is a case by case 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:37.140
 burnt in 1999 and filled in the bottle 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:42.629
 in 2011, 46 minutes per cent twelve years 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:45.059
 old and in the earnings forecast series 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.670
 I'm always looking forward to it because here 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.539
 is owned by one of the owners or one 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.230
 employee of dieter gift one 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.120
 taste description submitted and 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.969
 end up with a zero point where the 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.829
 mean that he stands and he says so 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:07.010
 near to the a is bottled from the 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:11.570
 Ice cream not filtered not colored 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:17.220
 now he says sweet and soft of fruity 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:23.060
 slightly spicy subtle oak everything in the 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:29.790
 nose in the taste a slight fatigue 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:34.280
 which develops into sweet malt and 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.280
 afterwards there are warm spices 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:42.829
 where the spices then stronger 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:49.780
 will be in and out there then 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:49.780
 chewing a julie alone at the 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:57.500
 talk show but nice from twelve years 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.390
 relatively bright for twelve years 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.740
 either because they have sharif 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.479
 now before for a before 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.340
 maturation times have been used very briefly 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.340
 then the first sweeping would be here 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.840
 Also get out or it would be 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.549
 a blessing of the dry sharif us 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.610
 been 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:17.000
 where comparatively little to cherry 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.489
 rest was in it or it was a 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.060
 cherry which is not so fully oxidized 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.940
 So it is not so with the oxidation 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.700
 this dark processor has accepted 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:32.720
 Sorry there are so many 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:37.450
 different of the cherry varieties 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.450
 sharif it will be used then 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:47.000
 this usual orosov or pedro jimenez 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.720
 cherry we have now here 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.720
 not in the nose 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.629
 yes, first of all, are birthday for me 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.980
 carried by reach 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:29.690
 then the fruits make a piece 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:29.690
 continue to where 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:45.459
 apricot apple though I soft 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.700
 nectarine now comes easily 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:51.750
 behind it, a tiny detail of the eichhof 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.750
 yes try now 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:16.709
 very spicy on to yes the nut is there 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:20.400
 He likes us as a nazis on everyone 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:24.060
 Fall this sweet as that I do not like 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:28.020
 so sweet I feel and behind it like that 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:36.150
 spices like christmas spices 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:38.240
 bit cinnamon is directly with violence 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.980
 like anise 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:51.120
 but maybe over now 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:52.110
 do not hand the tui the euro into the 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.850
 I had a lot earlier 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.850
 now we have not had at the end 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.300
 if you can do it now first 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:13.250
 stanza most likely second time 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:16.280
 then would actually try 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:22.260
 that would be a building behind 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:25.380
 yes very nice and limited quantity 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.870
 We are hamborn asking too fast too 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.610
 here follower however with this 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.410
 independent bottlers always strong 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.390
 changing firmly with that really 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.590
 watch out because it is not colored 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.350
 you on the internet with the color already 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:40.260
 reasonably recognize in what direction it 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.910
 at the bottlings then yes is pleased 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.230
 I am pleased that the spectators 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.340
 me if you are on the internet after this 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:47.810
 looking for a bottle 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.810
