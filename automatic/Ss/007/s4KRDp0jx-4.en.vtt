yeah but you can see the curl pattern of
a<00:00:54.629> pattern<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.199> really<00:00:55.410> defined<00:00:55.949> but<00:00:56.250> there's

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
a pattern is really defined but there's

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.400

you know it'll without other process or
without<00:01:05.369> increasing<00:01:06.060> its<00:01:06.360> messing<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.080> yes

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
without increasing its messing it yes

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.140 
without increasing its messing it yes
and<00:01:07.590> it's<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.430> technique<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.119> developed

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
and it's the technique that I developed

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.460 
and it's the technique that I developed
over<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.110> last<00:01:10.490> 25<00:01:11.490> 30<00:01:11.520> years<00:01:12.229> but<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.290> thing

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
over the last 25 30 years but the thing

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.280 
over the last 25 30 years but the thing
is<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.520> with<00:01:14.670> her<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.780> basically

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
is and with her is this basically

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.420 
is and with her is this basically
running<00:01:16.799> it<00:01:16.920> through<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.700> hair<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:19.430> allowing

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
running it through the hair and allowing

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.320 
running it through the hair and allowing
it<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.610> prosper<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.810> cross<00:01:22.670> Colby<00:01:23.670> now<00:01:24.060> this

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
it to prosper it to cross Colby now this

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.950 
it to prosper it to cross Colby now this
is<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.600> after<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.259> her<00:01:25.290> texturizer<00:01:25.979> yes<00:01:26.580> and

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
is the after of her texturizer yes and

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.280 
is the after of her texturizer yes and
we<00:01:27.960> still<00:01:28.770> have<00:01:29.040> yet<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.460> trim<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.180> which<00:01:31.079> will

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
we still have yet to trim it which will

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.870 
we still have yet to trim it which will
take<00:01:31.500> some<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.040> weight<00:01:32.189> off<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.520> what<00:01:32.850> I

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880

wanted<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.390> show<00:01:33.799> was<00:01:34.799> how<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.520> curl<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.119> just

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
wanted to show was how the curl is just

a lot more relaxed right there's more of
a<00:01:39.329> wave<00:01:39.570> now<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.619> going<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.950> dry<00:01:41.369> curly

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
a wave now is it going to dry curly

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.690 
a wave now is it going to dry curly
right<00:01:42.570> earlier<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.500> it's<00:01:44.159> going<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.490> drive

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.770 
hair she wears are here in a shape that
has<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.410> lot<00:02:19.710> of<00:02:19.740> weight<00:02:20.100> on<00:02:20.400> it<00:02:20.640> so<00:02:21.330> it's<00:02:21.630> not

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
has a lot of weight on it so it's not

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.860 
has a lot of weight on it so it's not
like<00:02:22.250> we<00:02:23.250> can<00:02:23.400> use<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.760> weight<00:02:23.940> line<00:02:24.270> to<00:02:24.660> keep

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
like we can use the weight line to keep

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.970 
like we can use the weight line to keep
from<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.770> car<00:02:25.980> guys<00:02:26.220> down<00:02:26.610> oh<00:02:27.650> great<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:28.890> her

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
from the car guys down oh great and her

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.700 
from the car guys down oh great and her
hair<00:02:29.220> goes<00:02:29.460> down<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.270> troll-like<00:02:30.840> we<00:02:31.230> anchor

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
hair goes down the troll-like we anchor

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.140 
hair goes down the troll-like we anchor
the<00:02:31.740> curl<00:02:32.160> so<00:02:32.670> that<00:02:32.820> it's<00:02:33.000> down<00:02:33.270> versus<00:02:33.930> out<00:02:34.200> ah

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
the curl so that it's down versus out ah

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.480 
the curl so that it's down versus out ah
we<00:02:36.150> don't<00:02:36.300> layer<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.960> if<00:02:37.140> we<00:02:37.650> layered<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.250> it

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
we don't layer it if we layered it it

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:44.089 
we don't layer it if we layered it it
would<00:02:38.640> be<00:02:38.760> rounded<00:02:39.480> right

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.399 

all<00:02:45.099> right<00:02:45.489> so<00:02:45.849> this<00:02:46.030> is<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.480> end<00:02:46.689> result<00:02:46.959> of

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
all right so this is the end result of

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:52.319 
all right so this is the end result of
the<00:02:48.010> texturizer<00:02:50.250> so<00:02:51.250> as<00:02:51.340> you<00:02:51.459> can<00:02:51.579> see<00:02:51.640> the

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
the texturizer so as you can see the

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.380 
the texturizer so as you can see the
Kochs<00:02:52.540> you<00:02:52.750> still<00:02:53.019> have<00:02:53.200> plenty<00:02:53.739> of<00:02:54.010> curl<00:02:54.489> left

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
Kochs you still have plenty of curl left

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.229 
Kochs you still have plenty of curl left
and<00:02:56.189> what<00:02:57.189> we<00:02:57.370> did<00:02:57.700> was<00:02:58.030> basically<00:02:58.239> just

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
and what we did was basically just

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.690 
and what we did was basically just
release<00:03:01.239> a<00:03:01.480> subdued<00:03:02.049> the<00:03:02.349> frizz<00:03:02.680> lean<00:03:03.670> a

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
release a subdued the frizz lean a

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.899 
release a subdued the frizz lean a
little<00:03:04.030> forward<00:03:05.280> so<00:03:06.280> you<00:03:06.400> can<00:03:06.459> see<00:03:06.760> the

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
little forward so you can see the

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:21.040 
little forward so you can see the
beautiful<00:03:07.450> texture<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.379> still<00:03:08.709> is<00:03:08.980> remaining

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.110 

and<00:03:22.050> I<00:03:22.350> just<00:03:22.530> wanted<00:03:22.830> to<00:03:22.980> show<00:03:23.280> that<00:03:23.760> you<00:03:23.910> can

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
and I just wanted to show that you can

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:35.190 
and I just wanted to show that you can
still<00:03:24.480> get<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:24.960> lot<00:03:25.440> of<00:03:25.710> lift<00:03:26.360> out<00:03:27.360> of<00:03:27.660> it

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.740 

shake<00:03:35.860> your<00:03:36.040> head<00:03:36.250> from<00:03:36.459> side<00:03:36.730> to<00:03:36.790> side<00:03:37.030> really
