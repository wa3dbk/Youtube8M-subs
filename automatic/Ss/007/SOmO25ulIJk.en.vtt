 hello to all and coline i7 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.330
 who will show you how to get back the 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:14.040
 ap data folder for minecraft 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:15.990
 so as I saw on blogs 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.080
 I was looking for myself 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.689
 lost I had lost the folder abdat to 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.090
 the data folder for minecraft because 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.380
 I wanted to set up a mode and I do not 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.550
 could not like I did not have the 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.529
 folder abdat art 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.970
 but I think it makes you the same 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.369
 thing 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:38.850
 I think that at random you type% 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:40.980
 Abdat unreliable and it make me any 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:48.450

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:57.750
