00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 hey that happens very good family to all 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.970
 I'm lady boss today it's wednesday and we're 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.950
 in whatsapp games and following the line 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.650
 from last week that you recommended me 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.960
 it's worth if today we're going to do what 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.510
 your kids be good here do not want 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.010
 your happiness would be a bit boring if not 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.289
 we could do anything but good 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.560
 I guess it means that in life 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.930
 We do not have to hit our teacher 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.490
 that's what video games are for 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.679
 do things that in real life do not 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.020
 we can or we should not do that have to 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.970
 to be very clear, so let's go back 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.640
 to start now 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.680
 the same child is the same child as the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.769
 again it seems the same child 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.629
 this teacher seems a curmudgeon if 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.329
 It seems that he is quite angry 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.260
 let's see what we can do 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:56.500
 let's see what we have per year or a vase 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.960
 yes but this is not going to leave me worth that 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.519
 it takes me outside we can not see it is 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.399
 advertising 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:10.060
 or a stapler we can do with 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:13.060
 a stapler is worth the same child 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.740
 psychopath the other time the other 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.630
 speed with a thief thing that good 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.750
 it seemed to me more or less well and they were 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.210
 the consultants mother my boy that is 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.640
 is being taught but to the beast up 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.030
 Then tomorrow more fuck 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.030
 [Music] 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.970
 ok let's move on to the next one 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.640
 we have since it is this seems one of 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:40.960
 this coffee as it is called is all 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.760
 watch we have associated with and what harm to 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.860
 that is a kid lie that is 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:49.230
 cheating all ways 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.860
 it's very good I love it 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:55.590
 What a brute is the bloody child is that 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.480
 the hot milk the hot coffee there comes 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:03.140
 to finish goodbye 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:06.050
 well then let's move on to the next 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.979
 what is this is to inflate wheels or 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:12.410
 something like this I do not know exactly this or not 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.490
 but this we can not use it is worth what else 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.160
 we have here we are going to see 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.330
 Little things to see we have a book 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:23.710

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:27.060
 with the pencil also or the scissors something 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:29.740
 that carry the umbrella will not leave us 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.460
 this is a 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:37.030
 a glass boat full of flies I do not know 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.770
 it's a weird experiment and I do not see much 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.110
 more good because we will continue with 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.840
 things on the table worth the scissors you're going to 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.090
 do as he cuts his hair this 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.420
 Mr. who does not have hair is worth cut the 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.420
 tie 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:57.360

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.330
 and leave only the blood the color of 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.709
 the blood and this one is very cool the 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.770
 The truth is that these are very beautiful 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.810

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.360

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.270
 pss can not be a pencil that 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.760
 it has to be very sharp to be able to 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.459
 do something like that or is that the child has 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:30.269
 super strength calls me good mother what 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:32.599

 my mother, look at it 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.450
 Without a child, it is very scary. 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.310
 watch 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.040
 I think we're done with everything 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.620
 there on the table so let's move on 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:53.470

 look what always remote is what it says 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.170
 it's worth next 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.310
 we have already done this, not what 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.180
 we can do 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.680
 the chair come let's try the chair 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.900

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.460
 teeth that clear and wait 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.460

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:35.330
 auction how well you look 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.210
 yes 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.960
 damn power kids needed a 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.960
 psychologist 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:49.400
 ok let's continue with the backpack to see 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.830
 what makes a gift 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.780
 see if a person I'm going to make a 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:59.080
 gift because I like them a lot 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.080
 teacher the game what is this a lighter 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:09.530
 let's go so well is he is a bastard and 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.530
 since he's a kid he 's a bastard 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:17.290
 oysters has exploded that is great 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:19.289
 this is great is worth seeing what else 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.389
 we have 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:23.969
 and what a pity it did not let us do 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:26.909
 nothing with the glue is worth the book 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:33.599
 let's see what he does with the book if 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:35.369
 take the whole hand take this clear power 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.960
 is that we put such big books in 

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:38.909
 plan the lord of the rings' that you can 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.139
 kill someone with that or I would 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:41.219
 agreement when I had to read it that 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:43.529
 when I went to bed it's when 

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:46.110
 normally I read books catch that 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:47.699
 book so hey it was a bit dangerous 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.339
 because if you shut up in your face you could 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:52.050
 die if the truth is that there are books that 

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:55.540
 they are too big and then they pass 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:57.850
 these things let's move on to the next 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:02.290
 I think we only have this but I 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:04.420
 I think it still is not not leave us 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:08.400

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.400
 is this 19 of 10 1 and below 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:14.110
 ok and now the flies that are going to do 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:17.920
 when a wasps are not flies, not because 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:20.910
 I do not say that I should give equal 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.910
 they will not kill him either 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:30.889
 I love that you bastards guys climbed bastard 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:33.360
 we are missing something guys and I do not know what it is 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:35.540
 to see 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.760
 it has to be 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.650
 has to be I do not know where to see the 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.710
 child does not wear anything wrong 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:47.000
 we are not going to look on this side this is not 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:50.540
 leave us this we have already done this nothing 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.640
 we have already done the book 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.520
 there has to be something else this does not 

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.020
 leave 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.000
 Ok, guys, it looks like I found 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.650
 what I was missing is the cable this what 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.949
 What's the matter? How did I get here? 

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:04.720
 Spam on this because we need this voucher 

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:06.550
 this cable so see what I do 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.280
 supposedly going to drown it is not going 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.980
 hang or something like that you see yes 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.690
 but read something else very probably you 

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.100
 do something else because this kid does not know 

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.830
 is that he does not stay calm 

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:20.470
 only with killing him he has to 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:24.040
 finish well 

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:26.980
 It's already broken his neck, it's no longer 

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:30.060
 if it aspires pica and since it is already as 

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.930
 it's already I think it's over now 

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.210
 indeed, this is over 

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.890
 I hope you guys have passed 

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:37.600
 very well if it is like this you already know you give to 

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.610
 like in the joy of leaving me more 

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.190
