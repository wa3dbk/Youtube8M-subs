down<00:02:00.670> deep<00:02:00.909> there

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.260 

and<00:02:08.650> the<00:02:08.770> very<00:02:09.010> backyard<00:02:09.610> looks<00:02:09.820> like<00:02:09.970> there's

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
and the very backyard looks like there's

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:17.870 
and the very backyard looks like there's
a<00:02:10.830> bone<00:02:13.080> some<00:02:14.080> sort<00:02:14.470> I<00:02:15.240> can't<00:02:16.240> really<00:02:16.480> make<00:02:16.810> out

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
a bone some sort I can't really make out

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.310 
a bone some sort I can't really make out
and<00:02:18.880> it<00:02:19.150> looks<00:02:19.330> like<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.540> hole<00:02:19.750> goes<00:02:20.020> down<00:02:20.290> a

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
and it looks like the hole goes down a

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.160 
and it looks like the hole goes down a
little<00:02:20.590> deeper<00:02:22.020> but<00:02:23.020> I<00:02:23.050> don't<00:02:23.380> want<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:25.170> climb
