tank
I<00:00:30.710> used<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:33.140> like<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> suction<00:00:34.500> line<00:00:34.860> like<00:00:35.850> a

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
I used a like a suction line like a

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.400 
I used a like a suction line like a
vacuum<00:00:36.300> line<00:00:36.480> like<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:36.750> drain<00:00:37.050> your<00:00:37.170> pool

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
vacuum line like you drain your pool

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.450 
vacuum line like you drain your pool
with<00:00:38.750> I'm<00:00:39.750> going<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:39.960> pull<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:40.350> cap<00:00:40.620> off<00:00:40.920> here

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
with I'm going to pull this cap off here

with I'm going to pull this cap off here
and<00:00:43.190> drain<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.309> tank<00:00:44.550> from<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.820> bottom

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
and drain the tank from the bottom

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.250 
and drain the tank from the bottom
because<00:00:45.510> as<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.930> can<00:00:46.020> see<00:00:47.719> I've<00:00:48.719> got<00:00:48.930> quite<00:00:48.989> a

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
because as you can see I've got quite a

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.340 
because as you can see I've got quite a
bit<00:00:50.090> chunks<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.210> there<00:00:51.329> now<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.930> floated

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
bit chunks in there now that it floated

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.490 
bit chunks in there now that it floated
up<00:00:53.180> with<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.360> apple<00:00:54.660> cider<00:00:54.809> vinegar<00:00:55.350> and

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
up with the apple cider vinegar and

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.680 
up with the apple cider vinegar and
stuck<00:00:55.920> at<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.219> top<00:00:56.930> that's<00:00:57.930> interesting<00:00:59.690> see

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
stuck at the top that's interesting see

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.979 
stuck at the top that's interesting see
if<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.840> can<00:01:00.930> do<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.289> one-handed

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
if I can do this is one-handed

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.539 
if I can do this is one-handed
look<00:01:03.989> at<00:01:04.170> all<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.530> rust<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.949> comes<00:01:05.159> off<00:01:05.369> or

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
look at all the rust that comes off or

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:18.990 
look at all the rust that comes off or
just<00:01:05.580> my<00:01:05.909> finger

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.270 

nothing<00:01:19.870> can<00:01:19.990> tell<00:01:20.230> but<00:01:20.470> that's<00:01:20.680> all<00:01:20.890> deuce

nothing can tell but that's all deuce

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:28.350 
nothing can tell but that's all deuce
rust<00:01:21.730> I<00:01:26.160> got<00:01:27.160> the<00:01:27.250> light<00:01:27.490> on<00:01:27.520> now<00:01:27.910> it<00:01:27.970> might<00:01:28.210> be

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
rust I got the light on now it might be

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.510 
rust I got the light on now it might be
a<00:01:28.390> little<00:01:28.510> easier<00:01:28.720> to<00:01:28.960> see<00:01:29.340> give<00:01:30.340> this<00:01:30.460> a

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
a little easier to see give this a

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.050 
a little easier to see give this a
little<00:01:30.729> wipe<00:01:32.010> you<00:01:33.010> can<00:01:33.220> watch<00:01:33.400> all<00:01:33.640> this<00:01:33.760> rust

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
little wipe you can watch all this rust

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:49.290 
little wipe you can watch all this rust
just<00:01:34.330> come<00:01:34.660> right<00:01:34.870> off<00:01:38.670> see<00:01:39.670> that<00:01:48.060> even<00:01:49.060> on<00:01:49.180> the

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
just come right off see that even on the

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.580 
just come right off see that even on the
outside<00:01:49.450> here<00:01:49.960> if<00:01:50.050> you<00:01:50.140> give<00:01:50.320> it<00:01:50.410> a<00:01:50.470> little

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
outside here if you give it a little

00:01:50.590 --> 00:02:02.719 
outside here if you give it a little
polish<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:52.540> can<00:01:52.720> really<00:01:53.020> tell<00:01:53.229> a<00:01:53.259> difference

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.940 

so<00:02:03.729> now<00:02:03.970> my<00:02:04.300> goal<00:02:04.539> is<00:02:04.570> to<00:02:04.960> clean<00:02:05.229> out<00:02:05.380> that<00:02:05.410> tank

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
so now my goal is to clean out that tank

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.109 
so now my goal is to clean out that tank
so<00:02:06.160> I<00:02:06.220> think<00:02:06.430> I'm<00:02:06.490> going<00:02:06.640> to<00:02:06.670> flush<00:02:06.910> it<00:02:06.940> with

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
so I think I'm going to flush it with

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:13.620 
so I think I'm going to flush it with
water<00:02:08.729> kind<00:02:09.729> of<00:02:10.620> you<00:02:11.620> know<00:02:11.770> be<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.630> neutralize

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
water kind of you know be the neutralize

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.250 
water kind of you know be the neutralize
the<00:02:13.870> acid<00:02:14.350> that<00:02:14.500> was<00:02:14.620> in<00:02:14.770> there<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:16.080> see<00:02:17.080> if<00:02:17.170> I

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
the acid that was in there and see if I

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.750 
the acid that was in there and see if I
can<00:02:17.380> get<00:02:17.530> most<00:02:17.680> of<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:17.950> gunk<00:02:18.280> out<00:02:18.430> I'm<00:02:18.580> going

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
can get most of that gunk out I'm going

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.670 
can get most of that gunk out I'm going
to<00:02:18.820> try<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.000> use<00:02:19.239> like<00:02:19.390> a<00:02:20.580> high-pressure<00:02:21.580> water

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
to try to use like a high-pressure water

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.259 
to try to use like a high-pressure water
and<00:02:23.680> then<00:02:24.220> I'm<00:02:24.340> going<00:02:24.459> to<00:02:24.549> fill<00:02:24.760> it<00:02:24.880> right<00:02:25.090> back

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
and then I'm going to fill it right back

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.350 
and then I'm going to fill it right back
up<00:02:25.330> with<00:02:25.660> another<00:02:25.930> bath<00:02:26.200> of<00:02:26.440> acid<00:02:27.180> this<00:02:28.180> time

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
up with another bath of acid this time

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.320 
up with another bath of acid this time
I'm<00:02:28.420> going<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.600> use<00:02:28.720> white<00:02:28.959> vinegar<00:02:29.200> and<00:02:30.330> see

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
I'm going to use white vinegar and see

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:50.809 
I'm going to use white vinegar and see
what<00:02:31.480> that<00:02:31.660> does

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.960 

alright<00:02:51.819> so<00:02:52.060> we<00:02:52.239> just<00:02:52.420> rinse<00:02:52.690> it<00:02:52.870> with<00:02:52.959> water

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
alright so we just rinse it with water

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.400 
alright so we just rinse it with water
you<00:02:54.970> can<00:02:55.150> see<00:02:55.330> we<00:02:55.510> lost<00:02:55.690> a<00:02:55.959> lot<00:02:56.080> of<00:02:56.290> those

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
you can see we lost a lot of those

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.040 
you can see we lost a lot of those
floaties<00:02:58.110> rust<00:02:59.110> flakes<00:02:59.290> are<00:02:59.650> in<00:02:59.860> there<00:03:00.069> you

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
floaties rust flakes are in there you

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.050 
floaties rust flakes are in there you
can<00:03:02.050> tell<00:03:02.230> just<00:03:02.290> by<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.739> bottom<00:03:03.610> of<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.819> tank

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
can tell just by the bottom of the tank

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.990 
can tell just by the bottom of the tank
there<00:03:04.300> then<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.950> know<00:03:06.130> all<00:03:06.220> that<00:03:06.340> rust<00:03:06.580> on<00:03:06.790> to

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
there then you know all that rust on to

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.900 
there then you know all that rust on to
the<00:03:07.120> bottom<00:03:08.040> if<00:03:09.040> we<00:03:09.160> look<00:03:09.310> at<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.520> color

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
the bottom if we look at the color

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.380 
the bottom if we look at the color
we're<00:03:10.600> apple<00:03:10.870> cider<00:03:11.019> vinegar<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:12.790> is<00:03:12.940> darker

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
we're apple cider vinegar it is darker

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.350 
we're apple cider vinegar it is darker
than<00:03:13.420> before<00:03:13.870> and<00:03:14.019> there's<00:03:14.230> some<00:03:15.360> parts

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.320 
you can tell it's neutralizing me now
that<00:03:31.810> acidic<00:03:32.880> solution<00:03:33.880> in<00:03:34.000> there<00:03:34.150> a<00:03:34.180> little

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
that acidic solution in there a little

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.259 
that acidic solution in there a little
bit<00:03:34.590> nothing<00:03:35.590> crazy<00:03:35.860> but<00:03:36.010> I'm<00:03:36.819> going<00:03:37.030> to<00:03:37.090> put

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
bit nothing crazy but I'm going to put

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.800 
bit nothing crazy but I'm going to put
acid<00:03:37.660> in<00:03:37.750> it<00:03:37.930> again<00:03:38.500> so<00:03:39.330> this<00:03:40.330> time<00:03:40.390> we're

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
acid in it again so this time we're

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.930 
acid in it again so this time we're
going<00:03:40.930> to<00:03:40.989> dry<00:03:42.209> hinds<00:03:43.709> distilled<00:03:44.940> white

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
going to dry hinds distilled white

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.140 
going to dry hinds distilled white
vinegar<00:03:47.010> see<00:03:48.010> how<00:03:48.100> that<00:03:48.280> this<00:03:48.519> I<00:03:48.760> think<00:03:49.000> it<00:03:49.060> was

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
vinegar see how that this I think it was

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.569 
vinegar see how that this I think it was
the<00:03:49.239> same<00:03:49.450> price<00:03:49.720> as<00:03:49.959> the<00:03:50.459> lighter

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
the same price as the lighter

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:56.069 
the same price as the lighter
so<00:03:53.790> once<00:03:54.790> this<00:03:54.970> is<00:03:55.120> done<00:03:55.299> drain<00:03:55.630> with<00:03:55.810> water

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
so once this is done drain with water

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.430 
so once this is done drain with water
I'm<00:03:56.350> going<00:03:56.620> to<00:03:56.709> blow<00:03:57.250> it<00:03:57.370> out<00:03:57.430> there<00:03:58.260> guess<00:03:59.260> I

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
I'm going to blow it out there guess I

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.319 
I'm going to blow it out there guess I
can<00:03:59.680> maybe<00:04:00.100> stick<00:04:00.489> a<00:04:00.519> rag<00:04:00.730> in<00:04:00.940> there<00:04:01.090> and<00:04:01.209> wipe

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
can maybe stick a rag in there and wipe

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.440 
can maybe stick a rag in there and wipe
it<00:04:01.480> a<00:04:01.570> bit<00:04:02.190> and<00:04:03.190> then<00:04:03.430> I<00:04:03.459> will<00:04:03.670> fill<00:04:04.120> it<00:04:04.209> up<00:04:04.269> with

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
it a bit and then I will fill it up with

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.970 
it a bit and then I will fill it up with
vinegar<00:04:04.870> and<00:04:04.900> we'll<00:04:05.079> let<00:04:05.170> it<00:04:05.320> sit<00:04:05.560> for<00:04:05.590> another

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
vinegar and we'll let it sit for another

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.410 
vinegar and we'll let it sit for another
week<00:04:06.220> or<00:04:06.400> so<00:04:06.579> and<00:04:07.650> see<00:04:08.650> what<00:04:08.769> happens<00:04:09.040> in<00:04:09.420> the

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
week or so and see what happens in the

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:58.030 
week or so and see what happens in the
meantime

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.620 

all<00:04:59.040> right<00:04:59.280> so<00:04:59.550> we<00:04:59.670> flush<00:04:59.970> it<00:05:00.120> out<00:05:00.210> with<00:05:00.390> water

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
all right so we flush it out with water

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.890 
all right so we flush it out with water
so<00:05:01.320> I'm<00:05:01.410> blown<00:05:01.770> and<00:05:01.980> out<00:05:02.070> with<00:05:02.220> there<00:05:02.720> you<00:05:03.720> can

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
so I'm blown and out with there you can

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.420 
so I'm blown and out with there you can
see<00:05:05.510> some<00:05:06.510> of<00:05:06.630> these<00:05:06.720> particles<00:05:07.140> that<00:05:07.590> came

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
see some of these particles that came

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.250 
see some of these particles that came
out<00:05:08.610> on<00:05:08.700> there<00:05:08.850> some<00:05:09.120> rust<00:05:09.360> and<00:05:09.600> stuff<00:05:09.870> there's

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
out on there some rust and stuff there's

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.840 
out on there some rust and stuff there's
some<00:05:10.410> other<00:05:10.530> dirt<00:05:10.800> in<00:05:10.920> here<00:05:11.070> from<00:05:11.280> that<00:05:11.580> lonely

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
some other dirt in here from that lonely

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.300 
some other dirt in here from that lonely
engine<00:05:12.210> and<00:05:12.390> stuff<00:05:12.570> but<00:05:12.830> you<00:05:13.830> get<00:05:13.980> the<00:05:14.130> main

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
engine and stuff but you get the main

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:22.940 
engine and stuff but you get the main
idea<00:05:17.270> here's<00:05:18.270> what<00:05:18.540> our<00:05:19.730> white<00:05:20.730> vinegar<00:05:21.950> looks

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
idea here's what our white vinegar looks

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.370 
idea here's what our white vinegar looks
like<00:05:23.990> before

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
like before

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.630 
like before
it<00:05:25.710> sits<00:05:27.890> you<00:05:28.890> can<00:05:29.070> see<00:05:29.250> some<00:05:29.460> of<00:05:29.550> those

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
it sits you can see some of those

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.690 
it sits you can see some of those
floating<00:05:30.090> particles<00:05:30.450> in<00:05:30.720> them<00:05:32.060> so<00:05:33.060> we<00:05:33.390> used

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
floating particles in them so we used

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.280 
floating particles in them so we used
almost<00:05:35.700> the<00:05:35.940> whole<00:05:36.060> thing<00:05:36.360> there's<00:05:36.900> probably

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:37.290 
almost the whole thing there's probably

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:44.540 
almost the whole thing there's probably
a<00:05:37.410> six<00:05:38.600> tiny<00:05:39.600> flecks<00:05:40.080> or<00:05:40.380> something<00:05:40.880> 16

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.590 

so<00:05:45.550> what<00:05:45.760> this<00:05:45.940> sitting<00:05:46.300> I'll<00:05:46.390> let<00:05:46.480> you<00:05:46.570> know

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600
