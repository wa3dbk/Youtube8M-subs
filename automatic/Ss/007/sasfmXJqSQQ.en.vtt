00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:11.670
 I was designed 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.670
 to save the world 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.350
 when looking at the sky people would see 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:19.509
 hope 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.130
 It's the first thing I'll take away 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.919
 there is only one path to peace 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.280
 your extension 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.620
 try to create an armor that will surround 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.010
 the world 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.430
 but what he thinks was a terrible thing 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.430
 artificial intelligence 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:53.300
 it's called the auto program 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.300
 whenever we make mistakes, others pay 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.610
 that the reason for fighting is not to end 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:02.460
 that fight and go home 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.460
 well now you failed like never before 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.930
 we only have left 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.240
 our will and desire to save the 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.470
 world 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.690
 so go out and fight 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.470
 not all will come out of this I have no plans 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.470
 tomorrow night 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:33.050
 I always have to solve your problems 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.050
 we will smash them 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.700
 inside 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.820
 you had to say it
