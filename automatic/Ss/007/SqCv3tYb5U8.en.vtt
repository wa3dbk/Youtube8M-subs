00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.220
 Hi 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.780
 all these beds welcome on body ten 1 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.580
 then we will represent a new 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.400
 workout with the dr x 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.010
 what was it brawny that's it 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.930
 that's a system that's a 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.000
 system of straps to make 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.090
 body weight training 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.710
 the more we will vary the angle of work 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.710
 more or less we will work 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.430
 the first exercise is to develop it 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:40.940
 with her husband as if you were doing 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.090
 bridges so we stay well guinea of 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.050
 waxed abs we work the pectorals 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:50.530
 triceps before the paul and of course 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.530
 the entire abdominal belt 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.620
 quebec I have bugs from your childhood 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.070
 will play well for that it is risky 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.860
 but it really required the series of 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.839
 sales snow mud this is it's 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.000
 the same one blows by pushing 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.680
 register me downhill so 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.960
 now level 2 we go back a little 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.090
 little feet and there you will feel the 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.090
 slightly greater body weight 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.180
 third of the word one recoils in fact that 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.040
 you have backed off the feet 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:24.920
 to be hard the more you are going to need 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:26.299
 it will be gainer more comfortable in Makina 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.700
 the base necessarily more it will be hard 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.770
 to be like on slopes 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.990
 except that we are unstable 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.909
 increases a little bit the intensity and there 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.590
 it's really you work the 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.820
 functional it's exercises they 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.100
 are functional that will serve you 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.080
 then in a movement every day 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.020
 in your sport in all your 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.540
 activities you're going to be able to do just 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.979

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.930
 to find other brands of others 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.390
 things here is even any strap 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.700
 it's the same principle for all 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.790
 brands of straps after any 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.920

 very quickly and especially especially especially 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.160
 by then keep fishing
