bottled ink I just wanted to show you a
little<00:02:59.900> comparison<00:03:00.590> in<00:03:00.830> terms<00:03:01.370> of<00:03:01.730> how<00:03:01.849> much

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
little comparison in terms of how much

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.270 
little comparison in terms of how much
ink<00:03:02.269> it<00:03:02.420> will<00:03:02.720> hold<00:03:02.959> this<00:03:03.290> sailor<00:03:03.890> here<00:03:04.099> is<00:03:04.160> on

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
ink it will hold this sailor here is on

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.000 
ink it will hold this sailor here is on
my<00:03:04.430> left<00:03:04.730> this<00:03:05.209> is<00:03:05.269> an<00:03:05.540> Aurora<00:03:05.900> fountain<00:03:06.769> pen

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.100 
my left this is an Aurora fountain pen
converter<00:03:07.670> I'm<00:03:08.269> going<00:03:08.390> to<00:03:08.450> line<00:03:08.599> them<00:03:08.750> up<00:03:08.900> to

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
converter I'm going to line them up to

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.420 
converter I'm going to line them up to
where<00:03:09.260> they<00:03:09.380> would<00:03:09.500> attach<00:03:09.739> to<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.040> pin<00:03:10.250> so

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
where they would attach to the pin so

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:11.979 
where they would attach to the pin so
you<00:03:10.519> can<00:03:10.670> see<00:03:10.970> that's<00:03:11.510> where<00:03:11.780> they<00:03:11.870> would

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
you can see that's where they would

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.809 
you can see that's where they would
detach<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.590> pen<00:03:12.799> you<00:03:12.980> can<00:03:13.010> see<00:03:13.280> how<00:03:13.430> much<00:03:13.549> less

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
detach the pen you can see how much less

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.789 
detach the pen you can see how much less
ink<00:03:14.090> a<00:03:14.209> sailor<00:03:14.599> converter<00:03:15.140> would<00:03:15.350> hold<00:03:15.560> then

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
ink a sailor converter would hold then

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.900 
ink a sailor converter would hold then
say<00:03:16.459> a<00:03:16.489> typical<00:03:16.760> Aurora<00:03:17.269> so<00:03:18.049> it<00:03:18.200> does<00:03:18.350> have

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
say a typical Aurora so it does have

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.400 
say a typical Aurora so it does have
limited<00:03:19.910> ink<00:03:20.090> capacity<00:03:20.690> on<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.989> converter

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
limited ink capacity on the converter

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.729 
limited ink capacity on the converter
I've<00:03:21.799> actually<00:03:22.340> chosen<00:03:22.700> to<00:03:23.030> use<00:03:23.060> the

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
I've actually chosen to use the

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.840 
I've actually chosen to use the
cartridges<00:03:24.739> that<00:03:24.769> come<00:03:25.160> with<00:03:25.370> it<00:03:25.400> just<00:03:25.730> to

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
cartridges that come with it just to

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.099 
cartridges that come with it just to
test<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.269> pin<00:03:26.680> like<00:03:27.680> I<00:03:27.829> said<00:03:28.069> those<00:03:28.310> are

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
test the pin like I said those are

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.599 
test the pin like I said those are
squeezable<00:03:30.109> you<00:03:30.380> can<00:03:30.560> actually<00:03:30.890> force<00:03:31.220> some

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
squeezable you can actually force some

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.340 
squeezable you can actually force some
of<00:03:31.730> the<00:03:31.790> ink<00:03:31.970> out<00:03:32.150> of<00:03:32.329> the<00:03:32.450> vent<00:03:32.660> hole<00:03:32.870> here<00:03:33.170> I

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
of the ink out of the vent hole here I

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060

tell<00:03:36.739> you<00:03:36.859> that<00:03:36.980> does<00:03:37.190> happen<00:03:37.359> but<00:03:38.359> you<00:03:38.450> can

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
tell you that does happen but you can

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.259 
tell you that does happen but you can
force<00:03:38.900> that<00:03:38.989> ink<00:03:39.380> out<00:03:39.590> of<00:03:39.889> the<00:03:40.160> vent<00:03:40.819> hole<00:03:41.000> and

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
force that ink out of the vent hole and

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:42.789 
force that ink out of the vent hole and
the<00:03:41.359> to<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:41.660> Tyne<00:03:41.870> so<00:03:42.079> you<00:03:42.200> can<00:03:42.350> get<00:03:42.560> to

writing<00:03:43.010> quicker<00:03:43.340> or<00:03:43.609> you<00:03:43.730> can<00:03:43.850> just

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
writing quicker or you can just

does<00:03:48.290> hold<00:03:48.560> I<00:03:48.889> believe<00:03:49.760> the<00:03:50.590> cartridges

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
does hold I believe the cartridges

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.160 
does hold I believe the cartridges
themselves<00:03:52.450> appear<00:03:53.450> to<00:03:53.569> hold<00:03:53.750> a<00:03:53.810> little<00:03:54.019> bit

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
themselves appear to hold a little bit

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.460 
themselves appear to hold a little bit
more<00:03:54.410> ink<00:03:54.650> than<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.489> converter<00:03:56.060> which<00:03:56.630> well<00:03:57.440> I

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
more ink than the converter which well I

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.050 
more ink than the converter which well I
guess<00:03:57.680> if<00:03:57.859> you're<00:03:58.010> just<00:03:58.190> kind<00:03:58.670> of<00:03:58.730> stacking

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
guess if you're just kind of stacking

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.789 
guess if you're just kind of stacking
them<00:03:59.299> side-by-side<00:03:59.569> here<00:04:00.230> it<00:04:00.380> looks<00:04:00.739> like

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
them side-by-side here it looks like

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.020 
them side-by-side here it looks like
it's<00:04:01.010> going<00:04:01.130> to<00:04:01.190> hold<00:04:01.340> a<00:04:01.400> lot<00:04:01.579> more<00:04:01.609> ink<00:04:01.940> than

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
it's going to hold a lot more ink than

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.530 
it's going to hold a lot more ink than
the<00:04:02.780> converter<00:04:03.200> so<00:04:04.040> you'll<00:04:04.280> get<00:04:04.430> more<00:04:04.670> writing

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
the converter so you'll get more writing

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.259 
the converter so you'll get more writing
if<00:04:05.840> you<00:04:05.959> like<00:04:06.139> to<00:04:06.380> use<00:04:07.069> the<00:04:07.280> cartridges<00:04:07.880> versus

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
if you like to use the cartridges versus

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.300 
if you like to use the cartridges versus
the<00:04:08.420> converter<00:04:09.109> before<00:04:09.500> you<00:04:09.560> need<00:04:09.709> to<00:04:09.829> refill

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
the converter before you need to refill

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.449 
the converter before you need to refill
