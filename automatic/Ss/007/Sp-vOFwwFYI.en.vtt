give people a different kind of way to

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:46.249 
give people a different kind of way to
check<00:01:44.729> if<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.090> link<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> phishing<00:01:45.869> link<00:01:46.109> or

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
check if a link is a phishing link or

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.260 
check if a link is a phishing link or
not<00:01:46.409> because<00:01:47.159> phishing<00:01:47.609> links<00:01:47.909> are<00:01:47.999> getting

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
not because phishing links are getting

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.469 
not because phishing links are getting
more<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.689> more<00:01:48.979> convincing<00:01:49.979> all<00:01:50.219> the<00:01:50.399> time<00:01:50.609> so

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
more and more convincing all the time so

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.109 
more and more convincing all the time so
hopefully<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.799> helps<00:01:53.189> somebody<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.999> know

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
hopefully that helps somebody you know

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.230 
hopefully that helps somebody you know
it<00:01:54.270> seems<00:01:54.479> like<00:01:54.630> everyday<00:01:54.959> that<00:01:55.319> somebody's<00:01:55.740> a

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
it seems like everyday that somebody's a

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.940 
it seems like everyday that somebody's a
account<00:01:57.240> has<00:01:57.479> been<00:01:57.689> like<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.020> fished<00:01:58.679> or

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.099 
account has been like a fished or
something<00:01:59.279> like<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.429> so<00:01:59.999> that<00:02:00.299> really<00:02:00.749> sucks

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:01.109 
something like that so that really sucks

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:05.179 
something like that so that really sucks
