00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
want to come you know to left field you

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.379 
want to come you know to left field you
know<00:05:33.199> to<00:05:33.259> mainstream<00:05:34.250> or<00:05:34.430> to<00:05:34.610> poppy<00:05:34.939> because<00:05:35.360> I

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
know to mainstream or to poppy because I

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.149 
know to mainstream or to poppy because I
know<00:05:35.509> I<00:05:35.629> had<00:05:35.870> that<00:05:36.050> in<00:05:36.110> me<00:05:36.439> but<00:05:36.889> I<00:05:36.919> was<00:05:37.039> gonna

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:37.159 
know I had that in me but I was gonna

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:39.219 
know I had that in me but I was gonna
save<00:05:37.400> that<00:05:37.430> for<00:05:37.699> later<00:05:37.849> so<00:05:38.539> I<00:05:38.599> figured<00:05:38.930> I<00:05:39.020> just

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:39.229 
save that for later so I figured I just

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:40.600 
save that for later so I figured I just
do<00:05:39.349> something<00:05:39.589> to<00:05:39.710> represent<00:05:40.159> me<00:05:40.310> and<00:05:40.430> where

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
do something to represent me and where

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.279 
do something to represent me and where
I'm<00:05:40.699> from<00:05:40.729> and<00:05:41.270> I'm<00:05:41.779> the<00:05:41.930> best<00:05:42.139> way<00:05:42.259> to
