00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.699 
that killed and this reminds me of the
cod4<00:02:52.760> map<00:02:53.269> I<00:02:53.450> do<00:02:53.720> not<00:02:53.959> know<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:54.290> name<00:02:54.410> of<00:02:54.470> it

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
cod4 map I do not know the name of it

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.319 
cod4 map I do not know the name of it
because<00:02:54.980> I<00:02:55.069> didn't<00:02:55.250> play<00:02:55.400> cod4<00:02:55.819> but<00:02:56.060> I<00:02:56.090> know<00:02:56.180> it

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
because I didn't play cod4 but I know it

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:57.670 
because I didn't play cod4 but I know it
was<00:02:56.450> a<00:02:56.480> map<00:02:56.720> because<00:02:56.870> I<00:02:57.110> was<00:02:57.230> watching<00:02:57.560> some

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
was a map because I was watching some

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.500 
was a map because I was watching some
gameplay<00:02:58.099> from<00:02:58.489> thunder<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.209> there<00:02:59.360> was<00:02:59.480> a

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
gameplay from thunder and there was a

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.420 
gameplay from thunder and there was a
map<00:02:59.720> that<00:02:59.750> looked<00:03:00.079> like<00:03:00.170> this<00:03:00.470> and<00:03:00.709> I<00:03:01.160> think<00:03:01.370> a

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
map that looked like this and I think a

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.280 
map that looked like this and I think a
shipwrecked<00:03:02.060> or<00:03:02.209> something<00:03:02.540> like<00:03:02.629> that<00:03:02.690> but

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
shipwrecked or something like that but
