00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.410
 Every car needs at least one car battery to start 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.680
 at least as long as alternative energies and technologies are used 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:12.479
 can 

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:15.799
 but the demands on the batteries are rising almost every year with the new one 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.880
 Innovation of the automobile manufacturers 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.240
 she is no longer exclusively for the start of the 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.230
 Vehicle installed but must cover more and more power consumers 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.470
 In the past there were few consumers in the car such as the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.730
 Cigarette lighter the heated rear window or the good old cassettes 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.410
 radio 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.530
 Today, however, counts up to 120 servomotors in the vehicle 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.690
 the list is getting longer and longer 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.990
 Heated seats 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.180
 air conditioner 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.590
 electric mirrors 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.310
 navigation devices 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.570
 Electric seats 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.780
 and other technical refinements that make life and driving safe and enjoyable 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.780
 But all this has to be supplied with electricity 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.110
 because the electricity generated by the alternator is no longer sufficient 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.430
 the battery as a so-called buffer and must help out 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.690
 this puts a lot more strain on the cyclical than it used to 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.210
 Now not only States but additionally the consumers must supply 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.010
 The simple car battery of that time has long been obsolete 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.600
 Therefore, it is also hardly possible to go to the next hardware store and yourself 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.480
 to take a new one off the shelf 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.230
 many batteries have to be taught by the car 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.470
 The so-called battery management needs votes 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.080
 Portman in a modern car an old simple battery 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.760
 so you will enjoy it only in the short term 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.310
 little by little because all electricity consumers fail 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.070
 it has to be the power 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.620
 and the battery technology will be reinstalled 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.170
 Vehicle manufacturer installed 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.570
 I can not choose a little or no technology 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.880
 that means he did not have AG in the installed 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.150
 probably no normal the material has been 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.530
 This is prescribed by the manufacturer if they are living alone 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.440
 Desserts are working now and then some consumers will fail 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.490
 does not recognize battery management via Daily 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.730
 Stop ball is not all electric 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.830
 the councils will fail 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.449
 start that 

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.539
 will continue to work but consumers like the electrical appliances 

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:14.879
 Radio air conditioning will fail 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.739
 Many automakers are obstructing because of the numerous 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:18.780
 electricity consumers 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.459
 already two batteries 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.459
 the starting process should always be guaranteed 

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:25.089
 in the systems 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:29.389
 Product fifa-wm finished at the learning or utility one 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:30.699
 Starter battery that is 

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:33.789
 if today it will charge through the city traffic on the batteries and 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:34.799
 is claimed 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.189
 the main locations as the providers are both empty they can still start 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:41.430
 that means they can not move their father, then no 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.709
 Air conditioning no percent radio 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:45.859
 among the top ten 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.859
 but she can her father died Sandro to safety 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:53.430
 Two car batteries are still often used on vehicles with a start-stop function 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.789
 Logie installed 

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:58.269
 because for the frequent state operations at traffic lights or railroad crossings 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.619
 Of course, the car consumes more energy and of course it has to 

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:04.789
 be generated from the battery 

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:06.459
 a start-stop rejected 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.329
 Start the Middle Ages as the name implies burdened means this 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.329
 Batteries, they would have to go very much more state 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.489
 Suffer like a normal Badri when people in town 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.489
 Celle Gerdes start-stop in front of each traffic light 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:22.619
 always on startup 

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:25.389
 that is about how much much heavier charged 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:28.739
 Oliver Staab stopped increasing in the next few years around 80 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.739
 Percent of vehicles are equipped for this battery 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.799
 Lithium ion batteries or electric vehicles in the next few years 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.799
 It will not be possible to say that today in the zoo 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.229
 There will be more and more demands on battery technology 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:46.849
 Nevertheless, there is no special brand awareness of the customers 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:50.009
 however, more and more emphasis should be placed on premium brands 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:54.469
 that is becoming more and more important with the many consumers of electricity 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:58.419
 it is correct that you have batteries 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:00.579
 from brand manufacturers 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.229
 definitely 

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:04.839
 longer has something of it and thereby save 

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:06.950
 it is also important for you to do so much more 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.419
 the corresponding important gates as well used 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:14.979
 Here it is no longer possible to choose an Expedia over from 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:18.109
 Mandy has to actually fit the vehicle to run 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:19.590
 it is a brand of batteries 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.130
 d with the designation 12 volt 75 on the 4th 

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:30.279
 67 at 4 Neckermann Eigenmann that means that around this battery 

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:31.419
 tension 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:32.759
 Has 12 volts 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:36.499
 for a battery capacity of 75 at four hours 

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:38.240
 and a cold bridge electricity 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.949
 and 67 on the 4th 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.009
 Zacher pushed to say 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:45.610
 the presidium has 60 on 4 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.460
 Percent at minus 18 degrees percent measured over a period of time 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.930
 must be present this battery is a brand name and it now 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.840
 exemplary for many others 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.860
 Umbach manufacturer who none of us have been chosen by this one of us 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:04.749
 who died for 12 volts 75 years 

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:08.989
 I have now chosen as an example because of more and more 

00:05:08.989 --> 00:05:12.240
 Electronics in the vehicle stronger batteries 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.820
 Percent are needed and the 75 years of electricity needs are not all today 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:18.319
 Selling 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:22.389
 Changing a car battery is no problem if there is a mistake in the vehicle 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:24.090
 at a newer makes 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.809
 should a specialist workshop make the change 

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:31.389
 In any case, keep your radio code ready because of this point gain 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:33.969
 Duel each other eco-test new must be entered
