 she was the queen of the geneva show 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.900
 and it will probably also become the super 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.420
 car par excellence the ferrari in his 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.400
 unusual name that makes one think when 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.230
 we are the alda article in front of a name 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.600
 it is certain that it is a unique piece 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.180
 and the heir of the enzo is the car more 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:26.970
 most technologically advanced ever 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:29.550
 made by the brand the design 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.769
 breathtaking and extreme aerodynamics yes 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.370
 merge in the first hybrid ferrari of the 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.070
 story that the V12 6-liter 3 matches 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.200
 to the electrical unit for a total of 960 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.329
 three horses becoming the most 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.600
 always efficient and efficient 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.340
 this thanks to the derived hikers system 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.320
 from experience in formula 1 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.120
 experimented on the competition fields and 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.820
 evolved for use on a car 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.350
 road solution that guarantees the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.500
 perfect integration of the two 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.660
 propulsion reducing consumption to 14 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.000
 liters and two for almost one hundred kilometers 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.799
 one liter less than enzo although a 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.700
 honor of the truth that the purchase has ferrari 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.700
 not very interested 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.490
 the masterpiece in mechanics how much 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.120
 in style starting from the optical groups 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.070
 taken from the f12 berlinetta to the profile 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.500
 alare that replicates the Latvian of the 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.570
 single-seater up to the front hood with 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.430
 the traditional trend for av 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.320
 get to the doors designed for 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.320
 channel the air to the engine compartment 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.520
 a true example of all- Italian art
