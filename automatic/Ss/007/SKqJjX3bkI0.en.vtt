00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
less acceleration of the beater into the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.750 
less acceleration of the beater into the
head<00:01:06.600> double<00:01:07.560> chain<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.950> actually<00:01:08.340> comes<00:01:08.580> with

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
right now in terms of those features the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.070 
right now in terms of those features the
spring<00:01:25.650> system<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.220> what's<00:01:26.430> really<00:01:26.759> cool<00:01:27.080> down

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
spring system is what's really cool down

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.719 
spring system is what's really cool down
at<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.259> bottom<00:01:28.439> your<00:01:28.860> typical<00:01:29.100> pedal<00:01:29.549> this

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
at the bottom your typical pedal this

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.219 
at the bottom your typical pedal this
will<00:01:29.909> just<00:01:30.090> give<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.329> sort<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.570> fitting<00:01:30.930> and

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
will just give it sort of fitting and

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.679 
will just give it sort of fitting and
this<00:01:31.470> can't<00:01:31.710> move<00:01:31.920> down<00:01:32.700> here<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:33.119> swivels<00:01:33.600> a

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
this can't move down here it swivels a

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.990 
this can't move down here it swivels a
little<00:01:33.930> bit<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.770> if<00:01:34.860> you'll<00:01:34.979> notice<00:01:35.040> as<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.790> play

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
little bit so if you'll notice as I play

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.749 
little bit so if you'll notice as I play
the<00:01:36.150> pedal<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:37.140> swivels<00:01:37.590> back<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.950> forth<00:01:38.159> what

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
the pedal it swivels back and forth what

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.340 
the pedal it swivels back and forth what
this<00:01:38.909> does<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.329> kind<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.540> creates<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.900> rocking

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
this does it kind of creates a rocking

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.620 
this does it kind of creates a rocking
motion<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:41.189> makes<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.610> pedal<00:01:41.939> super<00:01:42.360> smooth

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
motion and makes the pedal super smooth

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.120 
motion and makes the pedal super smooth
the<00:01:42.840> whole<00:01:43.020> way<00:01:43.140> through<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.470> stroke<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
the whole way through the stroke and the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.410 
the whole way through the stroke and the
whole<00:01:44.399> way<00:01:44.490> out<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:46.939> obviously<00:01:47.939> you've
