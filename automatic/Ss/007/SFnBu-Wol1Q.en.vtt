00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
if you're using regular nail polish you

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.800 
if you're using regular nail polish you
can<00:01:19.680> apply<00:01:19.890> one<00:01:20.280> layer<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.820> top<00:01:21.119> coat<00:01:21.150> instead

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810

just<00:01:22.650> wait<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> couple<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.280> seconds<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.000> use

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
just wait a couple of seconds and use

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.940 
just wait a couple of seconds and use
the<00:01:24.840> same<00:01:25.080> thing<00:01:27.170> when<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.259> clear<00:01:28.500> gel<00:01:28.799> is

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
the same thing when the clear gel is

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.460 
the same thing when the clear gel is
cured<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.549> try<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.150> cover<00:01:30.479> as<00:01:30.630> much<00:01:30.720> as<00:01:31.259> possible

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
cured I try to cover as much as possible

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.160 
cured I try to cover as much as possible
with<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.159> gold<00:01:32.369> foil<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:33.630> won't<00:01:33.900> stick

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
with the gold foil it won't stick

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.460 
with the gold foil it won't stick
everywhere<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.759> will<00:01:36.600> make<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.810> cool<00:01:37.229> effect

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
everywhere so it will make a cool effect

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:55.289 
everywhere so it will make a cool effect
with<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.040> silver<00:01:38.340> polish<00:01:39.150> as<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.840> base

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.899 

this<00:01:56.299> is<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.750> naila<00:01:56.960> brush<00:01:57.500> that<00:01:57.950> I<00:01:58.219> use<00:01:58.609> and

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
this is the naila brush that I use and

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.830 
this is the naila brush that I use and
the<00:01:59.329> black<00:01:59.569> gel<00:01:59.899> pains<00:02:00.229> i<00:02:01.329> usually<00:02:02.329> don't<00:02:02.600> work

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
the black gel pains i usually don't work

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.440 
the black gel pains i usually don't work
with<00:02:03.049> gel<00:02:03.319> when<00:02:03.649> doing<00:02:03.950> nail<00:02:04.100> art<00:02:04.250> I<00:02:04.520> prefer

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
with gel when doing nail art I prefer

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.580 
with gel when doing nail art I prefer
working<00:02:05.659> with<00:02:05.979> acrylic<00:02:06.979> paint<00:02:08.049> but<00:02:09.049> I<00:02:09.080> decided

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
working with acrylic paint but I decided

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.309 
working with acrylic paint but I decided
to<00:02:09.950> try<00:02:10.310> this<00:02:10.429> out<00:02:10.849> to<00:02:11.209> make<00:02:11.420> it<00:02:11.599> as<00:02:11.780> close<00:02:12.080> to

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
to try this out to make it as close to

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.910 
to try this out to make it as close to
nail<00:02:12.440> polish<00:02:12.980> as<00:02:13.250> possible<00:02:13.989> I<00:02:14.989> wasn't<00:02:15.620> really

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
nail polish as possible I wasn't really

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.559 
nail polish as possible I wasn't really
happy<00:02:16.280> with<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.549> result<00:02:16.940> because<00:02:17.209> the<00:02:17.360> gel

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
happy with the result because the gel

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.990 
happy with the result because the gel
was<00:02:17.810> a<00:02:17.840> bit<00:02:18.079> too<00:02:18.440> thick<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:19.280> it<00:02:19.579> was<00:02:19.700> hard<00:02:19.940> to

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
was a bit too thick and it was hard to

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.569 
was a bit too thick and it was hard to
make<00:02:20.269> straight<00:02:20.569> lines<00:02:20.599> but<00:02:21.170> I<00:02:21.500> don't<00:02:22.400> think

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
make straight lines but I don't think

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:23.979 
make straight lines but I don't think
that<00:02:22.700> you<00:02:22.910> will<00:02:23.030> have<00:02:23.209> any<00:02:23.420> problems<00:02:23.930> with

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
that you will have any problems with

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.160 
that you will have any problems with
this<00:02:24.440> cuz<00:02:25.160> nail<00:02:25.310> polish<00:02:25.790> is<00:02:26.120> so<00:02:26.959> much<00:02:27.140> easier

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
this cuz nail polish is so much easier

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.210
