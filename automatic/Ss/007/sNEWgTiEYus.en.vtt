00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.749 

so<00:00:01.230> we<00:00:01.350> made<00:00:01.500> a<00:00:01.530> mold<00:00:01.829> of<00:00:02.639> a<00:00:03.240> shark<00:00:04.049> fin

00:00:04.749 --> 00:00:04.759 
so we made a mold of a shark fin

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.470 
so we made a mold of a shark fin
last<00:00:05.759> night

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.170 

pick<00:00:10.480> a<00:00:10.570> piece<00:00:10.780> of<00:00:10.960> rubber<00:00:11.500> hose<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:14.559> we<00:00:14.830> cut

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:15.180 
pick a piece of rubber hose and we cut

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.490 
pick a piece of rubber hose and we cut
cuts<00:00:16.180> on<00:00:16.360> the<00:00:16.450> inside<00:00:16.840> of<00:00:16.869> it<00:00:17.200> and<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.990> make<00:00:20.170> so

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
cuts on the inside of it and to make so

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.640 
cuts on the inside of it and to make so
we<00:00:20.619> can<00:00:20.770> make<00:00:20.890> the<00:00:21.040> bend<00:00:21.279> sharpen<00:00:21.790> up<00:00:25.650> that's

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
we can make the bend sharpen up that's

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.040 
we can make the bend sharpen up that's
not<00:00:26.860> a<00:00:26.890> good<00:00:27.100> sign

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
not a good sign

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.910 
not a good sign
I'm<00:00:29.050> dry<00:00:29.350> enough<00:00:31.199> playing<00:00:32.199> double<00:00:32.680> stick<00:00:32.890> tape

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920 
I'm dry enough playing double stick tape

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.450 
I'm dry enough playing double stick tape
to<00:00:33.370> the<00:00:33.460> back<00:00:33.640> of<00:00:33.850> the<00:00:34.090> foam<00:00:35.160> stick<00:00:36.160> it<00:00:36.280> to<00:00:36.340> the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
to the back of the foam stick it to the

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.400 
to the back of the foam stick it to the
table<00:00:36.820> so<00:00:36.970> don't<00:00:37.150> use<00:00:37.420> don't<00:00:37.989> have<00:00:38.140> to<00:00:38.230> use

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
table so don't use don't have to use

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.070 
table so don't use don't have to use
screws<00:00:38.830> I<00:00:39.449> cleaned<00:00:40.449> it<00:00:40.540> off<00:00:40.720> with<00:00:40.930> some

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
screws I cleaned it off with some

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.890 
screws I cleaned it off with some
alcohol<00:00:41.260> and<00:00:41.909> wipe<00:00:42.909> it<00:00:43.059> down<00:00:43.120> to<00:00:43.510> make<00:00:43.720> sure

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
alcohol and wipe it down to make sure

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.119 
alcohol and wipe it down to make sure
there's<00:00:44.050> no<00:00:44.140> wax<00:00:44.379> on<00:00:44.739> it<00:00:45.989> making<00:00:46.989> this<00:00:47.290> closing

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
there's no wax on it making this closing

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.880 
there's no wax on it making this closing
in<00:00:48.220> my<00:00:48.400> square<00:00:49.019> for<00:00:50.019> the<00:00:50.080> mold<00:00:52.500> I'm<00:00:53.500> gonna<00:00:53.650> wax

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
in my square for the mold I'm gonna wax

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.880 
in my square for the mold I'm gonna wax
the<00:00:54.100> mold<00:00:54.339> now<00:00:54.489> on<00:00:55.030> the<00:00:55.120> inside<00:00:55.739> because<00:00:56.739> it

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
the mold now on the inside because it

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.500 
the mold now on the inside because it
won't<00:00:57.040> be<00:00:57.129> able<00:00:57.280> to<00:00:57.370> do<00:00:57.460> it<00:00:57.580> later<00:00:57.729> on<00:00:57.970> with

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
won't be able to do it later on with

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.280 
won't be able to do it later on with
step<00:00:58.750> this<00:00:59.199> stuff<00:00:59.440> in<00:00:59.589> the<00:00:59.680> way<00:01:01.140> we<00:01:02.140> have<00:01:02.260> a

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
step this stuff in the way we have a

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.539 
step this stuff in the way we have a
hard<00:01:02.559> time<00:01:02.769> trying<00:01:02.979> to<00:01:03.070> figure<00:01:03.339> out<00:01:03.400> how<00:01:03.519> to

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:03.549 
hard time trying to figure out how to

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:05.789 
hard time trying to figure out how to
get<00:01:03.790> these<00:01:03.940> inside<00:01:04.479> corners<00:01:04.989> real<00:01:05.199> tight<00:01:05.530> like

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
get these inside corners real tight like

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.210 
get these inside corners real tight like
this<00:01:07.170> I've<00:01:08.170> got<00:01:08.320> a<00:01:08.350> mole<00:01:08.560> going<00:01:08.860> over<00:01:09.070> there

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
this I've got a mole going over there

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.910 
this I've got a mole going over there
it's<00:01:09.340> a<00:01:09.430> piece<00:01:09.610> of<00:01:09.760> plastic<00:01:10.210> tubing<00:01:10.920> it

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
it's a piece of plastic tubing it

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.410 
it's a piece of plastic tubing it
doesn't<00:01:12.580> look<00:01:12.729> like<00:01:12.760> it's<00:01:13.000> gonna<00:01:13.090> be<00:01:13.270> all<00:01:13.390> that

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
doesn't look like it's gonna be all that

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.770 
doesn't look like it's gonna be all that
successful<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:16.000> you're<00:01:16.090> gonna<00:01:16.180> wax<00:01:16.510> these

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
successful and you're gonna wax these

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.480 
successful and you're gonna wax these
things<00:01:17.050> up<00:01:17.290> this<00:01:17.500> is<00:01:17.650> a<00:01:17.740> piece<00:01:17.920> of<00:01:18.040> foam<00:01:18.280> I

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
things up this is a piece of foam I

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.270 
things up this is a piece of foam I
found<00:01:18.790> and<00:01:19.000> it's<00:01:19.120> about<00:01:19.330> the<00:01:19.480> right<00:01:19.600> diameter

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
found and it's about the right diameter

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.770 
found and it's about the right diameter
and<00:01:21.280> I<00:01:21.340> think<00:01:21.760> it's<00:01:21.940> gonna<00:01:22.090> work<00:01:22.150> out<00:01:22.540> real

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
and I think it's gonna work out real

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.490 
and I think it's gonna work out real
bitch<00:01:23.050> it's<00:01:23.350> pretty<00:01:23.560> smooth<00:01:24.040> this<00:01:25.290> mold<00:01:26.290> was

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
bitch it's pretty smooth this mold was

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.230 
bitch it's pretty smooth this mold was
done<00:01:26.680> with<00:01:26.830> hydraulic<00:01:27.370> cement<00:01:28.830> because<00:01:30.240> when

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
done with hydraulic cement because when

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.210 
done with hydraulic cement because when
we<00:01:31.360> did<00:01:31.540> the<00:01:31.750> other<00:01:31.900> day<00:01:31.990> didn't<00:01:32.620> dry<00:01:32.860> quick

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
we did the other day didn't dry quick

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.360 
we did the other day didn't dry quick
enough<00:01:33.490> overnight<00:01:34.620> your<00:01:35.620> step<00:01:35.890> should<00:01:36.130> dry

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
enough overnight your step should dry

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:42.900 
enough overnight your step should dry
really<00:01:36.730> fast<00:01:40.650> now<00:01:41.650> pull<00:01:41.860> them<00:01:42.040> on<00:01:42.130> first<00:01:42.520> I<00:01:42.700> cut

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
really fast now pull them on first I cut

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.760 
really fast now pull them on first I cut
him<00:01:43.060> cut<00:01:43.240> him<00:01:43.540> off<00:01:43.660> separate<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.260> two<00:01:44.410> molds

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
him cut him off separate the two molds

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.190 
him cut him off separate the two molds
now<00:01:45.730> I'm<00:01:45.910> trying<00:01:46.240> to<00:01:46.300> sand<00:01:46.570> this<00:01:46.690> edge<00:01:46.900> it's

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
now I'm trying to sand this edge it's

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.620 
now I'm trying to sand this edge it's
kind<00:01:47.380> of<00:01:47.470> thin<00:01:47.740> and<00:01:47.770> kind<00:01:48.100> of<00:01:48.280> odd<00:01:48.940> shaped<00:01:49.420> or

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
kind of thin and kind of odd shaped or

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.170 
kind of thin and kind of odd shaped or
whatever<00:01:50.220> I'm<00:01:51.220> seeing<00:01:51.550> that<00:01:51.670> you<00:01:51.820> kind<00:01:52.000> of<00:01:52.030> get

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
whatever I'm seeing that you kind of get

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.560 
whatever I'm seeing that you kind of get
a<00:01:52.210> uniform<00:01:52.510> finish<00:01:53.080> with<00:01:53.770> thickness<00:01:54.310> so<00:01:55.270> that

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
a uniform finish with thickness so that

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.330 
a uniform finish with thickness so that
when<00:01:56.080> I<00:01:56.110> make<00:01:56.290> the<00:01:56.440> mold<00:01:56.620> it<00:01:56.830> actually<00:01:57.130> looks

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
when I make the mold it actually looks

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.740 
when I make the mold it actually looks
happy<00:01:59.250> also<00:02:00.250> I<00:02:00.280> want<00:02:00.550> a<00:02:00.610> uniform<00:02:01.150> thickness

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
happy also I want a uniform thickness

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.710 
happy also I want a uniform thickness
all<00:02:02.260> along<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.920> edge<00:02:03.070> here<00:02:03.400> up<00:02:04.060> here<00:02:04.120> it's

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
all along the edge here up here it's

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.990 
all along the edge here up here it's
gotten<00:02:05.020> much<00:02:05.170> wider<00:02:05.500> I<00:02:05.890> guess<00:02:06.100> the<00:02:06.340> foam<00:02:06.790> was

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
gotten much wider I guess the foam was

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.949 
gotten much wider I guess the foam was
squished<00:02:07.330> in<00:02:07.630> so<00:02:07.930> I<00:02:07.960> gotta<00:02:08.229> sand<00:02:08.590> this<00:02:09.959> right

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
squished in so I gotta sand this right

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.110 
squished in so I gotta sand this right
here<00:02:11.290> in<00:02:11.830> this<00:02:11.950> step<00:02:12.159> the<00:02:12.220> hydraulics<00:02:12.940> seems

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
here in this step the hydraulics seems

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.970 
here in this step the hydraulics seems
to<00:02:13.269> be<00:02:13.300> really<00:02:13.750> stopped<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:14.440> maybe<00:02:14.680> it's<00:02:14.890> just

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
to be really stopped and maybe it's just

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:43.950 
to be really stopped and maybe it's just
hasn't<00:02:15.220> had<00:02:15.430> enough<00:02:15.459> time<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:15.970> dry

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.020 

you
