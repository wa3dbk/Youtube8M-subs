 special very rich essences that we 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:37.640

 because it's really spectacular I know that 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.609
 we started with a cupcake we started what 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.760
 we make easy very easy today we brought 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:54.890
 something very easy a classic cupcake and in 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.829
 this case is a vanilla cupcake no 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.140
 much more I have the pasta already dyed what 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.629
 What I'm going to do is add some 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.879
 essence droplets very beautiful and 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.619
 just to give you a little bit of 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.409
 aroma since we're going to work with some 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.539
 roses 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.380
 to give a little scent of roses 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:16.409
 look at me that sings are essences are 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.689
 essences for baking for decoration 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.520
 of everything exactly we are going to give a 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.640
 moment of aroma a little bit of flavor 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.469
 I also integrated it well into my pasta and 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.470
 what I'm going to do is again do 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:29.960
 a little bun 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.330
 and today I'm going to use a textured plate 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.750
 Dora like to give her a little bit of 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.460
 volume a little bit of texture is more 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.500
 what I 'm going to put up I put a 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.660
 little bit of what is impalpable sugar 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.090
 with a compact helping me with the 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.770
 pollerita so that it does not stick on me 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.920
 all because by incorporating a little bit of 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.500
 liquid there I will have that thing that 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.450
 the pasta is going to loosen up a bit 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.040
 I 'm going to stretch it doing a little bit of 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.460
 pressure so that I fit the 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.920
 texture I'm going to lift my pasta and a 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.500
 Once on Sunday he has achieved that 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.020
 it was very easy I'm going to cut it with 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.810
 a shear to circulate in this case of 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.870
 seven centimeters I'm going to grab half 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.520
 with a little hydrated cms this 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.100
 edible glue that we use 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.550
 all the reporters I will brush 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.160
 hermitage and there I will place this 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.740
 top coverage this seems to me of 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.770
 I love it when it makes the cupcakes area 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.920
 because you saw that it is like so easy rich 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.110
 economic and something simple with singing 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.150
 hand in hand I will try to take it 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.860
 without pressing too much to avoid losing 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.800
 my tenderness min 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.290
