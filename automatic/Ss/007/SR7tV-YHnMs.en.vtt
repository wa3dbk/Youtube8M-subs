 I came out with a window that I recognized it now and came out and recognized the crystal disturbance. 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.150
 It is after this 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:13.480
 Like this, I just got the secret map of Crystal Sword but 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:19.030
 By reading the person who found that this Crystal Sword 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:24.140
 In this game, a game called Crystal Sword is handed to Crystal Sword in the game. 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:30.560
 It is in such a state that we got the possibility to put in 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:32.850

 It is a state that the probability that I could get this mirror shield has increased 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.540
 Like this, Nintendo 3ds is already able to recognize these people 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.500
 It has become 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:22.600
