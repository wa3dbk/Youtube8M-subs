this video for the free motion quilting
project<00:00:10.950> today<00:00:11.580> we're<00:00:11.969> learning<00:00:12.120> another<00:00:12.629> new

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
project today we're learning another new

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.230 
project today we're learning another new
design<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:13.980> this<00:00:14.370> is<00:00:14.580> actually<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:14.940> very

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
design and this is actually a very

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.170 
design and this is actually a very
simple<00:00:15.840> variation<00:00:16.200> of<00:00:16.710> Paisley<00:00:17.340> we're<00:00:17.939> just

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
simple variation of Paisley we're just

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.910 
simple variation of Paisley we're just
going<00:00:18.360> to<00:00:18.420> wiggle<00:00:18.689> into<00:00:19.050> every<00:00:19.590> teardrop

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
going to wiggle into every teardrop

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.359 
going to wiggle into every teardrop
shape<00:00:20.430> with<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.090> little<00:00:21.450> wiggly<00:00:21.930> line<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.500> that

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
shape with a little wiggly line and that

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.759 
shape with a little wiggly line and that
is<00:00:23.640> going<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.939> create<00:00:24.060> split<00:00:24.930> Paisley<00:00:25.410> so

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
is going to create split Paisley so

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.380 
is going to create split Paisley so
let's<00:00:26.039> get<00:00:26.189> on<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.519> machine<00:00:26.850> and<00:00:26.880> see<00:00:27.269> how

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
let's get on the machine and see how

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.920 
let's get on the machine and see how
this<00:00:27.510> works<00:00:27.750> in<00:00:27.990> free<00:00:28.230> motion<00:00:29.630> so<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.720> get

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
this works in free motion so to get

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.780 
this works in free motion so to get
started<00:00:30.990> with<00:00:31.439> split<00:00:31.859> Paisley<00:00:32.340> all<00:00:32.550> we're

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
started with split Paisley all we're

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.670 
started with split Paisley all we're
going<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:32.970> do<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.449> stitch<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.780> simple<00:00:34.230> teardrop

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
going to do is stitch a simple teardrop

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:43.009 
going to do is stitch a simple teardrop
shape<00:00:37.070> down<00:00:38.210> swing<00:00:39.210> in<00:00:41.059> and<00:00:42.059> now<00:00:42.360> I'm<00:00:42.690> going<00:00:42.930> to

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.019 
shape down swing in and now I'm going to

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.680 
shape down swing in and now I'm going to
stitch<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.470> little<00:00:43.920> Wiggly<00:00:44.370> Molly<00:00:44.640> all<00:00:45.269> the<00:00:45.540> way

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
stitch a little Wiggly Molly all the way

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.479 
stitch a little Wiggly Molly all the way
to<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.989> end<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:48.379> and<00:00:49.379> there's<00:00:50.159> a<00:00:50.220> lot<00:00:50.460> of

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
to the end of that and there's a lot of

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.160 
to the end of that and there's a lot of
different<00:00:50.850> options<00:00:51.180> for<00:00:51.360> how<00:00:51.479> to<00:00:51.510> get<00:00:51.750> out<00:00:51.989> at

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
different options for how to get out at

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.719 
different options for how to get out at
this<00:00:52.290> point<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.920> could<00:00:53.100> travel<00:00:53.400> stitch

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:53.729 
this point you could travel stitch

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:55.609 
this point you could travel stitch
against<00:00:54.059> one<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.570> sides<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.110> teardrop

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:55.619 
against one of the sides of the teardrop

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:57.890 
against one of the sides of the teardrop
but<00:00:56.339> I<00:00:56.369> think<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.670> best<00:00:56.940> look<00:00:57.360> would<00:00:57.690> be<00:00:57.809> to

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
but I think the best look would be to

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.840 
but I think the best look would be to
travel<00:00:58.290> stitch<00:00:58.500> back<00:00:58.860> along<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.400> wiggly

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
travel stitch back along that wiggly

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.180 
travel stitch back along that wiggly
line<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.080> don't<00:01:01.229> have<00:01:01.409> to<00:01:01.680> rotate<00:01:02.010> your

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
line and you don't have to rotate your

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.039 
line and you don't have to rotate your
quilt<00:01:02.489> but<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.059> just<00:01:03.269> wanted<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.600> make<00:01:03.720> sure<00:01:03.780> you

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
quilt but I just wanted to make sure you

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.250 
quilt but I just wanted to make sure you
can<00:01:04.229> see<00:01:04.439> what<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.619> was<00:01:04.799> doing<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.720> then<00:01:06.720> rotate

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
can see what I was doing and then rotate

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.200 
can see what I was doing and then rotate
that<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.860> stitch<00:01:08.159> back<00:01:08.520> just<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.180> little

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
that and stitch back just a little

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.630 
that and stitch back just a little
careful<00:01:09.660> travel<00:01:10.200> stitching<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.190> now<00:01:11.460> we're

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
careful travel stitching and now we're

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.200 
careful travel stitching and now we're
going<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.820> swing<00:01:12.180> out<00:01:12.450> around<00:01:12.990> pivot<00:01:13.800> and<00:01:14.550> echo

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
going to swing out around pivot and echo

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:28.710 
going to swing out around pivot and echo
just<00:01:15.750> like<00:01:15.960> we<00:01:16.110> did<00:01:16.290> for<00:01:16.350> normal<00:01:16.920> Paisley

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.030 

okay<00:01:29.720> so<00:01:29.780> at<00:01:30.020> this<00:01:30.110> point<00:01:30.350> we<00:01:30.560> kind<00:01:30.740> of<00:01:30.800> have<00:01:30.920> to

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
okay so at this point we kind of have to

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.530 
okay so at this point we kind of have to
decide<00:01:31.400> all<00:01:31.670> right<00:01:31.790> where<00:01:31.940> are<00:01:31.970> we<00:01:32.120> going<00:01:32.360> next

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
decide all right where are we going next

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.010 
decide all right where are we going next
I<00:01:32.930> think<00:01:33.170> I'm<00:01:33.290> going<00:01:33.410> to<00:01:33.500> swing<00:01:33.770> down<00:01:33.950> here<00:01:35.020> and

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
I think I'm going to swing down here and

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.890 
I think I'm going to swing down here and
wiggle<00:01:36.620> out<00:01:36.830> with<00:01:37.730> nice<00:01:38.030> to<00:01:38.300> your<00:01:38.390> drop<00:01:38.630> shape

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
wiggle out with nice to your drop shape

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.220 
wiggle out with nice to your drop shape
kind<00:01:39.320> of<00:01:39.380> a<00:01:39.440> legally<00:01:39.830> teardrop<00:01:40.840> right<00:01:41.840> here

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.230 
kind of a legally teardrop right here

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.200 
kind of a legally teardrop right here
and<00:01:42.980> now<00:01:43.010> I'm<00:01:43.250> going<00:01:43.370> to<00:01:43.430> stitch<00:01:43.610> my<00:01:43.790> wiggly

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
and now I'm going to stitch my wiggly

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.390 
and now I'm going to stitch my wiggly
line<00:01:46.360> you<00:01:47.360> travel<00:01:47.960> stitch<00:01:48.140> back<00:01:48.410> hopefully

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
line you travel stitch back hopefully

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.830 
line you travel stitch back hopefully
you<00:01:49.490> can<00:01:49.610> see<00:01:49.850> that<00:01:50.060> when<00:01:50.210> I'm<00:01:50.330> travel

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
you can see that when I'm travel

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.440 
you can see that when I'm travel
stitching<00:01:51.260> especially<00:01:51.950> I<00:01:52.190> really<00:01:52.490> have<00:01:53.420> to

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
stitching especially I really have to

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.350 
stitching especially I really have to
slow<00:01:53.810> down<00:01:53.860> in<00:01:54.860> order<00:01:55.040> to<00:01:55.220> get<00:01:55.370> that<00:01:55.400> exact<00:01:56.120> in

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
slow down in order to get that exact in

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.480 
slow down in order to get that exact in
order<00:01:56.540> to<00:01:56.600> stay<00:01:56.840> on<00:01:57.020> that<00:01:57.170> line<00:01:57.410> have<00:01:58.130> to<00:01:58.280> slow

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
order to stay on that line have to slow

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.550 
order to stay on that line have to slow
down<00:02:00.100> editing<00:02:01.100> and<00:02:01.760> swing<00:02:02.150> it<00:02:02.180> around<00:02:02.500> you<00:02:03.500> can

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
down editing and swing it around you can

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.920 
down editing and swing it around you can
see<00:02:03.680> that<00:02:04.040> particular<00:02:04.790> echo<00:02:05.420> was<00:02:05.630> just<00:02:05.810> a

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
see that particular echo was just a

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.900 
see that particular echo was just a
little<00:02:06.170> bit<00:02:06.290> bigger<00:02:06.470> than<00:02:06.680> all<00:02:06.830> the<00:02:06.980> others<00:02:07.220> so

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
little bit bigger than all the others so

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.030 
little bit bigger than all the others so
how<00:02:08.060> do<00:02:08.119> I<00:02:08.179> fix<00:02:08.480> that<00:02:08.750> all<00:02:08.990> I<00:02:09.050> have<00:02:09.350> to<00:02:09.380> do<00:02:09.590> is<00:02:09.800> go

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
how do I fix that all I have to do is go

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.090 
how do I fix that all I have to do is go
in<00:02:10.220> there<00:02:10.520> and<00:02:11.140> Stitch<00:02:12.140> carefully<00:02:12.770> right

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
in there and Stitch carefully right

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.580 
in there and Stitch carefully right
through<00:02:13.490> the<00:02:13.580> middle<00:02:13.730> of<00:02:14.030> it<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:14.360> i'll<00:02:15.080> split

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590

space that all this weird area can just

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
be filled in with echoes I'm just

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.250 
be filled in with echoes I'm just
bouncing<00:03:45.430> from<00:03:45.580> the<00:03:45.760> edge<00:03:45.880> of<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.270> space<00:03:46.540> and

bouncing from the edge of the space and

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.440 
bouncing from the edge of the space and
back<00:03:47.620> and<00:03:48.370> that's<00:03:48.850> going<00:03:49.030> to<00:03:49.090> fill<00:03:49.270> that<00:03:49.300> up

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
back and that's going to fill that up

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.320 
back and that's going to fill that up
quite<00:03:49.810> nicely<00:03:50.310> and<00:03:51.310> then<00:03:51.790> I<00:03:51.880> can<00:03:52.060> swing<00:03:52.300> around

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
quite nicely and then I can swing around

00:03:52.330 --> 00:04:01.750 
quite nicely and then I can swing around
here<00:03:53.050> and<00:03:53.380> finish<00:03:54.100> that<00:03:54.430> up<00:03:54.490> just

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.630 

so<00:04:02.760> that's<00:04:03.180> it<00:04:03.540> or<00:04:03.900> split<00:04:04.319> Paisley<00:04:04.980> I<00:04:05.310> hope

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
so that's it or split Paisley I hope

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.040 
swinging that line out and around and
expanding<00:04:46.830> things<00:04:47.099> and<00:04:47.970> work<00:04:48.330> to<00:04:48.570> bring<00:04:48.780> your

expanding things and work to bring your
scale<00:04:49.320> back<00:04:49.590> to<00:04:49.860> where<00:04:50.070> you<00:04:50.310> were<00:04:50.490> quilting

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
scale back to where you were quilting

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.520 
scale back to where you were quilting
before<00:04:51.360> so<00:04:51.539> if<00:04:51.630> you're<00:04:51.750> working<00:04:51.990> on<00:04:52.199> a<00:04:52.259> bed

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
before so if you're working on a bed

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.589 
before so if you're working on a bed
quilt<00:04:52.830> and<00:04:52.949> you're<00:04:53.160> wanting<00:04:53.639> one<00:04:54.270> particular

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
quilt and you're wanting one particular

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:57.230 
quilt and you're wanting one particular
scale<00:04:55.139> it's<00:04:55.530> a<00:04:55.650> good<00:04:55.949> idea<00:04:56.160> to<00:04:56.460> always<00:04:56.820> start

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
scale it's a good idea to always start

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.779 
scale it's a good idea to always start
on<00:04:57.449> a<00:04:57.479> practice<00:04:57.990> sandwich<00:04:58.349> and<00:04:58.789> understand

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
on a practice sandwich and understand

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:00.890 
on a practice sandwich and understand
what<00:05:00.000> your<00:05:00.120> body<00:05:00.300> is<00:05:00.389> wanting<00:05:00.690> to<00:05:00.780> do

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
what your body is wanting to do

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.350 
what your body is wanting to do
naturally<00:05:01.500> and<00:05:01.710> so<00:05:02.220> that<00:05:02.430> way<00:05:02.550> you<00:05:02.610> don't<00:05:03.000> put

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
naturally and so that way you don't put

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.839 
naturally and so that way you don't put
those<00:05:03.509> first<00:05:04.010> beginning<00:05:05.010> stitches<00:05:05.400> on<00:05:05.580> that

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:05.849 
those first beginning stitches on that

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:07.460 
those first beginning stitches on that
quilt<00:05:06.150> and<00:05:06.300> potentially<00:05:06.870> have<00:05:06.960> to<00:05:07.139> rip<00:05:07.289> them

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
quilt and potentially have to rip them

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.740 
quilt and potentially have to rip them
out<00:05:07.590> you<00:05:08.250> know<00:05:08.370> if<00:05:08.610> I<00:05:08.729> was<00:05:08.940> putting<00:05:09.270> this<00:05:09.419> on<00:05:09.659> a

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
out you know if I was putting this on a

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.659 
out you know if I was putting this on a
real<00:05:10.470> quilt<00:05:10.770> and<00:05:10.889> I<00:05:10.979> wanted<00:05:11.280> things<00:05:11.430> to<00:05:11.550> be

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
real quilt and I wanted things to be

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:14.060 
real quilt and I wanted things to be
really<00:05:12.210> really<00:05:12.240> really<00:05:12.599> tight<00:05:13.020> and<00:05:13.289> dense<00:05:13.680> and

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
really really really tight and dense and

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.950 
really really really tight and dense and
I'm<00:05:14.520> swinging<00:05:15.000> everything<00:05:15.330> out<00:05:15.539> real<00:05:15.780> big

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
I'm swinging everything out real big

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.500 
I'm swinging everything out real big
well<00:05:16.349> clearly<00:05:16.979> I<00:05:17.130> can't<00:05:17.490> add<00:05:17.699> more<00:05:17.970> echoes<00:05:18.300> in

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
well clearly I can't add more echoes in

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.270 
well clearly I can't add more echoes in
but<00:05:19.110> it<00:05:19.199> would<00:05:19.320> be<00:05:19.409> a<00:05:19.440> lot<00:05:19.650> better<00:05:19.680> to<00:05:20.039> just

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
but it would be a lot better to just

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.520 
but it would be a lot better to just
know<00:05:20.789> that<00:05:21.000> acknowledge<00:05:21.630> it<00:05:21.810> have<00:05:22.139> a<00:05:22.169> chance

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
know that acknowledge it have a chance

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.589 
know that acknowledge it have a chance
to<00:05:22.800> kind<00:05:23.039> of<00:05:23.130> you<00:05:23.789> know<00:05:23.820> go<00:05:24.060> ahead<00:05:24.180> and<00:05:24.479> take

00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:24.599 
to kind of you know go ahead and take

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:26.810 
to kind of you know go ahead and take
stock<00:05:24.960> of<00:05:25.020> what<00:05:25.470> my<00:05:25.620> body's<00:05:26.039> doing<00:05:26.250> that<00:05:26.610> day

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
stock of what my body's doing that day

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.909 
stock of what my body's doing that day
so<00:05:27.419> it's<00:05:27.570> always<00:05:27.750> a<00:05:27.900> good<00:05:28.139> idea<00:05:28.169> to<00:05:28.440> start<00:05:28.740> on<00:05:28.860> a

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
so it's always a good idea to start on a

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:30.649 
so it's always a good idea to start on a
practice<00:05:29.340> sandwich<00:05:29.699> and<00:05:29.909> give<00:05:30.090> yourself<00:05:30.210> that

00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:30.659 
practice sandwich and give yourself that

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:32.659 
practice sandwich and give yourself that
little<00:05:30.990> bit<00:05:31.229> of<00:05:31.259> insight<00:05:31.830> before<00:05:32.280> you<00:05:32.400> start

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669
