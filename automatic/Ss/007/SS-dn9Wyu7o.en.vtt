00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
reason number one it only works with the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.500 
reason number one it only works with the
iphone<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:44.309> we<00:00:44.460> all<00:00:44.579> know<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.789> apple<00:00:45.360> stuff

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
iphone so we all know that apple stuff

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.330 
iphone so we all know that apple stuff
generally<00:00:45.960> only<00:00:46.110> works<00:00:46.440> well<00:00:46.680> with<00:00:46.800> other

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
generally only works well with other

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.889 
generally only works well with other
apple<00:00:47.850> stuff<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:48.300> shouldn't<00:00:48.539> be<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> surprise

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
apple stuff that shouldn't be a surprise

apple stuff that shouldn't be a surprise
but<00:00:49.200> with<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:50.100> apple<00:00:50.700> thing<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.510> only<00:00:51.660> works

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
but with this apple thing it only works

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.229 
but with this apple thing it only works
specifically<00:00:52.620> with<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.860> very<00:00:53.250> few<00:00:53.670> apple

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
specifically with a very few apple

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.819 
specifically with a very few apple
products<00:00:54.690> so<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.870> can't<00:00:55.140> tether<00:00:55.379> right<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.770> an

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
products so you can't tether right to an

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.260

ipod<00:00:56.129> touch<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.489> can't<00:00:56.699> tether<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.090> your

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
ipod touch you can't tether it to your

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.630 
ipod touch you can't tether it to your
iPad<00:00:57.539> or<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.750> mac<00:00:58.230> or<00:00:58.260> an<00:00:58.590> imac<00:00:58.920> or<00:00:58.949> macbook<00:00:59.460> pro

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.220 
iPad or a mac or an imac or macbook pro
we<00:00:59.730> can<00:00:59.850> only<00:00:59.969> tell<00:01:00.239> her<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.510> an<00:01:00.600> iphone<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:01.050> has

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
we can only tell her to an iphone it has

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.680 
we can only tell her to an iphone it has
to<00:01:01.379> be<00:01:01.500> an<00:01:01.590> iphone<00:01:02.039> 5<00:01:02.309> or<00:01:02.579> newer<00:01:02.879> now<00:01:03.420> there<00:01:03.600> is

to be an iphone 5 or newer now there is

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.149 
to be an iphone 5 or newer now there is
a<00:01:03.719> technical<00:01:04.080> reason<00:01:04.260> for<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.710> he<00:01:04.769> uses<00:01:05.040> all

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
a technical reason for it he uses all

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.280 
a technical reason for it he uses all
the<00:01:05.250> sensors<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.700> your<00:01:05.820> iphone<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.930> Apple

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
the sensors of your iphone so the Apple

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.780 
the sensors of your iphone so the Apple
watch<00:01:07.380> needs<00:01:07.740> something<00:01:08.280> that's<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.549> little

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
watch needs something that's a little

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.690 
watch needs something that's a little
more<00:01:09.290> recent<00:01:10.290> i<00:01:10.439> guess<00:01:10.740> but<00:01:10.920> still<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.549> only

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
more recent i guess but still it only

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.670 
more recent i guess but still it only
works<00:01:12.060> for<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.360> tiny<00:01:12.689> part<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.229> apple

year's not going worth 18k so it's one
of<00:03:49.000> those<00:03:49.090> things<00:03:49.150> it's<00:03:49.540> I've<00:03:49.870> always<00:03:50.230> thought

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
of those things it's I've always thought

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.289 
of those things it's I've always thought
of<00:03:50.650> a<00:03:50.739> watch<00:03:50.950> as<00:03:51.130> an<00:03:51.250> investment<00:03:51.639> you<00:03:51.790> spend<00:03:52.239> a

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
of a watch as an investment you spend a

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:53.879 
of a watch as an investment you spend a
lot<00:03:52.419> of<00:03:52.450> money<00:03:52.630> on<00:03:52.690> a<00:03:52.810> nice<00:03:53.019> watch<00:03:53.319> and<00:03:53.650> it's

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
lot of money on a nice watch and it's

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:56.280 
lot of money on a nice watch and it's
timeless<00:03:54.430> with<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:54.790> Apple<00:03:55.060> watch<00:03:55.209> it's<00:03:56.139> got

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
timeless with the Apple watch it's got

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.379 
timeless with the Apple watch it's got
an<00:03:56.410> expiry<00:03:56.859> date<00:03:56.859> it's<00:03:57.400> going<00:03:57.879> to<00:03:57.940> be<00:03:58.090> useless

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389 
an expiry date it's going to be useless

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:00.569 
an expiry date it's going to be useless
so<00:03:58.959> those<00:03:59.169> are<00:03:59.200> the<00:03:59.680> five<00:03:59.859> reasons<00:04:00.160> that<00:04:00.519> I

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
so those are the five reasons that I

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.550 
so those are the five reasons that I
think<00:04:01.060> you<00:04:01.419> should<00:04:01.660> not<00:04:01.810> get<00:04:02.049> an<00:04:02.230> Apple<00:04:02.530> watch

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
think you should not get an Apple watch

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.159 
think you should not get an Apple watch
now<00:04:02.859> if<00:04:03.069> you<00:04:03.340> could<00:04:03.489> get<00:04:03.609> over<00:04:04.180> those<00:04:04.840> five

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:05.169 
now if you could get over those five

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:07.140 
now if you could get over those five
reasons<00:04:05.440> I<00:04:05.739> do<00:04:05.799> think<00:04:06.190> that<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.519> Apple<00:04:07.000> watch

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
reasons I do think that the Apple watch
