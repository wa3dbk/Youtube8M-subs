00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.800
 to take a deep breath try 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.780
 to make it a little taller to stretch a 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.060
 little more 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.610

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.680
 stress of the day 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.810
 Five breaths should be 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.820
 enough so we're going to inhale 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.400
