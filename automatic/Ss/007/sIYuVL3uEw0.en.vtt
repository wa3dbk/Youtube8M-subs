00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:23.530 
and 1000 now it has a built-in xpad

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.160 
and 1000 now it has a built-in xpad
which<00:00:24.190> is<00:00:24.430> a<00:00:24.460> sampler<00:00:25.210> that<00:00:25.720> you<00:00:25.810> can<00:00:25.930> load

I'll give you a quick demo here right
now<00:00:36.730> we're<00:00:36.910> just<00:00:36.940> going<00:00:37.120> to<00:00:37.300> affect<00:00:37.570> the<00:00:37.690> input

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
now we're just going to affect the input

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.020 
now we're just going to affect the input
which<00:00:38.380> is<00:00:38.560> the<00:00:39.040> track<00:00:39.310> that's<00:00:39.550> running<00:00:39.790> right

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
which is the track that's running right

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.610 
which is the track that's running right
now<00:00:40.180> so<00:00:40.810> we<00:00:41.079> have<00:00:41.200> an<00:00:41.320> isolator<00:00:43.110> we<00:00:44.110> have<00:00:44.260> the

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
now so we have an isolator we have the

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.639 
now so we have an isolator we have the
cut<00:00:44.860> or<00:00:45.040> the<00:00:45.160> ad<00:00:45.899> now<00:00:46.899> this<00:00:47.140> does<00:00:47.350> it<00:00:47.500> by

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
cut or the ad now this does it by

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:55.639 
cut or the ad now this does it by
frequency<00:00:49.680> if<00:00:50.680> we<00:00:50.829> do<00:00:50.980> the<00:00:51.190> role<00:00:51.670> and<00:00:52.030> the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.810 

transformer<00:00:56.649> adjust<00:00:57.280> on<00:00:57.460> certain

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
transformer adjust on certain

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:05.630 
transformer adjust on certain
frequencies<00:00:58.329> and<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:01.000> gate<00:01:01.239> and<00:01:01.450> the<00:01:01.570> drive

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.880 

now<00:01:06.640> as<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:07.060> signal<00:01:07.420> flow<00:01:07.659> comes<00:01:08.380> over<00:01:08.650> to<00:01:08.770> the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
now as the signal flow comes over to the

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.520 
now as the signal flow comes over to the
right<00:01:09.070> we<00:01:09.340> have<00:01:09.370> all<00:01:09.549> these<00:01:10.030> effects<00:01:10.510> the<00:01:11.260> blue

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
right we have all these effects the blue

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.899 
right we have all these effects the blue
ones<00:01:11.830> are<00:01:12.130> sort<00:01:12.850> of<00:01:12.909> the<00:01:13.060> low<00:01:13.750> effects<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.880> the

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:15.909 
ones are sort of the low effects and the

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.719 
ones are sort of the low effects and the
red<00:01:16.870> ones<00:01:17.140> are<00:01:17.320> the<00:01:17.619> higher<00:01:17.830> effects<00:01:18.400> so<00:01:18.520> if<00:01:18.610> we

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
red ones are the higher effects so if we

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:25.350 
red ones are the higher effects so if we
want<00:01:18.940> to<00:01:19.000> spiral<00:01:19.540> up<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:24.520> we<00:01:24.850> have<00:01:25.000> a<00:01:25.030> really

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
want to spiral up and we have a really

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.090 
want to spiral up and we have a really
cool<00:01:25.600> kill<00:01:25.960> switch<00:01:26.260> so<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:29.380> got<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.590> vinyl

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
cool kill switch so you got the vinyl

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.560 
cool kill switch so you got the vinyl
break<00:01:30.700> you<00:01:31.420> got<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:31.810> echo<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:34.150> you<00:01:34.330> have<00:01:34.479> the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
break you got the echo and you have the

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.760 
break you got the echo and you have the
backspin<00:01:36.240> now<00:01:37.240> aside<00:01:37.930> from<00:01:37.990> all<00:01:38.290> of<00:01:38.350> that<00:01:38.470> you

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
backspin now aside from all of that you

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.340 
backspin now aside from all of that you
also<00:01:38.920> have<00:01:39.220> the<00:01:39.760> expat<00:01:40.270> effect<00:01:40.600> which<00:01:40.840> will

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
also have the expat effect which will

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.770 
also have the expat effect which will
give<00:01:41.530> you<00:01:41.740> it<00:01:41.860> comes<00:01:42.040> in<00:01:42.310> with<00:01:42.970> built-in<00:01:43.420> kick

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
give you it comes in with built-in kick

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.230 
give you it comes in with built-in kick
snare<00:01:43.990> clapping<00:01:44.770> hi<00:01:44.950> hat<00:01:47.729> which<00:01:48.729> you<00:01:48.909> can<00:01:49.060> play

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
snare clapping hi hat which you can play

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.989 
snare clapping hi hat which you can play
or<00:01:49.630> just<00:01:49.659> hold<00:01:50.140> down

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:55.999 

00:01:55.999 --> 00:02:00.529 

now<00:01:56.999> also<00:01:57.299> if<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:58.640> do<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.789> role<00:02:00.060> it's<00:02:00.329> going

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
now also if you do the role it's going

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:01.789 
now also if you do the role it's going
to<00:02:00.600> do<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.840> input<00:02:01.200> since<00:02:01.350> we<00:02:01.469> have<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.679> input

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
to do the input since we have the input

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.319 
to do the input since we have the input
selected<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.460> now<00:02:02.549> we'll<00:02:02.729> be<00:02:02.850> able<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.030> roll

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
selected so now we'll be able to roll

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:11.509 
selected so now we'll be able to roll
the<00:02:03.840> music<00:02:04.289> that's<00:02:04.500> on<00:02:09.920> and<00:02:10.920> we<00:02:11.190> could<00:02:11.370> also

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
the music that's on and we could also

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.880 
the music that's on and we could also
create<00:02:11.849> our<00:02:12.660> own<00:02:12.690> pattern<00:02:13.430> by<00:02:14.430> simply<00:02:14.910> just

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
create our own pattern by simply just

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:25.539 
create our own pattern by simply just
tap<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:16.920> in

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.039 

and<00:02:26.549> we<00:02:26.700> can<00:02:26.879> overdub<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.510> like<00:02:27.690> if<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.810> want

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
and we can overdub it like if you want

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:35.270 
and we can overdub it like if you want
to<00:02:28.110> do<00:02:33.200> so<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.260> have<00:02:34.470> different<00:02:34.650> things<00:02:35.099> and

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
to do so you have different things and

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.369 
to do so you have different things and
you<00:02:35.400> can<00:02:35.549> keep<00:02:36.090> overdubbing<00:02:36.720> over<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.230> you

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
you can keep overdubbing over it you

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.530 
you can keep overdubbing over it you
have<00:02:37.530> a<00:02:37.560> volume<00:02:38.010> control<00:02:38.040> for<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.849> pad<00:02:39.060> you

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
have a volume control for the pad you

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.990 
have a volume control for the pad you
have<00:02:39.659> a<00:02:39.720> pitch<00:02:39.989> control<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.829> it<00:02:41.549> works<00:02:41.849> with

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
have a pitch control and it works with

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.390 
have a pitch control and it works with
the<00:02:42.150> center<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.510> return<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:43.019> any<00:02:43.260> of<00:02:43.799> the<00:02:44.040> DJ

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
the center and return of any of the DJ

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.890 
the center and return of any of the DJ
mixtures<00:02:44.790> that<00:02:44.819> have<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.239> center<00:02:45.540> in<00:02:45.599> return

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
mixtures that have the center in return

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.190 
mixtures that have the center in return
