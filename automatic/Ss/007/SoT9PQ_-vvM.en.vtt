00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:07.360
 hello youtube friends today I bring you a 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:11.700
 new video that is how to install 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:18.240
 an application called clean master 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:23.039
 that will help us move applications 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.590
 also to eliminate information cache 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.160
 that does not serve us and we have it in the 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.000
 mobile 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:34.000
 is now practically a cleaner that 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.410
 is for me the best cleaner all 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.390
 followed by prehistory 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.770
 We are here in the lupita and we are going to 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.770
 start up 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.740
 we wait for them to look for us and we are going to 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.030
 choose this we give in install clean 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.510
 optimized master 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.339
 let's install 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.339
 and in accepting 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.470
 and we will wait for you to download and 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.470
 install 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.260
 and as you see, friends have just installed and 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.260
 we are going to give it in open 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.920
 is an application really useful 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.820
 and for example here we are going to give 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.549
 authorization if advice perception route 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.250
 weather you can optimize your device 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.950
 is to install applications for installed 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.800
 and necessarily in this device 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.880
 want to continue 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.290
 this is only to authorize it depends if 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.710
 you have them going to leave if you do not 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.630
 they have not come out or this is 9 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.600
 need to be root 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.710
 and we are going to grant it for example in 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.710
 this request 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.070
 already 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.920
 and as you see there is the application that 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.300
 master 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:17.910
 reynosa the sd card used 1,3 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:22.340
 Free gigas 580 and 1.1 mb devices 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:26.880
 used 168 megabyte free 21 mb 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.380
 cleaned today 00 bytes total 00 bytes what 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.840
 what we are going to do is use for example 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.730
 to eliminate cache and delete files 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.520
 trash we give you here in the goats 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.050
 garbage 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.050
 and we accept 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.550
 Here we see this that we have read 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.400
 quickie that is recommended and starts 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.470
 Total have recommended us delay a bit 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.980
 less than total cleaning for cleaning 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:55.430
 total gives you much more look then 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.820
 as you can see these are caches for example 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.560
 for example these to freckles that for 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.120
 example I arrived I'm installed but 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.400
 I have them out there for example is a 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:10.290
 search and we clean and as you see 26 as 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.950
 87 megabytes have been released 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:18.750
 It ends if we want we give it in option 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:22.319
 of more advanced search we can also 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:25.350
 give here in optimize optimizer 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.360
 memory where he seeks us 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.790
 things that 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.820
 that we may be taking away 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.820
 a lot of space that we can 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:38.120
 manage optimize so that we 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.120
 creates 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.630
 create us a little more memory by 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:48.110
 example there the device is 88 now 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:51.410
 we already have the 78 used already we have more 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.870
 to put more games because now here 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.780
 in the application history for example 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.960
 we can put here there we appear 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.300
 all our applications that we have 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.430
 we can uninstall from here or do 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.420
 backups for example for 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:14.050
 some suddenly the application is 81 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:16.430
 which occupies 255 points 38 megabytes 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.829
 pre-installed applications are the 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.130
 applications that come installed 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.330
 by 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.330
 can cellular na 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.130
 and the applications that I installed 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.380
 so for example here we go for 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:35.600
 make backup 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:38.370
 and for to move for example we are of 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.050
 memory to the phone phone in the 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.570
 memory because although on applications 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.430
 moved that I go to mobile that is in 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:48.470
 get on your there is forgiveness and 23 of 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.470
 michael wellington the mobile 

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:55.080
 to the memory card 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:59.409
 and it's very good here we can update 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:02.110
 comment trash reminder settings 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:03.909
 for example station so that by 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.009
 example remind us that we have memory 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:10.039
 cache and that we should erase it 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:14.599
 I for example when every how much when 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:16.230
 we have more than 300mb your time scans 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:18.960
 those applied 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.480
 used memory will not be the 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.760
 tasks mathematically self with the 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.040
 screen off for example we would have 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:30.449
 something open and it is already extinguished with 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:32.729
 macerate stove for example if we had 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:34.740
 let's say we were sliding 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:36.300
 we got youtube and we were and but 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.740
 we do not close it completely 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.479
 then with this it does not close anymore 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.220
 completely and it stops us spending 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.710
 drums 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.030
 it's a very good thing without this law 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.660
 program is very good 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:51.300
 I hope you liked it 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:55.580
 the list in the place tone 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.580
 and we went to this clinic master 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.820
 archive 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:06.610
 and that has been all in any committee 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.610
 Hello, I hope you liked it and it's going
