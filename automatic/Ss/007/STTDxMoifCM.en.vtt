what's<00:01:35.990> called<00:01:36.050> an<00:01:36.290> optic<00:01:36.650> eye<00:01:36.860> so<00:01:37.310> if<00:01:37.820> there's

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
what's called an optic eye so if there's

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.400 
what's called an optic eye so if there's
no<00:01:38.270> coming<00:01:38.570> out<00:01:38.780> of<00:01:38.930> her<00:01:39.050> udder

no coming out of her udder

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.830 
no coming out of her udder
it<00:01:40.100> goes<00:01:40.340> through<00:01:40.640> an<00:01:40.730> optic<00:01:41.090> eye<00:01:41.210> and<00:01:41.540> it<00:01:41.690> will

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
it goes through an optic eye and it will

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.290 
it goes through an optic eye and it will
stay<00:01:42.170> on<00:01:42.380> the<00:01:42.620> vacuum<00:01:42.980> stays<00:01:43.220> on<00:01:43.430> the<00:01:43.550> cow<00:01:43.730> when

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
stay on the vacuum stays on the cow when

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.570 
stay on the vacuum stays on the cow when
that<00:01:44.480> milk<00:01:44.750> flow<00:01:45.050> slows<00:01:45.530> down<00:01:45.920> when<00:01:46.370> her

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
that milk flow slows down when her

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.320 
that milk flow slows down when her
udders<00:01:46.910> getting<00:01:47.300> empty

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
udders getting empty

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.810 
udders getting empty
comes<00:01:48.690> off<00:01:48.930> all<00:01:49.320> by<00:01:49.500> itself<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:50.160> milk<00:01:50.520> comes

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
comes off all by itself the milk comes

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.700 
comes off all by itself the milk comes
out<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.450> cow<00:01:51.690> at<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.050> temperature<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.560> about

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
out of the cow at a temperature of about

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.040 
out of the cow at a temperature of about
100<00:01:53.220> degrees<00:01:53.340> with<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.090> body<00:01:54.540> temperature

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
100 degrees with the body temperature

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.620 
100 degrees with the body temperature
for<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.320> cow<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:56.220> within<00:01:56.400> five<00:01:56.730> minutes<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.480> has

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
for a cow and within five minutes it has

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.440 
for a cow and within five minutes it has
pulled<00:01:57.870> down<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.380> about<00:01:58.590> 36<00:01:59.100> degrees<00:01:59.550> so<00:02:00.390> the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
pulled down to about 36 degrees so the

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.960 
pulled down to about 36 degrees so the
milk<00:02:00.750> does<00:02:00.960> not<00:02:01.140> have<00:02:01.380> time<00:02:01.980> to<00:02:02.040> be<00:02:02.280> warm<00:02:02.640> after
