00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.160
We have two kinds of digital
printing presses, the Indigo 10000 and 5500.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.880
These two pieces of equipment
are completely complementary.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.200
They can meet the printing format
requirement of 1/8 paper size (A3) and B2.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.560
The 10000 has
the B2 printing format.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.800
It can meet the customer’s short-run
printing requirements very well

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.240
and its quality can absolutely
reach the offset printing standard.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.400
Many of our customers
need short-run printing.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.480
We couldn’t meet their demand if the quantity were small
because we used conventional offset printing.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.720
However, we can use the B2 format to do the job now
to ensure our customers get satisfied products.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.640
This brought big changes.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.200
We've accumulated a lot of customer resources
since we began using the Indigo 5500.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.960
We have nearly 4000
customers at present.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.680
Many of them are based
in small batch production

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.760
which can not be accomplished
with conventional offset press.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.920
Since we bought Indigo 10000, we have integrated
the resources and improved our business scope greatly.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:15.600
No.1, we excluded conventional digital design
drawing completely with B2 format of Indigo 10000.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.320
From the customers' conventional design drawing
of the customers to printing on the Indigo 10000.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.040
No. 2, personalized format manufacturing is realized;
mainly in printing packages with big format pictures.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:33.840
No. 3, we put all the editions together and printed them
all at once to provide the customers with good products.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.960
HP Indigo has overturned the meaning
of "conventional printing" completely

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.000
and given a satisfying answer
for the customers.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.000
It has also influenced every conventional
printing producing format of our customers.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.440
It has improved both the quality
and speed greatly for us.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.240
There is a local printing company
that is also our business partner.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.680
This company is quite special. It's in the
solar system and plastic packaging business.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.120
Some of its requirements could not
be meet by others before.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.160
First, the colors couldn't meet its requirements
using conventional methods.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.200
The color difference was too big.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.840
But since they came to us and asked us to produce for them,
we solved the problem successfully using the 5500 and 10000.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.120
So the company can now provide its customers with
good products with no color difference at all.
