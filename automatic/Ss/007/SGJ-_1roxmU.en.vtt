00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.199 
wondering what that special pen is it's
not<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:26.010> special<00:03:26.400> plan<00:03:26.519> I<00:03:26.580> just<00:03:26.790> put<00:03:26.970> my<00:03:27.180> eye

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
not a special plan I just put my eye

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.850 
not a special plan I just put my eye
pencil<00:03:27.900> in<00:03:27.989> an<00:03:28.650> empty<00:03:28.950> pool<00:03:29.160> like<00:03:29.790> Pigpen<00:03:30.860> body

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
pencil in an empty pool like Pigpen body

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.100 
pencil in an empty pool like Pigpen body
and<00:03:32.220> taped<00:03:32.700> it<00:03:32.940> because<00:03:33.510> it<00:03:33.660> was<00:03:33.690> getting

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
and taped it because it was getting

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.270 
and taped it because it was getting
through<00:03:34.230> short<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:34.620> can<00:03:34.799> hold<00:03:35.040> it<00:03:35.130> properly

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
through short and I can hold it properly

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.390 
through short and I can hold it properly
so<00:03:35.970> it's<00:03:36.120> really<00:03:36.269> nothing<00:03:36.510> special<00:03:36.660> just

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
so it's really nothing special just

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.580 
so it's really nothing special just
doing<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.489> face<00:03:38.670> now<00:03:38.940> with<00:03:39.299> the<00:03:40.290> teeth<00:03:40.470> and

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
dark almost black but one important

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.789 
dark almost black but one important
thing<00:03:54.239> to<00:03:54.420> remember<00:03:54.570> is<00:03:54.840> that<00:03:54.870> your<00:03:55.410> creatures

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
thing to remember is that your creatures

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.759 
thing to remember is that your creatures
usually<00:03:56.100> have<00:03:56.280> some<00:03:56.610> sort<00:03:56.640> of<00:03:56.970> tongue<00:03:57.299> or<00:03:57.769> like

something<00:03:59.100> in<00:03:59.370> their<00:03:59.519> mouth<00:03:59.670> it's<00:03:59.910> not<00:04:00.060> just<00:04:00.269> a

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
something in their mouth it's not just a

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.840 
something in their mouth it's not just a
black<00:04:00.630> empty<00:04:01.049> hole<00:04:01.260> and<00:04:01.530> if<00:04:02.459> you<00:04:02.549> color<00:04:02.760> it

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
black empty hole and if you color it

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.240 
black empty hole and if you color it
completely<00:04:03.750> black<00:04:04.080> then

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
completely black then

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.820 
completely black then
the<00:04:05.820> teeth<00:04:06.000> will<00:04:06.150> get<00:04:06.300> lost<00:04:06.540> because<00:04:06.870> they're

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
the teeth will get lost because they're

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.460 
the teeth will get lost because they're
just<00:04:08.220> there<00:04:08.550> will<00:04:08.670> just<00:04:08.700> be<00:04:08.910> too<00:04:09.120> small<00:04:09.360> so<00:04:10.080> if

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
just there will just be too small so if

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.200 
just there will just be too small so if
that<00:04:10.530> happens<00:04:11.040> it's<00:04:11.190> good<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.550> give<00:04:12.000> each

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210 
that happens it's good to give each

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.820 
that happens it's good to give each
tooth<00:04:12.450> a<00:04:12.570> highlight<00:04:12.960> even<00:04:13.380> though<00:04:13.500> there's<00:04:13.680> no

decorations or whatever but

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.590 
decorations or whatever but
yeah<00:05:39.930> this<00:05:40.650> drawing<00:05:40.920> took<00:05:41.250> about<00:05:41.370> two<00:05:41.850> and<00:05:42.030> two

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
yeah this drawing took about two and two

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.850 
yeah this drawing took about two and two
hours<00:05:42.870> and<00:05:43.050> 20<00:05:43.290> minutes<00:05:43.440> and<00:05:45.380> then<00:05:46.380> go<00:05:46.560> into<00:05:46.710> a

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
hours and 20 minutes and then go into a

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.440 
hours and 20 minutes and then go into a
lot<00:05:47.070> of<00:05:47.100> extreme<00:05:47.520> detail<00:05:47.790> with<00:05:48.150> it<00:05:48.270> just

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.450 
lot of extreme detail with it just

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:49.910 
lot of extreme detail with it just
because<00:05:48.600> there<00:05:48.870> wasn't<00:05:49.050> really<00:05:49.230> much<00:05:49.380> room

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:49.920 
because there wasn't really much room

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.300 
because there wasn't really much room
for<00:05:50.280> detail<00:05:51.590> it's<00:05:52.590> still<00:05:52.800> a<00:05:52.860> nice<00:05:53.040> looking

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
for detail it's still a nice looking

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.610 
for detail it's still a nice looking
character<00:05:53.730> and<00:05:53.910> it's<00:05:54.030> still<00:05:54.240> fairly<00:05:55.110> complex

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
character and it's still fairly complex

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.560 
character and it's still fairly complex
considering<00:05:56.340> everything<00:05:56.580> but<00:05:56.940> for<00:05:57.420> some

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
considering everything but for some

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:58.970 
considering everything but for some
reason<00:05:57.900> it<00:05:57.990> it's<00:05:58.200> going<00:05:58.560> pretty<00:05:58.680> fast

00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:58.980 
reason it it's going pretty fast

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.610 
reason it it's going pretty fast
nowadays<00:05:59.250> especially<00:05:59.670> since<00:06:00.270> I<00:06:00.570> got<00:06:00.870> the<00:06:01.050> new

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:01.620 
nowadays especially since I got the new

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.480 
nowadays especially since I got the new
prismacolors<00:06:03.770> before<00:06:04.770> I<00:06:04.800> used<00:06:05.100> to<00:06:05.220> go<00:06:05.340> for

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
prismacolors before I used to go for

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.100 
prismacolors before I used to go for
like<00:06:05.640> four<00:06:06.210> hours<00:06:06.240> and<00:06:06.690> I'm<00:06:06.750> drawing<00:06:06.960> like

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
like four hours and I'm drawing like

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.020 
like four hours and I'm drawing like
this<00:06:07.260> but<00:06:07.530> it's<00:06:07.920> just<00:06:08.160> so<00:06:08.280> easy<00:06:08.310> with<00:06:08.700> personal

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
this but it's just so easy with personal

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.400 
this but it's just so easy with personal
colors<00:06:09.330> once<00:06:09.510> you<00:06:09.600> get<00:06:09.690> used<00:06:09.870> to<00:06:09.930> them<00:06:10.050> like

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:10.410 
colors once you get used to them like

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.370 
colors once you get used to them like
shading<00:06:10.860> takes<00:06:11.160> no<00:06:11.430> time<00:06:11.610> at<00:06:11.670> all<00:06:11.820> and<00:06:12.810> I

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
shading takes no time at all and I

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.890 
shading takes no time at all and I
change<00:06:13.680> the<00:06:13.980> position<00:06:14.700> of<00:06:14.760> the<00:06:14.820> squid<00:06:15.180> from

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
change the position of the squid from

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.780 
change the position of the squid from
the<00:06:16.020> original<00:06:16.380> figurine<00:06:16.860> reference<00:06:17.550> thing

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:17.790 
the original figurine reference thing

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.090 
the original figurine reference thing
because<00:06:18.120> it<00:06:19.050> doesn't<00:06:19.320> look<00:06:19.410> very<00:06:19.440> dynamic

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 
because it doesn't look very dynamic

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:21.770 
because it doesn't look very dynamic
there<00:06:20.280> it<00:06:20.460> looked<00:06:20.700> like<00:06:20.850> it<00:06:21.030> was<00:06:21.150> just<00:06:21.360> sitting

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
there it looked like it was just sitting

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.140 
there it looked like it was just sitting
on<00:06:21.930> his<00:06:22.110> index<00:06:22.380> finger<00:06:22.650> so<00:06:23.100> I'm<00:06:23.370> I<00:06:23.640> gave<00:06:24.000> it<00:06:24.090> a

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
on his index finger so I'm I gave it a

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.220 
on his index finger so I'm I gave it a
position<00:06:24.570> where<00:06:24.720> it<00:06:24.780> looks<00:06:24.930> like<00:06:25.020> it's

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:25.230 
position where it looks like it's

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:26.630 
position where it looks like it's
actually<00:06:25.470> jumping<00:06:25.860> off<00:06:26.040> his<00:06:26.160> hand<00:06:26.430> and

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:26.640 
actually jumping off his hand and

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:33.650 
actually jumping off his hand and
attacking<00:06:27.540> something<00:06:30.020> so<00:06:32.120> just<00:06:33.120> switching<00:06:33.540> it

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:33.660 
attacking something so just switching it

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.010 
attacking something so just switching it
up<00:06:33.720> a<00:06:33.900> bit<00:06:33.930> to<00:06:34.790> do<00:06:35.790> not<00:06:35.940> make<00:06:36.120> it<00:06:36.270> identical<00:06:36.690> to

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
up a bit to do not make it identical to

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.740 
up a bit to do not make it identical to
the<00:06:37.380> figurine<00:06:37.740> but<00:06:38.130> the<00:06:38.280> poses<00:06:38.790> is<00:06:39.090> pretty

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:39.750 
the figurine but the poses is pretty

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.440 
the figurine but the poses is pretty
much<00:06:39.840> the<00:06:39.930> same<00:06:40.200> I<00:06:41.030> find<00:06:42.030> that<00:06:42.090> the<00:06:42.240> games

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:42.450 
much the same I find that the games

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.030 
much the same I find that the games
workshop<00:06:42.900> poses<00:06:43.320> their<00:06:43.470> figurines<00:06:43.860> and

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:44.040 
workshop poses their figurines and

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.960 
workshop poses their figurines and
rather<00:06:45.470> nice<00:06:46.470> poses<00:06:47.040> so<00:06:47.190> there's<00:06:47.400> really<00:06:47.790> no

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:47.970 
rather nice poses so there's really no

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:49.580 
rather nice poses so there's really no
reason<00:06:48.120> for<00:06:48.420> me<00:06:48.450> to<00:06:48.570> alternate<00:06:49.140> it<00:06:49.260> and

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:49.590 
reason for me to alternate it and

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:51.530 
reason for me to alternate it and
eventually<00:06:50.280> i<00:06:50.580> will<00:06:50.790> start<00:06:51.030> doing<00:06:51.330> like

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:51.540 
eventually i will start doing like

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.240 
eventually i will start doing like
multiple<00:06:51.990> characters<00:06:52.290> scenes<00:06:52.800> it's<00:06:53.040> just

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.250 
multiple characters scenes it's just

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.780 
multiple characters scenes it's just
they<00:06:54.180> take<00:06:54.419> a<00:06:54.450> long<00:06:54.630> time<00:06:54.930> because<00:06:55.230> I<00:06:55.590> i<00:06:55.790> I'm

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:56.790 
they take a long time because I i I'm

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.820 
they take a long time because I i I'm
sort<00:06:57.390> of<00:06:57.419> a<00:06:57.510> perfectionist<00:06:58.080> so<00:06:58.230> I<00:06:58.290> tend<00:06:58.560> to<00:06:58.680> go

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.830 
sort of a perfectionist so I tend to go

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.270 
sort of a perfectionist so I tend to go
into<00:06:58.980> a<00:06:59.100> lot<00:06:59.250> of<00:06:59.340> detail<00:06:59.669> on<00:07:00.000> everything<00:07:00.930> and

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.280 
into a lot of detail on everything and

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.909 
into a lot of detail on everything and
doing<00:07:02.280> a<00:07:02.370> battle<00:07:02.669> scene<00:07:02.910> it<00:07:03.060> would<00:07:03.360> take<00:07:03.570> just

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:03.919 
doing a battle scene it would take just

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:06.830 
doing a battle scene it would take just
and<00:07:04.919> crazy<00:07:05.669> amount<00:07:05.940> of<00:07:05.970> hours<00:07:06.330> it<00:07:06.600> would<00:07:06.660> take

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 
and crazy amount of hours it would take

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.210 
and crazy amount of hours it would take
like<00:07:06.990> six<00:07:07.440> seven<00:07:07.740> eight<00:07:07.890> hours<00:07:08.310> so<00:07:09.860> i'll<00:07:10.860> do<00:07:11.100> it

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.220 
like six seven eight hours so i'll do it

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.360 
like six seven eight hours so i'll do it
eventually<00:07:11.310> just<00:07:11.700> just<00:07:12.240> not<00:07:12.480> now<00:07:12.810> while<00:07:13.140> i'm

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:13.370 
eventually just just not now while i'm

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.830 
eventually just just not now while i'm
i'm<00:07:14.370> trying<00:07:14.700> to<00:07:14.820> put<00:07:14.970> our<00:07:15.060> videos<00:07:15.390> as<00:07:15.510> often<00:07:15.720> as
