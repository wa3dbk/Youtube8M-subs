00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.910
 welcome to radiation docs.com I 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.549
 will introduce you as soon as possible 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.559
 flashpoint of bugs so it's a knife 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:18.000
 with an excellent place a system 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.279
 one-handed opening and closing 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.470
 with a detent that has a 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.359
 button on the skin nor so the first 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.730
 characteristic of this knife was 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.730
 as often with bugs the quality of the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.570
 blade to know that we are on a blade in 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.810
 stainless steel 420 hc so it's a 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.270
 high carbon steel which 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:42.149
 will give us a sharp blade so 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.500
 with part 10 parts in your which will 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.030
 have a very good resistance 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.559
 also to wear and abrasion 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.539
 the second interesting point is the 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.420
 ease of opening and closing 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.149
 since we are on a craon system here 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.089
 which is simply manipulated at once 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.710
 to close the blade and to open it and 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:04.949
 so a notch that is very reliable 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.700
 it does not move once open it does not 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.400
 not suffer once closed 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.380
 here we are on a steel handle 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.590
 with parties like so what will 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.950
 give a good grip 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.770
 and then we also have a system of 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.640
 carabiners to fix the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.220
 knife on a backpack clip for the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.659
 fasten to the belt 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.570
 and then last details for the 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.210
 emergency situations we have here a small 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.689
 bottle opener so here we are on a 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.960
 knife that we will choose first for the 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.880
 good quality of the blade next 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.040
 also for its ease of use 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.180
 knowing that at bug we have some water 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.950
 who gets closer a little bit that they 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.990
 have their paul wing that's going to be a 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.299
 little bit lighter so here if we 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.969
 would rather have a knife a little more a 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.500
 little heavier it'll be this one if 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.700
 it's to give the streams have rather 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.700
 choose the polt raid
