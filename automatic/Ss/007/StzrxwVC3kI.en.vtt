00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.940
 the second part of the video repair gear 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:13.049
 kia sorento 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:16.710
 2 2004 here it is a car here it is here 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:27.599
 reducer about the internal grenade I already 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:29.119
 shot only and cleaned made size 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.470
 grinded 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:35.809
 Here is actually in fact that on it 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:42.020
 coiled metal from differential case 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:46.219
 This is generally very hard to remove. 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:48.719
 removed very hard and because there 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:51.379
 tempered on cooked they tempered 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.379
 very much when 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:59.820
 Strong and stucco 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.559
 Now here he is himself very well the size of the sleeve 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.180
 I won't tell you what to do with 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.360
 Individually how much is broken 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.850
 Especially the external size is well seen 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.430
 that she doesn't 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.549
 slightly smaller amount wall almost 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.320
 divides in half but it is slightly less than 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:21.450
 the outer part is about 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.210
 about the hardships or gap 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.740
 I wonâ€™t say the installer either 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.130
 should only be too small 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.360
 did as I don't know which mouths and 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.520
 too big should not be too 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:42.090
 because it's just the trouble you for this 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:44.300
 from alinka flows left dates with a pistol 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.060
 tightened 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:52.070
 so here it happens that this 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:54.920
 covered this vacuum know what 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.100
 the company in the Urals that the membrane which 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.400
 It includes automatic brake but 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.290
 simultaneously with the inclusion of distributed 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.440
 connecting razdatki front axle 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:10.940
 there is an electric motor 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:16.030
 includes here what's the most thing 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.030
 the main well we will put new bearings 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:32.690
 I can't read the numbers so I will read 001 182 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:37.640
 7350 in my opinion in the same gate before they 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:42.740
 same that's what 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:49.910
 what to look for attention 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:52.790
 that the left right fingers are not they are different 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:56.480
 understandable here as finger centering 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:00.050
 who like them for training can 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:02.360
 when adjusting and they adjust for 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.489
 engage the contact patch mainly it was time 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.220
 that's their most important thing is not to confuse here 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:10.400
 we took them out like that now back 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.110
 we get 1 1 on the left is the other on the right 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.690
 it is very important not to confuse 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:20.300
 otherwise the pair will scream there in short 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.000
 that leads in trouble something will be a hundred 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.100
 percent can get on big like 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.350
 would 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:32.960
 Now we will assemble the gearbox possible with 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.940
 him and the second video about the installation as it were 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:40.970
 but there is nothing difficult there is already 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:46.960
 the third will be the video will change the gland yet 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:49.550
 several times already changed until 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.640
 understand that this is due to the backlash of this 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:57.530
 huge dad and he after the trip 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:04:01.540
 the man drove. 2000 kilometers even 3d 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:04.850
 Tatars here pay a half back here 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:08.660
 to more than three thousand kilometers and he's like 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:15.440
 would have crashed at all in the trash in general such 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:18.980
 that's it means setting it well what are we 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:26.510
 there we stick a little to the left, let's forget about the fairy 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:28.250
 This is not the case when it means 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.360
 only so much to the left you need to unscrew 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:35.630
 ball top spoil them on the rail 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.229
 By the way, I do not tear off without giving water to 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.450
 river 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:48.770
 do not tear off the chips otherwise 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:50.600
 otherwise it will not spin 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.000
 fucking spin the wheel once like 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.830
 before easy 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.820
 Good luck to everyone on the road 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.820
 do not break
