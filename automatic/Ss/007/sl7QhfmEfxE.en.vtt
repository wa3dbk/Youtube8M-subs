explanatory if you do have any dramas
feel<00:02:39.560> free<00:02:39.800> to<00:02:39.830> ask<00:02:40.190> but<00:02:41.000> it's<00:02:41.330> always<00:02:41.480> better

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
feel free to ask but it's always better

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.300 
feel free to ask but it's always better
if<00:02:42.020> you<00:02:42.140> learn<00:02:42.290> these<00:02:42.470> things<00:02:42.680> yourself<00:02:43.040> in<00:02:43.160> my

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
if you learn these things yourself in my

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.520 
if you learn these things yourself in my
opinion<00:02:43.640> because<00:02:43.970> then<00:02:44.900> you<00:02:45.050> retain<00:02:45.380> that

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
opinion because then you retain that

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.310 
opinion because then you retain that
knowledge<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:46.930> everything<00:02:47.930> works<00:02:48.110> much

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
knowledge and everything works much

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.530 
knowledge and everything works much
better<00:02:48.350> for<00:02:48.620> you<00:02:48.890> so<00:02:49.100> in<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:50.150> radio

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
better for you so in the radio

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.240 
better for you so in the radio
programming<00:02:50.960> go<00:02:51.170> to<00:02:51.230> your<00:02:51.410> just<00:02:51.650> list<00:02:51.860> and<00:02:52.130> go

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
programming go to your just list and go

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.730 
programming go to your just list and go
to<00:02:52.310> flaps<00:02:53.260> as<00:02:54.260> you<00:02:54.410> can<00:02:54.560> see<00:02:54.740> there<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.820> flaps

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
to flaps as you can see there the flaps

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.410 
to flaps as you can see there the flaps
for<00:02:57.740> normal<00:02:58.100> you<00:02:58.580> should<00:02:58.730> operate<00:02:59.150> so<00:02:59.300> for

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
for normal you should operate so for

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.390 
for normal you should operate so for
your<00:02:59.510> flux<00:02:59.720> which<00:02:59.870> obviously<00:03:00.320> for<00:03:01.010> normal<00:03:01.280> is

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
your flux which obviously for normal is

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.330 
your flux which obviously for normal is
zero<00:03:01.640> now<00:03:02.180> got<00:03:02.390> it<00:03:02.480> for<00:03:02.600> lender<00:03:02.900> 80%<00:03:03.590> you<00:03:04.190> can

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
zero now got it for lender 80% you can

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.670 
zero now got it for lender 80% you can
play<00:03:04.520> with<00:03:04.700> that<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:04.970> adjust<00:03:05.330> it<00:03:05.510> as<00:03:05.780> you<00:03:06.440> need

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
play with that and adjust it as you need

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.780 
play with that and adjust it as you need
from<00:03:07.040> see<00:03:07.310> fit

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
from see fit

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.110 
from see fit
I<00:03:07.820> have<00:03:08.540> it<00:03:08.660> set<00:03:08.840> at<00:03:08.930> 80%<00:03:09.580> just<00:03:10.580> for<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:10.880> test

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
I have it set at 80% just for the test

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.140 
I have it set at 80% just for the test
so<00:03:12.020> that<00:03:12.230> it<00:03:12.380> didn't<00:03:12.740> you<00:03:13.460> know<00:03:13.490> Bond<00:03:13.880> or

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
so that it didn't you know Bond or

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.200 
so that it didn't you know Bond or
otherwise<00:03:14.600> bugger<00:03:14.960> up<00:03:15.200> my<00:03:15.350> servos<00:03:15.800> and<00:03:16.210> make

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
otherwise bugger up my servos and make

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.910 
otherwise bugger up my servos and make
things<00:03:17.420> go<00:03:17.690> ping<00:03:18.050> and<00:03:18.260> break<00:03:18.500> and<00:03:18.710> snap

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
things go ping and break and snap

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.770 
things go ping and break and snap
everywhere<00:03:19.370> and<00:03:19.820> it<00:03:20.030> worked<00:03:20.210> very<00:03:20.300> well<00:03:20.540> of

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
everywhere and it worked very well of

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.330 
everywhere and it worked very well of
that<00:03:20.930> so<00:03:21.320> I'm<00:03:21.440> going<00:03:21.620> to<00:03:21.680> leave<00:03:21.830> it<00:03:21.980> there<00:03:22.130> I

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
that so I'm going to leave it there I

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.040 
that so I'm going to leave it there I
haven't<00:03:22.850> flown<00:03:22.940> it<00:03:23.240> at<00:03:23.390> that<00:03:23.540> yet<00:03:23.750> but<00:03:23.900> it

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
haven't flown it at that yet but it

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.190 
haven't flown it at that yet but it
certainly<00:03:24.230> worked<00:03:24.620> well<00:03:24.860> on<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.520> test<00:03:25.820> bench

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
certainly worked well on the test bench

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.510 
certainly worked well on the test bench
the<00:03:27.200> next<00:03:27.440> thing<00:03:27.590> we<00:03:27.680> do<00:03:27.830> is<00:03:27.950> you<00:03:28.040> go<00:03:28.160> down<00:03:28.340> to

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
the next thing we do is you go down to

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.050 
the next thing we do is you go down to
mix<00:03:28.730> one<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:30.040> as<00:03:31.040> you<00:03:31.100> can<00:03:31.310> see<00:03:31.370> we<00:03:31.880> have

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
mix one and as you can see we have

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.500 
mix one and as you can see we have
rudder<00:03:32.300> two<00:03:32.480> flat<00:03:32.750> active<00:03:34.030> down<00:03:35.030> right<00:03:35.300> there

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
rudder two flat active down right there

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.240 
rudder two flat active down right there
plus<00:03:35.690> one<00:03:35.900> hundred<00:03:36.230> percent<00:03:36.350> and<00:03:36.680> our<00:03:36.800> up<00:03:36.980> rate

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
plus one hundred percent and our up rate

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.270 
plus one hundred percent and our up rate
at<00:03:37.430> plus<00:03:37.670> 100<00:03:38.150> percent<00:03:38.480> and<00:03:38.690> I<00:03:38.780> switch<00:03:39.050> on<00:03:39.280> the

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
at plus 100 percent and I switch on the

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.050 
at plus 100 percent and I switch on the
trim<00:03:40.610> is<00:03:40.820> inhibited<00:03:42.040> so<00:03:43.040> we'll<00:03:43.460> pause<00:03:43.670> this<00:03:43.910> if

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
trim is inhibited so we'll pause this if

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.600 
trim is inhibited so we'll pause this if
you<00:03:44.150> need<00:03:44.330> to<00:03:44.510> and<00:03:45.160> you<00:03:46.160> know<00:03:46.250> you<00:03:46.310> can<00:03:46.430> set

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
you need to and you know you can set

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.370 
you need to and you know you can set
your<00:03:46.670> radio<00:03:46.940> up<00:03:47.090> and<00:03:47.210> then<00:03:47.390> you<00:03:47.690> can<00:03:47.840> unpause

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
your radio up and then you can unpause

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.040 
your radio up and then you can unpause
it<00:03:48.590> and<00:03:48.710> go<00:03:49.340> on<00:03:49.370> with<00:03:49.610> it<00:03:49.760> with<00:03:50.210> my<00:03:50.240> dulcet

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
it and go on with it with my dulcet

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.620 
it and go on with it with my dulcet
tones<00:03:51.350> in<00:03:51.560> your<00:03:51.680> ear<00:03:52.030> so<00:03:53.030> then<00:03:53.180> we<00:03:53.330> go<00:03:53.480> from

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
tones in your ear so then we go from

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.199 
tones in your ear so then we go from
there<00:03:53.750> we<00:03:54.680> go<00:03:54.830> back<00:03:55.070> into<00:03:55.250> the<00:03:55.490> dust<00:03:55.880> list<00:03:56.090> we

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
there we go back into the dust list we

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.430 
there we go back into the dust list we
go<00:03:56.360> to<00:03:56.420> mix<00:03:56.660> to<00:03:57.220> amplify<00:03:58.220> the<00:03:58.400> mix<00:03:58.670> to<00:03:59.200> and<00:04:00.200> we

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
go to mix to amplify the mix to and we

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.460 
go to mix to amplify the mix to and we
have<00:04:00.590> flap<00:04:00.830> to<00:04:00.980> rudder<00:04:01.160> active<00:04:01.880> again<00:04:02.420> we<00:04:03.170> have

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
have flap to rudder active again we have

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.550 
have flap to rudder active again we have
our<00:04:03.770> rate<00:04:04.280> on<00:04:04.459> the<00:04:04.550> Left<00:04:04.790> 80<00:04:05.120> percent<00:04:05.600> I<00:04:05.900> wrote

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
our rate on the Left 80 percent I wrote

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.660 
our rate on the Left 80 percent I wrote
it<00:04:06.620> on<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.770> right<00:04:06.920> 100<00:04:07.310> now<00:04:07.430> basically

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
it on the right 100 now basically

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.340 
it on the right 100 now basically
adjusted<00:04:08.209> that<00:04:08.300> 100<00:04:08.660> operators<00:04:09.050> are<00:04:09.140> quite<00:04:09.320> a

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
adjusted that 100 operators are quite a

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.540 
adjusted that 100 operators are quite a
bit<00:04:09.590> and<00:04:09.740> it<00:04:09.830> seems<00:04:10.010> to<00:04:10.070> make<00:04:10.280> it<00:04:10.310> zero

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
bit and it seems to make it zero

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.850 
bit and it seems to make it zero
different<00:04:11.000> so<00:04:11.180> I<00:04:11.660> think<00:04:12.410> there's<00:04:12.709> something

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
different so I think there's something

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.020 
different so I think there's something
again<00:04:13.190> you're<00:04:13.280> gonna<00:04:13.370> have<00:04:13.459> to<00:04:13.640> play<00:04:13.820> with<00:04:14.000> a

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
again you're gonna have to play with a

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.120 
again you're gonna have to play with a
little<00:04:14.240> bit<00:04:14.390> you<00:04:15.170> switch<00:04:15.410> on<00:04:15.620> you<00:04:15.830> trim

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
little bit you switch on you trim

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.000
