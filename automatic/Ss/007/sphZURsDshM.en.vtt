 so I think really good economy is running 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.370

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.700

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.029
 I know that is especially on Oct 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:52.629

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.159
 Waterfalls can do 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.529
 God of Thunder save with 

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:24.019

 Townsend one last also speculation some feel 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.569
 To make up for it again, I checked 

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:09.969
 With that, the gap is only to be found in the big leagues 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.879
 another one 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:23.219

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:43.639
 I have to go with 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:45.520
 nothing comes 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.110
 Nasdaq scor is not just looking for 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.400
 and now you have to 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.400
 I do not want to be artificial at the moment 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.020

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.110
 and here are the poverty 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.110
 probably in high 

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:50.800
 comes the bill 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.800
 make with 100 percent 

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.279

 Customers and disabled people 

00:07:56.659 --> 00:07:59.659
 or just save 

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.789
 I did not like Coburg's symbolism 

00:08:07.789 --> 00:08:10.789
