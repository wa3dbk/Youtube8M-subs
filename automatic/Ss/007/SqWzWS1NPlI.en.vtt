00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
other than shits and giggles I decided

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.100 
other than shits and giggles I decided
to<00:00:34.920> switch<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.370> situation<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.660> Patriots

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
to switch the situation so the Patriots

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.450 
to switch the situation so the Patriots
have<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.380> ball<00:00:37.559> at<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.770> one-yard<00:00:38.190> line

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
have the ball at the one-yard line

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.250 
have the ball at the one-yard line
and<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:39.030> Seahawks<00:00:39.239> are<00:00:39.540> trying<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.899> stop<00:00:40.140> them

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
and the Seahawks are trying to stop them

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.590 
and the Seahawks are trying to stop them
from<00:00:40.320> scoring<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:41.070> also<00:00:41.790> switched<00:00:42.120> Russell

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
from scoring I also switched Russell

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.840 
from scoring I also switched Russell
Wilson's<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.230> Malcom<00:00:43.559> Butler's<00:00:43.890> roles<00:00:44.160> so

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
Wilson's and Malcom Butler's roles so

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.279 
Wilson's and Malcom Butler's roles so
Russell<00:00:45.210> Wilson<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.660> now<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.899> undrafted

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289

you<00:03:15.269> know<00:03:15.420> I<00:03:15.450> thought<00:03:15.900> about<00:03:15.959> you<00:03:16.769> know

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
you know I thought about you know

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.460 
you know I thought about you know
playing<00:03:17.489> as<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:18.030> Patriots<00:03:18.600> so<00:03:18.989> I<00:03:19.019> could<00:03:19.290> make

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
playing as the Patriots so I could make

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.229 
playing as the Patriots so I could make
sure<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.830> ball<00:03:20.040> is<00:03:20.070> always<00:03:20.519> thrown<00:03:21.060> at

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
sure the ball is always thrown at

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.080 
sure the ball is always thrown at
Russell<00:03:21.510> Wilson<00:03:21.890> but<00:03:22.890> I<00:03:23.190> felt<00:03:23.790> like<00:03:23.940> that

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
Russell Wilson but I felt like that

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.240 
Russell Wilson but I felt like that
would<00:03:24.239> end<00:03:24.360> up<00:03:24.450> being<00:03:24.660> too<00:03:24.900> easy<00:03:24.930> but<00:03:25.890> now<00:03:26.070> I'm

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
would end up being too easy but now I'm

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.770 
would end up being too easy but now I'm
starting<00:03:26.489> to<00:03:26.670> kind<00:03:26.910> of<00:03:27.030> regret<00:03:27.450> that<00:03:27.600> decision

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
starting to kind of regret that decision

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.780 
starting to kind of regret that decision
because<00:03:28.650> even<00:03:29.070> though<00:03:29.160> this<00:03:29.340> makes<00:03:29.610> more

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
because even though this makes more

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.790 
because even though this makes more
sense<00:03:30.150> from<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.600> challenge<00:03:30.989> perspective<00:03:31.590> it

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
sense from the challenge perspective it

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.190 
sense from the challenge perspective it
still<00:03:32.670> would<00:03:32.850> have<00:03:32.880> been<00:03:32.970> so<00:03:33.330> much<00:03:33.570> easier<00:03:33.630> to

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
still would have been so much easier to

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.610 
still would have been so much easier to
play<00:03:34.380> as<00:03:34.440> a<00:03:34.560> Patriots<00:03:35.100> oh<00:03:38.300> my<00:03:39.300> God<00:03:39.540> he's<00:03:39.900> going

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
to go oh the way too bad that's not the

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.050 
to go oh the way too bad that's not the
challenge<00:03:45.000> I'd<00:03:45.810> be<00:03:46.410> done<00:03:46.650> already<00:03:46.680> oh<00:03:47.310> how<00:03:48.030> I
