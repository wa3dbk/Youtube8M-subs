00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
and this near this bond as you can see I

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.410 
and this near this bond as you can see I
got<00:00:32.399> some<00:00:32.550> gameplay<00:00:32.880> here<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.180> played<00:00:33.329> on

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
got some gameplay here and played on

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.810 
got some gameplay here and played on
easy<00:00:33.450> but<00:00:33.930> same<00:00:34.800> amount<00:00:35.100> of<00:00:35.190> bullets<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.579> kill

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
easy but same amount of bullets to kill

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.510 
easy but same amount of bullets to kill
uneasy<00:00:36.660> compared<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.469> original<00:00:37.710> but<00:00:38.489> I

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
uneasy compared to original but I

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.520 
uneasy compared to original but I
definitely<00:00:38.790> suggest<00:00:39.180> using<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.840> double<00:00:40.350> tap

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
definitely suggest using a double tap

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.110 
definitely suggest using a double tap
because<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:41.010> gun<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.309> very<00:00:41.520> slow<00:00:41.940> rate<00:00:41.969> of

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
because this gun is a very slow rate of

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.610 
because this gun is a very slow rate of
fire<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.660> double<00:00:42.989> tap<00:00:43.110> will<00:00:43.230> definitely<00:00:43.530> help

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
fire and double tap will definitely help

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.170 
fire and double tap will definitely help
you<00:00:43.710> out<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:43.950> killing<00:00:44.219> zombies<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.550> lot<00:00:44.730> faster

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
you out in killing zombies a lot faster

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.450 
you out in killing zombies a lot faster
and<00:00:45.539> also<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.230> would<00:00:46.530> definitely<00:00:46.739> suggest<00:00:47.070> just

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
and also I would definitely suggest just

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.889 
and also I would definitely suggest just
training<00:00:47.700> around<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.030> area<00:00:48.239> where<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.390> PDW

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
training around the area where the PDW

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.569 
training around the area where the PDW
is<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.110> get<00:00:49.260> more<00:00:49.440> ammo<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.920> keep<00:00:50.280> killing

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
is to get more ammo and keep killing

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.950 
is to get more ammo and keep killing
enemies<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.120> keep<00:00:51.300> getting<00:00:51.539> more<00:00:51.660> ammo

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
enemies and keep getting more ammo

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.660 
enemies and keep getting more ammo
because<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.289> gun<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.469> very<00:00:52.829> good<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.309> I

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
because this gun is very good and I

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.819 
because this gun is very good and I
definitely<00:00:54.030> suggest<00:00:54.270> using<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:54.930> gun<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.680> up

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
definitely suggest using this gun so up

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.580 
definitely suggest using this gun so up
next<00:00:55.860> is<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:57.149> 94<00:00:57.600> pack<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> punched<00:00:58.320> and

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
next is the and 94 pack a punched and

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.819 
next is the and 94 pack a punched and
this<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.949> called<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.399> actuated<00:00:59.969> neutralizer

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
this is called the actuated neutralizer

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.830 
this is called the actuated neutralizer
94,000<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.190> this<00:01:02.340> gun<00:01:02.579> has<00:01:02.609> 50<00:01:03.329> bullets<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.780> a

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
94,000 and this gun has 50 bullets in a

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.200 
94,000 and this gun has 50 bullets in a
clip<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.080> 600<00:01:04.890> extra<00:01:05.189> bullets<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.670> your<00:01:05.790> pocket

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
clip in 600 extra bullets in your pocket

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.149 
clip in 600 extra bullets in your pocket
so<00:01:06.420> it's<00:01:06.630> very<00:01:06.960> good<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.380> got<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.590> lot<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:07.920> ammo

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
so it's very good it got a lot of ammo

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.850 
so it's very good it got a lot of ammo
with<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.790> also<00:01:09.060> very<00:01:09.479> powerful<00:01:10.110> very<00:01:10.619> high

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
with it is also very powerful very high

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.100 
with it is also very powerful very high
damage<00:01:11.100> weapon<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.880> minimal<00:01:12.330> recoil<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.990> I
