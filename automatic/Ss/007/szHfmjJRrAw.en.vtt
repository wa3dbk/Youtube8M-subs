alone and they all were unanimous and
their<00:03:24.610> feeling<00:03:25.060> that<00:03:25.090> he<00:03:25.450> is<00:03:25.570> not<00:03:25.720> only<00:03:25.780> a<00:03:25.960> huge

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.260 

such<00:04:07.500> a<00:04:07.620> cliche<00:04:08.100> expression<00:04:08.760> but<00:04:08.880> he<00:04:09.000> really

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
such a cliche expression but he really

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.570 
such a cliche expression but he really
