00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 and in this week's video I'm going to 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.940
 tell them about the best six concerts 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.770
 to whom he has gone in all my life was 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.570
 difficult to choose only six 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.400
 concerts but I hope you like it 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.400
 smarter 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.150
 ah 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.100
 or what transa mais I had not seen 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.750
 before starting with the video of this 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.970
 week I have a pretty message 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.470
 important to tell them to crochet 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.360
 stamp I know that I always have to give them 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.949
 messages but this is very important 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.989
 as many of you know that in the 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.239
 week makati I wanted my top ten of 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.610
 youtubers top ten in which it appears 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.339
 khatib that youtuber that makes reviews 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.890
 of manga and anime unfortunately on youtube 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.420
 he just closed the channel 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.460
 unjustifiably the pretext was that 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.490
 I was spamming 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.619
 and you know how YouTube is sometimes 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.600
 Unfortunately, this was 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.670
 the reason why youtube closed the 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.550
 channel so I would like us to support 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.440
 to active you and subscribing us to your 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.720
 new channel because the truth is that if 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.220
 makes pretty good videos and I'm going to 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.869
 ask wholeheartedly for corn to be 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.000

 they would appreciate it too much because it knows how to be but 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.460
 YouTube closure channel 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.560
 but well, it 's time to move on to 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.310
 this week's theme 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.310
 10 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.860
 I've been to quite a few concerts in my life 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.960
 and it was difficult for me to choose six concerts 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.600
 that have marked me but after 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.159
 think about it carefully I think finally 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.650
 I managed to choose the best six 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:55.550
 concerts that I've gone like this is that 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:57.830
 with you my best six concerts 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.680
 limp bizkit in the palace of the 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.020
 sports year 2001 let's say that this was 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.030
 the first metal concert arquette 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.520
 order the truth is that it was very small 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.350
 and I went with my mom and my cousins back and 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.820
 I do not know my mom liked the 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.920
 linguist the truth was a concert 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.050
 quite emotional country back then 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.300
 I was traumatized with limp bizkit and the 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.040
 new goal and beautiful era I think the best 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.080
 extension of that concert outside of 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.069
 rowling someone remembers the waves 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.739
 of limp bizkit or I'm too old 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.530
 and stratovarius in the flying circus year 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.510
 2003 let's say that this was the first 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.129
 Metal concert I went to yet 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.260
 I remember when I was trained in 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:37.420
 row was pretty excited to see 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.060
 a stratum several for the first time live 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.799
 as a curious fact in this concert I went 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.540
 with my first girlfriend for those who follow 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.670
 my videos have long known that 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.139
 my first girlfriend was the keyboard player of my 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.000
 first band with it and with which 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:50.379
 I went to the concert of extract is worth more 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.750
 those of the low this concert was 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:54.849
 quite memorable despite 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.680
 that came strata but 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.540
 touch but that does not matter because I was 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.299
 a move double drum procedure and 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.919
 of many keyboard solos and and good 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.230
 as a curious fact, that's where I had 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:07.329
 my first fights in a relationship and 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.600
 well, something quite strange but still 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:12.990
 enjoy the concert 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.440
 Maroon Five at the Arena Mexico 2013 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.440
 but not 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.420
 or 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.880
 and that's when I really became a fan of 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.130
 manu file the only bad thing about this 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.530
 concert is that it took me two hours in 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.770
 leave the parking lot is not kidding 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.910
 if it took me two hours to go out with 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.580
 prince I'll see you in the auditorium 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.560
 national year 2006 I remember that it was the 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.330
 the first time I went to bernardi the theater 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.550
 live the truth that I was quite 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.260
 quite excited especially because 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.730
 was the octave guide and also 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.160
 they were playing songs of their 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.080
 previous albums which moved me 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.180
 more in the first concert where I 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.920
 I knew all the songs so 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.960
 my throat was destroyed and that night 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.410
 just like my pockets because in that 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:04.590
 concert I spent all my savings 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.660
 with link to and stanic text in the forum 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.970
 sun in the year 2002 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.070
 this concert was too much is in that 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.070
 then that invented was fashionable 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:17.160
 bands like potato roach curling vischi and 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.930
 thus they were in the full height of the moment 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.810
 for this concert between with a ticket 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.030
 of cougars america 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.580
 houston it turns out that the drummer 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.950
 I knew someone who knew someone 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.510
 that he knew someone who was talking to him 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.160
 type of the ticket and that was how 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.800
 we went with cougar tickets 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.289
 America was very turbid and green but 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.529
 interns 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:39.819
 metallica in the forum sun year 2009 I think 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:41.860
 that this has been one of the concerts 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:43.330
 more symbolic to those who help lives 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.919
 Well, not only did I go with the members 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.839
 from my first band with whom 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.789
 we play metallica covers but 

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:50.349
 I was also almost ahead of 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:52.479
 the same members of metallica 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:54.309
 face to face with all of 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:56.110
 metallica and best of all is that 

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:58.089
 they played all the songs that to me 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.129
 I always liked them and they omitted 

00:04:58.089 --> 00:05:02.680
 play any song of sanse in jr 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:04.119
 although I did not like anything but good that 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.369
 it's another subject 

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:08.259
 also a live dvd was recorded from that 

00:05:06.369 --> 00:05:10.659
 concert here in Mexico because I know that 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:12.339
 if they were very wrong and they are old and 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:14.469
 what you want but do not stop 

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:17.080
 be metallic and the truth is that that 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:18.699
 concert was like more spiritual for 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.740
 all and up to now those have been the 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:22.809
 best 6 concerts I've ever 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.849
 assisted in my whole life what are the 

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:26.319
 your mails leave here in the 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:28.629
 box of comments which have been 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:31.779
 the best 6 concerts to those who have 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:35.639
 assisted who why but good is the 

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:35.639
 moment to move to indecisions 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.009
 and this time I will recommend 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:46.770
 a tree or a little more 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:48.900
 spiritual or at least for me it is the 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:50.520
 song is called faith wise and talks about 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.979
 an issue that personally I 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.749
 fascinated by astral travel and 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:56.580
 lucid dreams as you always know 

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:58.020
 that I'm going to leave a link here and 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.089
 if you can not see it because they are 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.009
 profitable or on some mobile device 

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:04.589
 You can find it in the box 

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:08.550
 video description 

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:10.690
