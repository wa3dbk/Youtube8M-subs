 quiet very good player even come 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:55.110
 an offensive frame player 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.730
 my field tidy another half field 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.200
 also offensive to frame is a 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:04.500
 practitioner has an 8 - ball control 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:10.679
 80 passengers dribble is good 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:15.060

 own ecb is he is also a player 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:38.390
 good and cheap for those starting there 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.390
 it's an offensive weapon 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:53.040
 now let's stop in the middle of the law 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:57.440
 but of contention we have my car of 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:04.950
 containment in the delegation is we also have 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:07.049
 mba 87 speed 3g balance 86 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.959
 drive 85 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:14.340
 he is also a player who can be 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:20.010
 used as a defensive and it is a medium 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:23.160
 field beyond claw that is delivered 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.700
 in the game it 's really good 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:32.190
 I take a lot of balls to give good passes. 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:35.070
 the chance of him 81 speed 81 by his 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:38.410
 physique is a very strong player is 81 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:41.500
 on top of the r3 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.810
 and has a bit of agility too but the 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.410
 differential of less than the physical force is 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:50.380
 very good for a ball and get out in the 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:54.790
 game link 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:57.160
 another half field and neither connection is the 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:01.930
 Ricardo the fact 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:09.880
 it has 11 2084 speed 80 balance 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:11.620
 83 resistance 78 also a player of 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.040
 physical strength 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.380
 it can also be used as a steering wheel 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:23.890
 but his original position there is a fear 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:28.150
 link a containment beyond 80's of peace 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:32.410
 also of speed he is a player 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:35.070
 very strong and very good to give 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:41.440
 one closed in the middle field 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:47.190
 the other is a rabbi, he has strength and 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:53.040
 left 82 speed 81 blast 876 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:56.590
 level 83 to 76 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:59.800
 he is forecast to launch 80 has 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:04.900
 agility also 79 you did that he did not 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:09.840
 He's so tall, but you can play with him. 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:12.700
 he had a very good player maggi is 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.950
 differentiated in the midfield to make the 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.950
 Link 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:22.540
 He can play the wheel both he and 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:27.550
 ricardo speaks of 1 mb and a steering wheel of 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:30.120
 origin here indicated that in gaga has 84 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.729

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:43.320
 and he has resistance 82 and the condition 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.780
 His physics are good 7 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:50.639
 is a player that I indicate there also good 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:55.040
 is cheap and we will show that the values 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:06:03.110
 the value of each player stevanovic 532 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:10.530
