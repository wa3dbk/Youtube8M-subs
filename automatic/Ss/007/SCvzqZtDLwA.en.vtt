00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
thing I've learned about parking here is

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.259 
thing I've learned about parking here is
that<00:03:14.910> people<00:03:15.829> okay<00:03:16.829> except<00:03:17.129> on<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.370> exception

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
that people okay except on the exception

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.309 
that people okay except on the exception
because<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.599> street<00:03:18.840> people<00:03:18.959> aren't<00:03:19.230> doing

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
because the street people aren't doing

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.849 
because the street people aren't doing
this<00:03:19.560> but<00:03:19.980> they<00:03:20.099> always<00:03:20.280> turn<00:03:20.669> their<00:03:21.209> wheels

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
this but they always turn their wheels

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:25.129 
this but they always turn their wheels
now<00:03:22.859> I<00:03:23.190> think<00:03:23.609> people<00:03:24.030> do<00:03:24.299> this<00:03:24.419> on<00:03:24.569> hills<00:03:24.900> so

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
now I think people do this on hills so

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:26.870 
now I think people do this on hills so
that<00:03:25.260> if<00:03:25.349> your<00:03:25.500> car<00:03:25.799> actually<00:03:26.040> rolls<00:03:26.609> down<00:03:26.849> the

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
that if your car actually rolls down the

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.449 
that if your car actually rolls down the
hill<00:03:27.319> they<00:03:28.319> like<00:03:28.560> will<00:03:28.739> stop<00:03:29.040> it'll<00:03:29.310> hit<00:03:29.400> a

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
hill they like will stop it'll hit a

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.430 
hill they like will stop it'll hit a
curve<00:03:29.790> right<00:03:30.120> and<00:03:30.870> you<00:03:30.959> don't<00:03:31.109> want<00:03:31.230> to<00:03:31.319> look

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440
