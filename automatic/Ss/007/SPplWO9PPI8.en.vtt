if<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.430> guys<00:00:44.670> didn't<00:00:45.149> see<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.270> yet<00:00:45.539> youtube

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
if you guys didn't see that yet youtube

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.740 
if you guys didn't see that yet youtube
it<00:00:46.230> right<00:00:46.379> now<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.789> the<00:00:47.789> last<00:00:48.000> time<00:00:48.239> we<00:00:48.480> always

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
it right now and the last time we always

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.779 
it right now and the last time we always
thought<00:00:48.960> was<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.770> first<00:00:50.039> fight<00:00:50.340> he<00:00:50.610> had<00:00:50.640> with

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
thought was the first fight he had with

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.689 
thought was the first fight he had with
Danny<00:00:51.329> Garcia<00:00:51.829> where<00:00:52.829> he<00:00:53.160> lost<00:00:53.460> by<00:00:54.000> decision<00:00:54.390> I

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
Danny Garcia where he lost by decision I

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.389 
Danny Garcia where he lost by decision I
think<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.510> same<00:00:57.719> thing<00:00:57.960> will<00:00:58.170> happen

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
think that the same thing will happen

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.400 
think that the same thing will happen
again<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.609> this<00:01:00.000> fight<00:01:00.239> compared<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
again in this fight compared to the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.160 
again in this fight compared to the
first<00:01:01.559> fight<00:01:01.820> Danny<00:01:02.820> Garcia<00:01:03.329> will<00:01:03.539> win<00:01:03.690> by<00:01:03.870> a

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
first fight Danny Garcia will win by a

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.490 
first fight Danny Garcia will win by a
by<00:01:04.589> decision<00:01:05.689> Morales<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.840> no<00:01:07.020> longer<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
by decision Morales is no longer the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.730 
by decision Morales is no longer the
same<00:01:07.530> fighter<00:01:08.520> we<00:01:08.820> used<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.119> know<00:01:09.590> he<00:01:10.590> is

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
same fighter we used to know he is

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.859 
same fighter we used to know he is
already<00:01:11.010> old<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.820> don't<00:01:12.060> see<00:01:12.330> him<00:01:12.540> winning

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
already old and I don't see him winning

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.980 
already old and I don't see him winning
this<00:01:13.110> fight<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.909> think<00:01:14.909> he<00:01:15.150> should<00:01:15.390> retire<00:01:15.689> now

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
this fight I think he should retire now

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.550 
this fight I think he should retire now
but<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.560> still<00:01:16.650> want<00:01:17.490> him<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.820> fight<00:01:18.170> one<00:01:19.170> Manuel

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
but I still want him to fight one Manuel

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.260 
but I still want him to fight one Manuel
Marquez<00:01:19.920> before<00:01:20.820> he<00:01:20.909> retires<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.680> yeah

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270
