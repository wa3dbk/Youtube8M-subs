00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.760

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.000
 I find myself dismissed and kill them in calling 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.000
 the attention, well, let's go there 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.820
 Okay, it's got the hood, I do not know how the fuck 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.710
 I just put on the hood that was 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.800
 looking and looking to put it on and not 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.870
 he 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.850
 there it is I do not know I do not know what's wrong 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.590
 at 3 o'clock when it happens to you from the game 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.040
 can put here but right now he put 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.040
 in missions 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.960
 that is also saying that I do not know how to fuck 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.400
 but I've lost the tomahawk and if I 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.710
 you say how to get it again because 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.119
 I go to the store and he says that 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.110
 I have it but afterwards I do not know where 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:15.850
 I have a new meeting 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.850
 to see if it is separated or something 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.380
 also how are we checking me 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.500
 tinted the clothes and I have it blue 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.500
 Dark 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.070
 to see here 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.470
 now I could not prove it from within 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.110
 of is a little bit far 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.990
 identify and kill the two spies 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.740
 without being seen with both legs I will 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.740
 catch a horse 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.030
 but I do not think it's very close 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.030
 let's say 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.620
 the game is that it has a quantity of 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.010
 amazing light star of the best of 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:00.810
 the networks 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:04.649
 especially with horses the horses are 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.509
 a little bit famous is found in 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.399
 find a stone or something something that 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.399

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.810
 dancing 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.310
 you can not see it 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:24.959
 ok nobody comes easy enough 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.959
 and we will work with other things 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:32.970
 that's what counts 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.970
 They say it has gone well 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:41.580
 The good thing is that I can be among them 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:44.880

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.080

 I was trying to kill the General Arnold 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.390
 General Washington learned the plot and 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:51.130
 he sent me to prevent it 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.150

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.980
 ammunition to a nearby camp 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.410
