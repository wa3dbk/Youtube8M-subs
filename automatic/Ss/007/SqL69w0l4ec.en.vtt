the first class being the best class and
the<00:00:29.340> third<00:00:29.580> class<00:00:29.849> being<00:00:30.119> like<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.630> worst

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
the third class being like the worst

beyond<00:00:42.480> third<00:00:42.780> class<00:00:43.079> right<00:00:43.379> they<00:00:43.590> shouldn't

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
beyond third class right they shouldn't

third class exotics should not be

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.240 
third class exotics should not be
exotics<00:00:46.260> but<00:00:46.410> that's<00:00:46.559> how<00:00:46.680> i<00:00:46.710> divided<00:00:47.100> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
exotics but that's how i divided the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.910 
exotics but that's how i divided the
exotics<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:48.120> basically<00:00:48.450> bad<00:00:48.780> juju<00:00:49.260> when<00:00:49.680> the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
give you guys my review of the bad juju

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.499 
give you guys my review of the bad juju
so<00:01:25.439> basically<00:01:25.830> this<00:01:26.070> review<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.520> based<00:01:26.640> on<00:01:27.000> PvP

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
so basically this review is based on PvP

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.539 
so basically this review is based on PvP
mostly<00:01:28.020> because<00:01:28.439> you're<00:01:28.740> not<00:01:28.829> going<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.070> you

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
mostly because you're not going to you

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.310 
mostly because you're not going to you
can<00:01:29.700> be<00:01:29.790> using<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.360> PvE<00:01:30.659> but<00:01:31.079> i<00:01:31.110> would

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
can be using this in PvE but i would

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.870 
can be using this in PvE but i would
recommend<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.829> not<00:01:31.979> using<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.430> anywhere

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
recommend you not using it anywhere

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.100 
recommend you not using it anywhere
above<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.390> level<00:01:33.590> 23<00:01:34.590> range<00:01:34.860> because<00:01:35.310> um

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
above the level 23 range because um

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.050 
above the level 23 range because um
enemies<00:01:37.110> tend<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.799> be<00:01:37.920> really<00:01:38.220> ridiculous<00:01:38.850> and

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
enemies tend to be really ridiculous and

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.230 
enemies tend to be really ridiculous and
it's<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.590> thing<00:01:40.770> shines<00:01:41.189> every<00:01:41.939> time<00:01:42.119> you

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
it's this thing shines every time you

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.090 
it's this thing shines every time you
get<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.390> kill<00:01:42.689> so<00:01:43.170> if<00:01:43.229> you're<00:01:43.380> doing<00:01:43.590> crotas<00:01:43.920> end

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
get a kill so if you're doing crotas end

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.520 
get a kill so if you're doing crotas end
if<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:45.060> can<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.509> can<00:01:45.659> consistently<00:01:46.229> get

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
if you can you can consistently get

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.530 
if you can you can consistently get
thrall<00:01:47.040> kills<00:01:47.310> yak<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.939> see<00:01:48.240> what<00:01:48.420> you're

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
thrall kills yak and see what you're

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.539 
thrall kills yak and see what you're
going<00:01:48.960> with<00:01:48.990> them<00:01:49.290> but<00:01:49.590> i<00:01:49.860> would<00:01:50.340> much<00:01:50.520> rather

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
going with them but i would much rather

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.690 
going with them but i would much rather

use something like a fate bringer or an

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.609 
use something like a fate bringer or an
abyss<00:01:54.000> defiant<00:01:54.630> when<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.930> comes<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.380> but

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
abyss defiant when it comes to that but

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.170 
abyss defiant when it comes to that but
you<00:01:55.890> can<00:01:56.040> use<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.340> bed<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.640> do<00:01:56.759> for<00:01:57.000> the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
you can use the bed you do for the

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.670 
you can use the bed you do for the
lowest<00:01:57.390> type<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.750> situations<00:01:58.259> too<00:01:58.409> but<00:01:58.590> when

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
lowest type of situations too but when

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.800 
lowest type of situations too but when
you're<00:01:58.829> fighting<00:01:59.070> higher<00:01:59.520> rank<00:02:00.360> enemies

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
you're fighting higher rank enemies

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.620 
you're fighting higher rank enemies
which<00:02:01.320> are<00:02:01.649> majors<00:02:02.490> or<00:02:02.790> whatever<00:02:03.240> they<00:02:03.450> might

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
which are majors or whatever they might

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.749 
which are majors or whatever they might
be<00:02:03.869> that<00:02:04.140> have<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.619> ridiculous<00:02:05.490> amount<00:02:05.549> of

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
be that have a ridiculous amount of

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.779 
be that have a ridiculous amount of
health<00:02:05.939> or<00:02:06.119> they<00:02:06.270> might<00:02:06.450> have<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.750> over<00:02:07.380> shield

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
health or they might have a over shield

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:10.669 
health or they might have a over shield
over<00:02:08.789> them<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.300> bad<00:02:09.509> juju<00:02:09.660> isn't<00:02:10.229> really<00:02:10.530> the

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
over them the bad juju isn't really the

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.710 
over them the bad juju isn't really the
gun<00:02:10.920> for<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.640> so

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
gun for that so

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.480 
gun for that so
for<00:02:12.960> that<00:02:13.350> being<00:02:13.650> said<00:02:13.890> this<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:14.250> mace

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
for that being said this is mace

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.390 
for that being said this is mace
basically<00:02:15.240> mostly<00:02:15.600> for<00:02:15.840> PvP<00:02:16.380> so<00:02:16.620> basically

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
basically mostly for PvP so basically

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.450 
basically mostly for PvP so basically
this<00:02:17.550> thing<00:02:17.850> I<00:02:18.060> put<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.900> range<00:02:19.320> accurate<00:02:20.070> the

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
this thing I put the range accurate the

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.910 
this thing I put the range accurate the
range<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:21.090> perk<00:02:21.360> on<00:02:21.570> it<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:21.930> forgot<00:02:22.320> it<00:02:22.440> what<00:02:22.770> it

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
range of perk on it I forgot it what it

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.140 
range of perk on it I forgot it what it
was<00:02:23.070> called<00:02:23.250> but<00:02:23.430> that's<00:02:23.610> why<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:23.760> was<00:02:23.940> able<00:02:24.030> to

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
was called but that's why I was able to

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.850 
was called but that's why I was able to
get<00:02:24.300> that<00:02:24.480> guy<00:02:24.690> from<00:02:24.900> across<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.230> map<00:02:25.620> I

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
get that guy from across the map I

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.400 
get that guy from across the map I
didn't<00:02:26.520> kill<00:02:26.700> him<00:02:26.910> but<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.450> was<00:02:27.690> still<00:02:27.960> able<00:02:28.170> to

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
didn't kill him but I was still able to

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.590 
didn't kill him but I was still able to
land<00:02:28.650> really<00:02:29.340> good<00:02:29.490> shots<00:02:29.730> on<00:02:29.910> him<00:02:30.060> in<00:02:30.240> other

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
land really good shots on him in other

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.570 
land really good shots on him in other
games<00:02:30.840> I<00:02:31.200> was<00:02:31.560> able<00:02:31.710> to<00:02:31.890> kill<00:02:32.130> people<00:02:32.280> from

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
games I was able to kill people from

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.010 
games I was able to kill people from
across<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.880> map<00:02:33.180> with<00:02:33.360> this<00:02:33.510> thing<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:33.870> this

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
across the map with this thing so this

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.810 
across the map with this thing so this
thing<00:02:34.230> is<00:02:34.260> really<00:02:34.530> good<00:02:34.770> long-range<00:02:35.040> when<00:02:35.700> you

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
thing is really good long-range when you

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.150 
thing is really good long-range when you
put<00:02:36.060> that<00:02:36.210> perk<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:36.810> not<00:02:37.320> only<00:02:37.470> that<00:02:37.560> the

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
put that perk to it not only that the

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.640 
put that perk to it not only that the
impact<00:02:38.640> is<00:02:38.850> fairly<00:02:39.390> decent<00:02:39.990> so<00:02:40.260> you're<00:02:40.530> going

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
impact is fairly decent so you're going

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.010 
impact is fairly decent so you're going
to<00:02:40.740> get<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.010> kill<00:02:41.250> if<00:02:41.490> you're<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.820> spot<00:02:42.210> on<00:02:42.420> with

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
to get the kill if you're a spot on with

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.730 
to get the kill if you're a spot on with
your<00:02:43.530> shot<00:02:43.920> and<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.700> won't<00:02:44.910> be<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:45.120> difficult

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
your shot and it won't be that difficult

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.380 
your shot and it won't be that difficult
that<00:02:46.740> one<00:02:46.920> problem<00:02:47.160> i<00:02:47.310> did<00:02:47.490> have<00:02:47.640> a<00:02:47.670> fit<00:02:48.000> was

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
that one problem i did have a fit was

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.990 
that one problem i did have a fit was
the<00:02:48.660> recoil<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.530> recoil<00:02:50.010> was<00:02:50.160> really<00:02:50.430> really

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
the recoil the recoil was really really

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.090 
the recoil the recoil was really really
ridiculous<00:02:51.540> sometimes<00:02:52.260> for<00:02:52.620> me<00:02:52.680> I<00:02:52.709> guess<00:02:52.830> I

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
ridiculous sometimes for me I guess I

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.380 
ridiculous sometimes for me I guess I
haven't<00:02:53.250> been<00:02:53.370> playing<00:02:53.580> destiny<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.970> lot<00:02:54.150> so<00:02:54.360> I

don't<00:03:31.110> think<00:03:31.320> it<00:03:31.530> is<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:32.610> bad<00:03:32.760> juju<00:03:32.940> is<00:03:33.209> really

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
don't think it is the bad juju is really

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.500 
don't think it is the bad juju is really
good<00:03:33.630> in<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.560> 24<00:03:35.040> round<00:03:35.310> clip<00:03:35.670> when<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:36.269> get

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
good in the 24 round clip when you get

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.270 
good in the 24 round clip when you get
there<00:03:36.900> I'm<00:03:37.140> pretty<00:03:37.380> sure<00:03:37.500> you<00:03:37.620> extend<00:03:37.950> it<00:03:38.100> good

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
there I'm pretty sure you extend it good

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.520 
there I'm pretty sure you extend it good
it<00:03:38.760> doesn't<00:03:39.120> come<00:03:39.239> stock<00:03:39.510> I'm<00:03:39.870> not<00:03:40.019> sure<00:03:40.080> I

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
it doesn't come stock I'm not sure I

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.860 
it doesn't come stock I'm not sure I
think<00:03:40.890> it<00:03:41.010> comes<00:03:41.160> stock<00:03:41.489> now<00:03:41.730> but<00:03:42.299> the<00:03:42.450> 24

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
think it comes stock now but the 24

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.080 
think it comes stock now but the 24
round<00:03:43.049> clip<00:03:43.200> is<00:03:43.350> really<00:03:43.650> useful<00:03:44.310> type<00:03:44.940> of

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
round clip is really useful type of

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.300 
round clip is really useful type of
thing<00:03:45.299> it's<00:03:45.750> really<00:03:46.110> useful<00:03:46.260> mechanism<00:03:46.680> but

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
thing it's really useful mechanism but

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.580 
thing it's really useful mechanism but
I'd<00:03:47.640> much<00:03:47.910> rather<00:03:48.180> use<00:03:48.660> something<00:03:49.019> like<00:03:49.049> a<00:03:49.200> red

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
I'd much rather use something like a red

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.240 
I'd much rather use something like a red
death<00:03:49.860> or<00:03:50.070> an<00:03:50.820> Oversoul<00:03:51.480> edict<00:03:52.080> because<00:03:52.920> um

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
death or an Oversoul edict because um

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.750 
death or an Oversoul edict because um
it's<00:03:54.120> just<00:03:54.780> is<00:03:55.590> so<00:03:55.980> much<00:03:56.130> better<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.580> fire

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
it's just is so much better the fire

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.660 
it's just is so much better the fire
rate<00:03:57.030> on<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:58.019> Oversoul<00:03:58.470> edik<00:03:58.799> destroys<00:03:59.370> this

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
rate on the Oversoul edik destroys this

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.550 
rate on the Oversoul edik destroys this
with<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.330> minimal<00:04:00.750> amount<00:04:00.840> of<00:04:01.140> recoil<00:04:01.290> you

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
with the minimal amount of recoil you

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.140 
with the minimal amount of recoil you
get<00:04:01.769> on<00:04:01.890> it<00:04:01.920> and<00:04:02.160> the<00:04:02.310> Red<00:04:02.489> Death<00:04:02.700> is<00:04:02.910> just

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
get on it and the Red Death is just

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.750 
get on it and the Red Death is just
precision<00:04:03.900> and<00:04:04.049> its<00:04:04.709> impact<00:04:05.220> everything<00:04:05.640> is

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
precision and its impact everything is

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.580 
precision and its impact everything is
just<00:04:05.880> really<00:04:06.150> balanced<00:04:06.600> out<00:04:06.720> so<00:04:07.200> if<00:04:07.470> you're

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
just really balanced out so if you're

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.430 
just really balanced out so if you're
going<00:04:07.739> to<00:04:07.799> be<00:04:07.950> using<00:04:08.130> a<00:04:08.370> pulse<00:04:08.670> rifle<00:04:09.120> and

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
going to be using a pulse rifle and

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.350 
going to be using a pulse rifle and
since<00:04:10.440> this<00:04:10.620> new<00:04:10.799> update<00:04:10.920> dished<00:04:11.459> out<00:04:11.670> I<00:04:11.880> think

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
since this new update dished out I think

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.789 
since this new update dished out I think
pulse<00:04:12.540> rifle<00:04:12.900> pulse<00:04:13.080> rifles<00:04:13.440> are<00:04:13.530> going<00:04:13.650> to<00:04:13.709> be

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
pulse rifle pulse rifles are going to be

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.530 
pulse rifle pulse rifles are going to be
used<00:04:14.040> a<00:04:14.130> lot<00:04:14.160> more<00:04:14.580> i<00:04:14.790> would<00:04:15.180> highly<00:04:15.360> recommend

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
used a lot more i would highly recommend

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.140 
used a lot more i would highly recommend
you<00:04:15.989> use<00:04:16.200> something<00:04:16.590> other<00:04:16.739> than<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.940> bad

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
you use something other than the bad

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.180 
you use something other than the bad
juju<00:04:18.390> because<00:04:19.200> the<00:04:19.350> bad<00:04:19.500> juju<00:04:19.680> it's<00:04:20.100> a

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
juju because the bad juju it's a

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.920 
juju because the bad juju it's a
nice-looking<00:04:20.430> weapon<00:04:21.060> and<00:04:21.239> it's<00:04:21.570> fairly

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
nice-looking weapon and it's fairly

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.580 
nice-looking weapon and it's fairly
decent<00:04:22.530> but<00:04:22.830> if<00:04:23.070> you<00:04:23.190> want<00:04:23.340> to<00:04:23.430> max<00:04:23.640> amount

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
decent but if you want to max amount

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.220 
decent but if you want to max amount
maximize<00:04:25.010> your<00:04:25.250> experience<00:04:25.970> of<00:04:26.120> playing<00:04:26.960> in

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
maximize your experience of playing in

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.700 
maximize your experience of playing in
pvp<00:04:28.010> that<00:04:28.550> out<00:04:28.699> much<00:04:29.240> rather<00:04:29.510> you<00:04:29.780> use<00:04:30.199> a<00:04:30.410> red

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
pvp that out much rather you use a red

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.090 
pvp that out much rather you use a red
death<00:04:30.919> or<00:04:31.750> prettiest<00:04:32.750> revenge<00:04:33.260> or<00:04:33.530> timepiece

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
death or prettiest revenge or timepiece

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.820 
death or prettiest revenge or timepiece
the<00:04:34.370> timepiece<00:04:34.880> the<00:04:35.600> pulse<00:04:35.870> rifle<00:04:36.139> from<00:04:36.320> the

the timepiece the pulse rifle from the
vault<00:04:37.070> of<00:04:37.220> glass<00:04:37.250> raid<00:04:37.760> so<00:04:38.360> I'd<00:04:38.690> much<00:04:38.930> rather

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
vault of glass raid so I'd much rather

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.629 
vault of glass raid so I'd much rather
use<00:04:39.320> those<00:04:39.560> but<00:04:40.250> that's<00:04:40.370> just<00:04:40.460> my<00:04:40.610> opinion

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
use those but that's just my opinion

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.990 
use those but that's just my opinion

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.690 
know we were still winning our games and
I<00:04:59.479> chose<00:04:59.690> this<00:04:59.720> gameplay<00:05:00.169> because<00:05:00.530> it<00:05:01.310> shows

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
I chose this gameplay because it shows

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.510 
I chose this gameplay because it shows
that<00:05:02.000> we<00:05:02.300> still<00:05:02.810> had<00:05:03.380> a<00:05:03.410> decent<00:05:03.740> lead<00:05:04.100> ahead<00:05:04.280> of

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
that we still had a decent lead ahead of

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.740 
that we still had a decent lead ahead of
them<00:05:04.639> i<00:05:04.729> had<00:05:04.880> another<00:05:05.120> gameplay<00:05:05.360> we<00:05:05.630> were

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
them i had another gameplay we were

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.629 
them i had another gameplay we were
completely<00:05:06.070> dominated<00:05:07.070> them<00:05:07.190> but<00:05:07.370> I<00:05:07.400> wasn't

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:07.639 
completely dominated them but I wasn't

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:09.790 
completely dominated them but I wasn't
using<00:05:07.880> the<00:05:08.090> bad<00:05:08.240> juju<00:05:08.389> as<00:05:08.780> much<00:05:09.169> as<00:05:09.380> this<00:05:09.560> game

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
using the bad juju as much as this game

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.159 
using the bad juju as much as this game
and<00:05:10.070> so<00:05:10.790> yeah<00:05:10.970> you<00:05:11.210> know<00:05:11.330> gives<00:05:11.570> you<00:05:11.690> a<00:05:11.750> fairly

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169
