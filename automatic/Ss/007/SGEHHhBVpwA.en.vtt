be going over it something really easy

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.830 
be going over it something really easy
just<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.990> map<00:00:15.990> limits<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:17.449> yeah<00:00:18.449> well<00:00:18.630> have

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
just the map limits the yeah well have

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.859 
just the map limits the yeah well have
your<00:00:18.930> map<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.500> make<00:00:20.330> that<00:00:21.330> easy<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.720> do

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
your map that you make that easy to do

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.019 
your map that you make that easy to do
really<00:00:22.380> easy<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.680> manage<00:00:22.890> if<00:00:23.699> you're<00:00:23.880> making

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
really easy to manage if you're making

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.330 
really easy to manage if you're making
smaller<00:00:24.570> maps<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:25.109> essentially<00:00:25.590> using<00:00:26.160> just

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
smaller maps is essentially using just

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.990 
smaller maps is essentially using just
so<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.640> don't<00:00:26.820> let<00:00:26.939> players<00:00:27.539> wander<00:00:28.080> off

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
so that you don't let players wander off

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.310 
so that you don't let players wander off
just<00:00:30.000> pointlessly<00:00:30.510> swimming<00:00:31.050> or<00:00:31.170> just

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
just pointlessly swimming or just

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.540 
just pointlessly swimming or just
exploring<00:00:31.830> all<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.009> things<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.430> you've

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
exploring all the things that you've

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.639 
exploring all the things that you've
just<00:00:32.820> done<00:00:33.120> for<00:00:33.149> well<00:00:33.870> just<00:00:34.110> making<00:00:34.469> the

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
just done for well just making the

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.220 
just done for well just making the
likely<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.790> outreaches<00:00:36.210> in<00:00:36.480> your<00:00:36.630> map<00:00:36.809> just

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
likely the outreaches in your map just

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.049 
likely the outreaches in your map just
took<00:00:37.890> awesome<00:00:38.250> off<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.370> little<00:00:38.610> bit<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:38.940> it's

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
took awesome off a little bit so it's

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.750 
took awesome off a little bit so it's
just<00:00:39.239> not<00:00:39.739> every<00:00:40.739> single<00:00:40.950> things<00:00:41.309> just<00:00:41.579> not<00:00:41.670> a

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
just not every single things just not a

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.670 
just not every single things just not a
lost<00:00:42.000> island<00:00:43.940> so<00:00:44.940> well<00:00:45.450> we'll<00:00:46.230> get<00:00:46.379> correct

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
lost island so well we'll get correct

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.770 
lost island so well we'll get correct
song<00:00:46.860> with<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.160> now<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.149> it's<00:00:48.510> one<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
song with it now so it's one of the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.709 
song with it now so it's one of the
easiest<00:00:49.110> tutorials<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.920> do<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.219> one<00:00:50.719> I'll

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
easiest tutorials to do this one I'll

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.299 
easiest tutorials to do this one I'll
stab<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.020> should<00:00:52.260> have<00:00:52.350> cracked<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.770> well<00:00:53.280> I

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
stab you should have cracked it well I

you've<00:01:06.810> got<00:01:07.049> map<00:01:07.290> lemis<00:01:08.299> it's<00:01:09.299> really<00:01:09.900> easy<00:01:10.080> to

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
you've got map lemis it's really easy to

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.530 
you've got map lemis it's really easy to
see<00:01:10.530> what's<00:01:10.710> going<00:01:10.950> on<00:01:11.010> here<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.939> you've<00:01:12.299> got

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
on your left hand side moving at the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.620 
on your left hand side moving at the
point<00:01:16.560> remove<00:01:17.040> points<00:01:17.340> reset<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.270> toggle<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630

cursor and then hold short course with

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:29.300 
cursor and then hold short course with
your<00:01:21.090> rv's<00:01:26.119> currently<00:01:27.320> it's<00:01:28.320> just<00:01:29.070> speed

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
your rv's currently it's just speed

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.170 
your rv's currently it's just speed
though<00:01:29.520> it

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
though it

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.060 
though it
so<00:01:30.720> speeding<00:01:31.170> up<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.350> camera<00:01:31.680> movement

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
so speeding up you camera movement

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.550 
so speeding up you camera movement
remember<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.579> left<00:01:32.759> sticking<00:01:33.380> I'll<00:01:34.380> make

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
remember to the left sticking I'll make

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.149 
remember to the left sticking I'll make
it<00:01:34.740> really<00:01:35.310> really<00:01:35.610> quick<00:01:36.710> so<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.740> go<00:01:37.920> up<00:01:38.040> to

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
it really really quick so you go up to

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.390 
it really really quick so you go up to
eight<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:39.030> theoretically<00:01:40.100> I'm<00:01:41.100> just<00:01:41.280> gonna

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
eight so theoretically I'm just gonna

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.289 
eight so theoretically I'm just gonna
grab<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.390> your<00:01:42.869> radius<00:01:43.320> again<00:01:44.149> just<00:01:45.149> like

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
grab this your radius again just like

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.999 
grab this your radius again just like
what<00:01:45.509> we<00:01:45.630> were<00:01:45.689> doing<00:01:45.720> for<00:01:45.960> puffs<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.649> will

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
what we were doing for puffs that will

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.590 
what we were doing for puffs that will
control<00:01:47.369> whatever's<00:01:48.290> in<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.470> area<00:01:50.390> so<00:01:51.390> who

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
control whatever's in this area so who

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.429 
control whatever's in this area so who
want<00:01:51.780> me<00:01:51.930> this<00:01:52.340> right<00:01:53.340> trigger<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:54.320> and<00:01:55.320> then

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
want me this right trigger it and then

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.440 
want me this right trigger it and then
we<00:01:55.530> move<00:01:55.770> in<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.700> pan<00:01:56.939> around<00:01:56.969> with<00:01:57.329> you

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
we move in you pan around with you

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.580 
we move in you pan around with you
camera<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:59.810> we<00:02:00.810> don't<00:02:00.930> want<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.439> take

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
camera in that we don't want to take

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.830 
camera in that we don't want to take
that<00:02:01.619> right<00:02:02.490> I'm<00:02:02.939> using<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.329> original<00:02:03.450> map

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
that right I'm using the original map

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.420 
that right I'm using the original map
again

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
again

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:16.979 
again
so<00:02:06.430> if<00:02:06.549> we<00:02:06.700> grab<00:02:06.939> this<00:02:07.149> one<00:02:12.390> move<00:02:13.390> that<00:02:13.420> down<00:02:15.989> we

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
so if we grab this one move that down we

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:26.790 
so if we grab this one move that down we
can<00:02:17.200> I<00:02:17.230> take<00:02:17.500> that<00:02:17.530> over

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:34.020 

right<00:02:27.550> nominate<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.750> might<00:02:29.590> be<00:02:29.860> able<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:33.030> drop

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
right nominate and might be able to drop

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:41.610 
right nominate and might be able to drop
out<00:02:34.330> yeah<00:02:34.660> yeah<00:02:34.870> we<00:02:35.050> can<00:02:36.210> so<00:02:37.210> that<00:02:37.420> now<00:02:40.620> he's

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
out yeah yeah we can so that now he's

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.890 
out yeah yeah we can so that now he's
given<00:02:41.860> those<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.010> mop<00:02:42.280> limit<00:02:42.640> you<00:02:43.510> surround<00:02:43.780> the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
given those a mop limit you surround the

00:02:43.900 --> 00:03:07.460 
given those a mop limit you surround the
island<00:02:43.930> that<00:02:44.350> we've<00:02:44.560> we've<00:02:45.400> made<00:02:45.610> previously

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.530 

definitely<00:03:08.470> sets<00:03:08.680> it<00:03:08.800> further<00:03:09.010> well<00:03:09.390> so<00:03:10.390> that

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
definitely sets it further well so that

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.330 
definitely sets it further well so that
would<00:03:10.690> definitely<00:03:11.080> have<00:03:11.500> to<00:03:11.560> be<00:03:11.709> only<00:03:11.890> normal

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
would definitely have to be only normal

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.589 
would definitely have to be only normal
Matt<00:03:14.730> let's<00:03:15.730> have<00:03:15.849> a<00:03:15.940> look<00:03:16.060> where<00:03:16.209> else<00:03:16.420> we

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
Matt let's have a look where else we

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:27.660 
Matt let's have a look where else we
have<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:16.780> put<00:03:16.900> it<00:03:16.959> you<00:03:17.020> know<00:03:21.510> yeah<00:03:24.660> so<00:03:26.519> if<00:03:27.519> you

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
have to put it you know yeah so if you

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.190 
have to put it you know yeah so if you
do<00:03:27.850> go<00:03:28.060> beyond<00:03:28.330> your<00:03:28.450> map<00:03:28.600> limit<00:03:28.959> and<00:03:29.050> then<00:03:29.140> you

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
do go beyond your map limit and then you

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.839 
do go beyond your map limit and then you
get<00:03:29.350> about<00:03:29.470> ten<00:03:29.709> seconds<00:03:30.190> that<00:03:30.220> you<00:03:30.430> get<00:03:30.610> to<00:03:30.730> go

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
get about ten seconds that you get to go

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:32.370 
get about ten seconds that you get to go
back<00:03:31.060> inside<00:03:31.360> it<00:03:31.870> so<00:03:32.019> it's<00:03:32.140> not<00:03:32.260> an

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
back inside it so it's not an

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.960 
back inside it so it's not an
interesting<00:03:32.560> kill<00:03:32.950> it's<00:03:33.130> not<00:03:33.310> a<00:03:33.340> complete

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
interesting kill it's not a complete

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.030 
interesting kill it's not a complete
death<00:03:34.209> so<00:03:34.500> but<00:03:35.500> it's<00:03:35.620> good<00:03:35.739> that<00:03:35.769> you<00:03:35.950> can

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
death so but it's good that you can

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.580 
death so but it's good that you can
block<00:03:36.280> stuff<00:03:36.519> off<00:03:36.670> now<00:03:37.260> some<00:03:38.260> of<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.410> stuff

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
block stuff off now some of the stuff

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.770 
block stuff off now some of the stuff
that<00:03:38.620> you<00:03:38.800> can<00:03:38.950> do<00:03:39.100> with<00:03:39.250> it<00:03:39.400> it's<00:03:40.360> making<00:03:40.660> it<00:03:40.720> a

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
that you can do with it it's making it a

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.120 
that you can do with it it's making it a
little<00:03:40.870> bit<00:03:41.049> more<00:03:41.170> interesting<00:03:41.769> is<00:03:41.920> that<00:03:41.950> you

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
little bit more interesting is that you

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.940 
little bit more interesting is that you
could<00:03:42.400> make<00:03:43.360> some<00:03:43.600> parts<00:03:43.810> of<00:03:43.989> your<00:03:44.110> map<00:03:44.290> as

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
could make some parts of your map as

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.470 
could make some parts of your map as
always<00:03:45.190> saying<00:03:45.400> only<00:03:45.580> one<00:03:45.730> just<00:03:45.970> out<00:03:46.120> a<00:03:46.150> pound

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
always saying only one just out a pound

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.380 
always saying only one just out a pound
so<00:03:46.959> if<00:03:47.019> I<00:03:47.110> bring<00:03:47.319> that<00:03:47.470> over<00:03:47.620> here<00:03:48.390> anything

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
so if I bring that over here anything

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.509 
so if I bring that over here anything
which<00:03:49.690> is<00:03:49.720> in<00:03:49.959> that<00:03:50.110> triangle<00:03:50.530> you're<00:03:51.430> gonna

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
which is in that triangle you're gonna

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:52.620 
which is in that triangle you're gonna
be<00:03:51.700> surviving<00:03:52.000> and<00:03:52.239> that's<00:03:52.360> gonna<00:03:52.480> be<00:03:52.600> a

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
be surviving and that's gonna be a

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.280 
be surviving and that's gonna be a
battleground<00:03:53.850> when<00:03:54.850> you've<00:03:55.000> got<00:03:55.239> on<00:03:56.080> the

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
battleground when you've got on the

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.470 
battleground when you've got on the
left-hand<00:03:56.739> side<00:03:56.830> of<00:03:57.160> it<00:03:57.310> don't<00:03:58.239> we<00:03:58.330> see

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
left-hand side of it don't we see

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.880 
left-hand side of it don't we see
anybody<00:03:58.780> entering<00:03:59.049> to<00:03:59.200> that<00:03:59.380> area<00:03:59.590> is<00:03:59.769> gonna

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
anybody entering to that area is gonna

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.089 
anybody entering to that area is gonna
die

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.259 

now<00:04:05.700> what<00:04:05.969> you<00:04:06.060> can<00:04:06.299> do<00:04:06.510> for<00:04:06.900> awkward<00:04:07.290> maps<00:04:08.269> is

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
now what you can do for awkward maps is

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.020 
now what you can do for awkward maps is
that<00:04:09.510> we<00:04:09.840> can<00:04:09.989> have<00:04:10.109> a<00:04:10.139> point<00:04:10.349> and<00:04:10.530> again<00:04:11.030> and

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
that we can have a point and again and

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.530 
that we can have a point and again and
we<00:04:12.209> can<00:04:12.389> pull<00:04:12.569> that<00:04:12.719> in<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:13.579> then<00:04:14.579> record<00:04:14.969> at

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
we can pull that in and then record at

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.689 
we can pull that in and then record at
that<00:04:15.719> point<00:04:16.079> in<00:04:18.019> so<00:04:19.019> what<00:04:19.199> I<00:04:19.229> do<00:04:19.410> is<00:04:20.340> it<00:04:20.519> that

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
that point in so what I do is it that

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:24.830 
that point in so what I do is it that
give<00:04:20.970> you<00:04:21.169> a<00:04:22.169> safe<00:04:22.740> sound<00:04:23.070> so<00:04:23.310> to<00:04:23.370> speak<00:04:23.780> so<00:04:24.780> if

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
give you a safe sound so to speak so if

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.600 
give you a safe sound so to speak so if
we<00:04:24.990> then<00:04:25.110> at<00:04:25.289> that<00:04:25.500> point<00:04:25.740> in<00:04:28.220> so<00:04:29.220> that's<00:04:29.460> going

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
we then at that point in so that's going

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:36.589 
we then at that point in so that's going
to<00:04:29.699> be<00:04:29.759> a<00:04:29.789> deaf<00:04:30.030> part<00:04:34.970> but<00:04:35.970> you<00:04:36.090> could<00:04:36.270> have<00:04:36.360> two

00:04:36.589 --> 00:04:36.599 
to be a deaf part but you could have two

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:38.689 
to be a deaf part but you could have two
areas<00:04:37.020> and<00:04:37.410> you<00:04:37.560> could<00:04:37.770> do<00:04:37.949> things<00:04:38.250> where<00:04:38.639> you

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
areas and you could do things where you

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.990 
areas and you could do things where you
could<00:04:39.740> have<00:04:40.740> it<00:04:40.889> so<00:04:41.070> moving<00:04:41.580> it<00:04:41.699> to<00:04:41.820> other

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
could have it so moving it to other

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.670 
could have it so moving it to other
islands<00:04:42.530> so<00:04:43.530> if<00:04:43.800> we<00:04:44.009> increase<00:04:44.400> this<00:04:45.470> drop<00:04:46.470> out

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
islands so if we increase this drop out

00:04:46.680 --> 00:05:12.269 
islands so if we increase this drop out
for<00:04:46.889> those

00:05:12.269 --> 00:05:12.279 

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:18.010 

you<00:05:13.279> could<00:05:13.460> have

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.670 

a<00:05:19.120> section<00:05:20.120> over<00:05:20.210> here<00:05:20.509> where<00:05:21.199> you<00:05:21.289> just<00:05:21.440> build

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
a section over here where you just build

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.960 
a section over here where you just build
on<00:05:21.770> over<00:05:21.979> Ireland<00:05:22.340> and<00:05:22.490> then<00:05:22.580> that<00:05:22.789> one's

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
on over Ireland and then that one's

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.610 
on over Ireland and then that one's
covered<00:05:23.300> so<00:05:23.660> that<00:05:23.690> you<00:05:23.930> don't<00:05:24.110> have<00:05:24.259> to<00:05:24.440> just

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
covered so that you don't have to just

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.430 
covered so that you don't have to just
narrow<00:05:24.800> it<00:05:24.919> down<00:05:24.949> to<00:05:25.129> each<00:05:25.400> island<00:05:26.169> other<00:05:27.169> than

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
narrow it down to each island other than

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.379 
narrow it down to each island other than
that<00:05:27.620> it's<00:05:28.280> pretty<00:05:28.490> much<00:05:28.699> just<00:05:28.849> controlling

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
that it's pretty much just controlling

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:32.110 
that it's pretty much just controlling
it<00:05:29.599> like<00:05:29.750> you<00:05:29.870> did<00:05:30.080> with<00:05:30.319> the<00:05:30.789> paths<00:05:31.789> and<00:05:32.030> the

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
it like you did with the paths and the

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.969 
it like you did with the paths and the
roads<00:05:32.330> that<00:05:32.479> we<00:05:32.629> recovered<00:05:33.440> earlier<00:05:33.530> on<00:05:35.949> but<00:05:36.949> I

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:36.979 
roads that we recovered earlier on but I

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:38.969 
roads that we recovered earlier on but I
just<00:05:37.190> thought<00:05:37.400> that'd<00:05:37.669> give<00:05:37.879> her<00:05:38.030> a<00:05:38.060> quick

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
just thought that'd give her a quick

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:43.240 
just thought that'd give her a quick
quick<00:05:39.979> tutorial<00:05:40.610> covering<00:05:40.940> it<00:05:41.680> as<00:05:42.680> I<00:05:42.949> said<00:05:43.009> I

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
quick tutorial covering it as I said I

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.159 
quick tutorial covering it as I said I
