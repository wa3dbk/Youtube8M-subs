on our part which has probably happened
to<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.110> many<00:00:52.710> many<00:00:52.949> times<00:00:53.180> original<00:00:54.180> concept

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
to you many many times original concept

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.750 
to you many many times original concept
was<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.809> photograph<00:00:55.110> these<00:00:55.649> people<00:00:56.039> sitting

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
was to photograph these people sitting

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.639 
was to photograph these people sitting
on<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.210> seamless<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.780> basically<00:00:58.260> editing

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
on the seamless and basically editing

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:59.930 
on the seamless and basically editing
them<00:00:58.770> together<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.250> have<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.489> completely

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
them together and have it completely

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.240 
them together and have it completely
done<00:01:00.239> on<00:01:00.390> seamless<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.109> faded<00:01:01.440> look<00:01:01.620> we

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
done on seamless and that faded look we

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.979 
done on seamless and that faded look we
realized<00:01:02.760> when<00:01:03.030> we<00:01:03.149> actually<00:01:03.300> got<00:01:03.600> these<00:01:03.750> into

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
realized when we actually got these into

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.329 
realized when we actually got these into
the<00:01:04.019> computer<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.470> started<00:01:04.830> working<00:01:05.220> with

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
the computer and started working with

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.590 
the computer and started working with
them<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.729> they<00:01:05.850> were<00:01:05.909> just<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.270> little<00:01:06.510> bit

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
them that they were just a little bit

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.750 
them that they were just a little bit
boring<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.530> what<00:01:08.130> do<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.280> do<00:01:08.369> with<00:01:08.520> something

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
boring so what do you do with something

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.190 
boring so what do you do with something
you<00:01:08.939> shot<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.240> seamless<00:01:09.570> it's<00:01:09.750> boring<00:01:10.049> you

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
you shot on seamless it's boring you

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.750 
you shot on seamless it's boring you
composite<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.950> into<00:01:11.220> an<00:01:11.340> interesting

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
composite it into an interesting

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.520 
composite it into an interesting
background<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.630> makes<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.990> entire<00:01:13.229> image

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
background and it makes the entire image

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.499 
background and it makes the entire image
much<00:01:14.189> more<00:01:14.430> interesting<00:01:14.880> that's<00:01:15.210> what<00:01:15.390> we

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
much more interesting that's what we

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.390 
much more interesting that's what we
decided<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.960> do<00:01:16.170> but<00:01:16.439> we<00:01:16.530> decided<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.070> do<00:01:17.250> it

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
decided to do but we decided to do it

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.969 
decided to do but we decided to do it
after<00:01:18.090> we<00:01:18.570> actually<00:01:18.990> did<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.380> photo<00:01:19.590> shoot<00:01:19.680> of

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
after we actually did the photo shoot of

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.649 
after we actually did the photo shoot of
our<00:01:20.130> subjects<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:20.939> we<00:01:21.060> had<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.299> go<00:01:21.420> through

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
our subjects so we had to go through

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.480 
our subjects so we had to go through
several<00:01:21.900> processes<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.860> actually<00:01:23.189> make<00:01:23.340> it

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
several processes to actually make it

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.590 
several processes to actually make it
work<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.970> we're<00:01:24.119> going<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.270> take<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.570> through

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
work and we're going to take you through

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.170 
work and we're going to take you through
every<00:01:25.140> single<00:01:25.619> process<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.490> pro<00:01:26.640> tutorial

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
every single process in the pro tutorial

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.390 
every single process in the pro tutorial
so<00:01:27.450> original<00:01:27.990> idea<00:01:28.320> kept<00:01:28.619> on<00:01:28.740> changing<00:01:29.040> and

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
so original idea kept on changing and

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.890 
so original idea kept on changing and
changing<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.880> changing<00:01:30.000> even<00:01:30.420> during<00:01:30.750> the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
changing and changing even during the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.690 
changing and changing even during the
photo<00:01:31.110> shoot<00:01:31.229> we<00:01:31.619> wound<00:01:31.799> up<00:01:31.979> putting<00:01:32.310> people

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
photo shoot we wound up putting people

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.060 
photo shoot we wound up putting people
on<00:01:32.880> motorcycles<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.409> idea<00:01:34.650> came<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:35.009> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
on motorcycles and the idea came in the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.679 
on motorcycles and the idea came in the
middle<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.490> photo<00:01:35.700> shoot<00:01:35.939> hey<00:01:36.390> why<00:01:36.540> don't

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
middle of the photo shoot hey why don't

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:37.940 
middle of the photo shoot hey why don't
we<00:01:36.750> make<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.020> look<00:01:37.110> like<00:01:37.350> they're<00:01:37.530> holding<00:01:37.860> a

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
we make it look like they're holding a

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.740 
we make it look like they're holding a
piece<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.189> something<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:39.060> was<00:01:39.150> on<00:01:39.210> fire<00:01:39.479> or

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
piece of something that was on fire or

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.390 
piece of something that was on fire or
like<00:01:39.900> some<00:01:40.140> magical<00:01:40.650> orb<00:01:40.890> or<00:01:41.070> something<00:01:41.310> like

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
like some magical orb or something like

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.969 
like some magical orb or something like
that<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.850> we<00:01:41.970> put<00:01:42.240> these<00:01:42.780> basically<00:01:43.649> put<00:01:43.829> their

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
that so we put these basically put their

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.679 
that so we put these basically put their
hands<00:01:44.250> out<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.579> lit<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:44.909> in<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.210> way<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.450> where

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
hands out and lit it in a way to where

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.210 
hands out and lit it in a way to where
we<00:01:45.840> could<00:01:45.930> wind<00:01:46.170> up<00:01:46.259> doing<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.680> now<00:01:46.890> at<00:01:47.100> this

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
we could wind up doing that now at this

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.830 
we could wind up doing that now at this
point<00:01:47.430> we<00:01:47.579> didn't<00:01:48.060> know<00:01:48.149> exactly<00:01:48.420> what<00:01:48.720> we

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
point we didn't know exactly what we

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.389 
point we didn't know exactly what we
were<00:01:48.930> gonna<00:01:48.990> put<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.320> their<00:01:49.439> hand<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.950> we<00:01:50.250> had

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
were gonna put in their hand and we had

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.069 
were gonna put in their hand and we had
no<00:01:50.610> idea<00:01:50.640> we<00:01:51.030> would<00:01:51.149> be<00:01:51.329> compositing<00:01:51.930> them

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
no idea we would be compositing them

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.560 
no idea we would be compositing them
onto<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.649> background<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.610> after<00:01:53.909> we<00:01:54.030> decided<00:01:54.450> we

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
onto a background so after we decided we

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.270 
onto a background so after we decided we
were<00:01:54.689> going<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.110> put<00:01:55.290> fire<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.680> these<00:01:55.979> people's

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.530 
were going to put fire in these people's
hands<00:01:56.460> we<00:01:56.610> needed<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.909> way<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.119> basically

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
hands we needed a way to basically

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.600 
hands we needed a way to basically
create<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:58.079> fireball<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:58.979> what<00:01:59.280> we<00:01:59.399> came<00:01:59.549> up

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
create a fireball and what we came up

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.940 
create a fireball and what we came up
with<00:01:59.759> was<00:02:00.149> using<00:02:00.899> tennis<00:02:01.380> balls<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:01.860> we

with was using tennis balls so we

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.649 
with was using tennis balls so we

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
actually soaked in lighter fluid now we

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.840 
actually soaked in lighter fluid now we
did<00:02:03.899> this<00:02:03.990> outside<00:02:04.560> in<00:02:04.950> our<00:02:05.130> parking<00:02:05.430> lot<00:02:05.640> at

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.359 
did this outside in our parking lot at
night<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:06.479> very<00:02:07.439> little<00:02:07.649> chance<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.129> burning

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
night so very little chance of burning

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.760 
night so very little chance of burning
down<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:09.000> city<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.330> Chicago<00:02:09.360> but<00:02:10.110> we<00:02:10.410> wanted

photographed a hundred many many

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.289 
photographed a hundred many many
different<00:02:19.379> fireballs<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.640> that's<00:02:21.090> what

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
different fireballs and that's what

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:22.970 
different fireballs and that's what
wound<00:02:21.510> up<00:02:21.629> getting<00:02:21.780> positive<00:02:22.439> into<00:02:22.860> these

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
wound up getting positive into these

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
images in the computer we've got the

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.559 
images in the computer we've got the
fire<00:02:26.189> in<00:02:26.459> there<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:26.879> it<00:02:26.970> looks<00:02:27.180> great<00:02:27.269> but

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569

sure you guys have grown across this
before<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:31.079> was<00:02:31.379> just<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.709> little<00:02:31.920> boring<00:02:32.340> and

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
before it was just a little boring and

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.369 
before it was just a little boring and
it<00:02:32.610> needed<00:02:32.940> a<00:02:33.030> background<00:02:33.480> so<00:02:33.659> now<00:02:33.900> how<00:02:34.230> do<00:02:34.290> we

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
it needed a background so now how do we

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:35.960 
it needed a background so now how do we
create<00:02:34.709> a<00:02:34.890> background<00:02:35.220> or<00:02:35.489> photograph<00:02:35.879> a

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
background that's going to match the

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.319
