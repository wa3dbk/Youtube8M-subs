00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
just completely clogged up and my

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.900 
just completely clogged up and my
grandfather<00:02:36.120> had<00:02:36.360> said<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.140> me<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:37.670> that<00:02:38.670> it

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
grandfather had said to me that that it

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.820 
grandfather had said to me that that it
would<00:02:39.060> give<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:39.870> all<00:02:39.990> just<00:02:40.200> blow<00:02:40.440> right<00:02:40.470> off

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
would give it all just blow right off

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.750 
would give it all just blow right off
like<00:02:41.130> when<00:02:41.430> it<00:02:41.520> would<00:02:41.610> all<00:02:41.730> dry<00:02:42.290> but<00:02:43.610> which<00:02:44.610> I

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
like when it would all dry but which I

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
like when it would all dry but which I
think<00:02:44.790> he's<00:02:45.150> wrong

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
think he's wrong

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.540 
think he's wrong
I<00:02:47.120> think<00:02:48.120> he's<00:02:48.240> wrong<00:02:48.510> about<00:02:48.540> that<00:02:49.340> if<00:02:50.340> you

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
I think he's wrong about that if you

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.670 
I think he's wrong about that if you
would<00:02:50.670> let<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:51.090> stuff<00:02:51.390> all<00:02:51.630> dry<00:02:52.050> up<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:52.560> would

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
would let the stuff all dry up it would

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.980 
would let the stuff all dry up it would
just<00:02:52.860> be<00:02:53.040> as<00:02:53.570> hard<00:02:54.570> as<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.690> rock

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
just be as hard as a rock

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.410 
just be as hard as a rock
