 there will be no such samples 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.940
 look something else 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.260

 prototype on specified there are no numbers 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.610

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:20.560
 to understand just because she 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.550
 that's why
