00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.680
 first of all, which is the style 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.260
 easily you can go walking 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.940
 down the street imagine and suddenly they see 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.430
 to someone who is dressed in a way 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.770
 particular and we all say to and what father 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.960
 style they have or what ugly style they have 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.540
 Whatever the case, the band is like that 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.480
 Style is something that we creative 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:29.540
 difference to each other is our brand 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.579
 our letter and our 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.070
 stamp that is the style is the way in 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:36.020
 the one that we do things or for example to 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.329
 me in my case I really like the photos 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.780
 spontaneous suddenly it's a lot of color or 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.600
 suddenly it's black and white 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.370
 waves like that but usually my style 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.829
 at least I want to define it as something 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.750
 fun then here goes because it is 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.180
 important that we creative 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.129
 define or learn to define our 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.100
 style because that is what is going to 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.460
 to guarantee 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.829
 that is the touch the cash the trash 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.650
 whatever you want to call him in a world 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.869
 creative in which there are many 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.270
 people who are dedicated to creating things 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.240
 create photos or create designs or 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.430
 create writings or illustrations or pages 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.280
 web and so on is very important that each 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.780
 you know and value and define your own 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.270
 style because that is what is going to 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.979
 differentiate between other creatives when 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.289
 people want to hire someone in 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.210
 specific they are going to say good they know that 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.250
 I go with chuchito because I love 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.869
 that little one puts green on the pages 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.850
 Internet makes and I love 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.460
 the green and so on the style is something 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.100
 with what the public or customers 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.140
 can be identified and can do as 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.000
 your hiring decision 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.250
 competitive advantage if we want to put it 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.470
 as in a matter of marketing I would 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.330
 I propose that to start defining 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.590
 our style let's do the following 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.990
 ok style workshop 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.329
 an account of brushes already have interest 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.869
 then we go to the next step which is 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:01.390
 open a bowl or a board of pure things 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.729
 that inspire us or that we like that 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.130
 call us the attention that they have some 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.459
 type of connection with us all 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.920
 these things that we have on the board in 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.200
 Pinter's bowl is going to be things that 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.110
 will eventually define the way in which 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.970
 which we would like to represent or we 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.170
 will help to see that inner part of 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.670
 us that sometimes costs us a 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.680
 little bit of work to define us 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.599
 because I speak as in first person 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.230
 because in my case I am my own brand 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.519
 I fly I am fly photo and etcetera then 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.519
 I have to learn to define exactly 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.709
 what do I like and this is 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.629
 very important that we do it because 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.280
 Now I'm going to explain to you but I 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.290
 I propose to everyone that they open it to do 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.329
 its board that we start to think twice 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.459
 weeks and in the term of those two 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:48.400
 Weeks we see how it is going I'm going to go 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.079
 showing my style edge so they go 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.450
 saying go bounce me too 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:54.480
 words here is the question if by 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.030
 example we think pure photos 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.430
 of red cars then there is something in the 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.700
 Adrenaline in speed in passion 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.709
 of red etcetera that calls us a lot and 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.659
 that it might define us as 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.540
 people ok then it is well necessary 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:11.280
 that they think and that of everything they ask 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.370
 take out in three words that can 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.200
 define your personal characteristics or 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.000
 those of your brand ok why is it so 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.940
 important to make this board is a 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.579
 medium to women no but not the thing is what 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.980
 next if for example I find myself 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.780
 to myself giving opinions about things that define 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.970
 certain characteristics about me 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.370
 then those three characteristics or 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.590
 those three words you find should 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.840
 to reflect on all my work is 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.690
 say if for example in my word were 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.790
 white for saying this to see the flowers 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.769
 not then all my photos have to 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.379
 have some white or all my designs 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.480
 they have to have some eye white no 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.620
 they fit in a matter of color but it 's 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.260
 it was just an example 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.239
 then do it let's see how we 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.370
 it works and see you here in two 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.340
 more weeks to see how our 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.240
 edges and to see what results I got 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.640
 of mine 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:07.070
 see you then to the next one and to them 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.070
 I left homework take care and
