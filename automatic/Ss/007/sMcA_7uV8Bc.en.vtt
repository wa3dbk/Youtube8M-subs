00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 greetings to all mister friends 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:09.320
 computer in this video and we will follow 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:14.009
 a benchmark on the new android firmware 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:16.619
 4.1.2 of the samsung galaxy s3 we have 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.350
 of a v3 branded s3 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.880
 so we can do it immediately for 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.010
 our benchmark we will use antutu 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.740
 we open application we go on test us 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.070
 disable input sd card sd 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.630
 as it is not on our galaxy s iii 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.770
 present a memory expansion 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.579
 via microsd card 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.559
 remember that they all have a benchmark 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.570
 is a free application and therefore 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.100
 you can download and install it on 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:50.010
 your smartphone or android tablet for 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:54.090
 check the benchmark score e 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.920
 reach the tests with your device 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.000
 that are executed during benchmarks 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.620
 they are various 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.260
 the first concerns 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.210
 the cpu is then followed by one 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.600
 concerning the ram 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.720
 in this case as you can see you are 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.020
 following a capacity test 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:19.270
 calculation of the integers of the cpu 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:24.340
 obviously it will later be executed 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:26.560
 also one on the numbers with commas 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.350
 in the past we have already published others 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.250
 video with benchmarks on the various firmware 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.020
 of the galaxy s iii so you can then 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.300
 look for them inside ours 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:44.050
 channel we will put someone in maybe 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:47.380
 description now as you can see you are 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:53.979
 following the test regarding the 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:57.159
 graphics card for aspects 2 of pine 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:00.130
 has done tests 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.929
 let's say simple with small robots 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.209
 of android 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:09.340
 this has effects here and now 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:13.450
 let's go on to the test you can read 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:16.150
 opengl we are therefore a test 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.290
 on the board's 3D graphics capabilities 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.209
 graphic of our galaxy s iii that 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.319
 let's move on 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:29.410
 we are always on the 3d capacity test in 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.730
 low you can read how many frames per 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.110
 second 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:39.790
 manages to process and also the number of 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:41.370
 triangles that are processed for 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.370
 single image 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.370
 ok 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:52.660
 obviously it takes about 3 4 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.180
 minutes to complete it all here 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:03:03.480
 we finished as you can see the 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:09.969
 result and 15 1869 let's see some 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:13.739
 we can go to see the details of the 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:13.739
 our score 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.400
 we have locations and locations and readings 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.210
 then of course with the card 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.500
 sd had been able to raise the score 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.360
 this is a test you can all do 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.150
 run quiet we take advantage for 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:36.190
 wish you a merry Christmas and to the next one 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.190
 computer mister video precisely euro
