biodiesel processor now as the name

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:16.930 
biodiesel processor now as the name
suggests<00:00:14.959> it's<00:00:15.799> a<00:00:15.949> machine<00:00:16.070> capable<00:00:16.580> of

above the elements itself and this is

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.260 
above the elements itself and this is
facilitated<00:01:18.560> by<00:01:19.040> a<00:01:19.070> transducer<00:01:19.670> which<00:01:20.119> is
