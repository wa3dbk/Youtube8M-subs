calipers rotors and PFC brake pads off
we<00:00:24.779> go<00:00:26.420> okay

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
we go okay

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:36.200 
we go okay
wow<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.590> very<00:00:28.710> nice<00:00:29.070> Street

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.330 

I'm<00:00:37.210> now<00:00:37.390> going<00:00:37.540> to<00:00:37.600> be<00:00:37.720> doing<00:00:37.980> 660<00:00:38.980> miles<00:00:39.130> an

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
I'm now going to be doing 660 miles an

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.080 
I'm now going to be doing 660 miles an
hour<00:00:39.490> now<00:00:39.730> and<00:00:39.760> then<00:00:40.150> a<00:00:40.180> stuff<00:00:40.480> quickly<00:00:42.090> how

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
hour now and then a stuff quickly how

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.030 
hour now and then a stuff quickly how
fantastic<00:00:43.840> was<00:00:43.990> that<00:00:44.520> absolutely<00:00:45.520> straight

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
fantastic was that absolutely straight

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.870 
fantastic was that absolutely straight
and<00:00:49.320> after<00:00:50.320> that<00:00:50.470> stop<00:00:50.800> the<00:00:50.980> brakes<00:00:51.280> were<00:00:51.580> even

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:51.880 
and after that stop the brakes were even

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.190 
and after that stop the brakes were even
sharper<00:00:52.300> than<00:00:52.420> they<00:00:52.540> were<00:00:52.690> on<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:52.989> stuff

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
sharper than they were on the stuff

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.990 
sharper than they were on the stuff
before<00:00:53.880> fantastic

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
before fantastic

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.240 
before fantastic
and<00:00:55.090> I<00:00:55.540> usually<00:00:55.840> paths<00:00:56.350> have<00:00:56.560> to<00:00:56.590> be<00:00:56.800> heated<00:00:56.980> up

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
and I usually paths have to be heated up

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.700 
and I usually paths have to be heated up
and<00:00:57.880> I'm<00:00:58.210> getting<00:00:58.360> the<00:00:58.630> impression<00:00:58.660> these<00:00:59.170> PFC

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
and I'm getting the impression these PFC

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.330 
and I'm getting the impression these PFC
pads<00:01:00.010> work<00:01:00.670> well<00:01:00.960> from<00:01:01.960> early<00:01:02.590> starts<00:01:03.010> and<00:01:03.190> low

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
pads work well from early starts and low

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.380 
pads work well from early starts and low
speeds<00:01:05.520> but<00:01:06.520> you<00:01:06.670> can<00:01:06.790> only<00:01:06.970> be<00:01:07.240> the

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
speeds but you can only be the

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.580 
speeds but you can only be the
formulation<00:01:08.050> of<00:01:08.170> the<00:01:08.320> pad<00:01:08.500> material<00:01:09.119> has<00:01:10.119> been

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
formulation of the pad material has been

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.380 
formulation of the pad material has been
pre<00:01:11.590> organized<00:01:12.250> before<00:01:12.729> the<00:01:12.820> actual<00:01:13.060> pads

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
pre organized before the actual pads

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.330 
pre organized before the actual pads
have<00:01:13.479> been<00:01:13.660> made<00:01:13.840> a<00:01:14.140> lot<00:01:14.560> of<00:01:14.619> you<00:01:14.770> guys<00:01:14.920> may<00:01:15.190> not

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
have been made a lot of you guys may not

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.249 
have been made a lot of you guys may not
know<00:01:15.400> about<00:01:16.030> brake<00:01:16.420> pads<00:01:16.660> aren't<00:01:16.900> just<00:01:17.080> brake

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
know about brake pads aren't just brake

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.090 
know about brake pads aren't just brake
pads<00:01:17.530> you<00:01:18.400> can<00:01:18.430> put<00:01:18.759> various<00:01:18.970> materials<00:01:19.660> in<00:01:20.100> to

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
pads you can put various materials in to

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.590 
pads you can put various materials in to
suit<00:01:21.369> the<00:01:21.520> circumstances<00:01:22.210> they've<00:01:22.420> been

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
suit the circumstances they've been

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.810 
suit the circumstances they've been
designed<00:01:22.960> for<00:01:23.170> therefore<00:01:23.590> for<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:23.860> track<00:01:24.130> you

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
designed for therefore for the track you

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.760 
designed for therefore for the track you
would<00:01:24.940> use<00:01:25.119> a<00:01:25.150> different<00:01:25.270> formula<00:01:26.140> than<00:01:26.320> you

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
would use a different formula than you

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.240 
would use a different formula than you
would<00:01:26.950> for<00:01:27.100> the<00:01:27.160> road<00:01:28.860> we<00:01:29.860> have<00:01:29.890> to<00:01:30.009> be<00:01:30.220> a

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
would for the road we have to be a

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.740 
would for the road we have to be a
little<00:01:30.430> bit<00:01:30.610> careful<00:01:30.790> because<00:01:31.060> this<00:01:31.450> is<00:01:31.600> not

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
little bit careful because this is not

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.080 
little bit careful because this is not
on<00:01:31.900> a<00:01:31.930> track<00:01:32.259> this<00:01:32.590> is<00:01:32.710> on<00:01:32.830> a<00:01:32.860> regular<00:01:33.550> Highway

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
on a track this is on a regular Highway

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.910 
on a track this is on a regular Highway
with<00:01:34.270> people<00:01:34.690> and<00:01:34.840> cyclists<00:01:35.440> and<00:01:35.530> stuff<00:01:35.740> like

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
with people and cyclists and stuff like

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.760 
with people and cyclists and stuff like
that<00:01:36.160> they'll<00:01:36.610> still<00:01:36.970> sign<00:01:37.270> soon<00:01:37.600> we<00:01:38.229> got<00:01:38.710> a

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
that they'll still sign soon we got a

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.109 
that they'll still sign soon we got a
big<00:01:40.530> now<00:01:41.530> that's<00:01:41.800> what<00:01:41.979> you<00:01:42.130> call<00:01:42.369> a<00:01:42.399> stop<00:01:42.819> that

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
big now that's what you call a stop that

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:45.450 
big now that's what you call a stop that
is<00:01:43.899> what<00:01:44.080> you<00:01:44.259> call<00:01:44.410> the<00:01:44.530> control<00:01:44.800> stop<00:01:45.250> all

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
is what you call the control stop all

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.029 
is what you call the control stop all
four<00:01:45.970> stop<00:01:46.690> perfectly<00:01:47.440> I<00:01:49.470> am<00:01:50.470> convinced<00:01:51.009> that

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
four stop perfectly I am convinced that

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:53.609 
four stop perfectly I am convinced that
was<00:01:51.310> a<00:01:51.340> genuine<00:01:51.850> emergency<00:01:52.539> stop<00:01:52.780> I<00:01:53.050> hadn't

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
was a genuine emergency stop I hadn't

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.260 
was a genuine emergency stop I hadn't
realized<00:01:54.069> that<00:01:54.399> that<00:01:54.759> was<00:01:54.880> coming<00:01:55.149> to<00:01:55.240> a

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
realized that that was coming to a

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.320 
realized that that was coming to a
four-way<00:01:55.720> junction<00:01:56.289> and<00:01:56.819> that<00:01:57.819> was<00:01:58.000> really

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
four-way junction and that was really

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.059 
four-way junction and that was really
incredible<00:01:58.569> and<00:01:59.170> I<00:01:59.289> didn't<00:01:59.590> have<00:01:59.710> to<00:01:59.830> brake

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:00.069 
incredible and I didn't have to brake

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:04.260 
incredible and I didn't have to brake
very<00:02:00.340> hard<00:02:01.289> and<00:02:02.289> you<00:02:02.860> felt<00:02:03.160> the<00:02:03.280> ABS<00:02:03.729> came<00:02:04.060> in

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
very hard and you felt the ABS came in

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.870 
very hard and you felt the ABS came in
and<00:02:04.479> it<00:02:04.929> was<00:02:04.959> perfect<00:02:05.709> we're<00:02:06.399> coming<00:02:06.729> to<00:02:06.819> the

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
and it was perfect we're coming to the

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.190 
and it was perfect we're coming to the
end<00:02:06.970> of<00:02:07.179> this<00:02:07.300> amazing<00:02:08.200> trial<00:02:09.600> I've<00:02:10.600> been<00:02:11.020> very
