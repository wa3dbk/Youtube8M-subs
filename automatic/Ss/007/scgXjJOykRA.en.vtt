it's a 255 horsepower engine that has
been<00:00:56.960> modified<00:00:57.140> to<00:00:57.439> be<00:00:57.710> 200<00:00:58.399> horsepower<00:00:58.760> it

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
been modified to be 200 horsepower it

breakfast
alright<00:01:07.929> basically<00:01:08.929> flying<00:01:09.289> the<00:01:09.470> jet<00:01:09.500> of<00:01:09.799> our

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
alright basically flying the jet of our

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.609 
alright basically flying the jet of our
200<00:01:10.490> is<00:01:10.670> pretty<00:01:11.240> easy<00:01:11.450> pull<00:01:12.140> down<00:01:12.289> on<00:01:12.409> the<00:01:12.470> arm

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
200 is pretty easy pull down on the arm

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.070 
200 is pretty easy pull down on the arm
you<00:01:12.920> go<00:01:13.039> forward<00:01:13.429> go<00:01:13.909> up<00:01:14.060> with<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:14.270> arms<00:01:14.600> you

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
you go forward go up with the arms you

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.440 
you go forward go up with the arms you
go<00:01:15.229> back<00:01:15.440> to<00:01:16.159> look<00:01:16.310> at<00:01:16.399> the<00:01:16.549> thrust<00:01:16.880> or<00:01:17.179> the

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
go back to look at the thrust or the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.840 
go back to look at the thrust or the
nozzles<00:01:17.959> they<00:01:18.350> vector<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:18.830> water<00:01:19.069> thrust<00:01:19.490> and

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
nozzles they vector the water thrust and

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.969 
nozzles they vector the water thrust and
you<00:01:19.940> can<00:01:20.090> see<00:01:20.299> where<00:01:20.780> the<00:01:21.200> water<00:01:21.409> goes<00:01:21.740> is

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
you can see where the water goes is

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.399 
you can see where the water goes is
basically<00:01:22.369> where<00:01:22.610> you<00:01:22.819> go<00:01:23.000> if<00:01:23.659> I<00:01:23.810> move<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:24.200> jet

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
basically where you go if I move the jet

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:32.090 
basically where you go if I move the jet
back<00:01:24.709> I'm<00:01:25.250> up<00:01:25.459> in<00:01:25.580> the<00:01:25.700> air

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.609 

you<00:01:32.760> can<00:01:32.909> go<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.330> the<00:01:33.479> water<00:01:33.930> hop<00:01:34.140> out<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.439> the

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
you can go in the water hop out of the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.890 
you can go in the water hop out of the
water<00:01:34.860> with<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.670> can<00:01:35.820> go<00:01:35.939> right<00:01:36.330> you<00:01:36.630> can

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
water with it you can go right you can

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
thousand dollars and what's interesting

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.080 
thousand dollars and what's interesting
is<00:02:19.050> it's<00:02:19.860> because<00:02:20.130> it's<00:02:20.310> not<00:02:20.489> so<00:02:20.670> much<00:02:20.850> whether

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
is it's because it's not so much whether

you want this water jetpack or another
water<00:02:24.420> jetpack<00:02:25.100> this<00:02:26.100> is<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.430> only<00:02:26.580> one<00:02:26.850> out

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
water jetpack this is the only one out

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.509 
water jetpack this is the only one out
there<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:28.080> it's<00:02:28.410> whether<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.799> want<00:02:29.130> a<00:02:29.310> water

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
jet pack or not there's a lot of power

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.100 
jet pack or not there's a lot of power
this<00:02:34.170> bottle<00:02:34.590> is<00:02:34.620> very<00:02:34.950> sensitive<00:02:35.519> and<00:02:36.110> also

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
this bottle is very sensitive and also

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.110 
this bottle is very sensitive and also
with<00:02:37.260> these<00:02:37.380> control<00:02:37.829> arms<00:02:38.190> just<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.790> little

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
with these control arms just a little

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.280 
with these control arms just a little
bit<00:02:39.269> of<00:02:39.390> movement<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.750> makes<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:40.079> big

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
bit of movement it makes a big

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:47.270 
bit of movement it makes a big
difference

SeaWorld perfect let's say there was a
little<00:02:56.130> boat<00:02:56.310> fire<00:02:56.640> next<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.120> you<00:02:57.210> you<00:02:57.630> can

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
little boat fire next to you you can

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.750 
little boat fire next to you you can
just<00:02:57.930> like<00:02:58.110> send<00:02:58.380> them<00:02:58.470> some<00:02:58.680> spray<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:59.700> want

water perfect for that Wow Wow that's

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.610 
water perfect for that Wow Wow that's
pretty<00:03:06.480> important<00:03:08.930> that's<00:03:09.930> fit<00:03:10.170> for<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:10.410> time

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620

with<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:10.860> Jetlev<00:03:11.250> mostly<00:03:12.060> because<00:03:12.180> of<00:03:12.300> my

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
with the Jetlev mostly because of my

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.790 
with the Jetlev mostly because of my
contract<00:03:12.930> that<00:03:12.990> says<00:03:13.230> that<00:03:13.410> when<00:03:13.500> I'm<00:03:13.620> about

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
contract that says that when I'm about

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.580 
contract that says that when I'm about
to<00:03:13.860> die<00:03:14.130> I<00:03:14.160> can<00:03:14.520> call<00:03:14.700> it<00:03:14.850> a<00:03:14.910> day<00:03:15.090> so<00:03:15.600> it's<00:03:16.290> a<00:03:16.440> day

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
to die I can call it a day so it's a day

to die I can call it a day so it's a day
and<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.730> know<00:03:17.790> what<00:03:17.970> you're<00:03:18.090> thinking<00:03:18.390> this

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
and I know what you're thinking this

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.330 
and I know what you're thinking this
thing's<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:18.930> hundred<00:03:19.170> thousand<00:03:19.530> dollars<00:03:19.830> but

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
thing's a hundred thousand dollars but

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.710 
thing's a hundred thousand dollars but
so<00:03:20.520> is<00:03:20.580> a<00:03:20.670> sports<00:03:20.910> car<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.330> you're<00:03:21.450> paying<00:03:21.630> for

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
so is a sports car and you're paying for

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.170 
so is a sports car and you're paying for
exclusivity<00:03:22.380> there<00:03:22.620> this<00:03:23.520> thing's<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:23.910> jet

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
exclusivity there this thing's the jet

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.240 
exclusivity there this thing's the jet
pack<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:25.380> it<00:03:25.440> was<00:03:25.530> actually<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.830> lot<00:03:25.920> easier<00:03:25.980> to

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
pack and it was actually a lot easier to

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.770 
pack and it was actually a lot easier to
fly<00:03:26.370> than<00:03:26.520> I<00:03:26.640> thought<00:03:26.880> simple<00:03:27.330> physics<00:03:27.660> and

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
fly than I thought simple physics and

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.229 
fly than I thought simple physics and
dynamics<00:03:28.200> all<00:03:29.130> right<00:03:29.280> for<00:03:29.640> trans<00:03:29.850> logic<00:03:30.150> I'm

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
dynamics all right for trans logic I'm

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.550 
dynamics all right for trans logic I'm
