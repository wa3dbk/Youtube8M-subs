and<00:00:00.179> I<00:00:00.269> think<00:00:00.510> this<00:00:00.630> was<00:00:00.810> a<00:00:00.840> surreal<00:00:01.469> world<00:00:01.860> for

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.860 
well I think you can see from the look
on<00:00:38.460> her<00:00:38.579> face<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.060> the<00:00:39.150> smile<00:00:39.480> right<00:00:39.510> here

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
that she is attacking this with more

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.720 
that she is attacking this with more
energy<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.840> more<00:00:43.230> attack<00:00:43.920> than<00:00:44.160> I've<00:00:44.309> seen<00:00:44.340> in

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
energy and more attack than I've seen in

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.119 
energy and more attack than I've seen in
a<00:00:44.820> long<00:00:45.000> time<00:00:45.390> maybe<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.590> period<00:00:47.040> of

ah but if there was a single popping of
a<00:01:37.460> double<00:01:37.790> axel<00:01:38.590> that's<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:39.800> one<00:01:39.980> move<00:01:40.220> that

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
a double axel that's the one move that

00:01:40.460 --> 00:02:04.940 
a double axel that's the one move that
she's<00:01:40.640> usually<00:01:40.850> extremely<00:01:41.630> consistent<00:01:42.080> on

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:13.710 

speed<00:02:05.310> here<00:02:05.670> in<00:02:05.789> their<00:02:05.939> program

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.960 

now<00:02:13.840> double<00:02:14.410> toe<00:02:15.180> clean<00:02:16.180> as<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.450> whistle<00:02:17.970> and

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
now double toe clean as a whistle and

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:36.260 
now double toe clean as a whistle and
that's<00:02:19.090> a<00:02:19.240> lot<00:02:19.420> of<00:02:19.450> strength

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.450 

energy<00:02:36.570> at<00:02:36.690> work<00:02:36.900> for<00:02:37.380> concentration<00:02:38.100> here<00:02:38.430> I

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
energy at work for concentration here I

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.580 
energy at work for concentration here I
think<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.910> cheese<00:02:39.150> up<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.690> prove<00:02:39.960> where<00:02:40.320> she's

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
think the cheese up to prove where she's

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.780 
think the cheese up to prove where she's
been

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.899 

and<00:02:43.879> where<00:02:44.420> she's<00:02:44.659> going<00:02:44.689> from<00:02:45.319> you

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:49.909 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:51.500 

this<00:02:50.909> move

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
this move

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.360 
this move
it's<00:02:51.629> like<00:02:51.870> she's<00:02:52.079> opening<00:02:52.469> her<00:02:52.650> heart<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:53.249> the

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
it's like she's opening her heart to the

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:06.420 
it's like she's opening her heart to the
audience
