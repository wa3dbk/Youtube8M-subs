00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 first how it works 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.610
 pistons are key 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.350
 engine workflow 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.970
 internal combustion piston 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.040
 is a sleeve which 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.379
 moves up and down inside each 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.650
 cylinder compressing air / fuel mixture 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.370
 ignitable at the spark plug 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.990
 resulting from this 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.789
 energy turns the crankshaft 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.789
 driving the engine 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:36.400
 this company produces 9 thousand 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:38.500
 different piston models for everything from 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.230
 motocross bikes to road 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.760
 engines initially piston 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.220
 is a three-meter 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.110
 aluminum rod aluminum fits 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.940
 perfect because it's light not 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.480
 corrosive metal which 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.480
 easy to cut 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.230
 circular saw cuts the rod on 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.750
 billet length which can be changed 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.589
 adjusting the feeder 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.960
 push rod with different 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.460
 intervals 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.720
 This piston model requires 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.039
 workpiece 7 centimeters in length 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.720
 the factory is recycled and reused 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:15.220
 use the remaining aluminum 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.289
 shaving punch and mold 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.210
 heat up to four hundred and twenty six 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.860
 degrees celsius just such 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.560
 temperature required for stamping 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.460
 blanks blanks are heated to such 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.460
 same temperature in the oven 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.910
 under pressure of pressure two thousand 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.940
 tons formed the original shape of the piston 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:40.470
 approximately 1 out of 10 stampings is lowered into 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.470
 water to check for defects 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.150
 to facilitate the stamping process 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.460
 blanks before glowing them 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.050
 covered with grease that's why 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.180
 the workpiece flashes when on it 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.430
 the press project goes down performs this 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.440
 operation in just 2 seconds but blank 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.720
 so hot that they have to cool down 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:07.869
 at least an hour before the next one 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:11.080
 stage workers heat billets still 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.720
 two times first at very high 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.610
 temperature to strengthen the metal and during 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.540
 the second time is not so strong 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.540
 achieve sustainability 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.060
 then they process each billet 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.770
 on a lathe to impart 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.330
 stamping the appropriate form for 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.230
 mechanisms on which it will 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.230
 handle later 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.319
 through these little holes lend themselves 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:45.560
 oil lubricating piston 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:47.390
 the process of working another lathe 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.480
 reduces diameter by 3 millimeters 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.150
 then the same machine cuts through 3 times 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.940
 2 for compression rings and one for 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.650
 oil retention rings these rings 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.659
 designed to piston 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.680
 moved smoothly and provide 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:06.140
 tight fit this hole for 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.680
 piston pin which connects 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.329
 piston with connecting rod 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.069
 then on a milling machine on both sides 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.849
 piston grinding down to two centimeters 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.780
 metal 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:20.090
 to reduce its weight white liquid 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.810
 is a lubricant cooling surface 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.810
 the download process 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.700
 on another milling machine is cut off 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.500
 part of which is called the dome 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.350
 he will not touch others 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.090
 parts moving inside cylinder and piston 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.190
 there must be a strictly defined form and 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.980
 size some of them when working 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:47.670
 engine make up to 6000 movements up 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:49.440
 and down then on a lathe with 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.330
 the outer side is cut off 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.490
 a layer of metal thick with hair 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.350
 this stress enables the piston 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.560
 slightly increase in volume when inside 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.610
 cylinder temperature rises 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.770
 automatic drill makes two 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.480
 intersecting oil intake 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.110
 holes to improve the mask 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.110
 piston pin 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.980
 Now another mechanism engraves 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.980
 model and date of production 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.030
 worker removes sharp edges 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.010
 formed at runtime 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.720
 previous operations to do 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.730
 the surface is even smoother it 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.560
 uses a belt grinder 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:32.760
 sharp edges can damage the walls 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:35.040
 cylinder on this machine tools 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.930
 some metals are cut off 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:42.180
 parts of the bore so that the piston pin 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:44.400
 ideally walked inside after 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.650
 milling completed the jet under high 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.930
 pressure is washed by the pistons hot and 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.240
 ionized water after such a cleaning 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.420
 all traces of grease and oil are removed 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.190
 and after drying under the air cannon these 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.060
 pistons ready to start their endless 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.060
 movements
