there<00:00:56.860> we<00:00:57.860> have<00:00:57.980> the<00:00:58.010> rock<00:00:58.370> deflecting<00:00:59.120> water

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
there we have the rock deflecting water

there we have the rock deflecting water
to<00:00:59.660> the<00:01:00.040> strawberry

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
to the strawberry

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.130 
to the strawberry
better<00:01:03.590> which<00:01:03.980> is<00:01:04.150> growing<00:01:05.150> roots<00:01:05.390> rapidly

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
better which is growing roots rapidly

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.010 
better which is growing roots rapidly
and<00:01:06.560> that<00:01:06.820> end<00:01:07.820> is<00:01:08.000> not<00:01:08.240> growing<00:01:08.510> roots<00:01:08.780> which

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
was cut off from the main plan but it's

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.500 
was cut off from the main plan but it's
sending<00:01:12.680> out<00:01:12.770> still<00:01:13.370> a<00:01:13.580> runner<00:01:13.850> and<00:01:14.120> getting

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
sending out still a runner and getting

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.080 
sending out still a runner and getting
new<00:01:14.660> foliage<00:01:15.250> from<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:16.430> nutrients<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.030> the

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
new foliage from the nutrients and the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.130 
new foliage from the nutrients and the
rocks<00:01:17.770> so<00:01:18.770> the<00:01:19.640> akwa<00:01:19.880> product<00:01:20.240> system<00:01:20.390> micro

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
rocks so the akwa product system micro

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.500 
rocks so the akwa product system micro
scale<00:01:21.410> works<00:01:21.850> if<00:01:22.850> you<00:01:22.970> had<00:01:23.119> to<00:01:23.270> start

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
scale works if you had to start

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.570 
scale works if you had to start
seedlings<00:01:23.810> you<00:01:24.560> could<00:01:24.740> just<00:01:24.860> sprinkle<00:01:25.340> seeds

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
seedlings you could just sprinkle seeds

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.940 
seedlings you could just sprinkle seeds
on<00:01:25.790> like<00:01:26.030> I<00:01:26.150> did<00:01:26.390> and<00:01:26.930> you<00:01:27.229> will<00:01:27.350> have<00:01:27.470> starts

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
on like I did and you will have starts

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.170 
on like I did and you will have starts
within<00:01:28.490> a<00:01:28.670> few<00:01:28.820> days<00:01:29.710> now<00:01:30.710> we'll<00:01:31.490> go<00:01:31.520> over<00:01:31.729> to

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
within a few days now we'll go over to

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.280 
within a few days now we'll go over to
the<00:01:32.360> the<00:01:33.520> system<00:01:34.520> is<00:01:34.670> complete<00:01:35.030> running<00:01:35.990> drain

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
the the system is complete running drain

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.550 
the the system is complete running drain
system<00:01:36.800> and<00:01:37.040> the<00:01:37.880> bubbles<00:01:38.119> there<00:01:38.600> add<00:01:38.899> to<00:01:39.470> the

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
system and the bubbles there add to the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.030 
system and the bubbles there add to the
tank<00:01:39.830> below<00:01:40.750> and<00:01:41.750> it's<00:01:41.990> a<00:01:42.080> slow<00:01:42.290> drain<00:01:42.560> fills

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
tank below and it's a slow drain fills

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.980 
tank below and it's a slow drain fills
up<00:01:43.220> about<00:01:43.460> a<00:01:43.520> quarter<00:01:43.759> of<00:01:43.940> the<00:01:44.030> way<00:01:44.210> once<00:01:44.780> in<00:01:44.930> a

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
up about a quarter of the way once in a

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.300 
up about a quarter of the way once in a
while<00:01:45.140> and<00:01:45.350> then<00:01:45.440> drains<00:01:45.710> out<00:01:45.920> with<00:01:46.160> the

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
while and then drains out with the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.180 
while and then drains out with the
weight<00:01:46.750> so<00:01:47.750> it's<00:01:48.140> quite<00:01:48.380> an<00:01:48.500> isolated<00:01:49.009> system

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
weight so it's quite an isolated system

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.730 
weight so it's quite an isolated system
that<00:01:49.580> way<00:01:49.780> another<00:01:50.780> go<00:01:51.020> and<00:01:51.229> look<00:01:51.530> at<00:01:51.649> the

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
that way another go and look at the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.320 
that way another go and look at the
crayfish<00:01:52.040> over<00:01:52.610> here<00:01:54.520> and<00:01:55.520> that<00:01:55.729> is<00:01:55.880> our<00:01:56.030> herd

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
crayfish over here and that is our herd

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.370 
crayfish over here and that is our herd
of<00:01:56.509> baby<00:01:56.780> crayfish<00:01:57.380> right<00:01:57.649> there

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
of baby crayfish right there

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.770 
of baby crayfish right there
I'll<00:01:59.100> clinging<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.820> piece<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.060> plate<00:02:00.450> food

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
I'll clinging to a piece of plate food

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.570 
I'll clinging to a piece of plate food
each<00:02:01.740> one<00:02:02.039> of<00:02:02.070> them

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
each one of them

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.280 
each one of them
not<00:02:04.090> sure<00:02:04.330> if<00:02:04.420> we'll<00:02:04.570> be<00:02:04.720> able<00:02:04.750> to<00:02:04.960> see<00:02:05.110> them

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
not sure if we'll be able to see them

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.760 
not sure if we'll be able to see them
moving<00:02:05.530> but<00:02:06.780> this<00:02:07.780> is<00:02:07.900> an<00:02:08.020> eddy<00:02:08.200> current<00:02:08.649> in

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
moving but this is an eddy current in

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.550 
moving but this is an eddy current in
the<00:02:08.890> tank<00:02:09.160> as<00:02:09.369> well<00:02:09.580> where<00:02:10.300> things<00:02:11.110> collect

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
the tank as well where things collect

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.430 
the tank as well where things collect
naturally<00:02:12.100> like<00:02:12.310> in<00:02:12.460> the<00:02:12.550> Pacific<00:02:13.000> Ocean<00:02:13.440> so

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
naturally like in the Pacific Ocean so

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.200 
naturally like in the Pacific Ocean so
all<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.860> little<00:02:15.100> crayfish<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.700> collect

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
all the little crayfish and collect

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.280 
all the little crayfish and collect
appears<00:02:16.630> like<00:02:16.930> Kieran<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:19.630> there

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
appears like Kieran and there

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.340 
appears like Kieran and there
way<00:02:20.590> as<00:02:20.769> fast<00:02:21.069> as<00:02:21.310> they<00:02:21.430> can<00:02:21.670> sing

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
way as fast as they can sing

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.130 
way as fast as they can sing
big<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.710> strong<00:02:23.210> we<00:02:24.210> looked<00:02:24.450> at<00:02:24.690> at<00:02:24.870> first

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
big and strong we looked at at first

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.530 
big and strong we looked at at first
when<00:02:25.410> you<00:02:25.590> see<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.640> release<00:02:26.940> from<00:02:27.210> the<00:02:27.240> mother

when you see the release from the mother

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.880 
when you see the release from the mother
just<00:02:27.990> that<00:02:28.320> they<00:02:28.500> get<00:02:29.400> scattered<00:02:29.790> when<00:02:30.150> she

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
just that they get scattered when she

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.970 
just that they get scattered when she
afraid<00:02:31.990> but<00:02:32.990> if<00:02:33.290> you<00:02:33.380> touch<00:02:33.620> them<00:02:33.830> with<00:02:33.860> a

and survival explain hi actually so

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.070 
and survival explain hi actually so
we've<00:02:45.890> got<00:02:46.070> over<00:02:46.190> 20<00:02:46.640> here<00:02:46.850> now<00:02:47.000> and<00:02:47.270> there's

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080
