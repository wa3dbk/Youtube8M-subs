00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.519
 hello that such friends my name is Jorge 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.740
 you are on your channel hbo pay-per-view on 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.320
 this video we're going to another app that I 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.590
 loved it and that I call it the best 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.109
 translator of the actor this will not translate 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.300
 offline if you are looking for a translator that 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.249
 work offline Czech link here 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.250
 down in the entry that I am 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:28.790
 leaving at this time 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.010
 well that's called interlake is free 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.529
 at this moment you simply have to 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.379
 start it 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.750
 and this looks like this friendly way if you 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.090
 you are 7 years old you will look different 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.000
 that appear with a more renovated style 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.789
 much more intuitive good cleaner 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.980
 better or better and because I like it 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:51.040
 so much because the second one is the best 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:54.909
 translator of lapses simply because 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.190
 if we are going to spend a word cake that 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.320
 you know what it is to drink when you go 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.210
 writing you are putting the options 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.719
 that is, sometimes you do not know how to write 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.719
 a word 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.950
 and then here you are helping 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.950
 under 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.450
 here under arrest under construction 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.790
 under control and then you simply go 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.340
 helping to get the word 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.320
 what do you want we are going to put take here tec 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.650
 you will find the options more 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.930
 searched and simply by putting translate 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.540
 translates fast or in 3g equal translates 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.520
 fast and what I like is that you 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.020
 appear you appear options in the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.670
 general part of a verb appears 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.060
 how to attend I would catch hold 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.100
 in medication in fish 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.159
 when you fish you appear too many 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.780
 options on a single word and 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.990
 mostly when you go to a translator 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.670
 I wanted to take you so that you see the 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.259
 first option that is to take that is the 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.380
 general that you would see in any other 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:00.680
 video but another part that brings by 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.899
 example are you fishing and ticketek take 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.729
 well you would not understand it here says that 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.450
 to say would be like chopping or the fish 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.610
 good peak on my part and this would be 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.850
 all girls the other videos right now 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.980
 I'm going up with about 45 and 2 about 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.980
