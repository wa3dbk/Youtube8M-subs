there<00:01:39.100> is<00:01:39.370> a<00:01:39.400> bar<00:01:40.180> so<00:01:40.990> it'll<00:01:41.320> go<00:01:41.500> all<00:01:41.770> the<00:01:42.160> way

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
there is a bar so it'll go all the way

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.720 
there is a bar so it'll go all the way
give<00:01:43.060> it<00:01:43.210> anywhere<00:01:43.690> from<00:01:44.050> 5<00:01:44.410> to<00:01:44.440> 10<00:01:44.740> minutes<00:01:45.490> it

give it anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes it
can<00:01:45.820> go<00:01:46.000> as<00:01:46.150> long<00:01:46.300> as<00:01:46.480> that<00:01:47.100> sometimes<00:01:48.100> it'll

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
can go as long as that sometimes it'll

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.130 
can go as long as that sometimes it'll
take<00:01:48.640> 1<00:01:48.940> minute<00:01:49.150> depending<00:01:49.360> on<00:01:49.720> how<00:01:49.930> much

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
take 1 minute depending on how much

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.740 
take 1 minute depending on how much
storage<00:01:51.130> you<00:01:51.280> had<00:01:51.610> on<00:01:51.790> it<00:01:51.970> I<00:01:52.120> had<00:01:52.270> a<00:01:52.300> lot<00:01:52.630> of

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
storage you had on it I had a lot of

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.980 
storage you had on it I had a lot of
storage<00:01:52.990> I'd<00:01:53.170> over<00:01:53.440> 150<00:01:54.250> apps<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.780> it<00:01:55.870> could

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
storage I'd over 150 apps so it could

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.960 
storage I'd over 150 apps so it could
take<00:01:56.080> up<00:01:56.230> a<00:01:56.320> lot<00:01:56.530> so<00:01:56.830> mine<00:01:57.430> will<00:01:57.580> probably<00:01:57.850> take

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
take up a lot so mine will probably take

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.600 
take up a lot so mine will probably take
about<00:01:58.090> 5<00:01:58.420> minutes<00:01:58.450> most<00:01:58.870> likely<00:01:59.230> but<00:01:59.920> once

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
about 5 minutes most likely but once

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.520 
about 5 minutes most likely but once
that<00:02:00.790> bar<00:02:01.090> goes<00:02:01.600> all<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:01.870> way<00:02:01.990> from<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.290> left

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
that bar goes all the way from the left

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.620 
that bar goes all the way from the left
to<00:02:03.010> the<00:02:03.100> right<00:02:03.130> it'll<00:02:03.730> go<00:02:03.970> through<00:02:04.240> and

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
to the right it'll go through and

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.170 
to the right it'll go through and
that'll<00:02:05.530> be<00:02:05.620> it<00:02:05.710> all<00:02:06.460> right<00:02:06.610> if<00:02:06.790> you<00:02:06.910> guys<00:02:07.030> have
