that<00:00:20.490> has<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.699> loop<00:00:20.970> at<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.150> top<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.570> have<00:00:21.600> no

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
that has a loop at the top I have no

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.960 
that has a loop at the top I have no
idea<00:00:22.199> what<00:00:22.350> those<00:00:22.470> are<00:00:22.650> called<00:00:22.920> but<00:00:23.250> that

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
idea what those are called but that

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.429 
idea what those are called but that
would<00:00:24.150> be<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.330> really<00:00:24.720> good<00:00:24.930> way<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.140> add

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
would be a really good way to add

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.710 
would be a really good way to add
stirring<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:26.160> as<00:00:26.460> opposed<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:27.060> gluing<00:00:27.599> it

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
stirring to this as opposed to gluing it

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.950 
stirring to this as opposed to gluing it
on<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.990> back<00:00:28.170> because<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.890> might<00:00:29.429> come<00:00:29.699> off

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
on the back because it might come off

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.260 
on the back because it might come off
eventually<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.410> could<00:00:31.590> also<00:00:31.769> find<00:00:32.759> different

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
eventually you could also find different

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.750 
eventually you could also find different
sizes<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.840> wood<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.890> make<00:00:35.340> them<00:00:35.520> into

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
sizes of wood and make them into

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.459 
sizes of wood and make them into
