was in the yellow jersey so it even

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.130 
was in the yellow jersey so it even
added<00:00:51.519> more<00:00:51.699> drama<00:00:52.269> to<00:00:52.510> the<00:00:52.600> whole<00:00:52.750> thing<00:00:53.019> and

the more people wanted to talk to him

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.540 
the more people wanted to talk to him
then<00:00:55.449> maybe<00:00:55.690> normal<00:00:56.260> but<00:00:56.410> just<00:00:56.559> because<00:00:56.710> they

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
then maybe normal but just because they

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.000 
then maybe normal but just because they
didn't<00:00:57.789> know<00:00:57.820> still<00:00:58.449> who<00:00:58.629> we<00:00:58.660> really<00:00:58.989> were<00:00:59.320> at

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010

didn't know still who we really were at
that<00:01:00.219> point<00:01:00.519> and<00:01:00.699> so<00:01:00.879> it<00:01:01.030> was<00:01:01.149> an<00:01:01.239> interesting

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
that point and so it was an interesting

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.720 
that point and so it was an interesting
space<00:01:02.230> for<00:01:02.530> the<00:01:02.620> media<00:01:02.890> to<00:01:02.920> be<00:01:03.129> in<00:01:03.280> and<00:01:03.460> for<00:01:03.640> us

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
which in and I did that as well as a as

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.050 
which in and I did that as well as a as
a<00:01:20.200> writer<00:01:20.500> I<00:01:20.619> did<00:01:20.829> the<00:01:20.920> world's<00:01:21.220> many<00:01:21.640> times<00:01:21.880> a

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
a writer I did the world's many times a

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.039 
a writer I did the world's many times a
four-man<00:01:22.840> team<00:01:23.020> time<00:01:23.259> trial<00:01:23.530> that<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:25.810> so

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
four-man team time trial that it's so

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:27.960 
four-man team time trial that it's so
much<00:01:26.229> different<00:01:26.409> than<00:01:26.680> a<00:01:26.799> nine-man<00:01:27.340> team<00:01:27.700> time

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
much different than a nine-man team time

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.480 
much different than a nine-man team time
trial<00:01:28.329> you<00:01:28.810> can't<00:01:29.049> imagine<00:01:29.259> just<00:01:30.100> because<00:01:30.310> the

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
trial you can't imagine just because the

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.149 
trial you can't imagine just because the
speed<00:01:30.759> is<00:01:30.880> higher<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.899> the<00:01:32.140> technical<00:01:32.799> part

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
speed is higher the the technical part

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.700 
speed is higher the the technical part
of<00:01:33.280> it<00:01:33.399> is<00:01:33.520> just<00:01:33.759> it<00:01:34.030> mean<00:01:34.899> nine<00:01:35.140> riders<00:01:35.380> is<00:01:35.680> a

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
of it is just it mean nine riders is a

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.830 
of it is just it mean nine riders is a
long<00:01:35.979> line<00:01:36.250> and<00:01:36.610> you<00:01:37.360> get<00:01:37.509> in<00:01:37.630> there<00:01:37.810> and

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
long line and you get in there and

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.539 
long line and you get in there and
you're<00:01:38.049> you<00:01:38.320> know<00:01:38.439> you're<00:01:38.469> on<00:01:38.649> disc<00:01:39.250> wheels

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549

were not used to that they had not done

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.700 
were not used to that they had not done
that<00:01:45.729> before<00:01:46.240> and<00:01:46.390> we<00:01:47.049> had<00:01:47.170> not<00:01:47.320> trained<00:01:47.619> for

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
that before and we had not trained for

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.789 
that before and we had not trained for
it<00:01:47.890> and<00:01:48.100> so<00:01:49.110> there<00:01:50.110> wasn't<00:01:50.259> much<00:01:50.469> to<00:01:50.649> say

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
it and so there wasn't much to say

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.080 
it and so there wasn't much to say
except<00:01:51.130> just<00:01:51.369> get<00:01:51.490> out<00:01:51.610> there<00:01:51.640> and<00:01:51.789> do<00:01:51.939> your

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
except just get out there and do your

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.990 
except just get out there and do your
best<00:01:52.299> and<00:01:52.659> they<00:01:53.320> did<00:01:53.500> their<00:01:53.649> best<00:01:53.829> but<00:01:54.100> we<00:01:54.280> we

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
best and they did their best but we we

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.420 
best and they did their best but we we
did<00:01:55.119> a<00:01:55.149> terrible<00:01:55.450> job<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:56.649> was<00:01:56.799> worse<00:01:56.979> it<00:01:57.310> was

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
did a terrible job it was worse it was

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.950 
did a terrible job it was worse it was
the<00:01:57.579> worst<00:01:57.729> team<00:01:58.030> time<00:01:58.270> trial<00:01:58.539> I've<00:01:58.659> ever<00:01:58.810> seen

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
the worst team time trial I've ever seen

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.229 
the worst team time trial I've ever seen
in<00:01:59.020> my<00:01:59.140> life
