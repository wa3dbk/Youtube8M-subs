00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
rocks I got some marker rock it says 25

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.020 
rocks I got some marker rock it says 25
pounds<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.570> dry<00:00:30.570> rock<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:31.769> was<00:00:31.890> about<00:00:32.070> $60<00:00:32.820> the

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
pounds of dry rock it was about $60 the

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.270 
pounds of dry rock it was about $60 the
cheapest<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.480> could<00:00:33.750> find<00:00:34.110> online<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:34.829> it's<00:00:35.010> a

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
cheapest I could find online so it's a

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.970 
cheapest I could find online so it's a
really<00:00:35.910> good<00:00:36.180> deal<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.719> went<00:00:37.440> with<00:00:37.530> dry<00:00:37.770> rock

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
really good deal I went with dry rock

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.530 
really good deal I went with dry rock
simply<00:00:38.309> because<00:00:38.610> I<00:00:38.760> had<00:00:38.850> a<00:00:38.879> 10<00:00:39.149> gallon<00:00:39.329> reef

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
simply because I had a 10 gallon reef

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.770 
simply because I had a 10 gallon reef
tank<00:00:39.600> before<00:00:40.309> I<00:00:41.309> read<00:00:41.969> live<00:00:42.210> rock<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:42.629> that

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
tank before I read live rock in that

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.400 
tank before I read live rock in that
system<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.320> was<00:00:43.440> really<00:00:43.680> expensive<00:00:45.289> then<00:00:46.289> I'm

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
system it was really expensive then I'm

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.139 
system it was really expensive then I'm
pretty<00:00:46.739> sure<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.370> rock<00:00:47.520> was<00:00:47.760> leaking

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
pretty sure that the rock was leaking

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.910 
pretty sure that the rock was leaking
phosphates<00:00:48.690> because<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.140> could<00:00:49.410> not<00:00:49.590> control

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
phosphates because I could not control

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.569 
phosphates because I could not control
my<00:00:50.129> green<00:00:50.910> hair<00:00:51.149> allergy<00:00:51.539> problem<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.309> the<00:00:53.309> dry

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
my green hair allergy problem so the dry

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.459 
my green hair allergy problem so the dry
rock<00:00:53.789> simply<00:00:54.449> because<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.899> just<00:00:55.050> don't<00:00:55.230> want<00:00:55.379> to

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
rock simply because I just don't want to

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.110 
rock simply because I just don't want to
go<00:00:55.530> into<00:00:55.710> any<00:00:56.010> algae<00:00:56.430> problems

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
to island kind of aquascape I might

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.980 
to island kind of aquascape I might
change<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.200> up<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.530> future<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:35.810> got<00:01:36.810> some

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.650 
the only problem besides that with these
bulbs<00:02:07.950> would<00:02:08.280> just<00:02:08.520> be<00:02:08.700> like<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.420> color

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
bulbs would just be like the color

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.930 
bulbs would just be like the color
spectrum<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.500> how<00:02:10.709> they<00:02:11.160> could<00:02:11.220> keep<00:02:11.489> corals

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
spectrum and how they could keep corals

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.780 
spectrum and how they could keep corals
like<00:02:12.209> I'm<00:02:12.360> playing

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
like I'm playing

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.470 
like I'm playing
switching<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:14.010> coral<00:02:15.010> plusses<00:02:15.489> and<00:02:15.790> coral

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
switching to coral plusses and coral

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.750 
switching to coral plusses and coral
blues<00:02:16.719> and<00:02:17.019> stuff<00:02:17.079> like<00:02:17.290> that<00:02:17.439> from<00:02:17.590> ATI<00:02:18.010> I've

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
blues and stuff like that from ATI I've

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.789 
blues and stuff like that from ATI I've
heard<00:02:19.030> those<00:02:19.180> bulbs<00:02:19.510> can<00:02:19.870> keep<00:02:20.290> SPS

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
heard those bulbs can keep SPS

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.660 
heard those bulbs can keep SPS
comfortably<00:02:21.370> so<00:02:22.269> I<00:02:22.299> might<00:02:23.280> get<00:02:24.280> some<00:02:24.489> of<00:02:24.519> those

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
comfortably so I might get some of those

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.800 
comfortably so I might get some of those
in<00:02:24.849> the<00:02:24.909> future<00:02:25.799> as<00:02:26.799> a<00:02:26.859> water<00:02:27.219> flow<00:02:27.659> right<00:02:28.659> now

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
in the future as a water flow right now

got<00:04:03.310> some<00:04:03.699> red<00:04:04.689> sea<00:04:05.049> salt<00:04:05.859> heard<00:04:06.669> it's<00:04:06.819> really

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
got some red sea salt heard it's really

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.679 
got some red sea salt heard it's really
good<00:04:07.239> the<00:04:07.359> coral<00:04:07.659> plus<00:04:08.109> a<00:04:08.500> coral<00:04:09.250> pro<00:04:09.519> salt<00:04:10.000> so

good the coral plus a coral pro salt so

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:12.809 
good the coral plus a coral pro salt so
I'm<00:04:11.079> gonna<00:04:11.169> be<00:04:11.349> using<00:04:11.650> that<00:04:11.949> salt<00:04:12.340> my<00:04:12.549> reef

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
I'm gonna be using that salt my reef

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
can see the glass is a little bit dirty

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.510 
can see the glass is a little bit dirty
so<00:04:23.020> I'm<00:04:23.200> going<00:04:23.320> to<00:04:23.409> also<00:04:23.800> be<00:04:24.039> going<00:04:24.310> up

so I'm going to also be going up

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.810 
so I'm going to also be going up
Petsmart<00:04:25.090> Apeco<00:04:25.450> so<00:04:25.630> I'm

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
Petsmart Apeco so I'm

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.460 
Petsmart Apeco so I'm
that<00:04:26.030> to<00:04:27.460> get<00:04:28.460> a<00:04:28.490> mag<00:04:28.730> flow<00:04:29.060> some<00:04:29.510> of<00:04:29.660> the<00:04:30.140> algae

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
that to get a mag flow some of the algae

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.350 
that to get a mag flow some of the algae
scrapers<00:04:30.830> that<00:04:30.860> you<00:04:31.040> can<00:04:31.160> just<00:04:31.340> move<00:04:32.000> over<00:04:32.270> the

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
scrapers that you can just move over the

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.470 
scrapers that you can just move over the
glass<00:04:32.540> and<00:04:33.550> yes<00:04:34.550> that's<00:04:34.820> basically<00:04:35.060> all<00:04:35.270> I'm

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
glass and yes that's basically all I'm

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.660 
glass and yes that's basically all I'm
using<00:04:35.660> for<00:04:35.930> this<00:04:35.990> tank<00:04:36.260> what<00:04:37.250> I'm<00:04:37.340> using<00:04:37.520> the

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
using for this tank what I'm using the

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.690 
using for this tank what I'm using the
cycle<00:04:38.000> this<00:04:38.090> tank<00:04:38.330> is<00:04:39.010> stability<00:04:41.260> you<00:04:42.260> dose

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
cycle this tank is stability you dose

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.430 
cycle this tank is stability you dose
let's<00:04:43.700> see<00:04:43.910> I<00:04:44.120> don't<00:04:44.720> know<00:04:45.020> I<00:04:45.050> can't<00:04:45.290> read<00:04:45.410> that

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
let's see I don't know I can't read that

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.710 
let's see I don't know I can't read that
but<00:04:45.860> you<00:04:46.340> know<00:04:46.490> it's<00:04:46.640> about<00:04:46.730> one<00:04:47.030> capful<00:04:47.300> every

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
but you know it's about one capful every

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.350 
but you know it's about one capful every
single<00:04:47.960> day<00:04:48.110> for<00:04:48.470> seven<00:04:48.710> days<00:04:48.740> and<00:04:49.310> your<00:04:50.120> tank

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
single day for seven days and your tank

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.070 
single day for seven days and your tank
should<00:04:50.570> be<00:04:50.750> able<00:04:50.840> to<00:04:51.020> cycle<00:04:51.230> but<00:04:52.900> I'm<00:04:53.900> just

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
should be able to cycle but I'm just

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.350 
should be able to cycle but I'm just
gonna<00:04:54.170> wait<00:04:54.380> test<00:04:54.650> you<00:04:54.740> the<00:04:54.860> diatoms<00:04:55.400> and<00:04:55.970> then

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
gonna wait test you the diatoms and then

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.590 
gonna wait test you the diatoms and then
wait<00:04:56.750> about<00:04:57.020> two<00:04:57.730> one<00:04:58.730> to<00:04:58.850> two<00:04:59.000> weeks<00:04:59.150> after<00:04:59.390> I

wait about two one to two weeks after I

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.110 
wait about two one to two weeks after I
see<00:04:59.810> the<00:04:59.840> diatoms<00:05:00.440> and<00:05:00.890> add<00:05:01.310> my<00:05:01.520> cleanup<00:05:01.910> crew

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
see the diatoms and add my cleanup crew

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.180 
see the diatoms and add my cleanup crew
and<00:05:02.420> then<00:05:02.540> a<00:05:02.870> week<00:05:03.110> later<00:05:03.140> and<00:05:03.620> start<00:05:03.860> adding
