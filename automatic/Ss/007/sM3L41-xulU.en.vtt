00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
songbird populations have increased but

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.070 
songbird populations have increased but
just<00:04:13.310> because<00:04:13.490> wolves<00:04:13.880> change<00:04:14.420> the<00:04:14.630> landscape

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
just because wolves change the landscape

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.260 
just because wolves change the landscape
in<00:04:15.200> one<00:04:15.410> place<00:04:15.680> does<00:04:16.460> that<00:04:16.640> mean<00:04:16.940> it'll<00:04:17.120> happen

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.270 
in one place does that mean it'll happen

everywhere they appear were Singh and
Dellinger<00:04:22.670> think<00:04:22.970> that<00:04:23.150> seeing<00:04:23.450> things<00:04:23.750> from

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
Dellinger think that seeing things from

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.080 
Dellinger think that seeing things from
the<00:04:24.110> deers<00:04:24.380> point<00:04:24.710> of<00:04:24.830> view<00:04:25.070> could<00:04:25.520> be<00:04:25.580> key<00:04:25.940> to

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
the deers point of view could be key to

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.230 
the deers point of view could be key to
answering<00:04:26.480> this<00:04:26.660> question<00:04:26.840> I<00:04:27.670> think<00:04:28.670> the<00:04:29.030> most

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
answering this question I think the most

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.750 
answering this question I think the most
surprising<00:04:29.420> thing<00:04:30.080> is<00:04:30.110> how<00:04:30.640> individual<00:04:31.640> these

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
surprising thing is how individual these

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.000 
surprising thing is how individual these
deer<00:04:32.060> are<00:04:34.210> it's<00:04:35.210> a<00:04:35.300> lot<00:04:35.450> like<00:04:35.600> people<00:04:35.780> you<00:04:36.470> get

can actually see them nibbling the

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.520 
can actually see them nibbling the
lichen<00:04:43.460> yeah<00:04:43.880> the<00:04:44.210> deer<00:04:44.600> leans<00:04:44.960> down<00:04:45.080> to<00:04:45.230> eat

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
lichen yeah the deer leans down to eat

the camera pans down with it so you can

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.700
