00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:41.190
 at the beginning of this 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.770
 paris and more talk very very enjoyable 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.329
 that the original concept of the club 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.910
 chapultepec sports center 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.769
 tennis in its origins and well then 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.980
 we have support in being here in a 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:55.650
 scenario that good bar in history 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.809
 phenomenal and especially a lot and a lot 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.790
 profit and a lot of honor to tennis 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.309
 mexican that is the rafael stadium 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.739
 peninsula without a doubt that is the 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.350
 enclosure where greater glories has given to the 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.880
 Mexican tennis without demerit some 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.490
 other scenarios have not taken 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.410
 also great glories in tennis like 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.539
 German story in short in other 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.060
 facilities but here during 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:20.820
 many years it was the seat of not only the 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.190
 Pan-American tournament we're going with a 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.350
 Pan-American also headquarters of the major 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.630
 number of Davis cup series in the 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.119
 history of this country this is so 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.149
 beautiful also designed was built 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.220
 in the period from 1922 to 1924 according to 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.050
 resources with which we have such 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.390
 way that when the bank of mexico 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.420
 acquires these facilities already counted 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.090
 with this enclosure as background 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.470
 very accurate of this stage initially 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:52.110
 It was made of wood and later it was 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.570
 kept its shape as we find it today 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.619
 for today and the construction was done 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.289
 as such being the first of its kind 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:03.600
 and remembering that this is the first of 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.430
 only two that was the most recent 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.340
 from the Pan - American Center of Guadalajara 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.259
 due to the costs rose on 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.850
 Last year there is no doubt that 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.410
 this venue is 100% avant-garde without 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.390
 place to doubts considering the time in 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.840
 the one that was built reason we thought that 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.430
 10 thousand 822 ads 24 I do not know the 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.680
 data but surely there were not many 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.739
 statisticians in the world like this 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.189
 now something very important that happened in 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.739
 the year of 1962 where for the first time 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:38.170
 has a Davis Cup final that 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.329
 unfortunately we lost it in this 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.219
 against australia for next comes the 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:46.030
 unfortunate death our very dear 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:48.730
 rafael pelón osuna in the year 1969 in 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.409
 that tragic plane where he cut the 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.599
 If I played life going to one of the 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:54.700
 men it would have been that it was but 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.280
 would have been the most remembered 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.829
 if he could have confirmed his career 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.530
 someone here was formed to someone who 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:06.660
 he was part of this magnificent community 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:09.930
 and it has a beautiful memory we have organ 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.090
 forest hill won wimbledon made 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.670
 magnificent couple with the set of 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.890
 palafox in short who has not paraded by 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.530
 here that who can forget about 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.670
 that wonderful end and between raúl 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.320
 ramírez and mikonos December 1975 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.090
 where being jimmy as number one 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.069
 of the world 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.950
 raúl ramírez winning the elusive point 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.319
 to calculate to usa cup type 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.780
 that we all remember that it concludes a 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:38.510
 Monday, some of us escaped from 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.730
 keys to come to see the conclusion of 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.430
 that wonderful point and this scenario 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.280
 It's still the house of temps, so 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.190
 just returned again 9 during 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.290
 a period I believe that the authorities 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:55.160
 with a certain vision of promoting and promoting 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.650
 tennis nationally decided 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.610
 look for other places to bring the cup 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.680
 davis as a stage where I could 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.500
 have some concern among young people 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.510
 for the practice of this sport it 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.849
 he decided to do it like that I think his 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.090
 results of truth but finally in 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:16.880
 the year of 2001 and back here to the center 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.620
 sporty chapultepec your house where 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.090
 Since then, it has practically 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.430
 brought the highest number of Davis Cup 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.480
 so celebrated says done to the day 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.940
 from today 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.280
 it's not some davis cup held against 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.960
 el salvador héctor gastón villegas 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.270
 president of medical care me 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.220
 tennis already announced it as the house 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.280
 permanent the Davis Cup 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.290
 I must estimate the conditions 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.420
 techniques like this does not admit it will be played here is 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.240
 something that some favoring another 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.820
 surface other heights can be moved 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.800
 but in itself it gives us great joy that 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:53.540
 be recognized again as the home of 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:56.510
 the tennis player who returned to the cup 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:58.760
 davis al sports in 2001 have been 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:02.120
 played 10 series and has only been lost 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.730
 one last year against Colombia with a 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.320
 very strong team very powerful with the 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.510
 marias players within 100 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.830
 best in the world but I always 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:12.710
 I write that he was he has a great 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.540
 space 9 a magic where I believe that 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.660
 each and every one of the players that 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:20.150
 here they gave their best they left a 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.100
 a little bit of his spirit 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.380
 the honor of that struggle to carry and 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:27.050
 defend the colors of mexico and that by 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:29.330

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.900

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.780
 Mexican society throughout its 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.270
 recent history but it has also arrived 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:41.960
