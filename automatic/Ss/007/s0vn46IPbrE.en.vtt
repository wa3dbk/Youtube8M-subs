00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:26.000
 The Soviet government praised Stalingrad as the city of heroes during World War II. 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.500
 The bloody battle here reverses the situation of the Second World War 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.800
 "Chariot World" is a military game based on history 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.200
 We want to make this map both fun and historical. 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.000
 One of the problems is that Stalinger was almost flattened during the war. 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.150
 Only the broken wall 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.900
 The whole city is as desolate as the moon's surface 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.950
 So we decided to present Stalingrad at a specific time, that is, only destroying half of it. 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:11.350
 This is very difficult from the point of view of the test, because there is not much historical data, it is difficult to reconstruct the entire terrain. 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.500
 And architecture, especially in the late 1930s and early 1940s 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.200
 The best place to make a map is to choose a location. 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.800
 Position determines the tone of the entire map 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:35.200
 Therefore, choosing the right location and good theme is very important and determines the final quality of the map. 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.800
 We surveyed the site and observed the face of the city. 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.750
 The distance between the buildings must be estimated, so a lot of photos were taken 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.600
 You can say that we made this map based on impressions. 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.650
 We must rebuild the former residential and industrial areas of Stalingrad 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.850
 So rely heavily on aerial photography 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.000
 But there is only one aerial photo of the area, and there is a factory in the photo. 

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.650
 Must rebuild the general shape and appearance 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.600
 In accordance with the test and historical description 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.400
 It’s very difficult to make this map because the whole city is flat. 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.650
 Almost Wanli 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.200
 There are no ups and downs, so it’s not easy to make the map attractive in terms of sight and beauty. 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.850
 We select the area around Lenin Square for the Stalingrad map 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.650
 The reason is to worry about the game elements 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.200
 It is quite symmetrical here, with obvious centers and well-known buildings. 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:03:01.300
 The main building on the map is the worst in battle: Pavlov Apartments, Zabroni Apartments, Flour Mills and NKVD Buildings 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.000
 These buildings have been damaged, but they are still recognized. 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.750
 Stalingrad’s buildings at the time were mostly three or four stories, very close to each other. 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.950
 We must choose several regions to draw game models from these buildings. 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.100
 The central square in front of the flour mill is also a problem 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.800
 This is a large open space, you have to add some things to be boring. 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.750
 So add car wrecks and craters, plus smoke blurred vision 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.300
 We don't want to be empty here, lest people think that this is the result of rushing work. 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.500
 We also draw river banks along the Wowa River. 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.650
 This part is very difficult to do because there is no ups and downs from the aerial picture. 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:04.200
 I remember watching the photos of the railway car and measuring the height with the historical consultant. 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.800
 Then stack the cars and determine the actual height of the slope. 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 I really like the part of the map that transitions from a high-development zone to a river valley. 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.300
 The terrain here is very small 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.950
 Already not in the city, but not a village 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.000
 Only a few houses 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.350
 See the Wowa River 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.350
 Look at it 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.250
 The scenery is beautiful 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.700
 The Wowa River is misty, the sun is shining, and the sun is shining. 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.100
 These places have spent a lot of time because we want to make a few vantage points and let the players see a lot of interesting details. 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:48.650
 As long as we can see it in a specific area, we work hard to emphasize the visual arrangement of the map. 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:57.000
 This map is probably the most accurate 3D drawing of Stalingrad at the time. 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.200
 Of course, we hope that players like this map. 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.650
 Arouse their strong feelings 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.650
 I really like this map. 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:18.800
 To be honest, I am not only engaged in my own knowledge, but also in my own emotions. I am very happy. 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.600
 I hope the players like this map as well. 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.400
 I also hope that they can enjoy it after playing.
