00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.460 
keeping our gloves from getting a little
too<00:00:49.909> sweaty<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:50.870> first<00:00:51.079> thing<00:00:51.260> we're<00:00:51.379> going

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 
too sweaty the first thing we're going

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.819 
too sweaty the first thing we're going
to<00:00:51.559> do<00:00:51.680> is<00:00:52.210> reverse<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:53.780> rat<00:00:54.019> starting<00:00:54.710> from

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
to do is reverse the rat starting from

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:01.930 
to do is reverse the rat starting from
the<00:00:54.949> velcro<00:00:55.370> side<00:00:57.460> rolling<00:00:58.460> it<00:00:58.629> inside<00:00:59.629> out<00:01:00.940> so

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
the velcro side rolling it inside out so

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.219 
the velcro side rolling it inside out so
the<00:01:02.059> way<00:01:02.180> it<00:01:02.329> would<00:01:02.420> naturally<00:01:02.600> be<00:01:03.019> wrapped

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
the way it would naturally be wrapped

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:04.359 
the way it would naturally be wrapped
around<00:01:03.350> your<00:01:03.649> hand<00:01:03.829> we're<00:01:03.980> doing<00:01:04.160> that<00:01:04.280> in

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
Reverse so that when we put it on it's a

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:15.080 
Reverse so that when we put it on it's a
