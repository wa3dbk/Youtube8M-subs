when you look at something and you hear
something<00:00:14.380> different<00:00:14.800> something<00:00:15.340> which<00:00:15.610> does

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.090 
something different something which does

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.930 
something different something which does
not<00:00:16.240> go<00:00:16.450> together<00:00:16.690> with<00:00:17.140> what<00:00:17.530> you<00:00:17.650> see<00:00:18.010> then

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:18.940

I<00:00:29.700> went<00:00:30.700> around<00:00:30.849> the<00:00:31.210> city<00:00:31.450> with<00:00:31.840> very

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
I went around the city with very

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.780 
I went around the city with very
sensitive<00:00:32.739> headphones<00:00:33.640> which<00:00:34.470> you<00:00:35.470> can<00:00:35.790> pick

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
sensitive headphones which you can pick

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.880 
sensitive headphones which you can pick
up<00:00:36.970> the<00:00:37.150> electromagnetic<00:00:37.750> waves<00:00:38.170> in<00:00:38.530> the<00:00:38.560> city

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
up the electromagnetic waves in the city

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.310 
up the electromagnetic waves in the city
and<00:00:39.399> this<00:00:39.880> means<00:00:40.149> all<00:00:40.540> the<00:00:40.600> sounds<00:00:41.290> which

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.520 

of<00:01:10.740> having<00:01:11.070> some<00:01:11.310> really<00:01:11.610> strange<00:01:12.060> cells<00:01:12.530> you

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
of having some really strange cells you

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.440 
of having some really strange cells you
don't<00:01:13.800> know<00:01:14.040> where<00:01:14.310> they<00:01:14.430> come<00:01:14.640> from<00:01:14.700> you

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
don't know where they come from you

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.390 
don't know where they come from you
think<00:01:15.750> they<00:01:15.900> are<00:01:15.930> familiar<00:01:16.560> but<00:01:16.860> somehow<00:01:17.130> they

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
think they are familiar but somehow they

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.880 
think they are familiar but somehow they
are<00:01:17.490> not<00:01:17.610> familiar<00:01:17.850> but<00:01:18.840> everything<00:01:19.440> is<00:01:19.650> not

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
are not familiar but everything is not

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.430 
are not familiar but everything is not
electronic<00:01:20.610> music<00:01:20.640> it's<00:01:21.270> not<00:01:21.510> created

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
electronic music it's not created

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.800 
electronic music it's not created
artificially<00:01:23.070> as<00:01:23.160> a<00:01:23.190> computer<00:01:23.790> everything<00:01:24.660> is

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
artificially as a computer everything is

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:37.930 
artificially as a computer everything is
live<00:01:25.020> recorded

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.420 

when<00:01:38.810> you<00:01:38.930> have<00:01:39.110> this<00:01:39.320> special<00:01:39.590> headphone<00:01:40.220> on

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
when you have this special headphone on

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.760 
when you have this special headphone on
you<00:01:40.760> become<00:01:41.120> a<00:01:41.150> little<00:01:41.270> bit<00:01:41.570> like<00:01:41.870> someone<00:01:42.440> who

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
you become a little bit like someone who

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.010 
you become a little bit like someone who
is<00:01:42.980> a<00:01:43.250> spy<00:01:43.700> or<00:01:44.170> who<00:01:45.170> is<00:01:45.380> a<00:01:45.410> detective<00:01:46.070> and

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
is a spy or who is a detective and

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.830 
is a spy or who is a detective and
normally<00:01:48.020> I<00:01:48.500> walk<00:01:49.130> very<00:01:49.340> slowly<00:01:49.580> and<00:01:50.090> when<00:01:50.810> I

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
normally I walk very slowly and when I

00:01:50.840 --> 00:02:10.169 
normally I walk very slowly and when I
hear<00:01:51.110> something<00:01:51.320> interesting<00:01:51.590> I<00:01:51.980> stop

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.420 

the<00:02:10.569> gran<00:02:10.780> vía<00:02:11.019> is<00:02:11.200> a<00:02:11.230> big<00:02:11.500> Mick<00:02:11.739> tracing<00:02:12.310> of

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
the gran vía is a big Mick tracing of

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.809 
the gran vía is a big Mick tracing of
communication<00:02:13.269> and<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.900> idea<00:02:14.260> is<00:02:14.319> of<00:02:14.819> showing

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
communication and the idea is of showing

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.729 
communication and the idea is of showing
people<00:02:16.180> in<00:02:16.390> when<00:02:16.629> everyone<00:02:17.319> is<00:02:17.500> moving

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
people in when everyone is moving

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:38.309 
people in when everyone is moving
individually<00:02:18.609> there's<00:02:18.849> kind<00:02:19.180> of<00:02:19.329> big<00:02:19.569> net

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.009 

and<00:02:38.980> I<00:02:39.099> think<00:02:39.159> you<00:02:39.400> only<00:02:39.640> can<00:02:39.909> survive<00:02:40.299> if<00:02:40.749> you

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
and I think you only can survive if you

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.729 
and I think you only can survive if you
don't<00:02:41.969> take<00:02:42.969> too<00:02:43.209> much<00:02:43.480> attention<00:02:43.689> to<00:02:44.230> all

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
don't take too much attention to all

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.949 
don't take too much attention to all
these<00:02:45.159> surrounding<00:02:45.790> noises<00:02:46.239> otherwise<00:02:46.629> it<00:02:46.840> go

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
these surrounding noises otherwise it go

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.229 
these surrounding noises otherwise it go
crazy<00:02:47.290> but<00:02:48.189> if<00:02:48.340> there<00:02:48.519> is<00:02:48.700> something<00:02:49.090> special

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
crazy but if there is something special

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.599 
crazy but if there is something special
you<00:02:49.569> concentrate<00:02:50.170> on<00:02:50.200> maybe<00:02:50.680> then<00:02:51.010> afterwards

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
you concentrate on maybe then afterwards

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:53.849 
you concentrate on maybe then afterwards
when<00:02:51.999> you<00:02:52.030> take<00:02:52.299> off<00:02:52.420> your<00:02:52.629> headphones<00:02:53.109> you

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
when you take off your headphones you

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.800 
when you take off your headphones you
will<00:02:54.069> perceive<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.760> world<00:02:54.790> in<00:02:55.239> a<00:02:55.359> little<00:02:55.629> bit

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
will perceive the world in a little bit

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:04.420 
will perceive the world in a little bit
more<00:02:56.049> different<00:02:56.920> way

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.489 

you
