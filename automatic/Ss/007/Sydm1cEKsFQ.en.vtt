line excluding the cream to powder which
I<00:01:15.420> ran<00:01:15.960> out<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.320> use<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.890> on<00:01:17.060> but<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.090> have

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
I ran out of a I use it on but I have

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.140 
I ran out of a I use it on but I have
all<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.290> rest<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.799> them<00:01:19.979> here<00:01:20.250> today<00:01:20.520> no<00:01:20.909> one's

kind<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.750> go<00:01:21.840> through<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.170> woman<00:01:22.470> tell<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.159> what

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
kind of go through a woman tell you what

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.840 
kind of go through a woman tell you what
I<00:01:23.369> thought<00:01:23.549> about<00:01:23.610> each<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.299> products<00:01:25.850> as

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
I thought about each of the products as

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.130 
I thought about each of the products as
far<00:01:27.210> as<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:28.400> minimal<00:01:29.400> powder<00:01:29.900> look<00:01:30.900> it's

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
far as the minimal powder look it's

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.100 
far as the minimal powder look it's
really<00:01:31.470> good<00:01:31.829> for<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.549> very<00:01:32.970> sheer<00:01:33.420> coverage

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
really good for a very sheer coverage

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.840 
really good for a very sheer coverage
this<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.799> just<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.970> my<00:01:36.329> opinion<00:01:36.960> for<00:01:37.409> if<00:01:38.310> you

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
this is just in my opinion for if you

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.749 
this is just in my opinion for if you
have<00:01:39.150> oily<00:01:39.990> skin<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.220> kind<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.549> want<00:01:41.700> to

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
have oily skin and you kind of want to

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.600 
have oily skin and you kind of want to
just<00:01:41.820> knock<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.840> shine<00:01:43.200> off<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:44.100> mineral

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
just knock that shine off the mineral

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.160 
just knock that shine off the mineral
powder<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:45.060> very<00:01:45.299> very<00:01:45.509> good<00:01:45.689> for<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.930> and

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
powder is very very good for that and

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.960 
powder is very very good for that and
they<00:01:46.290> have<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.530> brush<00:01:46.920> too<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.460> comes<00:01:47.700> with

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
they have a brush too that comes with

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.700 
they have a brush too that comes with
this<00:01:48.380> so<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.649> can<00:01:49.829> get<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.340> know

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
this so that you can get you know

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.859 
this so that you can get you know
a<00:01:50.740> good<00:01:52.619> clean<00:01:53.619> finish<00:01:54.190> not<00:01:54.520> too<00:01:55.090> oily<00:01:55.330> on<00:01:55.630> the

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
a good clean finish not too oily on the

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.830 
a good clean finish not too oily on the
finish<00:01:56.260> but<00:01:57.130> aside<00:01:57.850> from<00:01:57.909> that<00:01:58.180> I<00:01:58.600> would

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
finish but aside from that I would

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.870 
finish but aside from that I would
probably<00:01:59.020> use<00:01:59.500> it<00:01:59.710> also<00:01:59.890> as<00:02:00.070> a<00:02:00.190> French<00:02:00.580> powder

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
probably use it also as a French powder

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.560 
probably use it also as a French powder
once<00:02:01.300> you<00:02:01.479> apply<00:02:01.869> your<00:02:02.340> foundation<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:04.390> can

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
once you apply your foundation you can

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.749 
once you apply your foundation you can
go<00:02:04.780> back<00:02:05.020> over<00:02:05.470> with<00:02:05.710> this<00:02:06.070> to<00:02:06.280> kind<00:02:06.490> of<00:02:06.610> lock

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
go back over with this to kind of lock

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.600 
go back over with this to kind of lock
it<00:02:07.000> in<00:02:07.180> so<00:02:07.840> I<00:02:08.200> do<00:02:08.289> like<00:02:08.590> it<00:02:08.830> for<00:02:09.069> that<00:02:09.130> and

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
it in so I do like it for that and

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.400 
it in so I do like it for that and
that's<00:02:09.789> primarily<00:02:10.000> what<00:02:10.509> I<00:02:10.569> use<00:02:10.959> before<00:02:11.380> I

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
that's primarily what I use before I

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.410 
that's primarily what I use before I
didn't<00:02:11.770> just<00:02:11.920> use<00:02:12.130> it<00:02:12.340> by<00:02:12.610> itself<00:02:12.640> because

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
didn't just use it by itself because

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.390 
didn't just use it by itself because
it's<00:02:13.600> kind<00:02:13.840> of<00:02:13.900> shear<00:02:14.610> as<00:02:15.610> far<00:02:16.030> as<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:17.400> the

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
it's kind of shear as far as the the

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.590 
it's kind of shear as far as the the
luminous<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:21.000> luminous<00:02:22.000> wear<00:02:22.300> liquid

luminous the luminous wear liquid
foundation<00:02:23.410> I<00:02:23.769> tried<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:24.880> and<00:02:26.010> honestly<00:02:27.010> I<00:02:27.370> was

soon as I put it on it's just like those
oily<00:03:18.100> mess<00:03:19.120> it<00:03:19.510> doesn't<00:03:20.170> really<00:03:21.000> agree<00:03:22.000> with

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
oily mess it doesn't really agree with

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
finish I love this I try all of them and

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.870 
finish I love this I try all of them and
this<00:03:50.000> is<00:03:50.120> probably<00:03:50.360> my<00:03:50.930> favorite<00:03:51.550> like<00:03:52.550> I<00:03:52.640> said

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
this is probably my favorite like I said

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.300 
this is probably my favorite like I said
you<00:03:53.120> can<00:03:53.270> use<00:03:53.300> it<00:03:53.600> for<00:03:53.810> any<00:03:54.140> type<00:03:54.410> of<00:03:54.440> skin<00:03:54.709> dry

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
you can use it for any type of skin dry

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.850 
you can use it for any type of skin dry
normal<00:03:56.030> some<00:03:56.540> of<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:56.840> skin<00:03:57.140> it<00:03:57.410> works<00:03:57.530> really

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
normal some of the skin it works really

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.860 
normal some of the skin it works really
really<00:03:57.980> well<00:03:58.220> and<00:04:00.250> the<00:04:01.250> full<00:04:01.970> coverage<00:04:02.480> it

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
really well and the full coverage it

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.920 
really well and the full coverage it
says<00:04:03.470> for<00:04:03.830> normal<00:04:04.250> to<00:04:04.280> dry<00:04:04.459> skin<00:04:04.700> and<00:04:05.420> probably

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
says for normal to dry skin and probably

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.510 
says for normal to dry skin and probably
because<00:04:06.170> it's<00:04:06.319> a<00:04:06.380> little<00:04:06.650> bit<00:04:06.800> thicker<00:04:07.100> it's

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
because it's a little bit thicker it's

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.910 
because it's a little bit thicker it's
pretty<00:04:08.030> much<00:04:08.180> almost<00:04:08.510> the<00:04:08.780> same<00:04:09.020> in<00:04:09.680> my

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
pretty much almost the same in my

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.559 
pretty much almost the same in my
opinion<00:04:10.340> as<00:04:10.459> the<00:04:10.580> medium<00:04:10.880> coverage<00:04:11.180> but<00:04:11.390> it's

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
opinion as the medium coverage but it's

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.509 
opinion as the medium coverage but it's
just<00:04:11.660> a<00:04:11.840> tad<00:04:12.140> bit<00:04:12.170> thicker<00:04:12.800> and<00:04:12.980> so<00:04:13.310> that's

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
just a tad bit thicker and so that's

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.640 
just a tad bit thicker and so that's
probably<00:04:14.000> why<00:04:14.720> they<00:04:14.959> recommend<00:04:15.140> it<00:04:15.620> for

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
probably why they recommend it for

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.370 
probably why they recommend it for
people<00:04:15.830> who<00:04:16.130> have<00:04:16.400> dry<00:04:16.880> skin<00:04:18.760> but<00:04:20.380> definitely

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
people who have dry skin but definitely

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.560 
people who have dry skin but definitely
if<00:04:21.739> all<00:04:21.950> those<00:04:22.160> fails<00:04:22.490> try<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.000> medium

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
if all those fails try the medium

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.420 
if all those fails try the medium
coverage<00:04:24.380> and<00:04:25.030> also<00:04:26.030> here<00:04:26.660> I<00:04:26.690> have<00:04:27.050> the<00:04:27.430> beauty
