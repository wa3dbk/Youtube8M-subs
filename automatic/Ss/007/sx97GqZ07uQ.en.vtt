00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
cars that go up ramps they try to run

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.630 
cars that go up ramps they try to run
you<00:00:22.350> over<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.740> try<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:22.980> snipe<00:00:23.250> them<00:00:23.430> out<00:00:23.550> of

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
you over you try to snipe them out of

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.589 
you over you try to snipe them out of
their<00:00:23.760> car<00:00:23.939> until<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:25.050> saw<00:00:25.260> someone<00:00:25.560> do<00:00:25.710> this

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
their car until I saw someone do this

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:30.140 
their car until I saw someone do this
and<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:28.170> was<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.160> little<00:00:29.310> bit<00:00:29.490> surprised<00:00:29.789> on<00:00:29.970> how

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
and I was a little bit surprised on how

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.720 
and I was a little bit surprised on how
they<00:00:30.300> did<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:31.170> kind<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.740> worked<00:00:32.160> down<00:00:32.430> how

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
they did it so I kind of worked down how

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.850 
they did it so I kind of worked down how
how<00:00:33.239> they<00:00:33.450> actually<00:00:33.570> going<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.079> get<00:00:34.230> off<00:00:34.320> the

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
how they actually going to get off the

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.639 
how they actually going to get off the
edge<00:00:35.070> just<00:00:35.820> like<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:37.050> what<00:00:37.230> happens<00:00:37.500> is

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
edge just like this so what happens is

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.670 
edge just like this so what happens is
if<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:37.860> end<00:00:38.219> up<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.879> just<00:00:39.719> glide<00:00:40.140> down<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.620> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
if you end up to just glide down to the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.139 
if you end up to just glide down to the
ground<00:00:40.860> don't<00:00:41.399> know<00:00:41.489> why<00:00:41.670> there's<00:00:41.910> happening

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
ground don't know why there's happening

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.170 
ground don't know why there's happening
that<00:00:42.390> how<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.750> happens<00:00:43.020> but<00:00:43.850> if<00:00:44.850> you're<00:00:45.059> lucky

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
that how it happens but if you're lucky

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.119 
that how it happens but if you're lucky
you<00:00:45.390> can<00:00:45.450> get<00:00:45.690> all<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.079> way<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.010> floor

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
you can get all the way to the floor

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.810 
you can get all the way to the floor
without<00:00:47.610> anybody<00:00:48.329> noticing<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.820> obviously

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
without anybody noticing and obviously

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.010 
without anybody noticing and obviously
you've<00:00:50.969> got<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.210> try<00:00:51.390> not<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.719> get<00:00:51.809> run<00:00:51.960> over

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
you've got to try not to get run over

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.790 
you've got to try not to get run over
either<00:00:53.090> so<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.149> do<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:54.989> successfully<00:00:55.140> you've

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
either so to do this successfully you've

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.350 
either so to do this successfully you've
got<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.010> do<00:00:56.100> pretty<00:00:56.309> much<00:00:56.489> exactly<00:00:56.789> what<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.120> did

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
got to do pretty much exactly what I did

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.150 
got to do pretty much exactly what I did
go<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.719> edge<00:00:57.960> if<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.590> don't<00:00:58.739> start<00:00:58.949> going

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
go to the edge if you don't start going

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.650 
go to the edge if you don't start going
down<00:00:59.280> just<00:00:59.430> go<00:00:59.579> back<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.030> try<00:01:00.300> again

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
down just go back and try again

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.630 
down just go back and try again
don't<00:01:01.289> try<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.559> keep<00:01:01.800> creep<00:01:02.070> going<00:01:02.370> further

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
don't try to keep creep going further

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.759 
don't try to keep creep going further
you<00:01:02.789> just<00:01:02.940> need<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.149> get<00:01:03.270> one<00:01:03.449> leg<00:01:04.140> off<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
you just need to get one leg off the

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.710 
you just need to get one leg off the
edge<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.869> have<00:01:06.869> one<00:01:07.350> would<00:01:07.979> still<00:01:08.490> back<00:01:09.180> just

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
edge and have one would still back just

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.020 
edge and have one would still back just
on<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.260> edge<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:11.369> shipping<00:01:11.700> container

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
on the edge of the shipping container

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.630 
on the edge of the shipping container
and<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.930> will<00:01:13.049> start<00:01:13.320> floating<00:01:14.040> down<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:14.520> like

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
and you will start floating down so like

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.550 
and you will start floating down so like
I<00:01:14.700> said<00:01:14.880> if<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.119> doesn't<00:01:15.330> work<00:01:15.450> first<00:01:15.750> go<00:01:15.930> just

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
I said if it doesn't work first go just

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.760 
I said if it doesn't work first go just
swivel<00:01:17.400> back<00:01:17.549> onto<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.360> platform<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:18.990> try<00:01:19.710> it

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
swivel back onto the platform and try it

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.010 
swivel back onto the platform and try it
again<00:01:19.920> now<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.700> guy<00:01:21.060> that's<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.450> car<00:01:21.659> over

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
again now the guy that's in the car over

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.749 
again now the guy that's in the car over
there<00:01:22.259> he<00:01:23.299> he<00:01:24.299> he<00:01:24.600> did<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.369> it<00:01:26.369> took<00:01:26.549> me<00:01:26.700> a

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
there he he he did this and it took me a

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.580 
there he he he did this and it took me a
couple<00:01:27.030> go<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.600> actually<00:01:27.990> work<00:01:28.140> out<00:01:28.290> what<00:01:28.500> he

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
couple go to actually work out what he

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.230 
couple go to actually work out what he
actually<00:01:28.770> did<00:01:29.159> but<00:01:29.400> we<00:01:29.490> worked<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.850> out

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
actually did but we worked it out

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.330 
actually did but we worked it out
and<00:01:30.329> I'm<00:01:31.290> pretty<00:01:31.560> sure<00:01:31.680> he<00:01:32.340> is

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
and I'm pretty sure he is

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.399 
and I'm pretty sure he is
right<00:01:33.939> now<00:01:34.149> that<00:01:34.450> I<00:01:34.479> am<00:01:34.750> doing<00:01:35.110> it<00:01:35.229> with<00:01:35.259> the

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
right now that I am doing it with the

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.670 
right now that I am doing it with the
same<00:01:35.680> glitch<00:01:36.479> trick<00:01:37.479> sheet<00:01:38.110> whatever<00:01:38.439> you

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
same glitch trick sheet whatever you

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.380 
same glitch trick sheet whatever you
want<00:01:38.829> to<00:01:38.890> call<00:01:39.100> it<00:01:39.280> that<00:01:39.939> he<00:01:40.630> has<00:01:41.140> done<00:01:42.390> so

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
want to call it that he has done so

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.510 
want to call it that he has done so
we're<00:01:44.229> just<00:01:44.259> going<00:01:44.560> to<00:01:44.649> float<00:01:44.920> down<00:01:45.100> here<00:01:45.399> now

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
we're just going to float down here now

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.880 
we're just going to float down here now
I<00:01:45.579> did<00:01:45.820> try<00:01:45.970> before<00:01:46.299> if<00:01:46.750> you<00:01:47.320> do<00:01:47.500> this<00:01:47.619> and<00:01:47.799> you

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
I did try before if you do this and you
