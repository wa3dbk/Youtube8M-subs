 story is not something for a player not 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.060
 has nothing to do with the multiplayer 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.820
 clarifying

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.650

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.660

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.040

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.110
 large photo line to be available 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.780
 October but there is a report in which 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:19.550
 says grand theft auto 'online goes to 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:22.760
 hold up to 32 players and not 16 this 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.770
 it was a rumor at this time the people of 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.390
 rockstar talked about this rumor but what 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.580
 I am going to comment a little bit of what it is about 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.930
 this rumor not for a report and if that 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.360
 grand theft auto 'online will be able to 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.600
 Hold up to 32 players in 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.330
 playstation 3 and xbox 360 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.400
 well, that was the rumor, not the people 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.110
 rockstar talk like that at the speed of a 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.790
 fart or it's like you eat ready 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.920

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.410
 fried and good milk rockstar people 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.120
 spoke about it to clarify this 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.920
 rumor because many people 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.780
 curuju 'street view' worldgroup believe 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.400
 but I repeat it is only a rumor and 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.620
 the roster agent talked about it and 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.290
 He said the following what great theft auto ' 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.990
 online will only hold 16 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:07.010
 players and not 32 how are you 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.720
