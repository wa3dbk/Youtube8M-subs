segment<00:06:47.290> I<00:06:47.320> want<00:06:47.410> to<00:06:47.500> talk<00:06:47.650> about<00:06:47.770> so<00:06:48.310> there's

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.550 
segment I want to talk about so there's

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.610 
segment I want to talk about so there's
a<00:06:48.640> different<00:06:49.030> ways<00:06:49.420> that<00:06:49.810> this<00:06:50.020> ending<00:06:50.440> part

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:50.620 
a different ways that this ending part

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.910 
a different ways that this ending part
of<00:06:50.680> this<00:06:50.770> chapter<00:06:50.950> could<00:06:51.340> go<00:06:51.550> now<00:06:52.440> we<00:06:53.440> have<00:06:53.650> a

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:53.920 
of this chapter could go now we have a

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.730
