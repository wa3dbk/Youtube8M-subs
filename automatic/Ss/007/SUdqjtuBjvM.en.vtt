00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.980
 it's hard to imagine a day without water 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.200
 however, and the fact that we pay for it so 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.059
 a lot of money though sometimes she doesn't 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.160
 different from the one that flows from the tap 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.870
 Americans are number one in the world 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.910
 for bottled water consumption 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.590
 but why should people overpay for 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.670
 it can manufacturers bottled 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.949
 water just us fool bottled water 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.960
 this is one big sell when you 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.970
 buy a bottle of water you pay in 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.130
 a hundred if not thousands of times more than 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.559
 to the plant that is already flowing from us 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.510
 the crane itself is almost half 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.340
 all bottled water is water from under 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.469
 tap consumers in the state at home 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.539
 home clean water as it is done on 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.039
 most plants but attractive 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.140
 advertising with glaciers and luxurious 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.180
 celebrities make this water in the eyes 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.850
 consumers such a desirable balalike 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.980
 people like children makers probably 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.660
 specifically make a bottle of this form 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.210
 which is nice to hold 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.309
 show in advertising beautiful actors 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.530
 rivers flowing down from the mountains all this 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.710
 associated with health at the very same 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.189
 In fact they hang noodles on our ears . 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.600
 Falls according to experts what 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.939
 bottled water is cleaner and safer 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.549
 water from the tap common 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.470
 delusion is pure water 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.450
 marketing ploy companies earn 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.580
 billions of dollars on selling water 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.470
 which today are more expensive than gasoline 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.970
 so we are definitely on hand that people 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.740
 consider as if the water from the tap 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.740
 more harmful than water in a bottle 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.720
 why because it just comes down to them 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.270
 with the hands of such movements as on the other side 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.680
 anti-corporation bottles 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.130
 bottled water production 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.680
 getting bigger the last three 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.149
 decades of manufacturing companies 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.430
 bottled water namely coca cola 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.380
 pepsi nst trying to convince us that 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.060
 clean and safe water can be 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.340
 only bottled what's really 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.990
 wrong drinking water manufacturers 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.090
 spend very aggressive and 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.920
 uncompromising policy profiting on 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:08.380
 water rights to which everyone has 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:10.660
 people of high countries 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.489
 pollution and in humans 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.250
 no choice but the americans 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.920
 he is surely going to you a muon of forms of power 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.480
 us more carefully regulate water quality 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.080
 from the tap than water quality in 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.680
 bottled 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.360
 Alef X-ray main problem in 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.739
 that plastic bottles in 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.500
 really accumulate in 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:31.600
 unprecedented quantities 75 percent 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.530
 bottles are dumped in the oceans and 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.900
 Rivers and lakes 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.790
 they pollute nature just 25 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.860
 percent of them are recycled and 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.430
 apparently most people think that this 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.200
 the rate is much higher now when 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.930
 energy drinking resources 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.120
 exhausted before the eyes of the Pacific 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.250
 US Institute found out that the production 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.150
 plastic bottles annually goes away from 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:57.489
 32 to 54 million barrels of oil this 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.630
 would be enough for refueling 1 2 million 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:05.620
 cars per year and while the situation remains 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.540
 former population of the planet is growing and water 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.430
 in bottles will buy more and 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.090
 more every day there are new 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.000
 stamps 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.040
 the purest water is so pure it is not easy 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.030
 plain water now it's still water 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.310
 different tastes 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.560
 activists say it's time to dispel this 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.690
 myth consumers need to remember their 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.579
 free water right until she 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.070
 disappeared forever from whom we want 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.109
 get our water from corporations on 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.540
 crypts obca coca-cola who seek 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:33.519
 cash in on this or we want to live in 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.480
 democratically driven cities in 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:39.220
 which will provide us with water 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.319
 if you look at the giant price increase 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.709
 on the product and so available in most 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.510
 houses 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.150
 as well as environmental issues 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.430
 health 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.200
 and compliance with the technical regulations 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.760
 Perhaps you should think about whether 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.980
 buy bottled water 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.000
 especially when you consider that some more 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.980
 decades ago 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.659
 life on earth somehow existed without 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.879
 plastic bottles or 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:03.040
 resist this tendency is useless 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:03.040
