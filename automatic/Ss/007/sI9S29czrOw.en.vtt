00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.060
 just come to this side of city 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.460
 heavy 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.700
 on this side you just have to 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.020
 go to download now 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.000
 and really should now completely 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.860

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.110
 Start download takes just his time 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.210
 with crystal, it lasts the longest time white 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.350
 has the biggest file is the letting you 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.310
 show again in the folder or have 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.200
 previously set up 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.960
 wanted to have played memory and me 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.900
 Now put them on the desktop 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.970
 so he just makes it with the 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.260
 the other side show the same way 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.270
 folder to so and then just as I said 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.770
 would be my suggestion for you 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.370
 or that we make them are a folder 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.820

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:01.590
 the just it called pokémon or what white 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:09.390
 I do not want to integrate like mine 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:15.100
 let tutorial about the times made 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:17.709
 yes tutorial take care of me and there I pack 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.950

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.750
 emulators us the edition purely then 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.340
 makes her and in an easy 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.010
 right-click unzip it in 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:30.160
 this order the visual on advance 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:34.060
 file or rar file and then've just 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.430
 skupin and the jailbreak in the morning now 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.780
 just double left click on then 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.470
 this window will open 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.900
 do nothing 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:45.060
 not as long as he is not on file 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:49.000
 Click and then open the vine here 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.500
 the edition that you have and seek 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.060
 could then wherever he has this 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.360
 Partner is better if it really is 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.130
 in the folder of trees had entered 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.200
 because he then all at the same time with 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.630
 just listed a double-click 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.670
 on it and that the beautiful is 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.709
 you can not just be the window like that 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.000
 want to adjust how did it just 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.940
 So for example it could be like that now 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.970
 play 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.780
 or so or I just play it 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:21.820
 fullscreen what i do of course is 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:24.620
 1240 1024 x 768 which should be open 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.510
 is that then be very loud 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.950
 becomes 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.940
 however, there are different ones up here 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.880
 Yes , we could adjust things 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:38.330
 frames are set 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.950
 how bad you are gonna be right now 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.890
 Sync change might be different 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.360
 You can change the race mode 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:47.840
 can actually do a lot 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.480
 we say it this way you have here also 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.620
 at mediator different settings 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.260
 also in which image company or 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.120
 Show formats that wanted to have 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.770
 Sound could give him the channels from the 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.380
 that come but you can do that 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.700
 kilohertz number the volume change me 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:06.390
 think I'll volume including 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:10.110
 put to 125 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:12.800
 yes I do that well or 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:16.200
 you can of course also up here 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.810
 Of course you can all up here too 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.500
 just the sound newton or whole 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.020
 make up 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.160
 at the g1 you saw there are 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.530
 different shape you can also here 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.470
 the whole circumstance a gba so ever 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:31.170
 after what you then for files to 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.460
 has started and that is a cleverer 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.990
 and pretty much you can also here 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.890
 the language can change a bit 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.530
 I think I'll get something down 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:41.310
 load was that you can download you 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:42.660
 if you really wanted her 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:47.700
 have different tools and so what to 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:51.030
 example in web viewer and so yes that was 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.830
 actually everything for pokémon 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.990
 is still important for you to know the 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.020
 Your game keys are y ticks that you can 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.550
 of course you change it up in option 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:07.250
 could rewind with the space bar and 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:07.250
 that your menu will show that new game yes 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:21.630
 yes yes yes, the way we can play 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:23.280
 with the button with y you can see the people 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:26.880
 address resp 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:31.410
 this is the button the way still in the 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:35.700
 game is just animal the ex key and with 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:36.660
 enter, open your menu that is 

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.930
 actually everything you are 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:41.430
 I would have to know that 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.470

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.460
 helped you and see you then 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.930
