this compared to table soccer table and

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.020 
this compared to table soccer table and
a<00:00:39.360> foosball<00:00:39.510> table<00:00:39.930> first<00:00:40.320> off<00:00:40.850> there<00:00:41.850> are

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
banks sides as you can see you all the

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.170 
banks sides as you can see you all the
way<00:00:45.390> down<00:00:45.739> highly<00:00:46.739> banked<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.250> then<00:00:47.910> along

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
way down highly banked and then along

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.520 
way down highly banked and then along
the<00:00:48.329> back<00:00:48.539> also<00:00:49.230> very<00:00:49.860> highly<00:00:50.070> banked<00:00:50.579> and

the back also very highly banked and
it's<00:00:52.530> all<00:00:52.649> made<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.980> wood

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
it's all made of wood

it's all made of wood
the<00:00:54.930> biggest<00:00:55.140> flaw<00:00:55.500> about<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:55.800> table<00:00:56.399> is

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
the biggest flaw about this table is

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.880 
the biggest flaw about this table is
that<00:00:57.390> there<00:00:58.109> are<00:00:58.289> nine<00:00:59.750> actually<00:01:00.890> scoring

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
that there are nine actually scoring

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.460 
that there are nine actually scoring
tallies<00:01:02.399> if<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.910> want<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.149> call<00:01:03.300> them<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.470> so

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
tallies if you want to call them that so

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.170 
tallies if you want to call them that so
there<00:01:04.619> are<00:01:04.769> nine<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.309> if<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.519> played<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.909> ten

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
there are nine so if you played to ten

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.969 
there are nine so if you played to ten
or<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.570> like<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.869> play<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.110> overtime<00:01:07.619> there<00:01:07.860> is

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
or you like to play to overtime there is

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.280 
or you like to play to overtime there is
a<00:01:08.010> difference<00:01:08.430> there<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:09.510> second<00:01:09.840> flaw<00:01:10.020> would

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
a difference there the second flaw would

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.670 
a difference there the second flaw would
be<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.939> the<00:01:11.939> goal<00:01:12.150> tends<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.140> really<00:01:13.470> kick

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
be that the goal tends to really kick

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.580 
be that the goal tends to really kick
out<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.040> ball<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.390> actually<00:01:15.750> took<00:01:16.439> out

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
out the ball and so I actually took out

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.880 
out the ball and so I actually took out
a<00:01:16.650> koozie<00:01:18.590> and<00:01:20.180> cut<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.390> half<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:22.439> I'm<00:01:22.590> able

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
a koozie and cut it in half and I'm able

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.830 
a koozie and cut it in half and I'm able
to<00:01:22.979> shove<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.369> up<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:23.640> there<00:01:23.880> without<00:01:24.509> having

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
to shove it up in there without having

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.370 
to shove it up in there without having
to<00:01:25.020> put<00:01:25.229> any<00:01:25.259> tape<00:01:25.710> on<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.720> just<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.930> standard

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
to put any tape on it so just a standard

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.950 
to put any tape on it so just a standard
koozie<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:29.130> just<00:01:29.670> happened<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.420> get<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.750> one

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
koozie I just happened to get this one

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.620

for free from my work but it's really
well<00:01:33.840> padded<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.610> it'll<00:01:35.610> throw<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.939> ball

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
well padded and it'll throw the ball

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.510 
well padded and it'll throw the ball
right<00:01:36.119> down<00:01:36.360> at<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.869> goal<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.770> really<00:01:38.340> loud

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
right down at the goal it is really loud

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.789 
right down at the goal it is really loud
also<00:01:39.090> at<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.329> bottom<00:01:39.630> if<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.229> don't<00:01:40.439> put<00:01:40.619> any

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
also at the bottom if you don't put any

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.889 
also at the bottom if you don't put any
padding<00:01:41.130> down<00:01:41.460> there<00:01:42.470> tends<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.619> be<00:01:43.710> rip<00:01:44.630> sorry

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.670 
grommet it was actually a little bit too
so<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.180> ball<00:02:15.360> would<00:02:15.600> pass<00:02:15.840> around<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.320> guy<00:02:16.470> on

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
so the ball would pass around the guy on

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.570 
so the ball would pass around the guy on
the<00:02:16.710> outside<00:02:17.250> so<00:02:18.090> I<00:02:18.120> actually<00:02:18.840> cut<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.320> down

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
the outside so I actually cut it down

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.010 
the outside so I actually cut it down
with<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.820> if<00:02:21.150> you<00:02:21.330> want<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.540> call<00:02:21.660> this<00:02:21.780> the

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
underside one the the crest or

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.800 
underside one the the crest or
sorry-sorry<00:02:28.560> trough<00:02:29.010> would<00:02:29.310> be<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:29.810> skinnier

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
sorry-sorry trough would be the skinnier

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.690 
sorry-sorry trough would be the skinnier
one<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.170> then<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.440> crest<00:02:31.650> on<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.950> top<00:02:32.130> anyhow

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
one and then the crest on the top anyhow

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.290 
one and then the crest on the top anyhow
if<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.030> cut<00:02:33.360> off<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:34.290> first<00:02:34.790> crest<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:36.090> then

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
if you cut off the first crest and then

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.240 
if you cut off the first crest and then
the<00:02:36.510> second<00:02:36.870> trough<00:02:37.080> you'll<00:02:37.650> be<00:02:37.770> fine<00:02:37.950> all<00:02:38.160> the

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
the second trough you'll be fine all the

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.240 
the second trough you'll be fine all the
way<00:02:38.340> around<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.730> board<00:02:39.710> like<00:02:40.710> I<00:02:40.860> said<00:02:41.070> it<00:02:41.220> is

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
way around the board like I said it is

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.370 
way around the board like I said it is
out<00:02:42.440> here<00:02:43.880> especially<00:02:44.880> like<00:02:45.660> in<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:45.990> corners

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
out here especially like in the corners

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.760 
out here especially like in the corners
very<00:02:46.680> loud<00:02:47.300> it<00:02:48.300> tends<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.870> actually<00:02:49.320> kick<00:02:49.560> up

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
very loud it tends to actually kick up

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.180 
very loud it tends to actually kick up
off<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.370> side<00:02:50.810> really<00:02:51.810> really<00:02:52.860> loud

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
off the side really really loud

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.080 
off the side really really loud
and<00:02:53.690> it'll<00:02:54.690> jump<00:02:54.960> and<00:02:55.670> come<00:02:56.670> back<00:02:56.820> to<00:02:57.000> your

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
and it'll jump and come back to your

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.770 
and it'll jump and come back to your
player<00:02:57.360> so<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:58.050> good<00:02:58.230> side<00:02:58.470> is<00:02:58.880> you<00:02:59.880> have<00:03:00.090> the

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
player so the good side is you have the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.830 
player so the good side is you have the
goal<00:03:00.990> so<00:03:01.680> like<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.160> pros<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:03.420> have<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.660> goal

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840

which actually you can shoot past and

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.120 
which actually you can shoot past and

believe you can find more of these tali
markers<00:03:55.500> and<00:03:56.540> so<00:03:57.540> you<00:03:57.630> can<00:03:57.750> get<00:03:57.870> a<00:03:57.900> full<00:03:58.140> 10<00:03:58.440> if

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
being that none of these are numbered so

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.060 
being that none of these are numbered so

the goals the players are I think a

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.020 
the goals the players are I think a
little<00:04:47.610> wider<00:04:47.880> than<00:04:48.600> the<00:04:48.810> standard<00:04:49.230> player

almost<00:05:12.990> like<00:05:13.200> a<00:05:13.230> new<00:05:13.440> game<00:05:13.680> so<00:05:15.200> like<00:05:16.200> I<00:05:16.290> said

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
almost like a new game so like I said

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.370 
almost like a new game so like I said
the<00:05:16.650> lab<00:05:16.800> points<00:05:17.250> here<00:05:17.940> whenever<00:05:18.720> it<00:05:18.990> actually

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
the lab points here whenever it actually

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.740 
the lab points here whenever it actually
drops<00:05:19.710> down<00:05:19.950> into<00:05:20.310> the<00:05:20.430> goal<00:05:20.610> because<00:05:21.300> it's<00:05:21.450> so

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
drops down into the goal because it's so

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.050 
drops down into the goal because it's so
far<00:05:21.990> down<00:05:22.050> and<00:05:22.620> on<00:05:23.220> the<00:05:23.370> underside<00:05:23.640> of<00:05:23.850> the

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
far down and on the underside of the

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.200 
far down and on the underside of the
table<00:05:24.240> it's<00:05:24.660> actually<00:05:25.110> like<00:05:26.040> a<00:05:26.160> like<00:05:26.820> a<00:05:26.850> small

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
table it's actually like a like a small

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.170 
table it's actually like a like a small
shoebox<00:05:27.780> I<00:05:28.230> might<00:05:28.950> be<00:05:29.070> able<00:05:29.190> to<00:05:29.310> actually<00:05:29.760> get

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
shoebox I might be able to actually get

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:42.629 
shoebox I might be able to actually get
you<00:05:30.360> a<00:05:30.770> short<00:05:31.770> shot<00:05:32.040> of<00:05:32.190> that

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:47.490 

so<00:05:43.330> um<00:05:43.629> I<00:05:43.990> know<00:05:44.860> it's<00:05:45.159> kind<00:05:45.370> of<00:05:45.460> relative<00:05:45.909> to<00:05:46.500> to

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
so um I know it's kind of relative to to

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.110 
so um I know it's kind of relative to to
figure<00:05:47.770> out<00:05:47.919> the<00:05:48.039> distance<00:05:48.219> I<00:05:48.580> would<00:05:48.789> say<00:05:48.939> it's

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
figure out the distance I would say it's

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.730 
figure out the distance I would say it's
about<00:05:50.370> ten<00:05:51.370> inches<00:05:51.580> to<00:05:52.479> the<00:05:52.509> bottom<00:05:52.930> so<00:05:53.620> you

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
about ten inches to the bottom so you

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.619 
about ten inches to the bottom so you
could<00:05:53.889> probably<00:05:54.159> even<00:05:54.580> cut<00:05:54.879> another<00:05:55.150> koozie

00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:55.629 
could probably even cut another koozie

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:57.600 
could probably even cut another koozie
stick<00:05:56.379> it<00:05:56.500> at<00:05:56.620> the<00:05:56.680> bottom<00:05:56.949> of<00:05:57.039> that<00:05:57.159> like<00:05:57.490> I

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
stick it at the bottom of that like I

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.050 
stick it at the bottom of that like I
said<00:05:57.639> this<00:05:58.030> is<00:05:58.210> very<00:05:58.509> noisy<00:05:58.800> so<00:05:59.800> if<00:06:00.580> you<00:06:00.759> happen

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
said this is very noisy so if you happen

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.640 
said this is very noisy so if you happen

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
regular foosball it's almost like a

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.480 
regular foosball it's almost like a
homerun<00:06:33.909> Slugger<00:06:33.969> fest<00:06:34.840> that<00:06:35.680> makes<00:06:35.889> 90<00:06:36.159> cents

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.490 
homerun Slugger fest that makes 90 cents

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:41.999 
homerun Slugger fest that makes 90 cents
you<00:06:37.120> kick<00:06:37.360> the<00:06:37.509> ball<00:06:37.659> off<00:06:37.689> the<00:06:37.900> back<00:06:38.259> and<00:06:41.009> you

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:42.009 
you kick the ball off the back and you

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:43.709 
you kick the ball off the back and you
know<00:06:42.129> like<00:06:42.430> it'll<00:06:42.819> come<00:06:43.060> down<00:06:43.090> and<00:06:43.569> you<00:06:43.629> can

00:06:43.709 --> 00:06:43.719 
know like it'll come down and you can

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:48.959 
know like it'll come down and you can
basically<00:06:44.370> dropkick<00:06:45.370> the<00:06:45.400> the<00:06:46.090> ball<00:06:46.240> so<00:06:47.969> hope

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:48.969 
basically dropkick the the ball so hope

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:52.680 
basically dropkick the the ball so hope
