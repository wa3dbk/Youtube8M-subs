is I didn't is this really cool and I'm

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.069 
is I didn't is this really cool and I'm
hoping<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:32.030> maybe<00:01:33.030> they<00:01:33.329> even<00:01:33.360> let<00:01:33.720> us<00:01:33.840> keep

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
hoping that maybe they even let us keep

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.899 
hoping that maybe they even let us keep
the<00:01:34.560> flaming<00:01:34.979> helmet<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.490> cool<00:01:35.700> name

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
the flaming helmet and the cool name

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.690 
the flaming helmet and the cool name
plates<00:01:36.210> after<00:01:36.650> july<00:01:37.650> seventh<00:01:38.220> because<00:01:38.579> it

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
plates after july seventh because it

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.690 
plates after july seventh because it
runs<00:01:38.909> from<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.570> think<00:01:40.320> June<00:01:40.799> fourteenth<00:01:41.460> to

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
runs from I think June fourteenth to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.450 
runs from I think June fourteenth to
July<00:01:42.030> seventh<00:01:42.479> which<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.810> almost<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.439> month<00:01:43.619> so

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
July seventh which is almost a month so

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.569 
July seventh which is almost a month so
maybe<00:01:44.820> just<00:01:45.750> they'll<00:01:46.380> let<00:01:46.619> us<00:01:46.649> keep<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.399> even

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
maybe just they'll let us keep it even

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.730 
maybe just they'll let us keep it even
after<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.180> hopefully<00:01:48.570> I'd<00:01:49.110> be<00:01:49.380> great

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
after that hopefully I'd be great

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.530 
after that hopefully I'd be great
because<00:01:49.920> I'm<00:01:50.520> getting<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.909> lot<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.090> questions

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
if I'm a bungee employee and I think

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.240

it's pretty cool that we have access to
this<00:01:56.399> now<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.090> really<00:01:57.119> appreciate<00:01:58.079> what

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110
