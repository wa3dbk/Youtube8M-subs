the first tip I have is use the bomb for
cover<00:00:51.719> there's<00:00:52.320> not<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.559> better<00:00:52.770> spot<00:00:53.160> in

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
demolition to use as cover than the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.410 
demolition to use as cover than the
actual<00:00:55.500> bomb<00:00:55.770> itself<00:00:56.160> as<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.730> can<00:00:57.030> see<00:00:57.210> from

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
this perspective right there

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.439 
this perspective right there
only<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.100> tip<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.489> my<00:00:59.550> head<00:00:59.850> will<00:01:00.030> show<00:01:00.239> up

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
only the tip of my head will show up

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.229 
only the tip of my head will show up
it's<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.440> perfect<00:01:01.649> aiming<00:01:02.309> level<00:01:02.699> for<00:01:02.910> your<00:01:03.000> gun

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
it's a perfect aiming level for your gun

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.289 
it's a perfect aiming level for your gun
and<00:01:03.890> it's<00:01:04.890> in<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.250> exact<00:01:05.580> right<00:01:05.790> place<00:01:06.030> the

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
and it's in the exact right place the

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.760 
and it's in the exact right place the
center<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.780> attention<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.200> demolition<00:01:07.470> is

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
center of attention and demolition is

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.140 
center of attention and demolition is
always<00:01:07.950> going<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.100> be<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.310> bomb<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:08.970> why

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
always going to be the bomb and so why

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.000 
always going to be the bomb and so why
not<00:01:09.360> put<00:01:09.900> yourself<00:01:09.960> right<00:01:10.290> there<00:01:10.439> with<00:01:10.799> some

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
not put yourself right there with some

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.100 
not put yourself right there with some
excellent<00:01:11.310> cover<00:01:11.640> as<00:01:11.790> well<00:01:11.939> here<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.780> can<00:01:12.930> see

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
excellent cover as well here you can see

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.390 
excellent cover as well here you can see
from<00:01:13.290> long<00:01:13.470> distance<00:01:13.979> it's<00:01:14.189> almost

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
from long distance it's almost

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.789 
from long distance it's almost
impossible<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:15.030> see<00:01:15.270> me<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.689> it's<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.650> great

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
impossible to see me and it's a great

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.490 
impossible to see me and it's a great
piece<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.070> cover<00:01:17.780> so<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:18.930> next<00:01:19.140> one<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.380> a

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
piece of cover so this next one is a

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.899 
piece of cover so this next one is a
quickie<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.890> don't<00:01:20.040> think<00:01:20.220> many<00:01:20.400> people<00:01:20.460> use

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
quickie I don't think many people use

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.760 
quickie I don't think many people use
this<00:01:21.060> enough<00:01:21.390> but<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.960> can<00:01:22.110> easily<00:01:22.560> shoot

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
this enough but you can easily shoot

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:23.810 
this enough but you can easily shoot
through<00:01:22.979> two<00:01:23.070> bombs<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.580> if<00:01:23.670> you're

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
through two bombs so if you're

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.280 
through two bombs so if you're
especially<00:01:24.119> if<00:01:24.420> you're<00:01:24.509> using<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.900> perk<00:01:25.110> like

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
especially if you're using a perk like

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.679 
especially if you're using a perk like
hardened<00:01:25.680> just<00:01:26.189> shoot<00:01:26.340> through<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.549> bomb<00:01:26.790> now

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
hardened just shoot through the bomb now

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.870 
hardened just shoot through the bomb now
the<00:01:27.750> other<00:01:28.200> thing<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.560> suggest<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.759> know

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
you'll pretty easily you know if you're

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.870 
you'll pretty easily you know if you're
within<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.470> decent<00:01:34.920> range<00:01:35.159> be<00:01:35.460> able<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.729> get<00:01:35.850> a

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
more map specific stuff here on launch

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.399 
more map specific stuff here on launch
so<00:01:47.189> everyone<00:01:47.670> knows<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.149> this<00:01:48.540> missile<00:01:49.200> goes

that<00:03:18.790> matter<00:03:19.379> even<00:03:20.379> though<00:03:20.470> you<00:03:20.530> might<00:03:20.709> think

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
that matter even though you might think

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.069 
that matter even though you might think
that<00:03:21.099> the<00:03:21.310> space<00:03:21.519> is<00:03:21.579> in<00:03:21.849> between<00:03:21.970> each<00:03:22.329> piling

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
that the space is in between each piling

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.259 
that the space is in between each piling
or<00:03:23.290> you<00:03:23.979> know<00:03:24.040> open<00:03:24.400> they're<00:03:24.609> not<00:03:24.760> so<00:03:25.120> it's

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
or you know open they're not so it's

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.030 
or you know open they're not so it's
great<00:03:25.479> spot<00:03:25.780> so<00:03:26.049> this<00:03:26.169> is<00:03:26.319> the<00:03:26.379> a<00:03:26.409> bomb<00:03:26.799> on

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
great spot so this is the a bomb on

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.449 
great spot so this is the a bomb on
radiation<00:03:27.419> it's<00:03:28.419> really<00:03:28.870> really<00:03:29.400> sort<00:03:30.400> of

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
radiation it's really really sort of

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:31.710 
radiation it's really really sort of
open<00:03:30.819> in<00:03:30.909> a<00:03:31.000> sense<00:03:31.239> there's<00:03:31.449> so<00:03:31.629> many

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
open in a sense there's so many

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.899 
open in a sense there's so many
entrances<00:03:32.319> it's<00:03:32.560> really<00:03:32.799> hard<00:03:33.010> to<00:03:33.189> dominate

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:33.909 
entrances it's really hard to dominate

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:35.939 
entrances it's really hard to dominate
that<00:03:34.090> areas<00:03:34.449> so<00:03:34.599> a<00:03:34.629> great<00:03:34.989> way<00:03:35.169> to<00:03:35.199> do<00:03:35.530> so<00:03:35.799> if

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:35.949 
that areas so a great way to do so if

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:37.379 
that areas so a great way to do so if
you're<00:03:36.099> either<00:03:36.189> defending<00:03:36.790> or<00:03:37.000> you're<00:03:37.180> trying

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
you're either defending or you're trying

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:38.879 
you're either defending or you're trying
to<00:03:37.479> plant<00:03:37.780> and<00:03:37.989> you<00:03:38.079> don't<00:03:38.290> want<00:03:38.470> the<00:03:38.560> defense

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:38.889 
to plant and you don't want the defense

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:41.670 
to plant and you don't want the defense
in<00:03:39.220> there<00:03:39.609> is<00:03:40.419> to<00:03:40.569> close<00:03:40.780> those<00:03:41.019> doors<00:03:41.290> because

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
in there is to close those doors because

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.770 
in there is to close those doors because
it<00:03:42.250> closes<00:03:42.430> off<00:03:42.759> probably<00:03:43.479> the<00:03:43.659> largest

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
it closes off probably the largest

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.039 
it closes off probably the largest
entrance<00:03:44.379> and<00:03:44.650> no<00:03:45.430> clock<00:03:45.939> it<00:03:46.239> makes<00:03:46.569> it<00:03:46.720> makes

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
entrance and no clock it makes it makes

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:48.479 
entrance and no clock it makes it makes
it<00:03:47.169> a<00:03:47.229> lot<00:03:47.409> of<00:03:47.470> the<00:03:47.620> area<00:03:47.859> a<00:03:47.919> lot<00:03:48.099> easier<00:03:48.370> to

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
it a lot of the area a lot easier to

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.240 
it a lot of the area a lot easier to
lock<00:03:48.699> down<00:03:48.939> so<00:03:49.720> this<00:03:49.810> is<00:03:49.959> this<00:03:50.229> is<00:03:50.409> the<00:03:50.590> a<00:03:50.889> bomb

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
lock down so this is this is the a bomb

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.960 
lock down so this is this is the a bomb
on<00:03:51.540> wwm<00:03:52.540> D<00:03:52.720> for<00:03:53.109> demolition<00:03:53.609> there's<00:03:54.609> the<00:03:54.819> B

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
on wwm D for demolition there's the B

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.479 
on wwm D for demolition there's the B
bomb<00:03:55.180> right<00:03:55.389> there<00:03:55.449> and<00:03:56.009> there's<00:03:57.009> one<00:03:57.099> thing

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.099 
bomb right there and there's one thing
about<00:03:57.549> this<00:03:57.729> map<00:03:58.120> that<00:03:58.150> you<00:03:58.479> want<00:03:58.659> to<00:03:58.750> control

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
about this map that you want to control

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:01.170 
about this map that you want to control
it's<00:03:59.470> this<00:03:59.859> building<00:04:00.340> right<00:04:00.519> here<00:04:00.849> it's<00:04:01.030> in

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
it's this building right here it's in

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.990 
it's this building right here it's in
the<00:04:01.359> pretty<00:04:01.720> much<00:04:01.840> the<00:04:01.959> center<00:04:02.259> of<00:04:02.349> the<00:04:02.409> map

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
the pretty much the center of the map

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.869 
the pretty much the center of the map
and<00:04:04.000> it<00:04:04.359> gives<00:04:04.509> you<00:04:04.769> sight<00:04:05.769> lines<00:04:06.009> to<00:04:06.310> both<00:04:06.519> the

and it gives you sight lines to both the
ANB<00:04:07.509> bomb<00:04:07.720> making<00:04:08.439> it<00:04:09.009> essential<00:04:09.519> to<00:04:09.609> control
