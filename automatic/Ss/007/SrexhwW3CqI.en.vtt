00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
it has a flipper mechanism also which

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.479 
it has a flipper mechanism also which
works<00:00:41.640> very<00:00:41.910> great<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:43.340> very<00:00:44.340> nice<00:00:46.190> the<00:00:47.190> steel

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
works very great and very nice the steel

works very great and very nice the steel
of<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.390> copier<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:49.559> for<00:00:49.920> 440<00:00:50.550> it's<00:00:51.449> not<00:00:51.660> say

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
of the copier it's for 440 it's not say

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.850

si<00:00:52.260> si<00:00:52.890> or<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.489> or<00:00:53.850> whatever<00:00:54.360> but<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.780> guess<00:00:55.350> when

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
si si or a or whatever but I guess when

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.090 
si si or a or whatever but I guess when
they<00:00:56.039> say<00:00:56.280> 414<00:00:57.059> it's<00:00:57.449> for<00:00:57.690> 48<00:00:58.109> which<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
they say 414 it's for 48 which is the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.590 
they say 414 it's for 48 which is the
inferior<00:00:59.820> still<00:01:00.410> but<00:01:01.410> still<00:01:02.000> it<00:01:03.000> came<00:01:03.300> very

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
inferior still but still it came very

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.830 
inferior still but still it came very
very<00:01:04.320> sharp<00:01:04.830> out<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.189> box<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:06.180> was<00:01:06.420> shaving

previous video for a fake paramilitary 2

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.990 
previous video for a fake paramilitary 2
I<00:02:53.140> like<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:53.860> design<00:02:54.360> very<00:02:55.360> much<00:02:55.540> now<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:55.989> this

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
I like the design very much now and this

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.970 
I like the design very much now and this
particular<00:02:58.000> knife<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:59.110> spherical<00:02:59.650> Domino

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
particular knife the spherical Domino

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.830 
particular knife the spherical Domino
the<00:03:00.300> design<00:03:01.300> of<00:03:01.510> it<00:03:01.750> it's<00:03:02.290> I<00:03:03.239> think<00:03:04.239> one<00:03:04.569> of<00:03:04.600> the

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
the design of it it's I think one of the

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.110 
the design of it it's I think one of the
prettiest<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.650> spider<00:03:06.190> course<00:03:06.489> but<00:03:06.670> this<00:03:06.970> is

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
prettiest the spider course but this is

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.630 
prettiest the spider course but this is
just<00:03:07.150> my<00:03:07.720> opinion<00:03:07.750> because<00:03:08.650> it<00:03:08.980> has<00:03:09.220> a<00:03:09.250> broad

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
just my opinion because it has a broad

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.180 
just my opinion because it has a broad
blade<00:03:09.880> and<00:03:10.440> has<00:03:11.440> this<00:03:11.590> a<00:03:12.720> very<00:03:13.720> very<00:03:14.170> good<00:03:14.950> line

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
blade and has this a very very good line

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.600 
blade and has this a very very good line
here<00:03:15.550> it<00:03:16.269> had<00:03:16.630> it<00:03:17.170> doesn't<00:03:17.440> like<00:03:18.070> make<00:03:18.310> this

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
here it had it doesn't like make this

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.770 
here it had it doesn't like make this
jump<00:03:19.090> here<00:03:19.390> like<00:03:19.930> most<00:03:20.170> of<00:03:20.350> other<00:03:20.769> models<00:03:21.780> like

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
jump here like most of other models like

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.039 
jump here like most of other models like
this<00:03:22.989> a<00:03:23.280> big<00:03:24.280> jump<00:03:24.519> which<00:03:25.269> is<00:03:25.420> interfering

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
this a big jump which is interfering

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.310 
this a big jump which is interfering
with<00:03:26.079> the<00:03:26.500> with<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.400> design<00:03:27.900> in<00:03:28.900> my<00:03:29.079> opinion

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320

my knives on my pockets I hold it aha in
front<00:06:07.750> of<00:06:07.870> the<00:06:07.960> pants<00:06:08.170> on<00:06:08.980> the<00:06:09.190> inner<00:06:09.490> side<00:06:10.680> so

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
front of the pants on the inner side so

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:16.680 
front of the pants on the inner side so
that's<00:06:12.310> why<00:06:13.800> and<00:06:14.800> the<00:06:15.010> clips<00:06:15.280> this<00:06:16.030> one<00:06:16.210> is<00:06:16.450> not

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
that's why and the clips this one is not

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.960 
that's why and the clips this one is not
movable<00:06:17.080> the<00:06:17.890> pocket<00:06:18.220> clip<00:06:18.370> is<00:06:18.520> not<00:06:18.670> movable

movable the pocket clip is not movable

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.610 
movable the pocket clip is not movable
so<00:06:19.930> this<00:06:20.080> is<00:06:20.200> a<00:06:20.230> little<00:06:20.560> bit<00:06:20.680> of<00:06:21.600> downside<00:06:22.620> but

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
so this is a little bit of downside but

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.170 
so this is a little bit of downside but
it's<00:06:23.800> not<00:06:24.010> it's<00:06:24.850> not<00:06:25.860> a<00:06:26.860> deep<00:06:27.160> pocket<00:06:27.610> lipids
