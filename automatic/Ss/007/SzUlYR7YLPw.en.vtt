00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:11.460
 I saw how it was your first day of 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.139
 sebrae jorge's work only aggravates 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.790
 in sony 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.010
 I had no difficulty in the season, I'm not 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.010
 Brazilian does not think much Brazilian net 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:40.050
 the first of that date to beat the netherlands 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:42.510
 has not had so many difficulties, it is not 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.930
 How did you learn about money? 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.260
 learned easy with money always everything 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:53.940
 It's mine, but then I had a lot. 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.910
 difficulty as chubby and you think 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.010
 that I am the clown and not me 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.370
 How did you know that you did not know the money? 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.180
 in my first experience was a 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.960
 Little bunny 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.479
 In Brazil it 's only 99 people . 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.580
 I do not know if it's still a boy, my husband. 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.150
 gave me the weekend he taught me 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.299
 and bike up this clock in varginha 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.840
 and gave me the money to buy it would give 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.850
 to buy 10 things so any 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.250
 thing is a stupid little coin that is 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.380
 a grin holding ag the im 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.119
 He said ok, you have to deliver. 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.380
 that money and more in this coin 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.150
 purchase of choice 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.660
 Then I got to know her 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.000
 when will buy things all 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:44.080
 It was a punctured penny nina one 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.720
 Clean moin with in and most liked 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:51.910
 Mommy season of five she went to buy 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:54.160
 It's one thing to be a mother was a tax on 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.160
 series I had to pay right is everything 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.710
 all you buy a tax is not it 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.350
 Part of me, I do not think that in Brazil 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:06.190
 tax is sometimes not know how're right and 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.960
 who knows, it's not a percentage there 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.630
 will have built-in value but here it is 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.650
 separated for example if you get there 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.390
 With a villain, you can not buy. 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.610
 To buy everything you have to have a 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:26.140
 to pay the tax is not 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:35.680
 this is the greatest difficulty 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:37.959
 everything is still dilma is male or the food 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:48.160
 water food is also any food 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:51.250
 game combines very much with what is 12 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.380
 sweet that is until then the game itself is a 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.620
 look sweet you will eat boring and 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.780
 in that of meat so is extra sauce that 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.440
 cough so it looks like that 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:05.290
 move nor layers of leon whether outback 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.810
 even draw was notchback attributes 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.120
 I did not think against that rib there. 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:15.130
 brazil in the rib but it is that social is 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:19.180
 sweet more castle auctioneer on own 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:22.630
 star on the thigh floor had no more where 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.769
 buy and so you had difficulty 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.890
 with the tongue 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:30.920
 Until today not learning 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.860
 when you thought that was I thought 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.260
 it was so easy is that 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.830
 products had already been registered as the 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.790
 people understand you did not speak 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.290
 about this 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:47.630
 bread is bread, world, but I thought everything 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.430
 or we can have people thought 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.860
 when you write in the book a goal you 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.050
 learn a goal is worth katakana yet 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.209
 a written guide, right? 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:59.569
 In Brazil, at least I thought it was 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.370
 I did not write this, I thought that 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.200
 product is this way for example I would 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.950
 to think that he was not going to 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:10.190
 penis for someone to have a gentleman 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.780
 there was no tendency to have to this day I 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.840
 I do not know how is the name of this song 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.209
 it's not just a guess not that it was 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.680
 It's because we do not even know why. 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.359
 I was in Brazil when I was there. 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.090
 studying the language whenever people 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.370
 Brazilian very much in the same head then 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.850
 more difficulty is not listening, right? 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.980
 So she spoke like this here in Brazil. 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.590
 japan you will find many products 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.590
 so Americanize each channel uses 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.120
 show product and adapted in this fall 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.340
 it's to power 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.320
 Then I understood that so I thought of 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.030
 My head did not even give a balloon like that. 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.800
 she saying like that, right? 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.960
 so when I get there I look for 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:53.060
 These people are all I'm talking about. 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:55.419
 There you are everything that we go through. 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.419
 no people
