and<00:00:33.610> from<00:00:33.820> the<00:00:33.940> end<00:00:34.180> of<00:00:34.329> the<00:00:34.420> board<00:00:34.660> you<00:00:35.560> want

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
and from the end of the board you want

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.260 
and from the end of the board you want
to<00:00:35.770> lay<00:00:35.920> your<00:00:36.070> paddle<00:00:36.520> bit<00:00:36.670> so<00:00:36.850> that<00:00:36.879> the<00:00:37.090> edge

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.270 
to lay your paddle bit so that the edge

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.020 
to lay your paddle bit so that the edge
of<00:00:37.510> it<00:00:37.600> touches<00:00:38.020> the<00:00:38.140> line<00:00:38.320> you<00:00:38.530> just<00:00:38.559> drew<00:00:39.030> and

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
of it touches the line you just drew and

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.599 
of it touches the line you just drew and
find<00:00:40.390> that<00:00:40.539> center<00:00:40.870> point<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:42.160> that<00:00:42.309> when<00:00:42.489> you

00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:42.609 
find that center point so that when you

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.729 
find that center point so that when you
drill<00:00:42.969> the<00:00:43.420> edge<00:00:43.660> of<00:00:43.870> your<00:00:43.989> blade<00:00:44.289> is<00:00:44.500> going<00:00:44.680> to

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
drill the edge of your blade is going to

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:46.500 
drill the edge of your blade is going to
touch<00:00:44.949> that<00:00:44.980> line<00:00:45.430> that<00:00:45.609> you<00:00:45.730> drift<00:00:46.000> now

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
touch that line that you drift now

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.660 
touch that line that you drift now
here's<00:00:46.719> a<00:00:46.809> tip<00:00:46.989> you<00:00:47.469> want<00:00:47.649> to<00:00:47.739> avoid<00:00:47.949> bad<00:00:48.309> spots

here's a tip you want to avoid bad spots

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.779 
here's a tip you want to avoid bad spots
in<00:00:48.850> the<00:00:48.940> world<00:00:49.059> like<00:00:49.300> this<00:00:50.519> there's<00:00:51.519> gonna<00:00:51.699> be

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:51.789 
in the world like this there's gonna be

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:53.819 
in the world like this there's gonna be
times<00:00:52.059> where<00:00:52.359> you<00:00:52.449> can't<00:00:52.809> so<00:00:53.320> just<00:00:53.590> go<00:00:53.800> slow

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
times where you can't so just go slow

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:55.650 
times where you can't so just go slow
otherwise<00:00:54.489> you're<00:00:54.879> gonna<00:00:54.969> splinter<00:00:55.449> and

otherwise you're gonna splinter and

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.549 
otherwise you're gonna splinter and
break<00:00:55.960> that<00:00:56.140> board<00:00:58.140> now<00:00:59.140> the<00:00:59.199> next<00:00:59.440> thing

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
break that board now the next thing

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
gonna now take a piece of four-inch

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.450 
gonna now take a piece of four-inch
sewer<00:01:14.140> line<00:01:14.409> and<00:01:14.619> place<00:01:14.890> it<00:01:15.100> there<00:01:15.280> as<00:01:15.430> a

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
sewer line and place it there as a

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.039 
sewer line and place it there as a
marker<00:01:15.939> now<00:01:16.420> I'm<00:01:16.509> going<00:01:16.659> to<00:01:16.720> tell<00:01:16.840> you<00:01:16.900> where

marker now I'm going to tell you where
that<00:01:17.110> four<00:01:17.320> inch<00:01:17.439> PVC<00:01:17.590> comes<00:01:18.070> in<00:01:18.159> the<00:01:18.220> flow

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
that four inch PVC comes in the flow

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.340 
that four inch PVC comes in the flow
here<00:01:18.549> in<00:01:18.610> a<00:01:18.670> second<00:01:19.000> but<00:01:19.149> use<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:20.020> edge<00:01:20.140> of

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
here in a second but use the edge of

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.039 
here in a second but use the edge of
that<00:01:20.500> to<00:01:20.649> mark<00:01:20.920> for<00:01:21.610> your<00:01:21.759> next<00:01:21.970> hole<00:01:22.299> same

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
that to mark for your next hole same

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.109 
that to mark for your next hole same
thing<00:01:23.320> edge<00:01:23.649> of<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:23.979> paddle<00:01:24.220> bit<00:01:24.460> to<00:01:24.939> touch

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
thing edge of the paddle bit to touch

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:33.430 
thing edge of the paddle bit to touch
the<00:01:25.329> line<00:01:25.509> you<00:01:25.689> just<00:01:25.720> drew

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.870 

now<00:01:34.440> you'll<00:01:34.590> notice<00:01:34.830> that<00:01:34.980> I've<00:01:35.220> clamped<00:01:35.490> two

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
now you'll notice that I've clamped two

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.180 
now you'll notice that I've clamped two
boards<00:01:36.240> together<00:01:36.500> that's<00:01:37.500> because<00:01:37.830> you<00:01:37.950> can

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
boards together that's because you can

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.920 
boards together that's because you can
do<00:01:38.400> more<00:01:38.640> than<00:01:38.790> one<00:01:38.970> at<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.150> time<00:01:39.330> in<00:01:39.540> fact<00:01:39.750> you

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
do more than one at a time in fact you

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.830 
do more than one at a time in fact you
can<00:01:40.110> probably<00:01:40.320> drill<00:01:40.920> out<00:01:41.040> three<00:01:41.520> at<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.730> time

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
can probably drill out three at a time

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.510 
can probably drill out three at a time
if<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.870> have<00:01:43.140> them<00:01:43.290> clamped<00:01:43.710> good<00:01:43.920> but<00:01:44.340> that's

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
if you have them clamped good but that's

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.470 
if you have them clamped good but that's
something<00:01:44.820> you're<00:01:44.940> going<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.090> have<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.330> work

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.480 
something you're going to have to work

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.880 
something you're going to have to work
up<00:01:45.720> too<00:01:45.870> because<00:01:46.110> if<00:01:46.230> you've<00:01:46.350> never<00:01:46.560> used<00:01:46.800> a

what's<00:03:19.550> going<00:03:19.700> to<00:03:19.730> become<00:03:19.880> the<00:03:20.300> middle<00:03:20.600> bar<00:03:20.960> of

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
what's going to become the middle bar of

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.830 
what's going to become the middle bar of
your<00:03:21.470> fence<00:03:21.880> now<00:03:22.880> this<00:03:23.060> bar<00:03:23.300> should<00:03:23.630> be<00:03:23.810> a

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
your fence now this bar should be a

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.320 
your fence now this bar should be a
little<00:03:24.140> looser<00:03:24.470> on<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.950> pipe<00:03:25.160> so<00:03:26.120> you<00:03:26.210> may

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
little looser on the pipe so you may

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:27.790 
little looser on the pipe so you may
have<00:03:26.480> to<00:03:26.570> bore<00:03:26.750> out<00:03:26.930> just<00:03:27.110> a<00:03:27.200> little<00:03:27.230> bit<00:03:27.530> more

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:27.800 
have to bore out just a little bit more

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:38.370 
have to bore out just a little bit more
to<00:03:28.340> give<00:03:28.490> it<00:03:28.580> that<00:03:28.730> space

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.470 

once<00:03:39.280> you've<00:03:39.400> got<00:03:39.520> all<00:03:39.550> the<00:03:39.730> PVC<00:03:40.150> in<00:03:40.270> place

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
once you've got all the PVC in place

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.070 
once you've got all the PVC in place
you're<00:03:40.930> ready<00:03:40.960> for<00:03:41.350> the<00:03:41.410> top<00:03:41.590> rail<00:03:41.890> and<00:03:43.080> that

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
you're ready for the top rail and that

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.390 
you're ready for the top rail and that
top<00:03:44.410> row<00:03:44.620> is<00:03:44.680> going<00:03:44.830> to<00:03:44.920> have<00:03:45.010> a<00:03:45.040> little<00:03:45.280> bit<00:03:45.370> of

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
top row is going to have a little bit of

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.610 
top row is going to have a little bit of
a<00:03:45.490> tighter<00:03:45.700> fit<00:03:46.000> on<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.270> PVC<00:03:46.630> than<00:03:47.140> the<00:03:47.320> middle

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
a tighter fit on the PVC than the middle

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.440 
a tighter fit on the PVC than the middle
rail<00:03:47.800> so<00:03:48.430> you're<00:03:48.580> going<00:03:48.790> to<00:03:48.850> need<00:03:48.940> to<00:03:49.060> tap<00:03:49.270> it
