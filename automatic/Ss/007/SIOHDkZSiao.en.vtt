don't<00:02:41.140> thin<00:02:41.590> or<00:02:41.799> you<00:02:41.829> know<00:02:42.190> separate<00:02:43.150> that

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
don't thin or you know separate that

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.509 
don't thin or you know separate that
much<00:02:43.510> so<00:02:43.720> what<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:43.900> did<00:02:44.049> I<00:02:44.079> got<00:02:44.140> a<00:02:44.260> nice<00:02:44.519> bottle

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
much so what I did I got a nice bottle

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.190 
much so what I did I got a nice bottle
of<00:02:45.610> model<00:02:45.970> master<00:02:46.120> enamel<00:02:46.780> which<00:02:46.900> as<00:02:47.049> you<00:02:47.170> can

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
of model master enamel which as you can

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.410 
of model master enamel which as you can
see<00:02:47.349> it's<00:02:48.099> thin<00:02:48.370> terribly<00:02:48.910> cuz<00:02:49.120> there's<00:02:49.299> the

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
see it's thin terribly cuz there's the

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.479 
see it's thin terribly cuz there's the
coil<00:02:49.540> underneath<00:02:49.959> you<00:02:50.890> can<00:02:51.099> see<00:02:51.130> all<00:02:51.370> the

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
coil underneath you can see all the

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:52.830 
coil underneath you can see all the
thinner<00:02:51.730> on<00:02:51.910> top<00:02:52.180> so<00:02:52.329> we're<00:02:52.450> going<00:02:52.540> to<00:02:52.599> give<00:02:52.750> it

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
thinner on top so we're going to give it

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.120 
thinner on top so we're going to give it
a<00:02:52.900> go<00:02:53.049> in<00:02:53.200> this<00:02:53.380> hopefully<00:02:53.620> I'm<00:02:53.860> not<00:02:53.950> going<00:02:54.069> to

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
a go in this hopefully I'm not going to

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.620 
a go in this hopefully I'm not going to
get<00:02:54.220> covered<00:02:54.519> in<00:02:54.610> it<00:02:54.760> I'm<00:02:55.120> not<00:02:55.299> gonna<00:02:55.480> bother

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
get covered in it I'm not gonna bother

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.069 
get covered in it I'm not gonna bother
Sheik<00:02:56.019> in<00:02:56.200> it<00:02:56.319> we'll<00:02:56.500> set<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.739> bottle<00:02:57.130> lid<00:02:57.310> off

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
Sheik in it we'll set the bottle lid off

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.350 
Sheik in it we'll set the bottle lid off
and<00:02:59.079> as<00:02:59.260> you<00:02:59.410> can<00:02:59.560> see<00:02:59.920> it's<00:03:00.640> separated<00:03:01.269> the

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
and as you can see it's separated the

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.930 
and as you can see it's separated the
hell<00:03:01.599> in<00:03:01.780> that<00:03:02.099> so<00:03:03.099> this<00:03:03.459> is<00:03:03.519> going<00:03:03.730> to<00:03:03.790> get<00:03:03.910> a

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
hell in that so this is going to get a

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.300 
hell in that so this is going to get a
real<00:03:04.269> good<00:03:04.510> pasting<00:03:05.019> now<00:03:05.230> I'm<00:03:05.500> gonna<00:03:05.620> see<00:03:05.799> just

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
real good pasting now I'm gonna see just

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.509 
real good pasting now I'm gonna see just
how<00:03:06.430> well<00:03:06.459> it<00:03:06.760> performs<00:03:07.239> and<00:03:07.359> the<00:03:07.540> zoom<00:03:07.810> is<00:03:08.019> in

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
how well it performs and the zoom is in

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.250 
how well it performs and the zoom is in
like<00:03:09.519> a<00:03:09.639> zoom<00:03:09.970> is<00:03:10.180> he<00:03:10.269> on<00:03:10.329> the<00:03:10.510> side<00:03:10.930> a<00:03:10.959> little

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
like a zoom is he on the side a little

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:20.250 
like a zoom is he on the side a little
bit<00:03:11.530> as<00:03:11.739> well<00:03:14.730> we<00:03:15.730> go<00:03:16.019> keep<00:03:17.019> it<00:03:17.230> there<00:03:19.260> and

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
bit as well we go keep it there and

bit as well we go keep it there and
we'll<00:03:20.410> see<00:03:21.000> try<00:03:22.000> and<00:03:22.090> keep<00:03:22.180> my<00:03:22.329> hand<00:03:22.569> out<00:03:22.690> of

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
we'll see try and keep my hand out of

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.500 
we'll see try and keep my hand out of
shot<00:03:22.989> for<00:03:23.200> you<00:03:23.760> yeah<00:03:24.760> it's<00:03:25.000> definitely<00:03:25.180> full

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
shot for you yeah it's definitely full

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.020 
shot for you yeah it's definitely full
of<00:03:25.690> paint<00:03:26.200> at<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.410> bottom<00:03:29.700> you<00:03:30.700> give<00:03:30.880> it<00:03:30.970> a

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
of paint at the bottom you give it a

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.910 
of paint at the bottom you give it a
good<00:03:31.180> go<00:03:31.359> around<00:03:31.660> that<00:03:31.900> would<00:03:32.049> see<00:03:32.260> just<00:03:32.650> how

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
good go around that would see just how

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:45.460 
good go around that would see just how
well<00:03:35.700> we<00:03:36.700> can<00:03:36.849> mix<00:03:37.120> that<00:03:37.269> paint<00:03:37.540> up

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:54.059 

that's<00:03:46.470> probably<00:03:46.680> mixed<00:03:47.100> by<00:03:47.280> now

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:59.069 

I<00:03:56.790> was<00:03:57.790> tempted<00:03:58.209> to<00:03:58.239> ahead<00:03:58.599> give<00:03:58.780> that<00:03:58.900> a<00:03:58.930> quick

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
I was tempted to ahead give that a quick

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.280 
I was tempted to ahead give that a quick
blast<00:03:59.349> oh<00:03:59.560> well<00:04:00.689> so<00:04:01.689> obviously<00:04:01.870> you're<00:04:02.200> gonna

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
get a bit of paint on the top obviously

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.550

the<00:04:04.120> less<00:04:04.329> full<00:04:04.659> your<00:04:04.840> bottle<00:04:05.109> is<00:04:05.230> you<00:04:05.439> could

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
the less full your bottle is you could

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.220 
the less full your bottle is you could
just<00:04:05.769> give<00:04:05.920> that<00:04:06.069> a<00:04:06.239> lap<00:04:07.239> around<00:04:07.390> inside<00:04:07.989> to

and Pete dinner they're cleaner rather
as<00:04:28.870> you<00:04:29.020> can<00:04:29.169> see<00:04:29.349> that's<00:04:30.009> nicely<00:04:30.250> mixed<00:04:30.729> now

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:30.849 
as you can see that's nicely mixed now

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:34.140 
as you can see that's nicely mixed now
the<00:04:31.539> colors<00:04:31.900> even<00:04:32.080> all<00:04:32.530> round<00:04:32.860> as<00:04:33.610> you<00:04:33.789> can<00:04:33.940> see

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
the colors even all round as you can see

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.540 
the colors even all round as you can see
it's<00:04:34.660> Russian<00:04:35.050> on<00:04:35.259> the<00:04:35.440> side<00:04:35.620> blue<00:04:36.130> which<00:04:36.430> you

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
it's Russian on the side blue which you

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.860 
it's Russian on the side blue which you
would<00:04:36.699> never<00:04:36.910> have<00:04:37.120> known<00:04:37.300> from<00:04:37.570> looking<00:04:37.750> for

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
would never have known from looking for

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.850 
would never have known from looking for
the<00:04:37.990> top<00:04:38.169> before<00:04:38.530> because<00:04:39.430> as<00:04:39.669> you<00:04:39.849> saw<00:04:40.800> it<00:04:41.800> was

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
the top before because as you saw it was

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.279 
the top before because as you saw it was
absolutely<00:04:42.669> separated<00:04:43.509> -<00:04:43.630> how<00:04:43.810> but<00:04:44.139> as<00:04:44.199> you

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
absolutely separated - how but as you

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:48.450 
absolutely separated - how but as you
can<00:04:44.410> see<00:04:44.590> now<00:04:44.830> does<00:04:45.669> perfectly<00:04:46.539> mixed<00:04:47.280> you<00:04:48.280> see

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
can see now does perfectly mixed you see

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.300 
can see now does perfectly mixed you see
a<00:04:48.520> little<00:04:48.639> bit<00:04:48.759> of<00:04:48.849> foam<00:04:49.060> on<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.330> top<00:04:49.919> I'm<00:04:50.919> as

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
a little bit of foam on the top I'm as

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.249 
a little bit of foam on the top I'm as
ready<00:04:51.550> to<00:04:51.820> you<00:04:52.000> so<00:04:52.300> that's<00:04:52.419> just<00:04:52.630> rejuvenated

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259 
ready to you so that's just rejuvenated

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:54.930 
ready to you so that's just rejuvenated
an<00:04:53.470> old<00:04:53.620> bottle<00:04:53.889> of<00:04:54.009> enamel<00:04:54.580> paint<00:04:54.789> that's

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
an old bottle of enamel paint that's

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.990 
an old bottle of enamel paint that's
probably<00:04:55.150> stood<00:04:55.360> there<00:04:55.570> for<00:04:55.740> quite<00:04:56.740> some<00:04:56.949> time

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
probably stood there for quite some time

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.360 
probably stood there for quite some time
separated<00:04:58.000> itself<00:04:58.330> and<00:04:58.720> I<00:04:59.710> probably<00:05:00.070> did

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
separated itself and I probably did

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.040 
separated itself and I probably did
doubly<00:05:00.849> amount<00:05:01.060> of<00:05:01.150> time<00:05:01.300> needed<00:05:01.570> with<00:05:01.900> that

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
doubly amount of time needed with that

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.100 
doubly amount of time needed with that
to<00:05:02.740> actually<00:05:03.159> get<00:05:03.460> that<00:05:03.580> going<00:05:03.940> and<00:05:04.090> there<00:05:05.020> you

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
to actually get that going and there you

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.379 
to actually get that going and there you
go<00:05:05.260> perfectly<00:05:06.159> mixed<00:05:06.340> paint<00:05:06.580> now<00:05:07.090> what<00:05:07.240> I<00:05:07.270> was

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
go perfectly mixed paint now what I was

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:08.490 
go perfectly mixed paint now what I was
just<00:05:07.419> saying<00:05:07.570> and<00:05:07.900> I<00:05:07.960> always<00:05:08.050> have<00:05:08.229> a<00:05:08.260> little

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
just saying and I always have a little

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.760 
just saying and I always have a little
bottle<00:05:08.620> next<00:05:08.979> to<00:05:09.039> my<00:05:10.349> brush<00:05:11.349> that<00:05:11.500> what<00:05:11.650> I've

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
bottle next to my brush that what I've

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.560 
bottle next to my brush that what I've
used<00:05:11.800> brushes<00:05:12.520> or<00:05:12.789> have<00:05:13.180> cleaned<00:05:13.449> off<00:05:13.690> with

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
used brushes or have cleaned off with

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
used brushes or have cleaned off with
these<00:05:16.570> little<00:05:16.900> things<00:05:17.110> in<00:05:17.260> fact<00:05:17.470> they're

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
these little things in fact they're

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.980 
these little things in fact they're
sitting<00:05:17.830> in<00:05:17.949> there<00:05:18.099> right<00:05:18.310> now<00:05:18.550> so<00:05:19.240> if<00:05:19.270> I<00:05:19.810> was

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
sitting in there right now so if I was

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.120 
sitting in there right now so if I was
using<00:05:20.110> animals<00:05:20.560> all<00:05:20.620> the<00:05:20.650> time<00:05:20.919> I'd<00:05:21.099> probably

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
using animals all the time I'd probably

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.909 
using animals all the time I'd probably
have<00:05:21.550> one<00:05:21.760> with<00:05:22.180> you<00:05:23.139> no<00:05:23.289> more<00:05:23.409> paint<00:05:23.650> cleaner

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
have one with you no more paint cleaner

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:25.649 
have one with you no more paint cleaner
and<00:05:24.130> there<00:05:24.310> but<00:05:24.760> I'm<00:05:24.880> not<00:05:24.970> at<00:05:25.090> the<00:05:25.120> minute<00:05:25.300> so<00:05:25.630> I

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:25.659 
and there but I'm not at the minute so I

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:26.939 
and there but I'm not at the minute so I
can't<00:05:26.020> go<00:05:26.169> and<00:05:26.320> check<00:05:26.470> it<00:05:26.590> and<00:05:26.650> have<00:05:26.919> a

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:26.949 
can't go and check it and have a

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:28.020 
can't go and check it and have a
horrible<00:05:27.250> they'll<00:05:27.520> use<00:05:27.699> a<00:05:27.729> little<00:05:27.880> bit<00:05:27.940> of

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
horrible they'll use a little bit of

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.350 
horrible they'll use a little bit of
cellulose<00:05:28.590> on<00:05:29.590> a<00:05:29.650> cloth<00:05:30.370> and<00:05:30.820> we'll<00:05:30.940> clean<00:05:31.180> up

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
cellulose on a cloth and we'll clean up

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.390 
cellulose on a cloth and we'll clean up
so<00:05:31.539> obviously<00:05:31.840> I<00:05:32.080> don't<00:05:32.800> tend<00:05:32.979> to<00:05:33.039> use<00:05:33.250> in

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
so obviously I don't tend to use in

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.189 
so obviously I don't tend to use in
house<00:05:33.520> that<00:05:33.789> much<00:05:34.000> but<00:05:34.690> I<00:05:34.720> thought<00:05:34.990> it<00:05:35.080> was<00:05:35.169> a

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 
house that much but I thought it was a

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:39.089 
house that much but I thought it was a
good<00:05:35.409> demo<00:05:36.840> to<00:05:37.840> show<00:05:37.870> just<00:05:38.560> how<00:05:38.710> well<00:05:38.979> it

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:39.099 
good demo to show just how well it

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:42.060 
good demo to show just how well it
cleans<00:05:39.750> which<00:05:40.750> you<00:05:40.900> cannot<00:05:41.169> fault<00:05:41.740> that<00:05:41.919> at

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.070 
cleans which you cannot fault that at

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.779 
cleans which you cannot fault that at
all<00:05:42.190> and<00:05:42.490> there<00:05:42.729> we<00:05:42.849> go<00:05:43.000> we're<00:05:43.210> probably<00:05:44.789> 90%

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:45.789 
all and there we go we're probably 90%

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:48.120 
all and there we go we're probably 90%
clean<00:05:46.389> so<00:05:46.900> there<00:05:47.020> you<00:05:47.080> go<00:05:47.199> a<00:05:47.229> nice<00:05:47.530> simple<00:05:47.800> tool

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
clean so there you go a nice simple tool

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.290 
clean so there you go a nice simple tool
they<00:05:48.760> cost

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
they cost

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.899 
they cost
I<00:05:49.389> believe<00:05:49.630> it's<00:05:49.810> 12<00:05:50.229> pounds<00:05:51.190> I<00:05:51.340> think<00:05:51.430> 12

00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:51.909 
I believe it's 12 pounds I think 12
