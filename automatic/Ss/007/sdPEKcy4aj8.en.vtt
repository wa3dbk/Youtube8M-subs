the training camp she went through at
Saddleback<00:00:14.040> well<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.790> ones<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.150> saddlebag

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
Saddleback well the ones that saddlebag

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.779 
Saddleback well the ones that saddlebag
are<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.690> lot<00:00:15.929> harder<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:17.039> be<00:00:17.160> honest<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.550> lot

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
are a lot harder to be honest a lot

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.359 
are a lot harder to be honest a lot
longer<00:00:18.060> on<00:00:18.480> these<00:00:19.020> are<00:00:19.170> more<00:00:19.320> on<00:00:19.590> Christian

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
longer on these are more on Christian

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.250 
longer on these are more on Christian
efficient<00:00:20.850> like<00:00:21.029> we<00:00:21.240> were<00:00:21.600> about<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:21.990> side

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
efficient like we were about that side

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.870 
efficient like we were about that side
babe<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.680> was<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.800> lot<00:00:22.949> longer<00:00:23.130> practice<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.820> we

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
babe it was a lot longer practice and we

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.490 
babe it was a lot longer practice and we
were<00:00:24.000> hitting<00:00:24.210> people<00:00:24.570> during<00:00:24.689> camp<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.320> see

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
were hitting people during camp to see

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.200 
were hitting people during camp to see
who<00:00:25.619> can<00:00:25.769> tackle<00:00:25.980> new<00:00:26.220> clean<00:00:26.460> tackle<00:00:26.670> but<00:00:26.970> here

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
who can tackle new clean tackle but here

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.210 
who can tackle new clean tackle but here
is<00:00:27.390> just<00:00:27.539> about<00:00:27.840> flying<00:00:28.500> around<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.010> ball

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
is just about flying around to the ball

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.710 
is just about flying around to the ball
and<00:00:29.250> working<00:00:29.789> on<00:00:29.849> your<00:00:29.970> tackling<00:00:30.300> technique

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
and working on your tackling technique

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.049 
and working on your tackling technique
to<00:00:30.869> be<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.170> better<00:00:31.410> tackler<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.070> I<00:00:32.340> think<00:00:32.759> it's<00:00:33.000> a

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
to be a better tackler so I think it's a

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.370 
to be a better tackler so I think it's a
lot<00:00:33.239> more<00:00:33.270> efficient<00:00:33.780> here<00:00:33.930> than<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.200> was<00:00:34.230> in

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
lot more efficient here than it was in

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.010 
lot more efficient here than it was in
my<00:00:34.559> JUCO<00:00:34.940> what<00:00:35.940> about<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.239> learning<00:00:36.360> curve<00:00:36.719> of

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
my JUCO what about the learning curve of

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.440 
my JUCO what about the learning curve of
absorbing<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.800> defense<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.820> know<00:00:38.940> comparing

absorbing the defense you know comparing

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.360 
absorbing the defense you know comparing

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
that learning curve going and how

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.220 
that learning curve going and how
comfortable<00:00:44.969> are<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.329> now<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.780> defensive

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
comfortable are you now in the defensive

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.049

system<00:00:46.530> they<00:00:46.620> have<00:00:46.649> here<00:00:46.980> I'm<00:00:47.879> really

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
system they have here I'm really

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.850 
system they have here I'm really
comfortable<00:00:48.510> here<00:00:48.840> on<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.260> system<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.739> lot

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
comfortable here on the system is a lot

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.830 
comfortable here on the system is a lot
easier<00:00:50.129> than<00:00:50.340> when<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.640> had<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.300> do<00:00:51.420> in<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.629> past

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
easier than when I had to do in the past

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.740 
easier than when I had to do in the past
on<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:53.520> hardest<00:00:54.059> learnt<00:00:54.239> cry<00:00:54.360> out<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.510> say

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
on the hardest learnt cry out to say

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.150 
on the hardest learnt cry out to say
though<00:00:54.930> when<00:00:55.079> i<00:00:55.140> went<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.379> JUCO<00:00:55.770> because<00:00:56.039> i

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
though when i went to JUCO because i

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.889 
though when i went to JUCO because i
used<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.370> play<00:00:56.489> rover<00:00:57.000> safety<00:00:57.420> when<00:00:57.600> i<00:00:57.629> was<00:00:57.840> in

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
used to play rover safety when i was in

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.810 
used to play rover safety when i was in
high<00:00:58.079> school<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.680> i<00:00:58.739> switched<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.129> corner<00:00:59.579> so

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
high school so i switched the corner so

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.790 
high school so i switched the corner so
it<00:01:00.030> was<00:01:00.149> like<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.390> new<00:01:00.870> transition<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.559> playing

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
it was like a new transition and playing

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.700 
it was like a new transition and playing
off<00:01:02.010> man<00:01:02.309> press<00:01:02.760> man<00:01:03.030> or<00:01:03.300> other<00:01:03.539> stuff<00:01:03.840> because

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
off man press man or other stuff because

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.830 
off man press man or other stuff because
i<00:01:04.739> have<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.040> ability<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.489> do<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.790> but<00:01:05.970> um<00:01:06.270> here

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
i have the ability to do it but um here

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.020 
i have the ability to do it but um here
is<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.080> simple<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.890> have<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.640> have<00:01:08.790> that

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
is a simple you have this you have that

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.300 
is a simple you have this you have that
so<00:01:09.360> it's<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.930> lot<00:01:10.080> easier<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.500> do<00:01:10.680> when<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.130> have

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
so it's a lot easier to do when you have

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.780 
so it's a lot easier to do when you have
that<00:01:11.490> type<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.900> understanding<00:01:13.189> so<00:01:14.189> you're<00:01:14.760> a

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
that type of understanding so you're a

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.609 
that type of understanding so you're a
junior<00:01:15.240> but<00:01:15.270> it's<00:01:15.689> also<00:01:15.869> your<00:01:16.140> first<00:01:16.380> year

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
junior but it's also your first year

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.410 
junior but it's also your first year
here<00:01:16.979> where<00:01:17.549> do<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.700> fit<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.150> in<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
here where do you fit in the in the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.640 
here where do you fit in the in the
pecking<00:01:18.720> order<00:01:18.840> do<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.229> get<00:01:19.350> treated<00:01:19.619> like

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
pecking order do you get treated like

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.109 
pecking order do you get treated like
the<00:01:19.860> freshman<00:01:20.100> by<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.430> older<00:01:20.700> guys<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
the freshman by the older guys on the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.820 
the freshman by the older guys on the
defense<00:01:21.450> no<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.049> don't<00:01:22.290> get<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.530> like<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
defense no I don't get you like the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.950 
defense no I don't get you like the
freshman<00:01:23.070> because<00:01:23.580> i'm<00:01:23.820> really<00:01:24.330> not<00:01:24.479> freshman

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
freshman because i'm really not freshman

freshman because i'm really not freshman
majunior<00:01:25.409> but<00:01:25.680> um<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:26.159> mean<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:26.909> do<00:01:27.119> i<00:01:27.240> do<00:01:27.450> some

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
of the things a freshman do like eight

doing<00:02:54.570> so<00:02:55.140> I<00:02:55.170> think<00:02:55.380> that's<00:02:55.710> the<00:02:56.040> comparison

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
doing so I think that's the comparison

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.150 
doing so I think that's the comparison
to<00:02:57.030> my<00:02:57.210> coaches<00:02:57.680> when<00:02:58.680> you're<00:02:58.830> getting<00:02:58.920> ready

that they could do so I think we're

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.039

run<00:05:16.110> that's<00:05:16.350> what<00:05:16.500> their<00:05:16.620> balance<00:05:17.040> is<00:05:17.220> when<00:05:18.180> he

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
run that's what their balance is when he

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.940 
run that's what their balance is when he
was<00:05:18.360> at<00:05:18.510> Troy<00:05:18.780> it's<00:05:19.110> just<00:05:19.350> that<00:05:19.680> it's

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
was at Troy it's just that it's

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.380 
was at Troy it's just that it's
somewhere<00:05:20.250> around<00:05:20.310> there<00:05:20.760> it's<00:05:20.970> just<00:05:21.180> that

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
somewhere around there it's just that

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.210 
somewhere around there it's just that
they<00:05:21.600> had<00:05:21.750> run<00:05:21.900> so<00:05:22.080> many<00:05:22.170> offensive<00:05:22.590> plays<00:05:22.950> it

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
they had run so many offensive plays it

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.470 
they had run so many offensive plays it
looks<00:05:23.460> like<00:05:23.580> there<00:05:23.730> are<00:05:23.760> passed<00:05:24.000> every<00:05:24.300> team

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 
looks like there are passed every team

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.870 
looks like there are passed every team
but<00:05:24.690> they<00:05:24.810> do<00:05:24.870> run<00:05:25.200> the<00:05:25.260> ball<00:05:25.500> and<00:05:25.770> I<00:05:26.190> we<00:05:26.550> expect

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
but they do run the ball and I we expect

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.300 
but they do run the ball and I we expect
batch<00:05:27.060> don't<00:05:27.570> get<00:05:27.900> over<00:05:28.140> pi<00:05:28.530> like<00:05:28.740> 15<00:05:29.160> 20

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310

look at a big team I look at is playing
football<00:06:22.530> and<00:06:22.740> we've<00:06:22.919> been<00:06:23.100> preparing<00:06:23.250> here

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:23.910 
football and we've been preparing here

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.330 
football and we've been preparing here
and<00:06:24.120> are<00:06:24.300> I<00:06:24.330> believe<00:06:24.870> that<00:06:25.140> we<00:06:25.410> have<00:06:25.440> like<00:06:26.010> the

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 
and are I believe that we have like the

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.610 
and are I believe that we have like the
best<00:06:26.460> group<00:06:26.700> of<00:06:26.820> receivers<00:06:26.940> around<00:06:27.660> so<00:06:28.050> we've

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
best group of receivers around so we've

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:29.840 
best group of receivers around so we've
been<00:06:28.710> preparing<00:06:28.860> with<00:06:29.190> those<00:06:29.310> receivers<00:06:29.700> so<00:06:29.820> I

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:29.850 
been preparing with those receivers so I

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.340 
been preparing with those receivers so I
think<00:06:29.970> the<00:06:30.300> game<00:06:30.540> is<00:06:30.570> going<00:06:30.930> to<00:06:31.020> be<00:06:31.080> the<00:06:31.169> same

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:31.350 
think the game is going to be the same

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.840 
think the game is going to be the same
as<00:06:31.560> practiced<00:06:32.010> as<00:06:32.130> long<00:06:32.280> as<00:06:32.370> we've<00:06:32.490> been<00:06:32.520> doing

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:32.850 
as practiced as long as we've been doing

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.190 
as practiced as long as we've been doing
what<00:06:32.940> we<00:06:33.000> do<00:06:33.120> in<00:06:33.210> practice<00:06:33.390> I<00:06:33.630> think<00:06:33.840> we<00:06:33.960> should

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:34.200 
what we do in practice I think we should

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.680 
what we do in practice I think we should
be<00:06:34.530> fine<00:06:34.770> on<00:06:35.160> the<00:06:35.490> two<00:06:35.640> new<00:06:35.789> faces<00:06:35.970> I'm<00:06:36.300> Ryan
