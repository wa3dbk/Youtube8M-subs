00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.850
 very good friends of youtube 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:09.570
 welcome to a grammy and I bring you a 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:13.289
 series of games to remember are two 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.629
 8-bit games of the console in my 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:18.710
 case I the one known as family game 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:22.339
 but it's the nintendo too 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.939
 I have a series of if they are several 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:24.939
 Applications 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.289
 that can be used as applied 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.710
 no need to have emulator in this 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.960
 I'm playing Super Mario 3 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.390
 really that applications run 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.600
 very well 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.290
 If we are able to use what 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.629
 it's like I have the case of using the 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.329
 phone with otegi and we can put a 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.840
 command if it's not going to be easier 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.960
 but also the simulators run 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.760
 very well I repeat are all and all 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.170
 apps app 'every one does not need 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.610
 install an emulator to be able to 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.699
 use it some have advertisements 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.239
 but as you could see I'm the remove and not 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.239
 appear more 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.700
 they weigh nothing and the truth that they are very 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.320
 entertained and it makes us remember a lot 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.259
 our childhood 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.670
 in my case good in memory to remember 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.880
 there is a game that I 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.850
 It marked a lot and I liked it always 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.570
 that I had the console family nor have 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.770
 used 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:32.080
 now we are going to 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.150
 an application that has 64 games 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.800
 as you can see the interface is almost 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.800
 similar to that of 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:43.150
 television when we look before the 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.460
 games 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:49.840
 we have a total of 64 varied games 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.399
 and three in a classic 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.520
 we have a lot of games like to 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:57.000
 to have a good time and remember those 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.000
 epochs 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.310
 here we are going to try a little bit so that 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.810
 see how it works without any kind of 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.390
 problem 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.159
 this application will find free 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.940
 in the sector about leaving the link in 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:13.500
 the description of the video 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:16.100
 mario 3 is a freckle that I have I go 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.100
 to go up to mega 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.860
 around 30 games that also the 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.610
 I'm going to upload to mega that 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.610
 fullness 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.650
 the Flintstones and a couple of games 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.349
 varied the islander 2 is to say charly 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.030
 in a lot of family game games or 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:39.770
 nintendo depending on how you know 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.270
 to have a good time and are games that 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:47.020
 they do not think we get to weigh 2 megabytes 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:50.070
 how do I go out to put another game 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.070
 for any side 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.140
 backwards 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.610
 again 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:15.480
 more games 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:17.930
 pacman I have a tree plays a thousand 942 the 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.930
 wings 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.510
 I think you have out there in this case this 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.540
 application no 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.269
 but when now I'm going to try the time and 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.090
 they will see that the screen is heard 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:35.890
 a lot of rehabilitation but that cause of 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.360
 emulator that is programmed like this 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.210
 per se 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.620
 if you are going to feel now when you also 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.400
 play 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:48.900
 but put the web where you are going to 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.900
 feel comfortable that way 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.180
 let's go to life 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.490
 as you can see they run without any type 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.490
 of problem 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.550
 you want to leave all the links so that 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:07.490
 can enjoy remembering their childhood 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:09.470
 with these 8-bit retro games 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:13.640
 let's try the last one so that they see 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:16.760
 how these games run 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.370
 and in the case I have the tiny toons a 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.579
 game 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:24.449
 to me in particular 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:26.729
 marked me very much I got tired of giving the 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:32.370
 back to this game to pass it on to 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:35.320
 everything that the subject of the 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.540
 vibration when pressing the buttons 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.970
 I wanted to configure it in the part of 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.210
 configurations but the 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.370
 solutions in china 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.820
 to which I want to comment when 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.800
 you enter the beta 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.510
 they have to be very fast and squeeze 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.150
 be immediately because if you are not going to 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.950
 redirect an internet page 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.560
 all the time so they have to be 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:00.080
 very fast and when they execute the apply 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.000
 it can automatically be then in 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.920
 Any case but a page is redirected 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.840
 Internet go back out of the page 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.060
 internet and run in formally but 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.240
 they have to be easy and put in 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.400
 start to be able to run the game well 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.440
 friends this was today's video 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.930
 8-bit retro games to remember 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.930
