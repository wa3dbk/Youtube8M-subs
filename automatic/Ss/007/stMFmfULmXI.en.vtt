00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
to right click on my background layer at

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.549 
to right click on my background layer at
the<00:00:32.399> top<00:00:32.610> there<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.000> duplicate<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.809> do<00:00:34.380> that

again and then I'm gonna rename these
layers<00:00:36.360> by<00:00:36.750> double<00:00:37.050> clicking<00:00:37.230> them<00:00:37.469> the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
layers by double clicking them the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.049 
layers by double clicking them the
bottom<00:00:38.219> one<00:00:38.340> I'm<00:00:38.520> gonna<00:00:38.700> call<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.120> bottom

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.880 

middle<00:00:45.059> layer<00:00:45.270> I'm<00:00:45.450> gonna<00:00:45.690> call<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.140> Meade

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
middle layer I'm gonna call it Meade

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.639 
middle layer I'm gonna call it Meade
I<00:00:47.870> never<00:00:48.870> guess<00:00:49.050> what<00:00:49.170> I'm<00:00:49.260> gonna<00:00:49.350> call<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
I never guess what I'm gonna call the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:57.290 
I never guess what I'm gonna call the
top<00:00:49.800> layer<00:00:49.980> go<00:00:50.370> on<00:00:54.710> so<00:00:55.710> creative<00:00:56.190> crazy<00:00:56.760> and

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
top layer go on so creative crazy and

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.930 
top layer go on so creative crazy and
then<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.809> am<00:00:58.140> going<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.770> deselect<00:00:59.190> my<00:00:59.670> bottom

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
then I am going to deselect my bottom

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.440 
then I am going to deselect my bottom
layer<00:01:00.059> just<00:01:00.359> by<00:01:00.510> turning<00:01:00.930> off<00:01:04.760> so<00:01:05.760> then<00:01:06.390> I'm

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
layer just by turning off so then I'm

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.880 
layer just by turning off so then I'm
gonna<00:01:06.570> go<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.780> my<00:01:06.869> effects<00:01:07.200> browser<00:01:07.380> now<00:01:07.860> I

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
gonna go to my effects browser now I

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.950 
gonna go to my effects browser now I
think<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.150> pics<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.420> my<00:01:09.510> team<00:01:09.750> should

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
think that the pics of my team should

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.720 
think that the pics of my team should
just<00:01:10.170> add<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.590> sketch<00:01:11.040> effect

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.720 

long<00:01:15.730> way<00:01:15.850> around<00:01:15.910> but<00:01:16.210> it's<00:01:16.360> not<00:01:16.510> that

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730 
long way around but it's not that

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.010 
long way around but it's not that
there's<00:01:18.730> many<00:01:18.880> ways<00:01:18.940> that<00:01:19.240> you<00:01:19.330> can<00:01:19.480> apply<00:01:19.870> an

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
there's many ways that you can apply an

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.760 
there's many ways that you can apply an
effect<00:01:20.320> to<00:01:20.500> what<00:01:21.340> we've<00:01:21.520> got<00:01:21.550> here<00:01:22.090> right

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
effect to what we've got here right

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.850 
effect to what we've got here right
if<00:01:23.770> I've<00:01:23.920> got<00:01:24.040> it<00:01:24.130> selected<00:01:24.280> here<00:01:24.790> I<00:01:25.060> can<00:01:25.930> drag

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
if I've got it selected here I can drag

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.620 
if I've got it selected here I can drag
and<00:01:26.920> drop<00:01:27.070> it<00:01:27.310> to<00:01:27.340> there<00:01:27.550> I<00:01:27.820> can<00:01:28.120> drag<00:01:28.420> and<00:01:28.600> drop

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
and drop it to there I can drag and drop

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.660 
and drop it to there I can drag and drop
it<00:01:28.750> on<00:01:28.990> canvas<00:01:29.170> or<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.920> simplest<00:01:30.460> way<00:01:30.610> you

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
it on canvas or the simplest way you

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.240 
it on canvas or the simplest way you
just<00:01:31.000> double<00:01:31.270> click<00:01:31.450> ok<00:01:32.350> so<00:01:32.440> and<00:01:32.920> that<00:01:33.130> will

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
just double click ok so and that will

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.710 
just double click ok so and that will
apply<00:01:33.460> it<00:01:33.580> to<00:01:33.760> whatever<00:01:33.940> cameras<00:01:34.390> you've<00:01:34.570> got

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
apply it to whatever cameras you've got

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.510 
apply it to whatever cameras you've got
selected<00:01:35.080> so<00:01:35.650> we've<00:01:35.800> applied<00:01:36.100> that<00:01:36.340> the

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
selected so we've applied that the

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.320 
selected so we've applied that the
invert<00:01:37.150> effect<00:01:37.690> to<00:01:38.380> our<00:01:38.410> top<00:01:39.040> canvas<00:01:39.490> I'm<00:01:40.150> then

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
invert effect to our top canvas I'm then

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.510 
invert effect to our top canvas I'm then
gonna<00:01:40.420> go<00:01:40.630> to<00:01:40.690> blending<00:01:41.020> mode<00:01:41.410> and<00:01:41.920> drop<00:01:42.280> down

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
gonna go to blending mode and drop down

John blur radius well after those differ

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.490 
John blur radius well after those differ
slightly<00:02:12.010> but<00:02:12.700> for<00:02:12.880> this<00:02:13.020> sort<00:02:14.020> of<00:02:14.050> portrays

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
stylize in the effects so you can just

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.340 
stylize in the effects so you can just
gone<00:02:24.400> effects<00:02:24.880> and<00:02:25.209> then<00:02:25.330> stylize<00:02:25.810> just

is<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:34.910> sketch<00:03:35.180> on<00:03:35.330> its<00:03:35.480> own<00:03:35.630> and<00:03:36.350> now<00:03:36.470> let's

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
is the sketch on its own and now let's

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.920 
is the sketch on its own and now let's
do<00:03:36.890> the<00:03:37.130> and<00:03:37.550> I'm<00:03:37.640> gonna<00:03:37.760> use<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:38.360> lightly<00:03:38.720> so

boy's hair outta there you make the
radius<00:04:04.459> bigger<00:04:04.790> and<00:04:05.090> smaller<00:04:05.390> so<00:04:06.049> you<00:04:06.110> move

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
radius bigger and smaller so you move

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.650 
radius bigger and smaller so you move
the<00:04:06.560> actual<00:04:06.799> light<00:04:07.220> with<00:04:07.640> this<00:04:07.850> big<00:04:08.360> one<00:04:08.570> in

the actual light with this big one in
the<00:04:08.720> middle<00:04:08.810> and<00:04:09.200> I'll<00:04:09.980> put<00:04:10.190> it<00:04:10.310> in<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:10.459> corner

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
the middle and I'll put it in the corner

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.670 
the middle and I'll put it in the corner
and<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.209> radius<00:04:11.570> make<00:04:12.049> it<00:04:12.200> bigger<00:04:12.380> like<00:04:12.530> this

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680
