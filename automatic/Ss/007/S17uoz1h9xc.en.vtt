00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.120
 great time of the joe bar team 2010 dont 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:42.920
 the one- seater and silent raised 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.140
 differentiates this roasted version of the 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.280
 classic version the v7 keeps its 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.649
 many touches of chrome and its 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.610
 final transmission by super cardan 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.320
 in this green dress

 V twin cylinder 2,744 cubic centimeters 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.640
 is rather decaffeinated with 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:03.140
 only 49 small horses that 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.850
 does not prevent moto guzzi propose us 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.380
 a caf is full of character that 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.439
 delivers good sensations at low and mid 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.439
 diets 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.390
 atypical driving position 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.860
 wages tiring in town but oh 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.570
 how much jubilant on the roads 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.070
 sinuous thanks to a cycle part 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.710
 particularly reassuring 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.540
 the front disc of 320 mm calipers 4 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.200
 pistons is also convincing 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.200
 in all situations 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.940
 I am 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.890
 I am 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.390
 riding this rewarding motorcycle and 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.310
 to match philippe our journalist 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.140
 tester really drank the little 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.550
 good milk then philippe we are in front of 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.690
 coffee people in saint tropez then 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.510
 exactly what did you think of 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.890
 this motorcycle guzzi v7 coffee 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.660
 good evening david ben listens to this bike 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.370
 this bike hides his game well 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.110
 she looks like a big brute 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.750
 like that otherwise it's a bike that's 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.910
 very easy who is taking the end of 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.720
 fingers she is very pleasant to use 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.930
 daily 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.900
 the nostalgic will be delighted first 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.030
 by the aesthetic that recalls without 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.530
 hesitate the motorcycles of yesteryear and then by the 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.660
 couple of reversal always present 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.950
 even if it is a little attenuated 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.260
 would have liked an author a little bit more 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.550
 powerful but but overall this 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.100
 motorcycle is very friendly 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.180
 in the end although the addition to little salty 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.220
 leaves a bitter aftertaste 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.600
 motorcycle guzzi serves us a coffee of very 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.600
 good taste to consume without moderation
