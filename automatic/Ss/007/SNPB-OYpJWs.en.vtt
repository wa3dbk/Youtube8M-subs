00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.400
 undoubtedly what most calls the 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.340
 attention to books write grid 2 is the 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.200
 juntera divided this design allows the 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.970
 independent work since the gold of 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.320
 foot so that a 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.240
 greater variety of support and a 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.550
 stability seen thanks to the ability 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.679
 of movement and strength that this 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.199
 finger greatly improving the feeling of 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:30.820
 terrain that users value so much 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:33.130
 minimalist 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.590
 It has a known strip of elastic 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.480
 as the band that surrounds the middle zone and 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.220
 makes the foot stay in tune 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.340
 and attached to the shoe throughout 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.110
 moment the last of the shoe is 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.390
 perfectly designed to mimic the 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.430
 human foot and to try to adapt to 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.449
 he like a second skin to 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.580
 to get it 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.140
 incorporates an asymmetrical throw that makes 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.629
 that the upper part is not divided into two parts 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.790
 almost symmetric as usual 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.769
 but it is built to adapt 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.379
 to each foot area in the best way 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.089
 possible the upper has also changes 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.070
 important in your expert to the first 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.960
 tongue version is a kind of 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.210
 continuation of one of the sides of 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.930
 the skin that wraps around our foot something 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.450
 imported from the prox great silence 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.310
 also the sole has a new 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.650
 design with a is completely created 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.540
 distinct much more fumigate entity and that in 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.980
 global will give better results in the 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.530
 most land that the version 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.720
 Previous protection and cushioning 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.240
 is provided by the biologist and 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.700
 the enea buffer gel and account 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.520
 with a 2 a fall between the heel and the 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.320
 tip of 4 mm ideal for all 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.720
 those minimalist runners in 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.180
 great looking transition or natural 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.180
 a shoe for the trail running your 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.160
 weight is 275 grams and its user 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.170
 recommended depends a lot on the technique 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.470
 of the corridor a corridor with good 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.530
 technique could use it up to 85 kilos and 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.960
 runners without transition up to 75 180 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.550
 kilos can also be used as 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.860
 competition shoe or 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.960
 training if you have a very technical 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.300
 good you can use it as a shoe 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.640
 of training and competition but for 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.500
 otherwise if you are in transition or 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.880
 starting you can use it to 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.480
 trailers like that ease of 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.480
 competition
