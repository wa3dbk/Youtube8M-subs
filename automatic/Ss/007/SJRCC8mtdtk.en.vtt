00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.280 

I<00:02:18.510> chose<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.709> rpi<00:02:20.040> exhaust<00:02:20.550> because<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:22.140> was<00:02:22.260> a

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
I chose the rpi exhaust because it was a

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.110 
I chose the rpi exhaust because it was a
full<00:02:22.560> exhaust<00:02:22.890> system<00:02:23.489> I<00:02:23.520> looked<00:02:23.790> into<00:02:23.940> the

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
full exhaust system I looked into the

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.390 
full exhaust system I looked into the
Dinan<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:25.020> basically<00:02:25.410> all<00:02:25.739> you<00:02:25.980> get<00:02:26.160> with<00:02:26.310> the

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
Dinan and basically all you get with the

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.420 
Dinan and basically all you get with the
Dinan<00:02:26.760> is<00:02:26.880> a<00:02:26.910> muffler<00:02:27.270> this<00:02:28.050> is<00:02:28.349> this<00:02:28.620> RPI<00:02:29.010> goes

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
Dinan is a muffler this is this RPI goes

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.270 
Dinan is a muffler this is this RPI goes
all<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.640> way<00:02:29.819> from<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.120> engine<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.840> tips

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
all the way from the engine to the tips

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.610 
all the way from the engine to the tips

fully stainless steel warrantied for

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.900 
fully stainless steel warrantied for
life<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.780> adds<00:02:36.780> about<00:02:37.050> 12<00:02:37.440> horsepower<00:02:37.890> due<00:02:38.790> to

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
life and adds about 12 horsepower due to

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.540 
life and adds about 12 horsepower due to
the<00:02:39.000> efficiency<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.840> exhaust<00:02:40.550> much

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
the efficiency of the exhaust much

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.750 
the efficiency of the exhaust much
better<00:02:41.790> than<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.090> Dinan<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:42.680> actually<00:02:43.760> right

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
better than the Dinan and actually right

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.570 
better than the Dinan and actually right
almost<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.209> same<00:02:45.330> price<00:02:45.739> so<00:02:46.739> I<00:02:46.950> thought<00:02:47.459> it's

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
almost the same price so I thought it's

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.820 
almost the same price so I thought it's
a<00:02:47.610> great<00:02:47.790> value<00:02:48.349> also<00:02:49.349> weighs<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:49.560> lot<00:02:49.769> less

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
a great value also weighs a lot less

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.220 
a great value also weighs a lot less
than<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.370> stock<00:02:50.850> exhaust<00:02:51.180> which<00:02:51.450> also<00:02:51.840> in

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
than the stock exhaust which also in

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.490 
than the stock exhaust which also in
effect<00:02:52.410> adds<00:02:52.890> power<00:02:54.200> okay<00:02:55.200> I'm<00:02:55.260> gonna<00:02:55.380> go

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
effect adds power okay I'm gonna go

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:03.150 
effect adds power okay I'm gonna go
ahead<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:55.830> put<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.700> windows<00:02:56.940> down
