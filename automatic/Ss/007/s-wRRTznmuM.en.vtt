00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.130
 Y 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.130
 you 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.619
 Oh, what's happening, today is 197 and today 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.320
 I bring you the tutorial on how to spend 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.720
 the music from our computer to the iphone 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.710
 it's all music bought on iTunes it 's 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.789
 all legal but good as music 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.220
 buy itunes you can download 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.480
 directly on the iphone although I'm going to 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.859
 pretend that I'm not going to do like that 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.250
 it's music bought in any other 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.199
 store and I will pass it in the way 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.790
 traditional to say it somehow not 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:41.699
 as if it were not from itunes without 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.600
 download it from there the first step 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:47.430
 obviously it will open itunes here is and 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.170
 good as you see I do not have any music 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.300
 asks me if I want to scan by the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.710
 computer to see what it finds and such 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.239
 but let's suppose that what I want 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:00.480
 to pass is exclusively this here 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:04.620
 then we select all this music 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.860
 and we drag it inside is not enough 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.390
 simple we wait for it to load all 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.520
 and good and here as you can see I'm doing 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.970
 the process in in mac and I will explain 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.830
 some peculiarities that there are in mac and 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.630
 good more than good rather they are 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.229
 differences between mac and windows 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.880
 in this aspect that is that I en in mac 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.869
 I drag these changes as they are 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.020
 here 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.280
 and no matter if deleted from here and towards 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.060
 the non- Felix wastebasket that I'm doing 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.860
 trap 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.740
 these songs are going to continue here and it 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.450
 they will continue listening they will be 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.829
 perfectly the same while in 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.490
 windows at the moment that simply 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:45.100
 move them a folder to another folder and 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.930
 they will not be available on iTunes 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.960
 then when I go to synchronize the 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.770
 iphone like I now had them here 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.720
 synchronized the iphone is passed in the 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.979
 iphone the new other folder synchronizes 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.020
 the iphone again and they are erased from 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.399
 iphone I have happened to me when I 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.049
 used windows and the truth is that it's a bit 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.780
 a nuisance and what I recommend is 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.340
 that before passing the music to iTunes 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.520
 go to my documents you create a 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.470
 folder metais there music and hence the 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.840
 passejÃ  itunes and nolan or you go from there already 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.940
 never again that will be a recommendation 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.030
 personal so you can see us in what you 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.950
 I have not told the truth that I see it 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.959
 best solution and it makes good in the only 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.640
 also so it occurs to me to have it 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.920
 everything so between quotes organized in 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.049
 windows not the mag there is no problem in that 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.849
 meaning so once explained the 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.799
 two differences already this tutorial would happen 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.560
 to be universal for both mac and for 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:35.170
 windows is worth now next step let's go 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.829
 to connect the iphone itunes is worth 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.829
 You see here I have it 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.210
 and we have the connected hawk you see here 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:50.210
 is already loading 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.070
 but not that synchronization starts 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.170
 it is already as you see it had nothing marked 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.870
 to synchronize and good now it's very 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.550
 simple we enter here on the iphone then 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.620
 here gives me all the information about 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.930
 about my iphone but good we're going to 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.250
 the music that is why we go and 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.590
 as you see the box synchronize music 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.020
 is disabled if it is simply the 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.590
 I would have to activate when it is detected 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.720
 that I have 13 songs we remove for 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.700
 example that I do not want the voice notes 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.610
 it means to put something or imagine 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.260
 that only has certain songs from 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.060
 my list because I give here simply 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:27.819
 would mark then for example I want those of 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:31.659
 david guetta that the crown of empire 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:35.230
 and the maroon five solo from we are the 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:37.599
 emergency those standards I want good so 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.640
 now just so you can see it 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:44.080
 connected sounds 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:48.810
 sorry a failure of the direct nothing happens 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.810
 we are already back here music 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.990
 and it's all already playing but 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.500
 you can see then now just you 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.500
 I give to apply 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.730
 and the transfer of 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:02.560
 songs as you see here already come out if you 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.200
 I give here songs that start loading 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.849
 all and as you see is very simple 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.700
 many people have complications in this 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:11.319
 but as you can see, it's not very 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.120
 complicated not at the moment that you 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.980
 explain already you see it once and it's 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.470
 everything very clear now and simply you 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.989
 would accept and would already be all 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.000
 past - this album good I now for 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.040
 example yes I'm going to let it go 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.690
 to synchronize all but in the notes of 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.490
 voice 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.370
 and then tomorrow to the we are the 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.470
 emergency 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.470
 would be is this after transferring 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:41.850
 here is then we are going to do the 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.850
 try and we will give you for example here 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:49.449
 yes yes they have spent everything great and 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.059
 so then one had said all this 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:54.069
 I would have to say goodbye because I no longer 

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:55.749
 is nothing more to add so well 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:57.669

00:04:55.749 --> 00:05:00.809
