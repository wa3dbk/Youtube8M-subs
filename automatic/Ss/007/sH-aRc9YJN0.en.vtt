Tab 8 point and 10.1 these were created

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.300 
Tab 8 point and 10.1 these were created
as<00:00:18.449> mid-range<00:00:19.020> tablets<00:00:19.560> in<00:00:19.770> different<00:00:20.130> size

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
as mid-range tablets in different size

as mid-range tablets in different size
screen<00:00:21.060> sizes<00:00:21.300> so<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.410> needs<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.740> a

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
screen sizes so that the needs of a

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.689 
screen sizes so that the needs of a
broader<00:00:23.070> group<00:00:23.310> were<00:00:23.699> met<00:00:25.220> the<00:00:26.220> best<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.550> them

broader group were met the best of them
all<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.029> Galaxy<00:00:27.449> Tab<00:00:27.750> 10.1<00:00:28.199> costs<00:00:29.480> $379<00:00:30.480> then

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
all the Galaxy Tab 10.1 costs $379 then

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.440 
all the Galaxy Tab 10.1 costs $379 then
the<00:00:31.230> tab<00:00:31.470> 3.8<00:00:32.329> 8.0

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
the tab 3.8 8.0

the tab 3.8 8.0
for<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.489> $299<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.760> finally<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.840> tab<00:00:37.079> 3<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.530> 7.00

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
for a $299 and finally the tab 3 is 7.00

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
for 199 all on Amazon do you already

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:50.549 
for 199 all on Amazon do you already
have<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:42.030> favorite

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.590 

what's<00:00:51.129> striking<00:00:51.460> right<00:00:51.940> off<00:00:52.090> the<00:00:52.210> bat<00:00:52.390> is

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
what's striking right off the bat is

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.420 
what's striking right off the bat is
that<00:00:52.660> there<00:00:52.960> is<00:00:53.050> a<00:00:53.079> design<00:00:53.500> jump<00:00:53.860> from<00:00:54.070> the<00:00:54.160> tab

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
that there is a design jump from the tab

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.290 
that there is a design jump from the tab
3.0<00:00:55.360> and<00:00:55.600> 10.1<00:00:56.170> to<00:00:56.739> the<00:00:56.860> 7-inch<00:00:57.280> model<00:00:57.670> the

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
3.0 and 10.1 to the 7-inch model the

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.180 
3.0 and 10.1 to the 7-inch model the
reason<00:00:58.570> for<00:00:58.719> this<00:00:58.839> is<00:00:59.170> that<00:00:59.410> the<00:00:59.649> smallest<00:00:59.949> of

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
reason for this is that the smallest of

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.040 
reason for this is that the smallest of
three<00:01:00.460> was<00:01:00.610> presented<00:01:01.089> before<00:01:01.239> each<00:01:01.629> of<00:01:01.899> the

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
three was presented before each of the

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.360 
three was presented before each of the
other<00:01:02.199> two<00:01:02.500> in<00:01:02.710> fact

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
other two in fact

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.550 
other two in fact
belongs<00:01:03.879> to<00:01:03.969> the<00:01:04.119> line<00:01:04.299> before<00:01:04.540> the<00:01:04.780> s4<00:01:05.290> style

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
belongs to the line before the s4 style

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.210 
belongs to the line before the s4 style
for<00:01:06.460> example<00:01:06.850> if<00:01:07.060> we<00:01:07.180> compare<00:01:07.509> the<00:01:07.630> Tab<00:01:07.869> 7.0<00:01:08.590> to

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
for example if we compare the Tab 7.0 to

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.070 
for example if we compare the Tab 7.0 to
the<00:01:09.340> 8.0<00:01:09.759> you<00:01:09.970> can<00:01:10.119> see<00:01:10.300> that<00:01:10.479> the<00:01:10.600> former<00:01:10.930> is

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
the 8.0 you can see that the former is

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.620 
the 8.0 you can see that the former is
quite<00:01:11.380> a<00:01:11.440> bit<00:01:11.619> wider<00:01:12.119> other<00:01:13.119> design

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
quite a bit wider other design

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.690 
quite a bit wider other design
differences<00:01:13.990> include<00:01:14.979> the<00:01:15.100> texture<00:01:15.490> of<00:01:15.520> the

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
differences include the texture of the

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.639 
differences include the texture of the
plastic<00:01:16.149> the<00:01:16.509> location<00:01:17.020> of<00:01:17.110> the<00:01:17.200> camera<00:01:17.409> lens

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
plastic the location of the camera lens

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:20.789

when<00:01:45.460> compared<00:01:45.819> with<00:01:45.880> the<00:01:45.970> Nexus<00:01:46.390> 7<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.979> can

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
when compared with the Nexus 7 you can

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.559 
when compared with the Nexus 7 you can
see<00:01:48.310> that<00:01:48.460> the<00:01:48.580> screen<00:01:48.789> is<00:01:48.819> in<00:01:49.000> fact<00:01:49.240> smaller

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 
see that the screen is in fact smaller

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:54.859 
see that the screen is in fact smaller
as<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.950> Nexus<00:01:51.250> 7<00:01:51.399> has<00:01:51.550> a<00:01:51.729> seven-inch<00:01:52.240> diagonal

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.899 

personally<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.829> think<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.460> Nexus<00:01:56.759> 7

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
personally I think that the Nexus 7

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.910 
personally I think that the Nexus 7
feels<00:01:57.210> more<00:01:57.390> comfortable<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.990> hold<00:01:58.170> as<00:01:58.439> well

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
feels more comfortable to hold as well

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.440 
feels more comfortable to hold as well
as<00:01:59.009> gives<00:01:59.219> off<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.609> impression<00:01:59.640> of<00:02:00.000> being<00:02:00.060> of

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
as gives off the impression of being of

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.940 
as gives off the impression of being of
higher<00:02:00.630> quality

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.550
