00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.040
 plus 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.610
 hello how about friends how are you doing I am 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:20.670
 gay and here I bring you a kind of 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:23.040
 tutorial a question that made me me 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.110
 they said that as I recorded the screen 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.270
 of my android to be able to do those 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.990
 gameplays with the android as the 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:34.590
 answer is the screencast that is this 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.300
 program that we see on screen with 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.790
 this program can record the screen 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.970
 of your android and therefore can play and 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.890
 record at the same time 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.650
 let's see a little more a little bit of 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.560
 What is this program about? 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.400
 Program 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.400
 Let's see 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.890
 excuse me I have a kind of 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.960
 password so that nobody can see what 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.179
 well here is the first one we 're going to 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.469
 find with a gray ball to 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:01.879
 be red because I'm 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.829
 recording but normally that color 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.750
 gray that means we're not 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.509
 recording when it is red is 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.549
 which means that we are recording 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:12.560
 that is the most basic thing, that is, it has no more 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.539
 is all they have to do to oppress 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.140
 when they have record and re-press 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:20.560
 when they want to stop recording 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.229
 let's see the options he gives us 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.909
 here is here they are supposed to have 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.299
 appear the videos that we have recorded 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.530
 with this program the most you see that 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.140
 it takes a little bit to order them there 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.490
 remember this this game is the 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.790
 game of my favorite villain who already 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.860
 I have on my channel 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.990
 and so if you have more obviously videos 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.840
 are going to appear more videos here can 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.370
 reproduce it or delete it the one that is in 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.690
 half the truth is that I have no idea 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.300
 so that it serves either 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.540
 I 've gotten a lot but the basics this 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.060
 is to do a test to see if their 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.250
 cell phones or your tablet is compatible or 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.320
 You can start it well without it 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.040
 loss of frames per second 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.170
 here we have the options the first is 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.480
 the quality of the video obviously I have 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.420
 in ten the highest 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.640
 high 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.370
 the second option that we are right now is 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.549
 that the video is rotated or not rotated 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.970
 let's see let's see here are the 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:24.040
 frames per second is up to 40 but 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.420
 I am 21 so that it does not become so 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.590
 heavy 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.970
 the speed between more per have goes more 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.410
 fast the video I do not know if I explain 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.960
 that does not matter much if 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.820
 leave it is no longer important here 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.720
 is for when the screen is raw 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.970
 appear on screen 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.150
 one of these icons I have the 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.120
 first that is I think the most basic good 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.090
 the second 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.140
 I like that we can put the name of the 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.569
 video I have it by default video 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.660
 the other options are a bit that no no 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.370
 be the one marked in the audio or the 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.090
 of audio record that is to record the audio 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.400
 that of the brand 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.349
 in the other options I really do not have 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.690
 idea for them to be either when they are not 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.020
 I think they serve a lot, that 's what 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.130
 I do 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.490
 and here is for 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.560
 the image format 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.080
 like to take a picture just there 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.530
 is 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.060
 and I tell them the other options I do not 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.850
 they are interesting because what I do is 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.560
 record the screen so basically 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:33.440
 that would be all they would have to do 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.500
 obviously if they have the tablet of a 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.319
 little capita observe a little bit 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.840
 the meaning of a processor and all that 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.760
 it's going to be a little difficult they're going to have 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.700
 a loss of frames per second very 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.670
 big but 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.470
 basically this program is very good 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:56.220
 yes if you run programs or games 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.870
 very heavy will see a lost I repeat 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.000
 very important frames per second 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.269
 even to see a little bit of acc and everything 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.670
 and that but right now there are cell very 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.590
 powerful and very powerful tablets as well 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.170
 I do not think they have much problem 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.269
 there's the answer friends this is the 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.879
 program that used the program costs 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.400
 around 50 pesos that would be like 4 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:19.470
 dollars approximately I think it was what 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.870
 that cost me is not free there is a 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:27.430
 trial version but this is not the 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.380
 approved in the complete 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.660
 to stop recording to stop 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.350
 record there are two ways we get to 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:37.900
 program and we squeeze the ball again 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.330
 red and we stop recording or in the bar 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.039
 of notifications is and is what I'm going to 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.770
 do at that time so many 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:51.250
 thank you I say goodbye telling you 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.250
 the next goodbye subscribe and
