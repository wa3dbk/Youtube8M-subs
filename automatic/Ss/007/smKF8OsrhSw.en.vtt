up a little higher you can't access it

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.359 
up a little higher you can't access it
from<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:37.020> good<00:01:37.140> angle<00:01:37.470> does<00:01:37.920> sit<00:01:38.130> in<00:01:38.220> there

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
from a good angle does sit in there

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.060

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
there so as you can see you do have some

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.020 
there so as you can see you do have some
nice<00:01:45.509> cushioning<00:01:46.079> in<00:01:46.229> there<00:01:46.520> which<00:01:47.520> does<00:01:47.729> keep
