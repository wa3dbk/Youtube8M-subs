the Dave which project believable yard

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.800 
the Dave which project believable yard
is<00:04:46.360> a<00:04:46.389> mess<00:04:46.720> man<00:04:46.750> very<00:04:47.650> cool<00:04:48.070> you<00:04:48.310> say<00:04:48.550> it<00:04:49.510> works

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
is a mess man very cool you say it works

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.560 
is a mess man very cool you say it works
it<00:04:50.139> really<00:04:50.470> works<00:04:50.680> this<00:04:51.370> technology<00:04:51.880> it's<00:04:52.300> a

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
it really works this technology it's a

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.320 
it really works this technology it's a
battery-operated<00:04:53.580> device<00:04:54.580> now<00:04:54.850> the<00:04:54.910> lines

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
battery-operated device now the lines

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.629 
battery-operated device now the lines
stuck<00:04:55.720> out<00:04:55.930> is<00:04:56.110> it<00:04:56.260> I<00:04:56.380> mean<00:04:56.530> yeah<00:04:56.800> get<00:04:57.190> ugly<00:04:57.610> I

stuck out is it I mean yeah get ugly I
mean<00:04:57.940> no<00:04:58.150> it<00:04:58.419> you<00:04:58.780> use<00:04:59.080> this<00:04:59.290> edging<00:04:59.889> guide<00:05:00.190> to

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
mean no it you use this edging guide to

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.219 
mean no it you use this edging guide to
go<00:05:00.850> along<00:05:01.000> the<00:05:01.150> side<00:05:01.360> of<00:05:01.479> your<00:05:01.540> house<00:05:01.720> or<00:05:02.110> go

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
go along the side of your house or go

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.219 
go along the side of your house or go
along<00:05:02.440> the<00:05:02.590> boundary<00:05:03.010> and<00:05:03.310> you<00:05:03.729> basically

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
along the boundary and you basically

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:06.450 
along the boundary and you basically
locate<00:05:05.229> the<00:05:05.320> perimeter<00:05:05.680> wire<00:05:05.889> underneath

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
locate the perimeter wire underneath

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.040 
locate the perimeter wire underneath
this<00:05:06.820> you<00:05:07.120> know<00:05:07.210> it's<00:05:07.449> really<00:05:07.660> well<00:05:07.810> laid<00:05:08.020> out

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
this you know it's really well laid out

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.379 
this you know it's really well laid out
and<00:05:08.500> remember<00:05:09.040> camping<00:05:09.639> with<00:05:09.820> the<00:05:09.910> Boy<00:05:10.030> Scouts

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
and remember camping with the Boy Scouts

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.629 
and remember camping with the Boy Scouts
you<00:05:10.630> just<00:05:10.810> use<00:05:10.960> these<00:05:11.139> stakes<00:05:11.530> and<00:05:11.860> you<00:05:12.490> put

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 
you just use these stakes and you put

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:14.430 
you just use these stakes and you put
the<00:05:12.760> stakes<00:05:13.030> along<00:05:13.300> the<00:05:13.450> wire<00:05:13.600> like<00:05:13.900> every<00:05:14.169> six

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
the stakes along the wire like every six

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.740 
the stakes along the wire like every six
feet<00:05:14.500> or<00:05:14.770> so<00:05:14.979> and<00:05:15.250> this<00:05:15.970> is<00:05:16.150> basically<00:05:16.360> the

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
feet or so and this is basically the

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.330 
feet or so and this is basically the
same<00:05:16.900> technology<00:05:17.410> that<00:05:17.440> the<00:05:17.680> electronic<00:05:18.130> dog

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
same technology that the electronic dog

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.210 
same technology that the electronic dog
leashes<00:05:18.610> use<00:05:18.940> keep<00:05:19.810> their<00:05:19.960> dog<00:05:20.110> in<00:05:20.350> okay<00:05:20.710> so

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
leashes use keep their dog in okay so

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.790 
leashes use keep their dog in okay so
the<00:05:21.639> lawnmower<00:05:22.120> follows<00:05:22.660> this<00:05:22.900> wire<00:05:23.200> and<00:05:23.620> the

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
the lawnmower follows this wire and the

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.460 
the lawnmower follows this wire and the
wire<00:05:23.979> gets<00:05:24.250> grown<00:05:24.610> in<00:05:24.820> by<00:05:24.970> the<00:05:25.030> grass<00:05:25.300> so<00:05:26.020> in<00:05:26.320> my

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
wire gets grown in by the grass so in my

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:27.870 
wire gets grown in by the grass so in my
segment<00:05:26.919> you<00:05:27.010> could<00:05:27.160> see<00:05:27.310> a<00:05:27.340> little<00:05:27.490> bit<00:05:27.639> about

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
segment you could see a little bit about

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.159 
segment you could see a little bit about
that<00:05:28.120> green<00:05:28.360> wire<00:05:28.540> this<00:05:28.750> because<00:05:28.900> it<00:05:29.050> was

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
that green wire this because it was

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:31.260 
that green wire this because it was
fresh<00:05:29.410> I<00:05:29.620> just<00:05:29.800> put<00:05:29.979> it<00:05:30.070> in<00:05:30.190> place<00:05:30.220> but<00:05:31.090> one

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
fresh I just put it in place but one

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.570 
fresh I just put it in place but one
part<00:05:31.479> of<00:05:31.630> your<00:05:31.780> long<00:05:31.990> yeah<00:05:32.320> but<00:05:32.770> you<00:05:33.100> push<00:05:33.370> the

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
part of your long yeah but you push the

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.690 
part of your long yeah but you push the
button<00:05:34.030> to<00:05:34.150> energize<00:05:34.600> it<00:05:34.840> and<00:05:35.220> the<00:05:36.220> the<00:05:36.490> wire

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
button to energize it and the the wire

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.909 
button to energize it and the the wire
creates<00:05:37.570> a<00:05:37.690> basically<00:05:38.110> a<00:05:38.199> magnetic<00:05:38.680> field

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
creates a basically a magnetic field

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.490 
creates a basically a magnetic field
that<00:05:39.310> the<00:05:39.520> robo-moe<00:05:40.000> first<00:05:40.630> it<00:05:40.840> follows<00:05:41.229> the

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
that the robo-moe first it follows the

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.650 
that the robo-moe first it follows the
perimeter<00:05:41.919> twice<00:05:42.190> to<00:05:42.430> edge<00:05:42.580> and<00:05:42.850> then<00:05:43.360> it<00:05:43.479> does

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
perimeter twice to edge and then it does

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.110 
perimeter twice to edge and then it does
a<00:05:43.690> zigzag<00:05:44.289> back<00:05:44.650> and<00:05:44.710> forth<00:05:44.919> movement<00:05:45.910> back

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
a zigzag back and forth movement back

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.830 
a zigzag back and forth movement back
across<00:05:46.389> the<00:05:46.840> lawn<00:05:47.410> and<00:05:48.090> it<00:05:49.090> does<00:05:49.389> the<00:05:49.539> mowing

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
across the lawn and it does the mowing

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.210 
across the lawn and it does the mowing
that<00:05:49.960> way<00:05:50.110> and<00:05:50.200> it's<00:05:50.560> really<00:05:50.770> great<00:05:50.950> it<00:05:51.070> kind

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
that way and it's really great it kind

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.250 
that way and it's really great it kind
of<00:05:51.280> spins<00:05:51.490> around<00:05:51.610> it<00:05:52.120> the<00:05:52.539> battery<00:05:52.750> lasts

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 
of spins around it the battery lasts

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.800 
of spins around it the battery lasts
about<00:05:53.350> four<00:05:53.680> hours<00:05:54.039> it<00:05:54.760> takes<00:05:54.940> about<00:05:55.210> an<00:05:55.750> hour

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
about four hours it takes about an hour

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.650 
about four hours it takes about an hour
to<00:05:56.200> mow<00:05:56.560> each<00:05:56.800> portion<00:05:57.370> of<00:05:57.610> my<00:05:57.760> lawn<00:05:58.030> so<00:05:58.630> I

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
to mow each portion of my lawn so I

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:59.850 
to mow each portion of my lawn so I
haven't<00:05:58.930> do<00:05:58.990> the<00:05:59.110> left<00:05:59.289> side<00:05:59.470> of<00:05:59.590> the<00:05:59.650> front

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
haven't do the left side of the front

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:00.990 
haven't do the left side of the front
yard<00:06:00.070> the<00:06:00.310> right<00:06:00.460> side<00:06:00.700> of<00:06:00.760> the<00:06:00.820> front<00:06:00.910> yard

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
yard the right side of the front yard

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.670 
yard the right side of the front yard
one<00:06:01.570> thing<00:06:01.750> that<00:06:01.900> you<00:06:01.990> can<00:06:02.110> do<00:06:02.229> and<00:06:02.470> that's<00:06:02.530> why

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
one thing that you can do and that's why

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.620 
one thing that you can do and that's why
the<00:06:02.800> the<00:06:03.130> joysticks<00:06:03.610> incorporated<00:06:04.389> with<00:06:04.479> it

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
the the joysticks incorporated with it
