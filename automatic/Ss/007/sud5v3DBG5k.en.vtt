00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:16.520
 Everything will grow In an explosion of life 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.370
 Each little grain is another starting point 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.000
 The new lawn candles the day The rain touches the ground 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:35.590
 And greener then ... Stay! 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.690
 Bees by air Spider silk ripples 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.540
 And in the totally blue sky a glow accumulates 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:54.220
 Each little flower will have ... Petals more 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.690
 When the new station arrives! 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.540

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.330
 I can not believe we're going to stay there all summer.] 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.730
 [Terence: And we're waiting for what? I'll get there first, huh !?] 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:19.630
 The breeze blows without stopping The grass hugs your floor 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.630
 See the flowers, feel this heat ... 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.850
 So many birds in the sky 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:29.840
 [Fawn: Nice to see you] 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.720
 They spin like a carousel They sing loudly to say it's rayed ... 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.870
 [Silvermist: Hi, friends!] 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.400

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.610

 [Terence: It's there, Tink. Fairy camp!] 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.840
 When the spring leaves Another charm draws us 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.060
 A time of greater emotion began 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.360
 Summer is here! 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.610
 Summer is here! 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.460
 [Tink: Hi, Cheese!] 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.410

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.160
 [Tink: Did you have a good trip?] 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.010
 [Bobble &amp; Clank: Get off!] 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.210
 Mr. Griffiths: "But the greatest talent of a fairy is simply 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.710
 be a good friend. "] 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.510
 The breeze makes the sky open There are so many things to feel 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.560
 It does not seem that time has passed ... 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.210
 Summer is here! 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.410
 In this intense blue of the sky When it is clear and has no veil 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.140
 With you, happy in the sun, I'm ... 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.500
 Summer is here!
