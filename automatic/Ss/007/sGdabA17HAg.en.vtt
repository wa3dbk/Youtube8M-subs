00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.799
 good night tomorrow 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:14.160
 who smoke so much 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.719
 I'm 30 years old I'll show you today 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.490
 as a funny I hope that funny 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.420
 is not my not that ultra high 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:26.130
 tree but a little spider monster 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.289
 palais who fall a spider monster 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.599
 on my current single player world 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.820
 which I have for half a year or so 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:38.850
 for half a year have only once 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:44.520
 Eggs fish eggs look here once too 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:47.550
 which ones on me are alright so here 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.079
 a worst technology cola machines have 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.600
 Decide I do not know if that 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:56.100
 Let's see the tutorial of the bauboom 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.800
 track is similar on the go in the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.920
 deep into the deep 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.780
 no idea deep motherfucker 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.530
 Whitewater should actually be in front of me 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.610
 to prevent damage 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.049
 here again a bit further down 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.400
 what's going on here somehow fits 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.650
 not actually a fall hurt 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:20.100
 otherwise we are a bit deeper oh how beautiful 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.710
 does not look wonderful a cover 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.259
 Incidentally, I have only standard extract 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.670
 there you are so not confused 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.280
 page that you do not see the bohr the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.259
 Ugly also looks really ugly 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.470
 Battery here and that is a small one 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.060
 away to a little monster trap too 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.640
 pity this all is gone bond 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.270
 that's always a pity so look no matter what 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.770
 take a look 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.210
 we see such a small one here 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.119
 I do not know who of you 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.040
 I've already seen mine 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:51.439
 earlier video than with very much together 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.439
 i have shown 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.340
 that's exactly how it looks here 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.540
 like this, we have one 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.200
 athlete i hope you can do that now 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.610
 we have a spanner and there 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.420
 in the back of the camera we still have one 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.340
 corner 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:14.110
 up there right now times creative mode 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.890
 Game Mode Create Creative is not a good one 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.170
 number 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:26.130
 oh creative yes no good number of what 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:29.230
 me from game mode 1 we take a glass with us 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.690
 and that is what I have just 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:35.260
 but everything here from brick or how 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.790
 It's a brick exactly as you see 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.700
 that was all normal before 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.890
 normal stone and complete stone 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.540
 I have mostly normal 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.000
 dug everything here and a bit 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.010
 with creative well you can not stop 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.120
 Doing everything standard would be that too 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.569
 a little over the top I do 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.890
 not always yes as I said 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.300
 dug out here and here are only three 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.030
 heights, bonner is crazy about the situation 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.120
 close to each other I have someone before 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.560
 Never in bays as a 23 up here the 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.519
 Chamber was also a I have that 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.640
 easily solved 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.620
 the over water does not mean that together 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.900
 In between, there is always such a flow 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.890
 half blog set but there are none 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.820
 Spider on it can that we again 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.750
 plop into the water 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:19.930
 the spawn here expects the 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:23.590
 spanier from bahrain by default 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:27.940
 and then through the water down here and there 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.820
 fall below the hole all so 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.019
 here from 1 front just plain clear then 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.500
 case are all pure and 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:39.640
 I can push everything down 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.870
 Of course, another texture is not a lousy one 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.370
 that now all I do not believe that 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.109
 but current ones are still all 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.850
 Textures in it I need for the 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:50.320
 version now he needs the idea me 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:55.140
 sometimes the recording runs thank you 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:58.120
 my face the two-wheeler and something 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.010
 just like that with me through the 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.379
 mobs 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:06.209
 Everything is nicely colorful that 's a com 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:09.959
 that looks like it looks natural to me 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:13.799
 something pretty like I think is so bright 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:16.650
 always here this graphic error so a 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.940
 a little bit so I am now 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:23.100
 I hope that title me now 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:25.110
 not gamer 0 was good last time 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.490
 I'm only halfway to blog 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.380
 over the air did that and then 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.590
 I've been killed because that's too much 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.479
 was supposedly too high so do not worry 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.740
 hurt as I said the flop 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:37.350
 the below purely I can brake up here 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.690
 stay comfortably and wait and 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.889
 then I go down here once for 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.810
 book run down once 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.150
 find me very loud people stripping 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.280
 As for that there is not too long, I the 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.090
 so the spiders take a bit 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:54.389
 according to eu you come here because 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:58.860
 the sweatshops turned out that we here 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:07.500
 the flap on marco russ 103 flap up 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:08.699
 and then it's not a nice 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.910
 Hard to take iron for that would be 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:14.270
 exaggerated 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.270
 the rib 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.070
 Normally I can be quite comfortable 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.480
 stop and just follow me 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.840
 the other broken it is actually 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.890
 pretty nice, especially the mouse a bit 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.200
 behind my back so that you can 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:31.200
 Maybe not quite like that 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.920
 micro here so i can now too 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.440
 move mouse 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.420
 I was level 224 before, then I am 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.750
 all top level 5 died back 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.470
 receives 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:42.600
 Such silence a fucking play yes 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.030
 In any case, this is my little spider 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.510
 have quasi or 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:50.840
 all or so I do not know my end 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:53.640
 for heights I spinn quite pleasant 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.840
 as you can see that everything is complete 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:06:02.630
 pleasantly kill partially 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:04.920
 mostly you know what I mean 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.090
 yes I noticed that I say 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.180
 quite often with that you know what I mean 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:12.450
 my 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:15.300
 certain circle modest I tell myself 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.680
 It's good that it was good 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.410
 already as I said is still very small 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.550
 thing down here in a single table 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:27.060
 maybe a few more excerpts 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:29.690
 show cutouts well then first 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.690
 okay
