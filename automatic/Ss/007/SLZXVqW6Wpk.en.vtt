00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:10.940
 n 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:14.240
 it's very nice that they are marisol welcome 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:17.810
 Today I'm going to teach you how to select 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.539
 chop to peel and cook a yucca 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.430
 criolla the vulgar way now as 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.320
 they selected sugar has to be 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.269
 firm everywhere cassava is a 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.310
 tuber like the potato and it should not be 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.740
 loose by nowhere you have to give 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.500
 hard because yucca is very hard ok 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.090
 The main thing we want to do is 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.040
 stabilize it and then it 's as if 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.540
 they were cutting wood with the 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.420
 knife like that to be sure that no 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.480
 they are going to cut you give it down with 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.150
 what we want is that 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.250
 completely peeled and is already peeled 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.140
 then if there are some pieces left 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.490
 we are going to remove them with a 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.860
 smaller knife like that 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:01.079
 to distribute the heat when the 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:04.439
 we cook we are going to chop it in half 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.400
 here we have boiled water they put it with 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.650
 careful not to splash ok 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.690
 while the yucca is boiling I'm going 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.530
 to teach how to make a mojo quickie and 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.530
 facilitated 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.060
 but let it be my granny like that and 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.190
 look how beautiful the color is green as 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.690
 emerald and how they know they are there is the 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:36.710
 yuca will spend one knife here 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:39.170
 and it has to happen like that 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.610
 and look what I have here if this 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.440
 they want to try it because it's 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.810
 warm and delicious look what they are 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.420
 to do and I promise you not to 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.280
 I tell nobody 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.320
 he puts butter on it you can have it 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.320
 children also very nutritious 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.400
 but now I'm going to teach you how to cut it 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.620
 in a gourmet way and we can 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.620
 serve in a different way 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:15.849
 and now our gourmet yukita looks at what 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.849
 what are we going to do, let's skip the 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.060
 It makes golden brown they have to 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.090
 look at her with love because the butter 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.980
 it burns easily and this makes it left 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.810
 as if they were more or less fries 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.110
 but obviously without so much oil 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.690
 only one teaspoon really here 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.870
 already distributed by all aesthetics and 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.560
 this the color that we want 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.560
 this 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.850
 and now we're going to put a little bit of 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:51.760
 Salt 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:54.430
 and this is not going to me that it does not look like a plate 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.200
 gourmet of a spectacular thing is 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:01.420
 simply delicious economic yucca 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.660
 facilitates nutritious 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.380
 has too many additives in the yucca 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.380
 chopsticks here 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.230
 until the eighth
