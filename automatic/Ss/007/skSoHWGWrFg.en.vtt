00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:07.710
 hello to another video of me 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.500
 today we do what you donut 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:16.010
 we need to do that 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:20.550
 We need three eggs of 100 grams of sugar 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:24.300
 375 grams of your baking powder a pack 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.490
 and a pack of vanilla sugar and 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.670
 powdered sugar to sprinkle 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:35.610
 to ride here in the kva force 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:40.920
 Now we want to fill all the ingredients 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:47.930
 in a bowl always the flour 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:52.920
 sugar vanilla sugar the baking powder and 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:55.380
 now comes the park island of 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.140
 Quark and the eggs are now in there too 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.140
 and now it is being stirred like a dough 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:11.710
 the dough is now ready and pick it up 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:14.200
 We get a pot and fill up there oil 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:22.360
 into it we the force to 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:25.020
 be able to avoid and 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.020
 complete bottle 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.080
 now turned on the stove 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:36.280
 and if it can throw small bubbles 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:39.850
 We'll start practicing it right away 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.790
 with spoons in doubt and shape 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.310
 practically as a small front and now 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.510
 do it how oil pure 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:52.240
 I hope it works and then we can 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:57.010
 Also see if the oil is already hot 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.950
 what's that starts slowly and 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:05.530
 Now we wait a while and give 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:09.820
 even more about it from time to time you hear the 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.740
 donate and of course, too 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.870
 important now takes smaller or 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.240
 larger ones stay longer or shorter 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.590
 They then in so they wanted 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.930
 become friendly 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.930
 but I'll show you right away 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:34.730
 so I think that looks pretty good 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:37.100
 and I have prepared something now 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.830
 I would like to have a kitchen roll here 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:43.280
 upped the ante so that afterwards the whole oil 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.510
 can drain and now we want the 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.510
 first ahead 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:05.720
 and now comes the second miracle and the 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.900
 the rest of the time comes a round one 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:16.550
 well as really now also I 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:17.650
 I have about twelve pieces from the dough 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.280
 come 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:26.060
 so the medium has something again 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:32.480
 drain and then sprinkle with 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:33.980
 powder sugar now again to practice on 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.459
 of course they taste the best when they are 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.110
 But you are warm the next day 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.150
 you could just do it in the microwave 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:45.530
 and then they are very, very, very 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:50.060
 Yum so delicious in our minds 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:53.120
 do the same times on so they see a 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.790
 then from the inside they are nicely juicy 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.620
 and they are really tasty 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.140
 then I wish you a lot of fun 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:04.810
 imitate and I'm looking forward to it 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.810
 for the next time bye you love
