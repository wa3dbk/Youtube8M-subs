00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.470
 alghero appear somewhere in the 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.440
 screen my old lines card 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.520
 which was a meter and we already say that it is 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.460
 a monitor 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.160
 almost almost occupied too much e 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.930
 but now it is not but wider screening 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.440
 one meter and forty and I managed to 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.469
 mount 4 screens and nothing then 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.020
 let's say don't stay too long 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.000
 just enjoy this let's say 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.579
 I will try to make it quite see 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.990
 the video so from us to anyone where 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:10.249
 I mount the desk with the various monitors e 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.249
 we ask everyone to like me 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.459
 here you can already see my new one 

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:16.200
 desk that we mounted from my own 

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:18.179
 father simply using his legs 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.329
 of the old and applying myself over the 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:22.529
 new channel 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:25.319
 after the video I made 

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:28.469
 previously boxes in the three piers of the 

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:29.759
 single monitor 40 were three I had them 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:32.789
 already mounted on the desk for 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.380
 check the operation so I am 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.810
 I simply have to entrust all the cables 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.130
 and to move 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.920
 you can view for the first time 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.650
 studiocanal and my father who are a 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.920
 make holes to apply the bracket 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.720
 them for the fourth monitor and here I am 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.640
 meanwhile I go to the cellar to be able 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.120
 take the putty and then close the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:58.650
 holes a is to apply the plug e 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:01.650
 applied to the wall bracket once 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.150
 finished the holes 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.550
 my father thinks of closing the holes 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.650
 that you are on the wall of the old vehicle 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:11.459
 the arc videotherapy to be able to put the 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:18.200
 fourth monitor and I'm going to apply the 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:18.200
 support bracket for the world 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.560
 here is just putting the screws to fix 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.780
 work and then control but 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.019
 second father who is all in bubble in 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.629
 so that the support is not crooked e 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:49.310
 then later the monitor could 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.310
 be mounted incorrectly 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.659
 and in fact the very comfortable thing was 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.549
 that the auction was already integrated 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:03:01.370
 bubble so I didn't have to use any 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:01.370
 another tool to make me aware of it 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.940
 I take this opportunity also to say that if if 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.129
 you want to put lin anyway it seems 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.790
 ask for the link in the comments 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:15.510
 bracket for monitor for support 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.700
 of the monitor because they are really comfortable 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.750
 and we say the price is around 30 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.939
 euro more than excellent as a price but I have 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.769
 already mounted the warning on the bracket 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:29.549
 control is well embedded and 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:32.819
 the opposition in the position that you 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:35.310
 like replied the webcam from the count 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:40.230
 Central to the one side and there them 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:42.150
 I put his desk in place one 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.129
 once the desk is inserted 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.310
 I have to go and position naturally 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:49.919
 monitor so that the top one 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.859
 ie four monitors are centered with 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:54.659
 the one below 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:57.209
 then of course I'm going to enter everyone 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:04:00.569
 calm to be able to connect to the PC all the 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.699
 monitor and or use all four 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:09.269
 output ports of my video card 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:11.269
 age the gtx 60p sigle port that the two tv 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:16.109
 aiel hdmi 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:17.750
 sincerely the computer through a 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.100
 video card quietly succeeds 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.660
 24 monitors and also I tried in game 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.210
 but I don't have any problems 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.060
 of course I can't play with everything 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.790
 the past at most will probably do 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.650
 a video in which I will show you here 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.320
 time of first ignition of 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:40.340
 four monitors and of course when yes 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:43.130
 turn on your pc only appears on the monitor 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.840

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.250
 saint donated 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.500
