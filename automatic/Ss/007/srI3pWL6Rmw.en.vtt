00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.390
 for 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.300
 I believe that a thousand people tonight they 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.360
 have seen a match 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.360
 lobby 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.460
 today remains a place of spectacle 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.630
 people have to keep coming and 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.009
 encourage us after what is a pity 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.940
 for us it's income with a 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.170
 also good team 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.310
 I will say what is unfortunate for us 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.210
 is that nancy next week 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:35.380
 plays Marseille game had his coach of 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.520
 keeping in the tribune and so 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:39.460
 the difference with players like 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.620
 even simone mollo have been 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.310
 unrecognizable today so and they 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.240
 have my young too here I am disappointed 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.470
 because we had a quarter of an hour 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.940
 difficult at the end of the first half and 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.800
 20 minutes very difficult at the beginning of 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.790
 second after I am very proud of my 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.720
 players because they are capable 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:58.000
 to reverse the trend on occasions I 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.620
 am still disappointed because david had 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.910
 so much need to salute the gesture that 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.700
 surface ticket that would have done 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.680
 probably been the goal of the year a 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.130
 Rigaud Regnier made a stop of 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.240
 the year so in view of the last quarter 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.440
 Time after residents and twenty 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.640
 first minutes of the second 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.280
 half-time the draw is a good 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.680
 result 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.940
 now seen from the fact that we are led to 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.369
 score and we miss 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.810
 finally some dragonmen a Gregorini we 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.880
 prevents from scoring this third goal I 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.820
 I'm disappointed we came across a very 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.730
 nice team of nancy and who made us 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.290
 a lot run tonight 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.630
 I can speak with David before we 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.440
 do miles for nothing but good 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.750
 So here it is true that led 1 0 on 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.070
 a bullet loss from me that was 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.480
 a little silly 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.550
 good it still remains 60 meters 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.440
 behind for it to mark then behind 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.620
 we score two goals in quick succession it's 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.140
 true that we get back in and then 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.660
 and then behind this goal 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.920
 it's really a shame because I 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.280
 think we had a lot of envy 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.270
 evening and then drop 2 is not I 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.490
 believe it's fair on the 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.710
 sahara are things yeah that's fine 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.430
 pretty well down I'm recruited 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.840
 for that so 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.300
 So here it is even tonight I was 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.190
 in a role more than number 10 that 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.450
 usually but it's a role I have 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.270
 saw a way besanÃ§on so that it me 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.840
 do not mind his room sdf in front of who is 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.090
 quiet and 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.190
 it's really his post so that's so 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.019
 it feels liberated now it's true 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.519
 that these two goals pretty good but 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.340
 I would have preferred the limit can be 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.000
 marked unless so win the game 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.069
 so that's okay we're going 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.230
 continue to work this week and then 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.940
 we still have not lost we did 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.010
 still four draws do not make 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.360
 advance in this championship so it takes 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.360
 go catch the match points
