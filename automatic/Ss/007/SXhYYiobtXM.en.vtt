00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.870

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.769
 Some good or false beliefs 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.110

 fanaticism that pushes you into the abyss of no 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.920
 believe in oneself as racism 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:55.129
 deep-rooted belief despite the years 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.860
 it still creates damage ideas like criticizing the 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.890
 nice or ugly popular look or text 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.890
 still analyze for a moment everything 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.110
 what they tell you is true as do not leave 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.360

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.740
 if you do not look for it, it reflects in them that 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:24.740
 this that so many beliefs that 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.750
 they remain as a seal wherever 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.630
 my great belief is the rap that is 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.340

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:44.510

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.720
 I sense that you follow your goals 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.239

 damn but it goes to heaven come mourning so 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.030
 to be alive when belief is a 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.010
 sign of cowards and maybe not forge their 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.200
 destiny believing only in divine or 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.239
 approaching I guess that if the one you get 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.670
