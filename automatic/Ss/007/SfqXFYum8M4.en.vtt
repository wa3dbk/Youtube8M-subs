00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.010
 so I show you how to cut to 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.799
 spikes very simply for that you 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.400
 will need to govern lastic of a 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.710
 pair of scissors and a comb so 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.310
 you will start with three enters at 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:27.960
 middle as you continue so up 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.929
 the back of your head for good 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.520
 separating the two-part hair thus 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.579
 you big it's good you have to layer it 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.989
 evening very smooth so if that's not the case 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.000
 you high schools if you have hair 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:45.420
 curly mail and high schools we detangled 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:54.199
 much more than they stay 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:54.199
 no do you take your elastic 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:04.629
 so you keep your head straight 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:06.610
 you do not approach it backwards you 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.400
 beings snapped up your hair in your hand 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.250
 like that so always by painting for 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.720
 whether it's for it to be the bread 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.670
 cooked no mistake that is no hair 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.780
 who come not that they are not well 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.520
 so let you hang the rubber band 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.650
 so not under the chin otherwise it's okay 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.950
 to make a rental you hang 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.420
 the elastic pretty much here was pulling you 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.259
 well on your current hair that remains 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.259
 of course 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:39.720
 here we are with these and 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.990
 you will slowly go down 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.290
 elastic 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.100
 I look well in my mirror that 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.810
 elastic drawings slowly 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.360
 so after a while redone a 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.280
 turn because as like there is less 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.960
 of masdar the spikes for easter 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.880
 the elastic without being redone a ride 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.700
 of elastics if I get there 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.460
 he is so tight am the man I 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:11.040
 prefers to be on va so I draw I 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.040
 I take it gently 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.080
 so there the hair that leaves on the 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.430
 side is my father so it was 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.930
 it's okay I did not touch because 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.760
 that I want to cut it's only but 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.990
 point 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.700
 so here you go down the elastic 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.040
 until time not just to where 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.980
 you cut his hair and then you 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.020
 take your scissors you 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.670
 can quite cut like that to 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.840
 from the moment the elastic does not 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.390
 do not move do you pull well your 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.760
 hair so voice that's what I do 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.700
 I will not cut much because 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:49.390
 I have not cut long ago so I 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:54.750
 take my scissors and I cut 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.750
 well m I remove my elastic 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.430
 here and so you see there you cut 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.860
 your spikes so this cut 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.530
 cutting here is your hair by 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.470
 in front of you gives a result in fact 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.760
 behind slightly rounded in sled so 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.510
 I do not know if you will see I'm going 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.510
 show you 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.870
 I do not know if you see 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.610
 so that's a very technical 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.340
 simple that not everyone's reach 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.720
 if you prefer to do it finally do it 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.730
 to help someone could very well 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.650
 ask someone helps you 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.360
 pinch the elastic and straight up if I 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.380
 sense of course but honestly we 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.660
 could do it alone 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.190
 there is no problem it's super simple 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.180
 go girls I'll see you soon for 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.180
 a new chat tutorial 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.819
 I
