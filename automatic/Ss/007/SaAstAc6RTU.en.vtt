back<00:02:09.690> to

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
back to

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.510 
back to
their<00:02:11.940> old<00:02:12.270> ways<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:13.280> self-shading

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
their old ways of self-shading

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.090 
their old ways of self-shading
which<00:02:14.940> really<00:02:15.660> really<00:02:16.140> triggered<00:02:16.800> me<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:16.920> buy

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
which really really triggered me to buy

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.560 
which really really triggered me to buy
this<00:02:17.160> because<00:02:17.520> I<00:02:17.700> really<00:02:17.970> like<00:02:18.120> Disney's
