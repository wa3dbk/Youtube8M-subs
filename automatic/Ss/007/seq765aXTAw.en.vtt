00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:10.380
We are at the border of France and Switzerland to test the Michelin’s new tire called the Cross Climate.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.140
This is really a revolutionary tire.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:20.240
It comes to the market with the allegation that it offers summer tire performance in the summer and winter tire performance in the winter.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.520
Let’s see if this tire in actuality, as far as our test and observation here,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.160
will satisfy the expectations explicitly and how is its usability as all-season tire.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.520
Let's start analysing all together...

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.420
In the first part of the event the executives of the Michelin disclosed to us that this tire was really 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.660
developed in the sense of the expectations of the car users in Europe.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.980
They have encountered by statistics that 65 percent of the car users in Europe were not making use of winter tires.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:30.060
As a result of customer’s requirements and feed backs the Michelin has developed the new tire called the Cross Climate

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.880
 for 3-years with a very big investment and at the moment have started producing them ready to submit to the market.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.640
The tire called Cross Climate developed by the Michelin is genuinely having features to be the first in revolution.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.120
Because up to now the all-seasons tires were trying to offer performance in summer as well as in winter

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.220
but never achieving to reach the values they claim.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.380
The Michelin says that the Cross Climate with specialty of the materials in its compound

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.160
and by its tread design will satisfy explicitly the summer expectations of

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.620
acceleration, performance, braking and road handling

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:22.000
and in addition to this in the winter usage especially on the snowy surfaces will reach very good values at traction and braking.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:30.740
As part of road test I have been driving the Peugeot 308 with the Michelin Cross Climate tires for 30 km.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:39.420
At the 30 km route I had a chance to test these tires on low-level roads of France and on Swiss Alps.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.220
The temperatures were 5-6 degrees and dry on low grounds.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.560
The tires did not execute any problem on road handling and traction.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.980
But the real worry was what we will encounter when we reach the heights.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:59.600
On the Swiss Alps the temperature was zero degrees and the surfaces were wet and on some parts snowy.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.960
I was wondering what kind of performance these tires were going to perform when the roads were covered with snow.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:14.380
And honestly they succeeded to transfer the power of the engine to the road and advanced without any difficulty.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:41.020
Now comes the time that we were anxious about, we will test all-season tires and the Cross Climate at 3 different places and compare their performances.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:50.000
First station is braking on dry surface. I am starting with a rival brand’s all-season tires.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:59.320
I will reach to the stopping point at a speed of 55 km/s and brake and observe the distance traveled.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.400
At the moment I have reached 55 km/s 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.300
and I braked.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.360
Here, on the left side we can see at what distance the all-season tires will stop anyway.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.980
Second station is about road handling on wet surface.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:24.420
Here on the prepared track we will find out how fast we can turn around a roundabout with fixed steering position.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:32.420
Here we will observe how good the tires discharge the water and how good they hold on to the surface.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.620
I am turning at 31 km/s at the moment with all-seasons tires.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.920
I am turning at 33 km/s and at this moment I have moved out of the line.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:57.540
In other words these tires couldn’t carry the load at 33-34 km/s and the car under steered.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:06.480
Third and last station is covered with snow and its aim is to find out the tires grip capacity on 9-degree gradient.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.820
At the moment I am in the first gear and trying to move.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.340
As you can see

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.520
we are climbing but with a lot of wheel spinning.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.860
In conclusion, the all-seasons tires of course perform on winter conditions

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.700
but what is important is to see whether the Cross Climate is better than these or not.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.080
Let’s see what the Cross Climate will be able to do at the same courses?

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:42.580
We will perform the 3 tests exactly as before with the VW Golf but this time the tires are Michelin Cross Climate.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.660
Just as before I am driving at 55 km/s on the dry surface before I have to stop.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.960
At the moment we move at a speed of 54 km/s 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.380
54 km/s

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.800
and braked just as before.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:05.920
We have stopped at 1.5-meter better distance as far as I can see from here.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.580
Second station is the wet surface for road handling.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.040
Let’s see how the Cross Climate will perform here?

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.480
We are going to the specially prepared roundabout on wet surface.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:23.400
I have started to turn with a speed of 30 km/s.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.820
At the moment I am turning at 33 km/s,

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:28.960
I am turning at 34 km/s,

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.520
35 km/s and still there is a good grip.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:39.020
37 km/s and the car started to move out of the line.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:48.120
Here there are about 3 km/s speed differences between the rival all-season tires and the Michelin Cross Climate.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.320
We have come to our last test.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:07:00.540
This is the place everyone is anxious about to find out if Michelin Cross Climate will be able to move on 9-degree gradient on snowy winter conditions or not.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:05.320
Let’s see if they will really perform better than the all-season tires?

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.320
I am in first gear and starting, 

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.740
there were still some small wheel spinning but truly the Cross Climate

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:24.340
even though not as good as winter tires, offered better grip than the all-season tires and over jumped this obstacle.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.740
If you do not encounter very hard winter conditions at where you live,

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.640
in short if to buy winter tires is an inconvenience to you

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:38.360
then I can say that as far as I have experienced these tires they will satisfy your expectations explicitly.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.460
See you...
