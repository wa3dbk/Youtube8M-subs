long<00:01:00.949> I<00:01:01.190> have<00:01:01.429> not<00:01:01.670> cut<00:01:01.969> it<00:01:02.120> even<00:01:03.109> though<00:01:03.229> I<00:01:03.260> was

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
long I have not cut it even though I was

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.259 
long I have not cut it even though I was
thinking<00:01:03.769> about<00:01:03.890> cutting<00:01:04.460> it<00:01:04.580> because<00:01:04.940> it's

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
thinking about cutting it because it's

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.490 
thinking about cutting it because it's
starting<00:01:05.570> to<00:01:05.690> fray<00:01:05.900> at<00:01:06.050> the<00:01:06.140> ends<00:01:06.409> a<00:01:06.470> little

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
starting to fray at the ends a little

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.180 
starting to fray at the ends a little
bit<00:01:06.850> but<00:01:07.850> actually<00:01:08.330> I<00:01:08.360> like<00:01:08.450> that<00:01:08.690> because<00:01:09.190> it

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
bit but actually I like that because it

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.289 
bit but actually I like that because it
mimics<00:01:11.860> hair<00:01:12.860> that's<00:01:13.130> been<00:01:13.299> chemically

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
mimics hair that's been chemically

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.139 
mimics hair that's been chemically
treated<00:01:14.869> for<00:01:15.140> like<00:01:15.740> a<00:01:15.770> Yacky<00:01:16.340> textured<00:01:16.909> hair

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
treated for like a Yacky textured hair

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.149 
treated for like a Yacky textured hair
so<00:01:17.750> let<00:01:18.079> me<00:01:18.170> get<00:01:18.320> a<00:01:18.350> little<00:01:18.439> closer<00:01:18.740> so<00:01:19.009> you<00:01:19.070> can

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
so let me get a little closer so you can

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:26.679 
so let me get a little closer so you can
see<00:01:19.280> that<00:01:24.100> it's<00:01:25.100> not<00:01:25.340> shiny<00:01:25.820> and<00:01:26.180> dull<00:01:26.390> hair

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
like it's it's more natural looking hair
