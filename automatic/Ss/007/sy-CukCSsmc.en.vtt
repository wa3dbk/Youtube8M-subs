and a fridge inside of each other it

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:42.259 
and a fridge inside of each other it
just<00:00:41.010> means<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.370> they're<00:00:41.579> connected<00:00:42.089> I

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.269 
just means that they're connected I

just means that they're connected I
don't<00:00:42.749> know<00:00:42.839> why<00:00:43.050> some<00:00:43.530> schools<00:00:43.859> just<00:00:44.129> like<00:00:44.309> to

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
don't know why some schools just like to

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.360 
don't know why some schools just like to
do<00:00:44.609> that<00:00:45.289> so<00:00:46.289> if<00:00:46.530> that's<00:00:46.649> how<00:00:46.829> your<00:00:46.980> school<00:00:47.219> is

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
do that so if that's how your school is

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.880 
do that so if that's how your school is
I<00:00:47.609> would<00:00:47.789> rent<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.239> through<00:00:48.510> them<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.710> would

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
I would rent it through them and I would

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.169 
I would rent it through them and I would
discuss<00:00:50.280> with<00:00:50.489> your<00:00:50.579> roommate<00:00:50.969> may<00:00:51.120> be

00:00:51.169 --> 00:00:51.179 
discuss with your roommate may be

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:52.790 
discuss with your roommate may be
splitting<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.809> cost<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.319> one<00:00:52.469> because<00:00:52.679> it's

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
splitting the cost of one because it's

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.169 
splitting the cost of one because it's
if<00:00:53.010> it's<00:00:53.159> just<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.460> two<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:53.969> don't

00:00:54.169 --> 00:00:54.179 
if it's just the two of you I don't

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:55.459 
if it's just the two of you I don't
think<00:00:54.420> there's<00:00:54.569> any<00:00:54.749> need<00:00:54.839> to<00:00:54.989> have<00:00:55.199> two

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
think there's any need to have two

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.680 
think there's any need to have two
microwaves<00:00:56.010> maybe<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.909> need<00:00:57.179> two<00:00:57.420> fridges

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
microwaves maybe you need two fridges

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.540 
microwaves maybe you need two fridges
but<00:00:58.109> honestly<00:00:58.559> they<00:00:59.069> come<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.429> about

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
but honestly they come to about

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.029 
but honestly they come to about
countertop<00:01:00.300> high<00:01:00.569> the<00:01:00.629> fridge<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.589> think

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
countertop high the fridge and I think

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.469 
countertop high the fridge and I think
it<00:01:02.129> fits<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.399> decent<00:01:02.760> amount<00:01:02.819> of<00:01:02.999> stuff<00:01:03.179> all<00:01:03.420> the

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
it fits a decent amount of stuff all the

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:05.060 
it fits a decent amount of stuff all the
time<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.929> I've<00:01:04.110> ever<00:01:04.140> had<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> fridge<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:04.890> my

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
time that I've ever had a fridge in my

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.830 
time that I've ever had a fridge in my
room<00:01:05.309> with<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.580> roommate<00:01:06.000> we've<00:01:06.270> always<00:01:06.540> shared

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
room with a roommate we've always shared

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.690 
room with a roommate we've always shared
it<00:01:07.079> there<00:01:07.200> was<00:01:07.259> no<00:01:07.439> need<00:01:07.469> for<00:01:07.740> two<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.280> them<00:01:08.430> I

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
it there was no need for two of them I

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.069 
it there was no need for two of them I
guess<00:01:09.149> it's<00:01:09.299> because<00:01:09.360> we<00:01:09.570> didn't<00:01:09.810> really<00:01:09.899> have

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:10.079 
guess it's because we didn't really have

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:11.870 
guess it's because we didn't really have
a<00:01:10.110> lot<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.350> stuff<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.920> mean<00:01:11.340> your<00:01:11.520> fridge<00:01:11.729> is

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
a lot of stuff I mean your fridge is

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.429 
a lot of stuff I mean your fridge is
just<00:01:12.060> going<00:01:12.149> to<00:01:12.240> hold<00:01:12.420> basic<00:01:12.930> important

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
just going to hold basic important

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.690 
just going to hold basic important
things<00:01:13.649> I<00:01:13.799> mean<00:01:13.920> it's<00:01:14.040> obviously<00:01:14.399> not<00:01:14.460> going

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
things I mean it's obviously not going

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.300 
things I mean it's obviously not going
to<00:01:14.790> be<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> full-size<00:01:15.450> fridge<00:01:15.810> but<00:01:16.200> whether<00:01:17.159> you

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.950 
to be a full-size fridge but whether you

water<00:04:41.620> it's<00:04:42.100> going<00:04:42.220> to<00:04:42.280> filter<00:04:42.520> it<00:04:42.760> and<00:04:42.790> it<00:04:43.030> was

water it's going to filter it and it was
only<00:04:43.210> 1099<00:04:44.020> so<00:04:44.260> that's<00:04:44.380> a<00:04:44.470> really<00:04:44.860> good<00:04:45.010> deal

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
only 1099 so that's a really good deal

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.390 
only 1099 so that's a really good deal
and<00:04:46.030> once<00:04:46.210> again<00:04:46.360> it's<00:04:47.200> compact<00:04:47.680> small<00:04:48.040> it's

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
and once again it's compact small it's

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.700 
and once again it's compact small it's
not<00:04:48.520> going<00:04:48.610> to<00:04:48.700> take<00:04:48.820> up<00:04:48.910> my<00:04:49.000> entire<00:04:49.330> fridge<00:04:49.960> so

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
not going to take up my entire fridge so

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:51.930 
not going to take up my entire fridge so
the<00:04:50.800> Brita<00:04:51.010> is<00:04:51.130> really<00:04:51.340> good<00:04:51.490> for<00:04:51.669> in<00:04:51.850> your

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
the Brita is really good for in your

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.220 
the Brita is really good for in your
dorm<00:04:52.210> room<00:04:52.330> but<00:04:52.570> if<00:04:52.660> you're<00:04:52.780> going<00:04:52.870> to<00:04:52.930> be<00:04:53.050> on

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
dorm room but if you're going to be on

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.930 
dorm room but if you're going to be on
the<00:04:53.470> go<00:04:53.620> and<00:04:53.889> going<00:04:54.220> to<00:04:54.310> class<00:04:54.520> I<00:04:54.760> think

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
the go and going to class I think

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.370 
the go and going to class I think
getting<00:04:55.120> a<00:04:55.300> water<00:04:55.510> bottle<00:04:55.720> like<00:04:55.960> this<00:04:55.990> is

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
getting a water bottle like this is

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.050 
getting a water bottle like this is
definitely<00:04:56.950> a<00:04:57.010> good<00:04:57.160> idea<00:04:57.190> now<00:04:57.730> you<00:04:57.820> might<00:04:57.940> be

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
definitely a good idea now you might be

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.520 
definitely a good idea now you might be
wondering<00:04:58.090> what<00:04:58.630> makes<00:04:58.840> this<00:04:58.990> water<00:04:59.260> bottle

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
wondering what makes this water bottle

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.980 
wondering what makes this water bottle
so<00:04:59.710> special<00:05:00.190> but<00:05:00.639> it's<00:05:00.760> actually<00:05:01.120> a<00:05:01.150> bobble<00:05:01.840> I

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
so special but it's actually a bobble I

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.180 
so special but it's actually a bobble I
think<00:05:02.200> that's<00:05:02.320> how<00:05:02.410> you<00:05:02.440> pronounce<00:05:02.560> it<00:05:03.010> and

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
think that's how you pronounce it and

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.950 
think that's how you pronounce it and
what<00:05:03.280> it<00:05:03.370> does<00:05:03.550> is<00:05:03.820> it<00:05:03.850> filters<00:05:04.360> the<00:05:04.389> water<00:05:04.570> as

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
what it does is it filters the water as

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.050 
what it does is it filters the water as
you<00:05:05.020> drink<00:05:05.620> it<00:05:05.770> so<00:05:06.310> this<00:05:06.490> little<00:05:06.639> pink<00:05:06.880> thing

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
you drink it so this little pink thing

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.890 
you drink it so this little pink thing
right<00:05:07.240> here<00:05:08.580> this<00:05:09.580> is<00:05:09.880> the<00:05:09.970> filter<00:05:10.479> and<00:05:10.690> most

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
right here this is the filter and most

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.420 
right here this is the filter and most
filters<00:05:11.350> I<00:05:11.500> mean<00:05:11.650> like<00:05:11.740> the<00:05:11.800> Brita<00:05:12.100> one<00:05:12.280> you

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
filters I mean like the Brita one you

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.980 
filters I mean like the Brita one you
pour<00:05:12.790> the<00:05:12.910> water<00:05:13.030> through<00:05:13.330> it<00:05:13.389> and<00:05:13.600> then<00:05:13.870> it

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
pour the water through it and then it

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.330 
pour the water through it and then it
filters<00:05:14.350> it<00:05:14.530> but<00:05:14.950> this<00:05:15.040> one's<00:05:15.280> different

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
filters it but this one's different

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.920 
filters it but this one's different
because<00:05:15.790> as<00:05:15.970> you<00:05:16.210> drink<00:05:16.510> it<00:05:16.630> it's<00:05:16.750> going<00:05:16.870> to

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
because as you drink it it's going to

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.110 
because as you drink it it's going to
filter<00:05:17.139> it<00:05:17.380> so<00:05:17.590> you<00:05:17.650> can<00:05:17.919> get<00:05:18.580> your<00:05:18.639> water<00:05:18.880> from

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
filter it so you can get your water from

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.580 
filter it so you can get your water from
basically<00:05:19.479> anywhere<00:05:19.960> and<00:05:20.110> it'll<00:05:20.229> be<00:05:20.320> nice<00:05:20.530> and

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
basically anywhere and it'll be nice and
