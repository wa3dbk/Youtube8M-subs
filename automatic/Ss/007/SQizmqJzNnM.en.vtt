00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
hair is a little bit

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.250 
hair is a little bit
it's<00:02:09.590> normally<00:02:09.979> more<00:02:10.220> easier<00:02:10.700> so<00:02:11.690> I<00:02:11.720> think<00:02:12.170> it

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
it's normally more easier so I think it

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.220 
it's normally more easier so I think it
has<00:02:12.410> something<00:02:12.590> to<00:02:12.709> do<00:02:12.950> with<00:02:13.129> that<00:02:14.230> that

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230
