the<00:02:40.870> cross-court<00:02:41.410> finish<00:02:41.739> I<00:02:43.140> get<00:02:44.140> over<00:02:44.349> there

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
the cross-court finish I get over there

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.809 
the cross-court finish I get over there
and<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:44.650> actually<00:02:44.800> have<00:02:45.010> options<00:02:45.459> I<00:02:45.520> can<00:02:45.640> go

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
and I actually have options I can go

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.479 
and I actually have options I can go
back<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.239> backhand<00:02:46.750> down<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.530> line<00:02:47.709> or<00:02:48.430> I

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
back to the backhand down the line or I

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:49.949 
back to the backhand down the line or I
can<00:02:48.670> go<00:02:48.760> cross<00:02:49.000> court<00:02:49.360> he's<00:02:49.780> actually

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
can go cross court he's actually

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.660 
can go cross court he's actually
opposition<00:02:50.620> when<00:02:50.830> I<00:02:50.890> make<00:02:51.040> kind<00:02:51.190> of<00:02:51.280> this<00:02:51.430> ball

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
opposition when I make kind of this ball

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.729 
opposition when I make kind of this ball
okay<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:52.720> and<00:02:52.900> then<00:02:53.110> I<00:02:53.230> think<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.530> courts

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
okay and and then I think the courts

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.530 
okay and and then I think the courts
really<00:02:54.069> opened<00:02:54.459> the<00:02:54.550> forehand<00:02:54.850> cross<00:02:55.180> I<00:02:55.420> go

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
really opened the forehand cross I go

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.720 
really opened the forehand cross I go
for<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.750> forehand<00:02:56.020> cross<00:02:56.500> because<00:02:57.340> I<00:02:57.489> think<00:02:57.550> I

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
for the forehand cross because I think I

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.820 
for the forehand cross because I think I
can<00:02:57.790> finish<00:02:58.200> when<00:02:59.200> you're<00:02:59.350> playing<00:02:59.650> your
