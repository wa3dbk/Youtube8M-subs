00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
when you're taking this first point and

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.710 
when you're taking this first point and
here<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.610> just<00:01:05.939> filled<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.240> little<00:01:06.450> with<00:01:06.570> him

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.179 
here I just filled it little with him
which<00:01:06.840> means<00:01:07.080> I'm<00:01:07.229> damaging<00:01:07.680> myself<00:01:07.830> with

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
which means I'm damaging myself with

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.000 
which means I'm damaging myself with
rockets<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:08.700> order<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.080> maximize<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.439> charge

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
rockets in order to maximize the charge

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.730 
rockets in order to maximize the charge
rate<00:01:11.450> and<00:01:12.450> because<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.200> was<00:01:13.350> doing<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.680> I

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
rate and because I was doing that I

so thank you both enough for finally

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.620 
so thank you both enough for finally
being<00:05:21.139> useful<00:05:21.880> and<00:05:22.880> just<00:05:23.120> kind<00:05:23.240> of<00:05:23.300> ducking

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
being useful and just kind of ducking

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.969 
being useful and just kind of ducking
and<00:05:23.720> dodging<00:05:24.050> in<00:05:24.139> case<00:05:24.320> of<00:05:24.470> snipers<00:05:24.860> on<00:05:24.949> the

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
and dodging in case of snipers on the

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:27.490 
and dodging in case of snipers on the
car<00:05:25.220> here<00:05:25.460> and<00:05:26.389> we<00:05:26.870> don't<00:05:27.020> really<00:05:27.110> have<00:05:27.199> team

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
car here and we don't really have team

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.379 
car here and we don't really have team
presents<00:05:27.919> so<00:05:28.070> I'm<00:05:28.310> uncomfortable<00:05:28.789> being<00:05:29.180> at

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
presents so I'm uncomfortable being at

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:31.650 
presents so I'm uncomfortable being at
the<00:05:29.509> front<00:05:29.780> where<00:05:30.440> there's<00:05:30.590> no<00:05:30.740> team<00:05:31.009> around

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
the front where there's no team around

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:40.070 
the front where there's no team around
so<00:05:32.660> we<00:05:32.750> just<00:05:32.900> kind<00:05:33.080> of<00:05:33.110> regroup

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.920 

and<00:05:41.190> that<00:05:42.190> demo<00:05:42.460> does<00:05:43.000> not<00:05:43.030> present<00:05:43.630> to<00:05:43.780> in

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
and that demo does not present to in

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.480 
and that demo does not present to in
time<00:05:44.169> which<00:05:44.470> is<00:05:44.590> unfortunate<00:05:45.220> for<00:05:45.370> him

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
time which is unfortunate for him

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.830 
time which is unfortunate for him
because<00:05:45.700> he<00:05:45.880> probably<00:05:46.120> could<00:05:46.389> have<00:05:46.450> killed<00:05:46.630> me

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
because he probably could have killed me

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.040 
because he probably could have killed me
so<00:05:47.620> he<00:05:47.800> goes<00:05:47.980> down<00:05:48.360> if<00:05:49.360> we<00:05:49.450> drop<00:05:49.660> down<00:05:49.840> with<00:05:49.990> the

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
so he goes down if we drop down with the

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.780 
so he goes down if we drop down with the
uber<00:05:50.290> take<00:05:50.830> out<00:05:50.980> one<00:05:51.190> century<00:05:51.460> with<00:05:51.730> the

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:51.790 
uber take out one century with the

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.850 
uber take out one century with the
engineer<00:05:52.210> and<00:05:52.630> this<00:05:53.260> is<00:05:53.380> kind<00:05:53.590> of<00:05:53.620> a<00:05:53.710> rookie

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
engineer and this is kind of a rookie

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.980 
engineer and this is kind of a rookie
error<00:05:54.160> by<00:05:54.340> me<00:05:54.520> I<00:05:54.700> tunnel<00:05:55.150> vision<00:05:55.480> this<00:05:55.720> heavy

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
error by me I tunnel vision this heavy

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.740 
error by me I tunnel vision this heavy
when<00:05:56.290> I<00:05:56.320> should<00:05:56.620> have<00:05:56.650> just<00:05:56.740> turned<00:05:57.160> around

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
when I should have just turned around

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.909 
when I should have just turned around
because<00:05:58.750> as<00:05:59.110> you<00:05:59.200> can<00:05:59.320> see<00:05:59.440> there's<00:05:59.680> a<00:05:59.740> level

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 
because as you can see there's a level

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:01.980 
because as you can see there's a level
three<00:06:00.160> directly<00:06:00.700> behind<00:06:00.850> me<00:06:01.060> so<00:06:01.810> that's

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
three directly behind me so that's

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.770 
three directly behind me so that's
unfortunate<00:06:03.120> so<00:06:04.120> that<00:06:04.240> was<00:06:04.330> a<00:06:04.389> good<00:06:04.510> defense

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:04.780 
unfortunate so that was a good defense

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.750 
unfortunate so that was a good defense
by<00:06:04.900> them<00:06:05.110> we<00:06:05.860> come<00:06:06.040> in<00:06:06.160> with<00:06:06.250> remember<00:06:06.550> again

the<00:06:25.210> team's<00:06:25.450> able<00:06:25.720> to<00:06:25.780> push<00:06:25.960> and<00:06:26.229> we<00:06:26.919> kind<00:06:27.160> of

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.250 
the team's able to push and we kind of

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.469 
the team's able to push and we kind of
fall<00:06:27.400> back<00:06:27.610> a<00:06:27.639> bit<00:06:27.910> here<00:06:27.940> because<00:06:28.270> they<00:06:28.419> were

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 
fall back a bit here because they were

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:29.940 
fall back a bit here because they were
all<00:06:28.720> looking<00:06:28.900> at<00:06:29.169> us<00:06:29.290> and<00:06:29.470> we<00:06:29.560> didn't<00:06:29.800> really

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:29.950 
all looking at us and we didn't really

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.280 
all looking at us and we didn't really
have<00:06:30.190> the<00:06:30.220> team<00:06:30.550> presence<00:06:31.030> right<00:06:31.210> there<00:06:31.419> so

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:32.290 
have the team presence right there so

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.620 
have the team presence right there so
now<00:06:32.680> we're<00:06:33.310> slowly<00:06:33.639> pushing<00:06:34.090> it<00:06:34.180> again<00:06:34.419> with

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.630 
now we're slowly pushing it again with

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.570 
now we're slowly pushing it again with
heels<00:06:34.900> so<00:06:35.650> I<00:06:35.680> think<00:06:35.919> I<00:06:36.040> was<00:06:36.100> a<00:06:36.160> good<00:06:36.310> move<00:06:36.430> by

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
heels so I think I was a good move by

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.219 
heels so I think I was a good move by
asking<00:06:37.000> the<00:06:37.060> patient's<00:06:37.479> with<00:06:37.660> the<00:06:37.750> push<00:06:37.990> there

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:38.229 
asking the patient's with the push there

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:40.260 
asking the patient's with the push there
and<00:06:38.530> it's<00:06:39.250> just<00:06:39.400> absolutely<00:06:39.550> chaos<00:06:40.060> their

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270 
and it's just absolutely chaos their

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.990 
and it's just absolutely chaos their
