00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
you wanted to say so mine will say enter

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.979 
you wanted to say so mine will say enter
password<00:00:41.620> and<00:00:42.219> then<00:00:42.909> I<00:00:43.089> do<00:00:43.149> that<00:00:43.420> make<00:00:43.719> it<00:00:43.839> look

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
password and then I do that make it look

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:45.959 
password and then I do that make it look
more<00:00:44.019> professional<00:00:44.350> and<00:00:44.920> then<00:00:45.339> add<00:00:45.550> a<00:00:45.579> space

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:45.969 
more professional and then add a space

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:48.739 
more professional and then add a space
so<00:00:46.809> that<00:00:46.839> there's<00:00:47.350> a<00:00:47.409> space<00:00:47.769> right<00:00:48.039> after<00:00:48.399> it

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:48.749 
so that there's a space right after it

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:51.950 
so that there's a space right after it
now<00:00:49.749> after<00:00:49.989> that<00:00:50.289> you<00:00:50.559> want<00:00:50.710> to<00:00:50.769> put<00:00:50.920> input

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
now after that you want to put input

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.599 
now after that you want to put input
equals<00:00:52.960> read<00:00:54.659> and<00:00:55.659> that<00:00:56.159> so<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.870> will<00:00:59.079> read

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
equals read and that so it will read

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.889 
equals read and that so it will read
it's<00:01:00.609> going<00:01:01.209> to<00:01:01.269> read<00:01:01.420> the<00:01:01.539> password<00:01:02.069> so<00:01:03.069> input

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
it's going to read the password so input

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.980 
it's going to read the password so input
equals<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.820> what<00:01:07.119> you<00:01:07.240> want<00:01:07.420> your<00:01:07.539> password

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
equals and what you want your password

make mine say correct so after that it's

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.139 
make mine say correct so after that it's
going<00:01:27.969> to<00:01:28.030> read<00:01:28.840> the<00:01:28.990> password<00:01:29.500> and<00:01:29.649> if<00:01:30.579> it's

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
going to read the password and if it's

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.389

going<00:01:33.640> to<00:01:33.789> do<00:01:34.359> a<00:01:34.390> redstone<00:01:35.020> current<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:37.060> want

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
going to do a redstone current you want

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.389 
going to do a redstone current you want
to<00:01:37.299> set<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.630> output<00:01:37.659> of<00:01:38.229> the<00:01:38.950> redstone

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
to set the output of the redstone

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.260 
to set the output of the redstone
current<00:01:39.759> with<00:01:40.030> a<00:01:40.060> capital<00:01:40.359> o<00:01:40.689> on<00:01:40.869> output<00:01:42.270> to

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
current with a capital o on output to

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.230 
current with a capital o on output to
the<00:01:43.979> left<00:01:44.979> and<00:01:46.350> then<00:01:47.350> comma<00:01:47.950> true<00:01:48.609> so<00:01:49.090> it's

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
the left and then comma true so it's

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.209 
the left and then comma true so it's
saying<00:01:49.509> yes<00:01:49.929> it's<00:01:50.469> true<00:01:50.740> that<00:01:50.920> there's<00:01:51.159> a

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
saying yes it's true that there's a

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:54.359 
saying yes it's true that there's a
redstone<00:01:51.579> current<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.119> the<00:01:52.210> left<00:01:52.469> so<00:01:53.469> after

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
redstone current to the left so after

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.270 
redstone current to the left so after
that<00:01:54.960> now<00:01:55.960> you<00:01:56.020> have<00:01:56.319> the<00:01:56.560> redstone<00:01:56.979> current

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
that now you have the redstone current

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.029 
that now you have the redstone current
to<00:01:57.369> the<00:01:57.429> left<00:01:57.609> and<00:01:57.819> you<00:01:58.119> want<00:01:58.299> that<00:01:58.950> I'll<00:01:59.950> make

to the left and you want that I'll make

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:06.830 
to the left and you want that I'll make
mines<00:02:02.280> okay<00:02:03.280> this<00:02:03.460> way<00:02:03.780> I'll<00:02:04.780> make<00:02:05.079> mine<00:02:05.350> say

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
I'm going to make mine sleep for three

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.860 
I'm going to make mine sleep for three
seconds<00:02:16.730> because<00:02:16.909> i<00:02:17.120> find<00:02:17.299> that<00:02:17.450> worth<00:02:17.689> the

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
seconds because i find that worth the

best so now it's going to read the

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:22.479 
best so now it's going to read the
password<00:02:21.170> and<00:02:21.439> it's<00:02:21.769> going<00:02:21.950> to<00:02:22.010> say<00:02:22.129> correct

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
password and it's going to say correct

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.789
