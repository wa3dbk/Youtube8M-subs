00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
set it has a 14 bit image processor on

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.720 
set it has a 14 bit image processor on
the<00:00:27.960> inside<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.380> an<00:00:28.800> 8<00:00:28.920> bit<00:00:29.130> display<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.640> what

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
the inside and an 8 bit display and what

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
the inside and an 8 bit display and what
that<00:00:29.849> really<00:00:30.000> means<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.480> you're<00:00:30.660> gonna

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
that really means is that you're gonna

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.569 
that really means is that you're gonna
get<00:00:30.929> over<00:00:31.019> 4000<00:00:31.830> levels<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.219> gradiation

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
get over 4000 levels of gradiation

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.670 
get over 4000 levels of gradiation
between<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.000> different<00:00:33.270> colors<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:34.350> also

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
between the different colors and also

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.930 
between the different colors and also
between<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.980> blacks<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.489> whites<00:00:35.520> and

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
between the blacks and the whites and

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.580 
between the blacks and the whites and
that<00:00:36.390> really<00:00:36.630> helps<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.960> lot<00:00:36.989> that's<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.440> good

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
that really helps a lot that's a good

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.549 
that really helps a lot that's a good
contrast<00:00:38.040> ratio<00:00:38.430> for<00:00:39.239> an<00:00:39.329> LCD<00:00:39.690> because<00:00:40.230> if<00:00:40.500> you

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
contrast ratio for an LCD because if you

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.229 
contrast ratio for an LCD because if you
noticed<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.070> in<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.399> black<00:00:41.579> areas<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.030> lot

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
noticed in the in the black areas a lot

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.090 
noticed in the in the black areas a lot
of<00:00:42.329> times<00:00:42.510> in<00:00:42.690> some<00:00:42.870> sets<00:00:43.110> with<00:00:43.920> lower

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
of times in some sets with lower

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.790 
of times in some sets with lower
contrast<00:00:44.550> ratios<00:00:45.030> or<00:00:45.329> less<00:00:45.930> contrast<00:00:46.410> ratios

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
contrast ratios or less contrast ratios

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.319 
contrast ratios or less contrast ratios
I<00:00:46.920> suppose<00:00:47.219> or<00:00:47.460> less<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.969> contrast<00:00:48.270> ratio

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
I suppose or less of a contrast ratio

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.750 
I suppose or less of a contrast ratio
you'll<00:00:49.079> notice<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.590> black<00:00:49.770> areas<00:00:50.250> just

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
you'll notice that the black areas just

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.369 
you'll notice that the black areas just
tend<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.000> be<00:00:51.059> black<00:00:51.270> well<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:51.930> one<00:00:52.110> even

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
tend to be black well in this one even

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.750 
tend to be black well in this one even
in<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.710> black<00:00:52.890> areas<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.340> see<00:00:53.460> different

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
in the black areas you see different

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.549 
in the black areas you see different
gradations<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.390> see<00:00:54.539> shades<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:55.079> see<00:00:55.230> colors

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
gradations you see shades you see colors

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.369 
gradations you see shades you see colors
it's<00:00:56.340> more<00:00:56.610> like<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:57.329> originally<00:00:58.079> wasn't<00:00:58.230> a

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
it's more like it originally wasn't a

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.220 
it's more like it originally wasn't a
theater<00:00:58.710> that's<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.280> nice<00:00:59.550> thing<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.570> mean<00:01:01.109> if

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
theater that's a nice thing I mean if

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.450 
theater that's a nice thing I mean if
you<00:01:01.320> notice<00:01:01.559> here<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.100> different<00:01:02.340> black

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
you notice here in the different black

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.889 
you notice here in the different black
areas<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.850> doesn't<00:01:03.210> just<00:01:03.359> turn<00:01:03.570> all<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.870> way

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
areas it doesn't just turn all the way

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.539 
areas it doesn't just turn all the way
black<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.739> white<00:01:04.920> areas<00:01:05.250> they're<00:01:05.400> not

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
black and the white areas they're not

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.910 
black and the white areas they're not
just<00:01:05.700> all<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:05.939> way<00:01:06.060> white<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.600> see<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:07.020> lot<00:01:07.770> of

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
just all the way white you see a lot of

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.109 
just all the way white you see a lot of
differences<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.490> colors<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> lot<00:01:09.090> of

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
differences in colors and a lot of

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.330 
differences in colors and a lot of
differences<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:10.229> different<00:01:10.500> shades<00:01:10.740> also

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
differences in the different shades also

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.620 
differences in the different shades also
I<00:01:11.460> wanted<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.729> show<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:11.909> an<00:01:12.060> action<00:01:12.330> movie<00:01:12.450> on

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
I wanted to show you an action movie on

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.149 
I wanted to show you an action movie on
this<00:01:12.720> set<00:01:12.900> because<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.260> has<00:01:13.350> an<00:01:13.470> 8<00:01:13.650> millisecond

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
this set because it has an 8 millisecond

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.060 
this set because it has an 8 millisecond
response<00:01:14.220> time<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:15.119> that's<00:01:15.299> quick<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:16.710> lot

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
response time and that's quick and a lot

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.620 
response time and that's quick and a lot
of<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.250> older<00:01:17.460> sets<00:01:17.670> again<00:01:17.939> they<00:01:18.420> have<00:01:18.600> a

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
of the older sets again they have a

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.539 
of the older sets again they have a
slower<00:01:19.380> response<00:01:19.590> times<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.250> start<00:01:20.460> to

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
slower response times and you start to

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.370 
slower response times and you start to
see<00:01:20.670> something<00:01:20.880> called<00:01:21.150> ghosting<00:01:21.600> where<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
see something called ghosting where the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.140 
see something called ghosting where the
characters<00:01:22.740> move<00:01:22.920> on<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.159> screen<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.670> then

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
characters move on the screen and then

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.670 
characters move on the screen and then
you'll<00:01:24.299> see<00:01:24.479> like<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.720> little<00:01:24.960> fragment<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.619> a

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
you'll see like a little fragment of a

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.990 
you'll see like a little fragment of a
shadow<00:01:25.890> behind<00:01:26.070> them<00:01:26.369> kind<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.640> catching<00:01:26.909> up

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
shadow behind them kind of catching up

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.460 
shadow behind them kind of catching up
to<00:01:27.180> them<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.900> won't<00:01:28.049> see<00:01:28.200> any<00:01:28.350> of<00:01:28.380> that

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
to them and you won't see any of that

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.859 
to them and you won't see any of that
with<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:28.860> set<00:01:29.130> plus<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.970> also<00:01:30.150> has<00:01:30.420> several

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
with this set plus it also has several

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.600 
with this set plus it also has several
different<00:01:31.110> modes<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.770> are<00:01:31.860> really<00:01:32.070> cool<00:01:32.280> it

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
different modes that are really cool it

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.580 
different modes that are really cool it
has<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.790> gaming<00:01:33.119> mode<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.079> gaming<00:01:34.409> mode

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
has a gaming mode and in the gaming mode

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.980 
has a gaming mode and in the gaming mode
it<00:01:34.799> heightens<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.490> response<00:01:35.880> time<00:01:36.150> even<00:01:36.750> more

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
it heightens the response time even more

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.480 
it heightens the response time even more
so<00:01:37.380> when<00:01:37.619> you're<00:01:37.740> playing<00:01:37.950> your<00:01:38.100> games<00:01:38.310> you

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
so when you're playing your games you

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.010 
so when you're playing your games you
really<00:01:38.820> want<00:01:39.000> accurate<00:01:39.390> response<00:01:39.720> times

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
really want accurate response times

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.080 
really want accurate response times
because<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:40.979> can<00:01:41.100> mean<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.579> difference<00:01:41.729> in

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
because that can mean the difference in

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.770 
because that can mean the difference in
being<00:01:42.180> Dead<00:01:42.390> or<00:01:42.509> Alive

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
being Dead or Alive

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.109 
being Dead or Alive
and<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:43.740> that's<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.070> game<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.460> see<00:01:44.640> how<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:44.850> tied

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
and so that's a game to see how I tied

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.240 
and so that's a game to see how I tied
that<00:01:45.299> together<00:01:45.450> Erik<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.979> paying<00:01:47.189> attention

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
that together Erik you paying attention

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.550 
that together Erik you paying attention
over<00:01:47.640> there<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:48.570> better<00:01:48.750> be<00:01:48.899> this<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.170> 1080p

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
over there you better be this is 1080p

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.679 
over there you better be this is 1080p
these<00:01:50.460> guys<00:01:50.640> are<00:01:50.790> not<00:01:51.000> messing<00:01:51.329> around<00:01:51.420> with

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
these guys are not messing around with

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.539 
these guys are not messing around with
the<00:01:51.840> set<00:01:52.079> now<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:52.950> has<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.100> lot<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.399> really

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
the set now this has a lot of really

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.340 
the set now this has a lot of really
cool<00:01:53.700> technologies<00:01:54.329> one<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.079> think<00:01:55.259> is

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
cool technologies one that I think is

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.200 
cool technologies one that I think is
really<00:01:55.500> cool<00:01:55.680> it's<00:01:56.640> something<00:01:56.939> that's<00:01:57.090> called

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
really cool it's something that's called

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.969 
really cool it's something that's called
dynamic<00:01:57.420> light<00:01:57.780> it's<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.020> backlight<00:01:58.829> control

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
dynamic light it's a backlight control

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.940 
dynamic light it's a backlight control
and<00:01:59.460> what<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.909> does<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.329> basically<00:02:00.950> detects

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
and what it does is it basically detects

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.999 
and what it does is it basically detects
every<00:02:02.939> scene<00:02:03.509> or<00:02:03.780> every<00:02:04.079> even<00:02:04.770> every

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
every scene or every even every

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.679 
every scene or every even every
individual<00:02:05.520> frame<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:06.149> goes<00:02:06.360> through<00:02:06.540> and

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
individual frame it goes through and

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:07.969 
individual frame it goes through and
detects<00:02:06.990> what<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.259> lights<00:02:07.439> doing<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:07.829> says

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
detects what the lights doing it says

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.260 
detects what the lights doing it says
like<00:02:08.129> oh<00:02:08.220> this<00:02:08.340> area<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.670> too<00:02:08.789> dark<00:02:09.030> or<00:02:09.119> this

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
like oh this area is too dark or this

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.630 
like oh this area is too dark or this
area<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.569> too<00:02:09.660> light<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.050> if<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.250> background

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
area is too light and if the background

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.700 
area is too light and if the background
is<00:02:11.760> too<00:02:11.879> bright<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.330> may

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
is too bright and may

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.230 
is too bright and may
the<00:02:12.800> subject<00:02:13.160> faces<00:02:13.580> a<00:02:13.610> little<00:02:13.790> darker<00:02:14.150> it

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
the subject faces a little darker it

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.120 
the subject faces a little darker it
helps<00:02:14.450> to<00:02:14.540> even<00:02:14.810> that<00:02:14.900> out<00:02:14.960> it<00:02:15.230> makes<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.620> face

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
helps to even that out it makes the face

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.560 
helps to even that out it makes the face
a<00:02:16.160> little<00:02:16.400> brighter<00:02:16.700> so<00:02:16.880> you<00:02:16.970> can<00:02:17.090> see<00:02:17.270> it<00:02:17.390> and

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
a little brighter so you can see it and

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.900 
a little brighter so you can see it and
it<00:02:17.870> does<00:02:18.080> that<00:02:18.260> to<00:02:18.440> every<00:02:18.860> individual<00:02:19.580> frame

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
it does that to every individual frame

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.610 
it does that to every individual frame
to<00:02:20.210> make<00:02:20.330> sure<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:20.540> get<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.750> best<00:02:20.900> image

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
to make sure you get the best image

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.680 
to make sure you get the best image
quality<00:02:21.650> possible<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:22.970> you<00:02:23.390> can<00:02:23.420> turn<00:02:23.630> that

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
quality possible and you can turn that

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.570 
quality possible and you can turn that
on<00:02:23.930> or<00:02:23.960> off<00:02:24.110> you<00:02:24.350> can<00:02:24.470> even<00:02:24.710> lower<00:02:25.070> and<00:02:25.400> raise

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
on or off you can even lower and raise

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.550 
on or off you can even lower and raise
the<00:02:25.790> different<00:02:26.060> level<00:02:26.300> and<00:02:26.570> just<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:27.350> get<00:02:27.470> it

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
the different level and just to get it

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.170 
the different level and just to get it
perfect<00:02:27.920> for<00:02:28.010> you<00:02:28.160> that<00:02:28.490> helps<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:28.790> lot<00:02:28.910> when
