we're<00:01:30.630> just<00:01:30.720> gonna<00:01:30.869> follow<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.229> instructions

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
we're just gonna follow the instructions

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.039 
we're just gonna follow the instructions
the<00:01:32.220> first<00:01:32.250> instruction<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:33.090> basically<00:01:33.600> to

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
the first instruction is basically to

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.010 
the first instruction is basically to
fold<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.979> paper<00:01:35.159> in<00:01:35.700> half<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.420> again<00:01:36.840> when

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
fold the paper in half and again when

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.149 
fold the paper in half and again when
you<00:01:37.110> start<00:01:37.170> doing<00:01:37.590> this<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.740> want<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.070> make

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
sure you're getting as symmetrical as

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.520 
sure you're getting as symmetrical as
possible<00:01:41.579> you're<00:01:42.509> going<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.720> open<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.140> paper

- there's lots of neat great for paper
airplanes<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.680> you're<00:01:49.770> just<00:01:49.890> gonna<00:01:50.070> fold<00:01:50.720> the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
airplanes and you're just gonna fold the

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.389 
airplanes and you're just gonna fold the
paper<00:01:51.960> down<00:01:52.820> like<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:55.009> so<00:01:56.009> you're<00:01:56.130> sort<00:01:56.280> of

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
paper down like so so you're sort of

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.169 
paper down like so so you're sort of
making<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.759> little<00:01:56.880> triangle<00:01:57.450> at<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.659> top

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:02.919 

now<00:02:02.179> what<00:02:02.299> you're<00:02:02.359> going<00:02:02.509> to<00:02:02.539> do<00:02:02.689> is<00:02:02.810> you're

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
now what you're going to do is you're

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:04.870 
now what you're going to do is you're
going<00:02:02.960> to<00:02:03.079> fold<00:02:03.409> that<00:02:03.530> triangle<00:02:04.520> that<00:02:04.759> you

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
going to fold that triangle that you

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.080 
going to fold that triangle that you
just<00:02:05.060> made<00:02:05.359> down<00:02:05.780> onto<00:02:06.469> the<00:02:06.590> paper<00:02:06.859> and<00:02:07.250> then

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
just made down onto the paper and then

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.150 
just made down onto the paper and then
you're<00:02:08.209> going<00:02:08.300> to<00:02:08.390> fold<00:02:08.599> the<00:02:08.810> corners<00:02:09.200> in<00:02:09.410> into

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
you're going to fold the corners in into

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.559 
you're going to fold the corners in into
that<00:02:10.280> little<00:02:10.429> crease<00:02:10.819> there<00:02:11.120> so<00:02:11.300> you<00:02:11.360> just

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
that little crease there so you just

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.699 
that little crease there so you just
sort<00:02:11.720> of<00:02:11.780> mash<00:02:12.050> them<00:02:12.230> things<00:02:12.440> up<00:02:14.560> now<00:02:15.560> we're

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
sort of mash them things up now we're

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.110 
sort of mash them things up now we're
going<00:02:15.800> to<00:02:15.860> do<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.099> same<00:02:16.310> thing<00:02:16.580> on<00:02:16.760> this<00:02:16.940> side

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.080 

so<00:02:20.120> right<00:02:20.269> now<00:02:20.420> we're<00:02:20.629> in<00:02:20.660> step<00:02:20.959> five<00:02:24.879> and<00:02:25.879> then

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
so right now we're in step five and then

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.280 
so right now we're in step five and then
what<00:02:26.269> you<00:02:26.390> do<00:02:26.510> is<00:02:26.540> you<00:02:26.690> just<00:02:26.720> flip<00:02:27.080> it<00:02:27.200> over

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
what you do is you just flip it over

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.570 
what you do is you just flip it over
when<00:02:27.590> you're<00:02:27.709> done<00:02:27.830> so<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:28.099> looks<00:02:28.250> like<00:02:28.340> this

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
when you're done so it looks like this

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.759 
when you're done so it looks like this
and<00:02:28.849> then<00:02:29.000> they're<00:02:29.150> asking<00:02:29.540> you<00:02:29.810> to<00:02:30.410> fold<00:02:30.620> it

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
and then they're asking you to fold it

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.110 
and then they're asking you to fold it
up<00:02:30.890> so<00:02:31.160> we're<00:02:31.310> going<00:02:31.430> to<00:02:31.489> fold<00:02:31.640> it<00:02:31.790> out<00:02:31.880> making

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
up so we're going to fold it out making

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.289 
up so we're going to fold it out making
sure<00:02:32.420> you<00:02:32.540> think<00:02:32.720> it's<00:02:32.810> nice<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.140> symmetrical

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
sure you think it's nice and symmetrical

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:44.050 
sure you think it's nice and symmetrical
and<00:02:35.299> then<00:02:36.290> we're<00:02:37.190> going<00:02:37.370> to<00:02:37.430> fold<00:02:37.670> it<00:02:42.190> over<00:02:43.190> and

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
and then we're going to fold it over and

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.569 
and then we're going to fold it over and
you<00:02:44.150> match<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.599> other<00:02:44.780> side<00:02:48.190> making<00:02:49.190> sure<00:02:49.340> you

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
you match the other side making sure you

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.300 
you match the other side making sure you
get<00:02:49.700> a<00:02:49.730> nice<00:02:50.000> creases<00:02:50.750> in<00:02:50.900> symmetry<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.620> there

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
get a nice creases in symmetry and there

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.550 
get a nice creases in symmetry and there
you<00:02:52.430> have<00:02:52.489> it<00:02:52.879> so<00:02:53.569> there<00:02:53.810> is<00:02:53.840> our<00:02:54.230> knack<00:02:54.530> i

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
you have it so there is our knack i

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.250 
you have it so there is our knack i
mereloc<00:02:55.040> when<00:02:56.000> you<00:02:56.120> fly<00:02:56.390> it<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:56.720> can<00:02:56.870> open<00:02:57.140> it

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
mereloc when you fly it you can open it

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.780 
mereloc when you fly it you can open it
up<00:02:57.379> like<00:02:57.590> that<00:02:57.739> on<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:57.950> inside<00:02:58.099> to<00:02:58.519> give<00:02:58.670> an

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
up like that on the inside to give an

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.990 
up like that on the inside to give an
extra<00:02:59.319> V<00:03:00.319> space<00:03:00.680> in<00:03:00.920> there<00:03:01.129> but<00:03:01.640> that's<00:03:01.819> the

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
extra V space in there but that's the

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.720 
extra V space in there but that's the
plane<00:03:02.209> so<00:03:02.989> I<00:03:03.230> hope<00:03:03.470> you<00:03:03.590> enjoyed<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.700> lesson

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
plane so I hope you enjoyed the lesson

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.300 
plane so I hope you enjoyed the lesson
