00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.860 
unorthodox but I think the end result
will<00:00:59.489> be<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.640> measurable<00:01:00.270> enhancement<00:01:00.809> to

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:34.109 
Archimedes would be so proud they

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:35.179 
Archimedes would be so proud they
shouldn't<00:01:34.469> there's<00:01:34.619> something<00:01:34.859> I<00:01:34.950> want<00:01:35.130> to

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
shouldn't there's something I want to

talk to you about before we go to the

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.510 
talk to you about before we go to the
party<00:01:36.719> I<00:01:36.840> don't<00:01:37.200> care<00:01:37.500> if<00:01:37.560> anybody<00:01:38.039> gets<00:01:38.280> it

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520

I'm<00:01:38.670> going<00:01:38.969> as<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.240> Doppler<00:01:39.600> effect<00:01:40.880> no<00:01:41.880> it's

00:01:42.199 --> 00:01:42.209 
I'm going as the Doppler effect no it's

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:48.249 
I'm going as the Doppler effect no it's
not<00:01:42.299> even<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.719> few<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.959> can<00:01:43.200> demonstrate<00:01:43.319> yeah

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.029

terrific oh hi hi hello but what are you

00:01:53.039 --> 00:02:00.649 
terrific oh hi hi hello but what are you
supposed<00:01:53.069> to<00:01:53.640> be<00:01:53.719> me<00:01:55.280> I'll<00:01:56.280> give<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.609> a<00:01:56.670> hint

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.460 

it's<00:02:01.439> due<00:02:01.679> to<00:02:01.890> dream<00:02:02.189> close

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:14.950 

the<00:02:06.890> brain<00:02:07.130> damage<00:02:07.310> to<00:02:07.760> to<00:02:07.970> tree<00:02:12.010> I<00:02:13.960> still

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
the brain damage to to tree I still

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.190 
the brain damage to to tree I still
don't<00:02:15.140> get<00:02:15.230> it<00:02:15.290> I'm<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.370> Doppler<00:02:16.790> effect<00:02:17.200> okay

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
don't get it I'm the Doppler effect okay

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.080 
don't get it I'm the Doppler effect okay
that<00:02:18.410> is<00:02:18.500> some<00:02:18.710> sort<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:18.980> learning<00:02:19.490> disability

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
that is some sort of learning disability

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.400 
that is some sort of learning disability
I<00:02:20.120> think<00:02:20.390> it's<00:02:20.510> very<00:02:20.750> insensitive<00:02:23.170> why<00:02:24.170> don't

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
I think it's very insensitive why don't

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.670 
I think it's very insensitive why don't
you<00:02:24.590> just<00:02:24.770> tell<00:02:25.010> people<00:02:25.220> you're<00:02:25.550> a<00:02:25.580> zebra<00:02:26.680> why

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
you just tell people you're a zebra why

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.080 
you just tell people you're a zebra why
don't<00:02:27.830> you<00:02:27.950> just<00:02:28.070> tell<00:02:28.280> people<00:02:28.430> you're<00:02:28.790> at<00:02:28.910> one

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
don't you just tell people you're at one

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.420 
don't you just tell people you're at one
of<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.240> Seven<00:02:29.540> Dwarves<00:02:29.900> because<00:02:30.800> I'm<00:02:30.950> Frodo

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
of the Seven Dwarves because I'm Frodo

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.830 
of the Seven Dwarves because I'm Frodo
yes<00:02:32.030> well<00:02:32.390> I'm<00:02:32.600> the<00:02:32.840> Doppler<00:02:33.260> effect<00:02:34.270> and<00:02:35.270> you

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
yes well I'm the Doppler effect and you

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.060 
yes well I'm the Doppler effect and you
want<00:02:35.990> to<00:02:36.050> know<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.260> worst<00:02:36.410> part<00:02:36.560> is<00:02:36.860> you<00:02:36.980> don't

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
want to know the worst part is you don't
