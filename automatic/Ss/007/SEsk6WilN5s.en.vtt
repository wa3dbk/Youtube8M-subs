rocket volume Express mess
this<00:04:47.360> really<00:04:47.660> helps<00:04:47.990> for<00:04:48.170> separating<00:04:48.800> and

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
this really helps for separating and

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:50.590 
this really helps for separating and
giving<00:04:49.250> more<00:04:49.430> volume<00:04:49.850> and<00:04:49.970> it's<00:04:50.120> a<00:04:50.240> much<00:04:50.390> drier

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
giving more volume and it's a much drier

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.900 
giving more volume and it's a much drier
formula<00:04:51.230> you<00:04:51.680> can<00:04:51.830> also<00:04:51.980> do<00:04:52.310> these<00:04:52.460> in<00:04:52.610> reverse

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
formula you can also do these in reverse

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.670 
formula you can also do these in reverse
to<00:04:52.940> it<00:04:53.300> works<00:04:53.480> really<00:04:53.720> well<00:04:53.840> if<00:04:54.140> you<00:04:54.260> do<00:04:54.500> the

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
to it works really well if you do the

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.440 
to it works really well if you do the
volumizing<00:04:55.580> one<00:04:55.820> first<00:04:56.060> and<00:04:56.300> then<00:04:56.420> the
