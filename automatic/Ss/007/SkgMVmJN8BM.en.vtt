00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
like it's felt-tipped but it's really

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.800 
like it's felt-tipped but it's really
flexible<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.979> bendable<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.610> yeah<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.600> think

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
flexible and bendable and yeah I think

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.100 
flexible and bendable and yeah I think
that<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.820> lines<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:39.119> can<00:01:39.270> draw<00:01:39.479> are<00:01:39.780> really

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
that the lines you can draw are really

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.749 
that the lines you can draw are really
thin<00:01:40.350> if<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.590> press<00:01:40.799> really<00:01:41.009> lightly<00:01:41.460> or

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
thin if you press really lightly or

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.359 
thin if you press really lightly or
really<00:01:42.299> think<00:01:42.570> if<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.810> press<00:01:43.049> pretty<00:01:43.470> hard<00:01:43.590> so

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
really think if you press pretty hard so

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.950 
really think if you press pretty hard so
you<00:01:44.820> guys<00:01:45.000> can<00:01:45.240> see<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.509> variety<00:01:45.630> of

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
you guys can see the variety of

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.120 
you guys can see the variety of
different<00:01:46.320> lines<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.590> got<00:01:46.740> just<00:01:46.950> by<00:01:47.070> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
different lines I got just by the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.859 
different lines I got just by the
texture<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.060> can<00:01:48.180> definitely<00:01:48.299> tell<00:01:48.600> it's

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
texture and you can definitely tell it's

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.389 
texture and you can definitely tell it's
pretty<00:01:49.229> pigmented<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:49.950> I'm<00:01:50.009> gonna<00:01:50.130> go<00:01:50.280> ahead

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
pretty pigmented so I'm gonna go ahead

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.859 
pretty pigmented so I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:01:50.520> do<00:01:50.579> this<00:01:50.640> much<00:01:50.880> test<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.329> little<00:01:51.570> bit<00:01:51.689> later

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
and do this much test a little bit later

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.780

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.380 
frame I'm really bad at it but we're
gonna<00:02:06.899> try<00:02:07.079> so<00:02:07.680> this<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.340> just<00:02:08.520> what<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.849> pen

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
gonna try so this is just what the pen

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.070 
gonna try so this is just what the pen
looks<00:02:09.660> like<00:02:09.869> up<00:02:10.020> close

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
looks like up close

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.260 
looks like up close
do<00:02:11.530> be<00:02:11.650> nice<00:02:11.830> and<00:02:12.070> pointy<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.730> let's<00:02:13.060> go<00:02:13.210> ahead

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
do be nice and pointy and let's go ahead

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:28.950 
do be nice and pointy and let's go ahead
and<00:02:13.480> start<00:02:13.630> drawing

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.320 

okay<00:02:29.960> so<00:02:30.020> I<00:02:30.200> got<00:02:30.410> my<00:02:30.560> wing<00:02:30.800> drawn<00:02:31.310> on<00:02:31.520> and<00:02:31.850> I

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
okay so I got my wing drawn on and I

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.700 
okay so I got my wing drawn on and I
will<00:02:32.570> say<00:02:32.780> that<00:02:32.810> it<00:02:33.050> does<00:02:33.230> take<00:02:33.410> me<00:02:33.560> a<00:02:33.590> little

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
will say that it does take me a little

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.410 
will say that it does take me a little
longer<00:02:33.860> than<00:02:34.220> I<00:02:34.430> would<00:02:34.550> like<00:02:34.820> to<00:02:35.000> draw<00:02:35.180> on<00:02:35.330> the

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
longer than I would like to draw on the

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.390 
longer than I would like to draw on the
wings<00:02:35.570> liner<00:02:35.840> but<00:02:36.230> it<00:02:36.350> was<00:02:36.440> really<00:02:36.710> smooth<00:02:37.040> and

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
wings liner but it was really smooth and

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.580 
wings liner but it was really smooth and
I<00:02:38.240> think<00:02:38.480> that<00:02:38.600> it<00:02:38.690> did<00:02:38.810> a<00:02:39.020> pretty<00:02:39.260> good<00:02:39.380> job

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
I think that it did a pretty good job

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.200 
I think that it did a pretty good job
I<00:02:39.710> have<00:02:39.830> quite<00:02:40.040> a<00:02:40.100> bit<00:02:40.280> of<00:02:40.370> hold<00:02:40.700> on<00:02:40.880> it<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.090> it

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
I have quite a bit of hold on it and it

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.330 
I have quite a bit of hold on it and it
doesn't<00:02:41.510> take<00:02:41.630> a<00:02:41.660> super<00:02:42.020> long<00:02:42.140> time<00:02:42.440> if<00:02:42.680> the

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
doesn't take a super long time if the

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.500 
doesn't take a super long time if the
more<00:02:43.520> you<00:02:43.610> press<00:02:43.790> on<00:02:43.910> it<00:02:44.000> it<00:02:44.120> does<00:02:44.270> really

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
more you press on it it does really

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.090 
more you press on it it does really
glide<00:02:44.780> across<00:02:44.900> your<00:02:45.110> eyes<00:02:45.350> so<00:02:45.530> I<00:02:45.560> did<00:02:45.860> like

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.890 
it looks on the eyes I think it's really
matte<00:03:28.919> and<00:03:29.280> I<00:03:30.000> think<00:03:30.299> that<00:03:30.419> it<00:03:30.540> glided<00:03:30.840> on

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
matte and I think that it glided on

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.509 
matte and I think that it glided on
pretty<00:03:31.349> smooth<00:03:31.620> it<00:03:31.769> wasn't<00:03:32.040> too<00:03:32.159> thick<00:03:32.370> or

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
pretty smooth it wasn't too thick or

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.069 
pretty smooth it wasn't too thick or
anything<00:03:32.760> like<00:03:33.060> that<00:03:33.090> so<00:03:33.480> I<00:03:33.510> did<00:03:33.689> really<00:03:33.870> like

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
anything like that so I did really like

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.229 
anything like that so I did really like
it<00:03:34.349> smudge<00:03:34.859> test<00:03:35.189> didn't<00:03:35.639> work<00:03:35.760> so<00:03:35.819> well<00:03:36.090> I'm
