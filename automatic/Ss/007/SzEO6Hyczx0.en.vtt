today is look at the resilience of the
boatport<00:00:25.289> easel<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.769> see<00:00:25.980> just<00:00:26.220> how<00:00:26.340> much<00:00:26.460> it

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
boatport easel and see just how much it

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.970 
boatport easel and see just how much it
can<00:00:26.910> take<00:00:27.180> before<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:27.750> tips<00:00:27.930> over<00:00:28.140> so<00:00:28.830> that's

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
can take before it tips over so that's

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.560 
can take before it tips over so that's
we're<00:00:29.099> going<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.279> test<00:00:29.519> today<00:00:29.640> how<00:00:29.910> stable<00:00:30.240> is

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
we're going to test today how stable is

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.179 
we're going to test today how stable is
the<00:00:30.779> bow<00:00:30.900> poor<00:00:31.140> diesel<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:31.590> how<00:00:31.830> much<00:00:31.980> wind

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
the bow poor diesel and how much wind

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.639 
the bow poor diesel and how much wind
can<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.430> take<00:00:32.579> for<00:00:32.820> tips<00:00:33.030> over<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.510> well<00:00:34.170> prove

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
can it take for tips over and well prove

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.000 
can it take for tips over and well prove
it<00:00:39.140> so<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.320> first<00:00:40.500> thing<00:00:40.620> we're<00:00:40.739> gonna<00:00:40.800> do<00:00:40.980> is

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
it so the first thing we're gonna do is

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.190 
it so the first thing we're gonna do is
test<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.579> with<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.790> smaller<00:00:42.120> sized<00:00:42.450> canvas<00:00:43.050> on

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
test it with a smaller sized canvas on

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.810 
test it with a smaller sized canvas on
it<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.469> see<00:00:43.620> how<00:00:43.770> well<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.010> holds<00:00:44.489> up<00:00:44.610> so

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
it and see how well that holds up so

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.970 
it and see how well that holds up so
I've<00:00:44.969> set<00:00:45.239> up<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.420> 12<00:00:45.660> by<00:00:45.780> 16<00:00:46.110> on<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.620> boat<00:00:46.770> pour

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.860 
I've set up a 12 by 16 on the boat pour
diesel<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.610> we're<00:00:48.120> gonna<00:00:48.239> simulate<00:00:48.510> some

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
diesel and we're gonna simulate some

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.240 
diesel and we're gonna simulate some
wind<00:00:49.050> conditions<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.800> help<00:00:49.950> me<00:00:50.010> with<00:00:50.129> that

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
wind conditions and to help me with that

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.240 
wind conditions and to help me with that
I<00:00:50.280> brought<00:00:50.550> along<00:00:50.820> my<00:00:51.059> biggest<00:00:51.660> fan<00:00:51.960> now<00:00:52.590> what

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
device and see just how much wind is

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.740 
device and see just how much wind is
hitting<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.399> miles<00:01:02.640> per<00:01:02.850> hour<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.239> see<00:01:03.449> how

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
hitting it in miles per hour and see how

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.219 
hitting it in miles per hour and see how
stable<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:05.270> he's<00:01:06.270> giving<00:01:06.600> me<00:01:06.689> kilometers

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
stable it is he's giving me kilometers

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.899 
stable it is he's giving me kilometers
nobody<00:01:08.070> knows<00:01:08.220> what<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.430> means

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
nobody knows what that means

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.899 
nobody knows what that means
my<00:01:10.820> anemometer<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:12.030> reading<00:01:12.900> six<00:01:13.860> six<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.850> a

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
my anemometer is reading six six and a

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.210 
my anemometer is reading six six and a
half<00:01:14.939> miles<00:01:15.509> an<00:01:15.750> hour<00:01:15.869> overall<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.799> think<00:01:16.950> it's

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
half miles an hour overall I think it's

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.700 
half miles an hour overall I think it's
pretty<00:01:17.729> stable<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.509> let's<00:01:19.320> make<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.500> little

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
pretty stable so let's make a little

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.789 
pretty stable so let's make a little
windier<00:01:20.659> now<00:01:21.659> we're<00:01:21.810> measuring<00:01:22.020> around<00:01:22.560> eight

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
windier now we're measuring around eight

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.770 
windier now we're measuring around eight
eight<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.310> half<00:01:23.340> miles<00:01:23.820> per<00:01:24.090> hour<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.540> a

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
eight and a half miles per hour so a

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.770 
eight and a half miles per hour so a
little<00:01:25.170> bit<00:01:25.350> more<00:01:25.409> push<00:01:26.000> but<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.180> easel<00:01:27.509> seems

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
little bit more push but the easel seems

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.710 
little bit more push but the easel seems
to<00:01:28.110> be<00:01:28.259> remaining<00:01:28.590> solid<00:01:29.420> alright<00:01:30.420> now<00:01:30.600> we're

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
to be remaining solid alright now we're

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.620 
to be remaining solid alright now we're
measuring<00:01:30.869> around

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
measuring around

12<00:01:32.350> miles<00:01:32.619> an<00:01:32.860> hour<00:01:32.979> get<00:01:33.850> a<00:01:33.880> little<00:01:34.090> windy<00:01:34.360> I

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
12 miles an hour get a little windy I

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.569 
12 miles an hour get a little windy I
might<00:01:35.530> say<00:01:35.740> a<00:01:35.770> little<00:01:35.920> bit<00:01:36.039> windier<00:01:36.399> than<00:01:36.430> I

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
might say a little bit windier than I

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:38.700 
might say a little bit windier than I
might<00:01:36.759> want<00:01:36.909> to<00:01:36.939> be<00:01:37.030> painting<00:01:37.240> outside<00:01:37.710> but

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
might want to be painting outside but

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.990 
might want to be painting outside but
the<00:01:38.979> reisel<00:01:39.280> seems<00:01:39.490> to<00:01:39.610> be<00:01:39.729> remaining

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
the reisel seems to be remaining

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.690 
the reisel seems to be remaining
absolutely<00:01:40.990> solid<00:01:43.020> very<00:01:44.020> reliable<00:01:44.649> tool<00:01:44.890> all

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
absolutely solid very reliable tool all

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.069 
absolutely solid very reliable tool all
right<00:01:45.789> I<00:01:45.850> think<00:01:46.060> we've<00:01:46.149> effectively<00:01:46.539> tested

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:47.079 
right I think we've effectively tested

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:49.499 
right I think we've effectively tested
it<00:01:47.200> at<00:01:47.320> a<00:01:47.380> small<00:01:48.070> scale<00:01:48.340> but<00:01:49.119> let's<00:01:49.299> see<00:01:49.420> what

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509 
it at a small scale but let's see what

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.690 
it at a small scale but let's see what
happens<00:01:49.840> when<00:01:49.990> we<00:01:50.049> put<00:01:50.259> a<00:01:50.289> large<00:01:50.920> sized<00:01:51.280> canvas

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
happens when we put a large sized canvas

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.399 
happens when we put a large sized canvas
on<00:01:51.850> here<00:01:52.030> now<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.539> bow<00:01:52.689> port<00:01:52.960> says<00:01:53.170> it<00:01:53.319> can

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
on here now the bow port says it can

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.850 
on here now the bow port says it can
hold<00:01:53.500> up<00:01:53.679> to<00:01:53.740> a<00:01:53.920> 48<00:01:54.429> inch<00:01:54.520> by<00:01:54.850> 60<00:01:55.179> inch<00:01:55.270> canvas

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
hold up to a 48 inch by 60 inch canvas

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:03.139 
hold up to a 48 inch by 60 inch canvas
and<00:01:56.860> that's<00:01:57.009> pretty<00:01:57.189> much<00:01:57.310> a<00:01:57.460> sail

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.880 

so<00:02:04.149> we've<00:02:04.390> fitted<00:02:04.599> our<00:02:04.810> bow<00:02:04.990> port<00:02:05.289> with<00:02:05.409> a<00:02:05.439> 48

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
so we've fitted our bow port with a 48
