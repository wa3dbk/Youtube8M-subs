a<00:01:35.040> little<00:01:35.250> tough<00:01:35.460> making<00:01:35.790> sure<00:01:36.090> this<00:01:36.270> isn't<00:01:36.509> in

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
a little tough making sure this isn't in

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.390 
a little tough making sure this isn't in
a<00:01:36.900> big<00:01:37.079> ol<00:01:37.229> glob<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.710> fat<00:01:37.890> but<00:01:38.100> we're<00:01:38.250> going<00:01:38.340> to

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
a big ol glob of fat but we're going to

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.560 
a big ol glob of fat but we're going to
just<00:01:38.640> take<00:01:38.759> our<00:01:38.939> chances

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
just take our chances

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.690 
just take our chances
put<00:01:39.990> them<00:01:40.110> right<00:01:40.290> in<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.740> set<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.460> meat

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
put them right in and set the meat

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.789 
put them right in and set the meat
thermometer<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.329> about<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.540> 130<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.590> then

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
thermometer to about a 130 and then

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.859 
thermometer to about a 130 and then
we're<00:01:44.549> gonna<00:01:44.640> Brown<00:01:44.909> up<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.240> outside<00:01:45.390> but

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
we're gonna Brown up the outside but

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.210 
we're gonna Brown up the outside but
first<00:01:46.170> we<00:01:46.350> just<00:01:46.380> put<00:01:46.649> them<00:01:46.710> right<00:01:46.770> into<00:01:47.070> the

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
first we just put them right into the

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.359 
first we just put them right into the
oven<00:01:47.420> 200<00:01:48.420> degree<00:01:48.630> oven<00:01:49.009> don't<00:01:50.009> know<00:01:50.100> how<00:01:50.220> long

oven 200 degree oven don't know how long

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.710 
oven 200 degree oven don't know how long
it's<00:01:50.520> gonna<00:01:50.610> take<00:01:50.729> just<00:01:51.030> kind<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.270> depend<00:01:51.600> on

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
it's gonna take just kind of depend on

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.289 
it's gonna take just kind of depend on
the<00:01:51.780> temperature<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.350> roast<00:01:53.240> well<00:01:54.240> it

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
remember we crisp it up in a 500-degree

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.520 
remember we crisp it up in a 500-degree
oven<00:03:04.800> after<00:03:05.190> slow<00:03:05.970> roasting<00:03:06.420> into<00:03:06.599> 200<00:03:07.110> the

temperature on the thermometer had

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.149 
temperature on the thermometer had
stabilized<00:03:09.420> at<00:03:09.599> about<00:03:09.780> 140<00:03:10.440> which<00:03:10.590> is<00:03:10.739> exactly

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
stabilized at about 140 which is exactly

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:12.740 
stabilized at about 140 which is exactly
where<00:03:11.340> I<00:03:11.370> want<00:03:11.610> it<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:11.700> be<00:03:11.909> so<00:03:12.300> let's<00:03:12.420> go<00:03:12.540> take<00:03:12.720> a

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
where I want it to be so let's go take a
