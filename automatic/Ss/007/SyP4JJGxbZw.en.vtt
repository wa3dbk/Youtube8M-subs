original position to change it with the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.880 
original position to change it with the
second<00:00:56.910> gear<00:00:57.089> what<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.690> would<00:00:57.899> do<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.530> we<00:00:58.859> would

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890

were to try go down again then the gear
lever<00:02:06.819> wouldn't<00:02:07.240> move<00:02:07.420> this<00:02:08.140> would<00:02:08.350> ensure

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
lever wouldn't move this would ensure

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.670 
lever wouldn't move this would ensure
that<00:02:09.039> you're<00:02:09.250> in<00:02:09.369> first<00:02:09.670> gear<00:02:10.319> however<00:02:11.319> if<00:02:11.530> you

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
that you're in first gear however if you

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.420 
that you're in first gear however if you
push<00:02:11.890> down<00:02:11.920> gently<00:02:12.580> you<00:02:13.360> go<00:02:13.630> into<00:02:14.110> neutral<00:02:14.560> so

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
push down gently you go into neutral so

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.400 
push down gently you go into neutral so
what<00:02:15.790> we<00:02:15.940> need<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.150> do<00:02:16.390> is<00:02:16.510> push<00:02:16.840> down<00:02:16.870> always

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
what we need to do is push down always

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.479 
what we need to do is push down always
so<00:02:18.069> again<00:02:18.280> look<00:02:18.549> in<00:02:18.880> first<00:02:19.510> gear

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
so again look in first gear

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.250 
so again look in first gear
the<00:02:21.489> next<00:02:21.760> thing<00:02:21.880> to<00:02:21.910> look<00:02:22.030> at<00:02:22.299> is<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:23.049> clutch

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
the next thing to look at is the clutch

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.910 
the next thing to look at is the clutch
later

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
later

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.390 
later
the<00:02:24.519> clutch<00:02:24.730> later<00:02:25.000> is<00:02:25.150> of<00:02:25.329> four<00:02:25.660> uses<00:02:26.400> firstly

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
the clutch later is of four uses firstly

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.550 
the clutch later is of four uses firstly
we<00:02:27.489> will<00:02:27.640> pull<00:02:27.850> the<00:02:27.880> clutch<00:02:28.180> in<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:29.109> go<00:02:29.320> to

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
we will pull the clutch in to go to

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.370 
we will pull the clutch in to go to
select<00:02:29.829> the<00:02:30.489> gear<00:02:30.700> that<00:02:30.940> we<00:02:31.060> want<00:02:31.269> we<00:02:32.019> then<00:02:32.200> use

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
select the gear that we want we then use

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.890 
select the gear that we want we then use
a<00:02:32.410> clutch<00:02:32.769> leave<00:02:33.070> a<00:02:33.190> nice<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:33.640> gently<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.660> pull

a clutch leave a nice and gently to pull

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.250 
a clutch leave a nice and gently to pull
away<00:02:35.459> we'll<00:02:36.459> also<00:02:36.670> use<00:02:36.970> it<00:02:37.120> which<00:02:37.269> lever<00:02:37.570> to<00:02:38.109> do

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
away we'll also use it which lever to do

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.770 
away we'll also use it which lever to do
slow<00:02:38.560> control<00:02:39.070> so<00:02:39.850> while<00:02:40.090> we're<00:02:40.239> going<00:02:40.390> slow

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
slow control so while we're going slow

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.320 
slow control so while we're going slow
moving<00:02:41.109> traffic<00:02:41.380> same<00:02:41.829> class<00:02:42.220> gear

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
close control to control the speed we

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.460 
close control to control the speed we
also<00:02:47.680> need<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.820> clutch<00:02:49.030> lever<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:49.810> aid<00:02:49.990> in<00:02:50.380> the

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
also need the clutch lever to aid in the

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.800 
also need the clutch lever to aid in the
scuba<00:02:50.860> gear<00:02:51.070> change<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:52.000> again<00:02:52.450> as<00:02:52.600> we're

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
scuba gear change and again as we're

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.630 
scuba gear change and again as we're
coding<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.320> stop<00:02:53.650> we<00:02:53.980> would<00:02:54.100> use<00:02:54.310> a<00:02:54.340> clutch

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
coding to stop we would use a clutch

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.700 
coding to stop we would use a clutch
lever<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.540> pull<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:55.930> clips<00:02:56.170> leaves<00:02:56.410> all<00:02:56.680> the

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
lever and pull the clips leaves all the

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.700 
lever and pull the clips leaves all the
way<00:02:56.890> into<00:02:57.070> the<00:02:57.250> handlebar<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:58.510> ensure<00:02:58.960> that

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
way into the handlebar to ensure that

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.200 
way into the handlebar to ensure that
the<00:02:59.950> bike<00:03:00.160> didn't<00:03:00.610> stall<00:03:00.910> and<00:03:01.390> start<00:03:02.970> on<00:03:03.970> the

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
the bike didn't stall and start on the

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.060 
the bike didn't stall and start on the
right-hand<00:03:04.420> side<00:03:04.900> of<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.110> bike<00:03:05.350> we've<00:03:05.830> got

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
right-hand side of the bike we've got

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.430 
right-hand side of the bike we've got
our<00:03:06.160> throw<00:03:06.490> brake<00:03:06.790> and<00:03:07.150> our<00:03:07.510> rear<00:03:07.750> brake<00:03:08.080> and

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
our throw brake and our rear brake and

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.040 
our throw brake and our rear brake and
we've<00:03:08.860> also<00:03:09.070> got<00:03:09.520> our<00:03:09.700> throttle<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:11.020> throttle

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
we've also got our throttle the throttle

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.160 
we've also got our throttle the throttle
is<00:03:11.530> spring-loaded<00:03:12.540> don't<00:03:13.540> rely<00:03:13.900> on<00:03:13.930> the

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
is spring-loaded don't rely on the

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.320 
is spring-loaded don't rely on the
spring-loaded<00:03:14.620> action<00:03:15.280> to<00:03:15.670> turn<00:03:15.880> the<00:03:16.060> power

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
spring-loaded action to turn the power

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.660 
spring-loaded action to turn the power
so<00:03:17.140> what<00:03:17.320> we<00:03:17.500> do<00:03:17.710> is<00:03:17.890> we<00:03:18.070> hold<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.460> throttle

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
so what we do is we hold the throttle

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.390 
so what we do is we hold the throttle
gently<00:03:19.210> with<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.390> right<00:03:19.660> hand<00:03:19.960> we<00:03:20.230> then<00:03:20.860> open

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
gently with the right hand we then open

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.550 
gently with the right hand we then open
the<00:03:21.520> throttle<00:03:21.760> generally<00:03:22.450> towards<00:03:22.959> us<00:03:23.080> to

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
the throttle generally towards us to

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.560 
the throttle generally towards us to
increase<00:03:23.980> speed<00:03:24.310> and<00:03:24.640> then<00:03:25.150> we<00:03:25.270> turn<00:03:25.540> the

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
increase speed and then we turn the

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.620 
increase speed and then we turn the
throttle<00:03:25.959> positively<00:03:26.920> away<00:03:27.240> to<00:03:28.240> turn<00:03:28.480> the

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
throttle positively away to turn the

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.190 
throttle positively away to turn the
power<00:03:28.870> off<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:30.370> throne<00:03:30.670> brake<00:03:30.940> is<00:03:31.150> used<00:03:31.480> when

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
power off the throne brake is used when

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.050 
power off the throne brake is used when
the<00:03:32.320> bike<00:03:32.530> is<00:03:32.560> in<00:03:32.740> an<00:03:32.950> upright<00:03:33.310> position<00:03:33.370> and

traveling in a straight line we'll never

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.360 
traveling in a straight line we'll never
ever<00:03:37.180> use<00:03:37.510> the<00:03:37.720> front<00:03:38.020> brake<00:03:38.130> while<00:03:39.130> we

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
ever use the front brake while we

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.760 
ever use the front brake while we
cornering<00:03:40.000> or<00:03:40.270> while<00:03:40.630> a<00:03:40.660> steering<00:03:41.320> is<00:03:41.410> terms

however<00:04:08.659> the<00:04:08.930> real<00:04:09.200> bread<00:04:09.530> would<00:04:09.709> be<00:04:09.889> used

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:10.129 
however the real bread would be used
