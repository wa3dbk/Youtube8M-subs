and the reason for the success was of

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.520 
and the reason for the success was of
course<00:03:59.750> the<00:03:59.870> loops<00:04:01.180> for<00:04:02.180> Ventus<00:04:02.660> lovers<00:04:03.080> who

think<00:04:12.020> if<00:04:12.590> you<00:04:12.770> change<00:04:13.220> the<00:04:13.459> Twitter's<00:04:13.970> if<00:04:14.150> I

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
think if you change the Twitter's if I

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.300 
think if you change the Twitter's if I
own<00:04:14.780> this<00:04:15.140> because<00:04:15.530> I<00:04:15.709> would<00:04:15.950> keep<00:04:16.130> it

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
own this because I would keep it

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.390 
own this because I would keep it
original<00:04:16.549> but<00:04:16.970> if<00:04:17.470> if<00:04:18.470> the<00:04:18.799> Twitter's<00:04:19.190> are

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
original but if if the Twitter's are

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.940 
original but if if the Twitter's are
down<00:04:19.810> because<00:04:20.810> that's<00:04:21.049> the<00:04:21.200> weak<00:04:21.410> point<00:04:21.709> from

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
down because that's the weak point from

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:27.010 
down because that's the weak point from
these<00:04:22.130> speakers<00:04:23.200> well<00:04:24.200> it's<00:04:24.880> if<00:04:25.880> you<00:04:26.630> change

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
these speakers well it's if you change

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.940 
these speakers well it's if you change
those<00:04:27.229> tweeters<00:04:27.770> in<00:04:27.800> in<00:04:28.310> modern

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
those tweeters in in modern

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.280 
those tweeters in in modern
Twitter's<00:04:29.400> well<00:04:29.700> I<00:04:29.850> think<00:04:29.970> the<00:04:30.510> sound<00:04:30.780> will<00:04:31.080> be

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
Twitter's well I think the sound will be

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.560 
Twitter's well I think the sound will be
very<00:04:31.770> very<00:04:32.070> good<00:04:32.370> and<00:04:34.130> well<00:04:35.130> I<00:04:35.400> just<00:04:36.000> checked

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
very very good and well I just checked

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.140 
very very good and well I just checked
the<00:04:36.660> thing<00:04:36.960> out<00:04:37.170> it's<00:04:37.560> big<00:04:37.950> and<00:04:38.130> heavy<00:04:38.430> but<00:04:38.880> it

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
the thing out it's big and heavy but it

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.360 
the thing out it's big and heavy but it
looks<00:04:39.510> more<00:04:39.810> heavy<00:04:40.110> than<00:04:40.230> it<00:04:40.440> is<00:04:40.710> it's<00:04:40.980> not

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
looks more heavy than it is it's not

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.810 
looks more heavy than it is it's not
even<00:04:41.790> 10<00:04:42.060> kilogram<00:04:42.750> its<00:04:43.380> I<00:04:43.590> think<00:04:43.890> 9<00:04:44.160> 9<00:04:44.460> half

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
even 10 kilogram its I think 9 9 half

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.430 
even 10 kilogram its I think 9 9 half
and<00:04:46.550> compare<00:04:47.550> it<00:04:47.670> to<00:04:47.880> my<00:04:48.030> magnet<00:04:48.540> oh<00:04:48.570> look

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
and compare it to my magnet oh look

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.440 
and compare it to my magnet oh look
smaller

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
smaller

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.870 
smaller
so<00:04:51.450> let's<00:04:51.780> impress<00:04:52.260> it<00:04:52.470> but<00:04:52.710> my<00:04:52.980> MA<00:04:53.250> not<00:04:53.490> await

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
so let's impress it but my MA not await

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.460 
so let's impress it but my MA not await
about<00:04:54.710> 17<00:04:55.710> kilos<00:04:56.220> so<00:04:56.550> it's<00:04:57.390> more<00:04:57.930> massive

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
about 17 kilos so it's more massive

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.720 
about 17 kilos so it's more massive
building<00:04:59.010> quality<00:04:59.910> and<00:05:00.620> that<00:05:01.620> I<00:05:01.650> think<00:05:02.400> the

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
building quality and that I think the

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.940 
building quality and that I think the
difference<00:05:03.210> between<00:05:03.570> these<00:05:03.990> two<00:05:04.290> speakers<00:05:04.590> I

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
difference between these two speakers I

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.830 
difference between these two speakers I
think<00:05:05.310> the<00:05:05.490> wood<00:05:05.670> is<00:05:06.030> also<00:05:06.630> not<00:05:06.900> that<00:05:07.170> thick<00:05:08.840> no

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
think the wood is also not that thick no

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.550 
think the wood is also not that thick no
it's<00:05:10.080> not<00:05:10.290> that

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
it's not that

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.560 
it's not that
take<00:05:10.890> it<00:05:11.040> but<00:05:11.280> for<00:05:12.260> 1974<00:05:13.260> speaker<00:05:14.180> this<00:05:15.180> thing

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
take it but for 1974 speaker this thing

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.840 
take it but for 1974 speaker this thing
was<00:05:15.750> pretty<00:05:16.080> heavy<00:05:16.440> and<00:05:16.860> I<00:05:17.130> remember<00:05:17.610> when<00:05:17.730> I

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
was pretty heavy and I remember when I

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.470 
was pretty heavy and I remember when I
was<00:05:18.000> 13<00:05:18.540> years<00:05:18.570> old<00:05:19.040> or<00:05:20.040> 15<00:05:20.700> years<00:05:21.000> old<00:05:21.210> all

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480 
was 13 years old or 15 years old all
