00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
hi I'm Sheena with there and today we're

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.410 
hi I'm Sheena with there and today we're
going<00:00:05.250> to<00:00:05.339> be<00:00:05.460> talking<00:00:05.670> about<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:06.060> features

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
going to be talking about the features

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.200 
going to be talking about the features
of<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.870> new<00:00:06.899> air<00:00:07.290> saber<00:00:07.830> tooth<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:09.000> saber

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
of the new air saber tooth the saber

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.759 
of the new air saber tooth the saber
tooth<00:00:09.300> is<00:00:09.630> approximately<00:00:10.290> twelve<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.740> half

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
tooth is approximately twelve and a half

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.860 
tooth is approximately twelve and a half
feet<00:00:11.099> long<00:00:11.160> which<00:00:11.519> makes<00:00:11.759> it<00:00:11.910> optimal<00:00:12.450> for<00:00:12.630> one

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
feet long which makes it optimal for one

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.690 
feet long which makes it optimal for one
to<00:00:13.019> two<00:00:13.200> people<00:00:13.440> twelve<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.400> half<00:00:14.429> feet

to two people twelve and a half feet

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.730 
to two people twelve and a half feet
also<00:00:14.880> makes<00:00:15.150> it<00:00:15.240> great<00:00:15.570> for<00:00:15.809> taking<00:00:15.990> on<00:00:16.230> burly

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
also makes it great for taking on burly
