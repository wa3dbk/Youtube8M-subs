in fact these two products or brother

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.980 
in fact these two products or brother
and<00:00:48.990> sisters<00:00:49.410> that's<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.340> point<00:00:50.520> i<00:00:50.880> will<00:00:51.750> show

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:51.990 
and sisters that's the point i will show

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.610 
and sisters that's the point i will show
maybe<00:00:52.140> after<00:00:52.470> this<00:00:52.650> one<00:00:52.860> but<00:00:53.930> so<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.200> this<00:00:55.380> one

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
maybe after this one but so in this one

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.050 
maybe after this one but so in this one
we<00:00:55.770> focus<00:00:56.070> more<00:00:56.220> on<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.550> size<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.880> the<00:00:57.000> screen

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.060 
we focus more on the size of the screen

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.350 
we focus more on the size of the screen
and<00:00:57.450> we<00:00:58.079> have<00:00:58.170> embedded<00:00:58.350> some<00:00:58.739> application

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
and we have embedded some application

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.600 
and we have embedded some application
first<00:01:00.360> open<00:01:00.690> we<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.989> calculator<00:01:01.610> which

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
first open we have the calculator which

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.399 
first open we have the calculator which
help<00:01:02.880> you<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.180> calculate<00:01:03.480> everything<00:01:04.049> for

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
help you to calculate everything for

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.880 
help you to calculate everything for
example<00:01:04.799> if<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.040> want<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.369> see<00:01:05.549> 4<00:01:05.909> plus<00:01:06.620> 4<00:01:07.620> and

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
example if I want to see 4 plus 4 and

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.740 
example if I want to see 4 plus 4 and
give<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:08.940> the<00:01:09.060> results<00:01:09.590> if<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.770> want<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.159> do<00:01:11.340> for

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
give you the results if I want to do for

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.520 
give you the results if I want to do for
example<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:13.430> it's<00:01:14.430> working<00:01:14.640> well<00:01:15.530> anyone

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
example this it's working well anyone

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.560 
example this it's working well anyone
you<00:01:16.740> can<00:01:16.890> make<00:01:17.159> some<00:01:17.370> equation<00:01:17.880> for<00:01:18.360> short

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
you can make some equation for short

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.050 
you can make some equation for short
that's<00:01:18.780> cool<00:01:18.990> then<00:01:19.620> is<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.370> special<00:01:20.729> Apple

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
that's cool then is that a special Apple

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.390 
that's cool then is that a special Apple
yeah<00:01:21.270> it's<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.420> special<00:01:21.690> I<00:01:21.750> coming<00:01:21.960> from<00:01:22.080> us

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
yeah it's a special I coming from us

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.890 
yeah it's a special I coming from us
exactly<00:01:23.400> then<00:01:24.120> we<00:01:24.540> have<00:01:24.630> an<00:01:24.750> application

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
exactly then we have an application

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.770 
exactly then we have an application
dedicated<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:26.010> make<00:01:26.700> scrapbook<00:01:27.180> for<00:01:27.360> example

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
dedicated to make scrapbook for example

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.090 
dedicated to make scrapbook for example
to<00:01:28.080> make<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:29.220> make<00:01:29.340> your<00:01:29.490> own<00:01:29.700> journal<00:01:30.650> so<00:01:31.650> we

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
to make to make your own journal so we

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.680 
to make to make your own journal so we
have<00:01:32.460> it's<00:01:32.850> here<00:01:33.750> scored<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.860> scribe<00:01:35.100> notes

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
have it's here scored the scribe notes

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.210 
have it's here scored the scribe notes
so<00:01:36.690> in<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.110> application

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
so in this application

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.660 
so in this application
you<00:01:39.880> can<00:01:40.120> make

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.310 

some<00:01:43.330> and<00:01:43.540> writing<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.909> can<00:01:46.119> put<00:01:46.420> some<00:01:46.960> colors
