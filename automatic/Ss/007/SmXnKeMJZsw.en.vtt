00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.970
 android on your pc 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.790
 so first of all you need a 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.740
 software called virtualbox that 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.039
 you can find on google typing 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.289
 virtualbox or indirectly you need 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.240
 also by the way game will give the link 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.880
 in the description and you need 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.470

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.359
 which I will also give in descriptions 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.250
 so once you all go to us 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.250
 install 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:38.480
 virtualbox so you have to install yourself 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:44.239

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.939
 less time in difference from the 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.850
 place that put me this is so I 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:23.820
