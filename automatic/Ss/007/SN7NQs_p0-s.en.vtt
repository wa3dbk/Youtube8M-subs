 hello good to all what is as it is and 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.910
 I bring you some new masters and runes 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.980
 You thought that you had left already 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.690
 section so we do not go back with the more 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.240
 cold and runes that many of you 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.160
 They help us to many of you 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.900
 help to improve to be better with 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.699
 such a good character today we are going to 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.170
 speak a little bit of and now on the top 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.520
 because we get to the event because 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.680
 is already becoming very famous is is 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.359
 doing putting a lot of fashion and I 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.820
 I would like to show you a little bit how 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.349
 is this character in the topic of the roll 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.179
 I plan to make a guide but good 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.439
 receive the summer it will be done everything not me 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.120
 you speak please tell you one more 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.789
 three and runes good 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.290
 to what was going as you see we have 21 attack 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:38.399
 and 9 defense I have this here so that what 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.540
 you see but in truth there is nothing or 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.579
 is that nothing happens like watching 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.860
 here nothing happens he is we have it 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.160
 deactivated here nothing happens and good 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.449
 we started I will comment now as is 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.769
 we have a double-edged sword point 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.170
 to make two points of damage 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.699
 additional and receive only one damage 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.649
 additional this is fine because another 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.839
 ball we will do 2% damage 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.760
 additional for five seconds I think 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:00.870
 that those five blows or I do not remember anymore 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.059
 which is a possible 10 additional damage 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.830
 migration make us anything we put 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.380
 three points in witchcraft because if now 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.810
 they are based pretty good it goes away if you do not 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.490
 base is worth it because it is configured we have 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.720
 that learn to use it pretty well 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.369
 his abilities what will come will be the 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.440
 counter s stay the button and is with 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.090
 Moss hit double damage the 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.710
 attack speed and the jump for that 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.179
 it's witchcraft is going very well to have what 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.860
 as soon as possible the jump as soon as possible 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:24.659
 counter and so we what 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.460
 we will achieve will be better online 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.350
 If we are going to use it well, I prefer 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.360
 much earlier witchcraft than fury because 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.750
 total what gives fury gives you half 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.910
 half fervor I think I do not know 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.470
 then butcher and feast to form in 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.050
 the low levels with a little more than 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.730
 ease nothing since we are we are amx l 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.860
 since we were approaching to kill a bug 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.140
 well at least give us some life 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.060
 more than anything and well, here we start 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.620
 in the part of life is to say a 3 in 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.600
 brute force and a martial mastery and 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.610
 how much we have more damage and here we have 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.020
 the executor and one in dangerous play with 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.760
 we will be more damage to the enemy when 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.410
 is below 50% of life 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.910
 It stretches very well if it took care of chilo 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.500
 we take with our last one that is to say 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.360
 when we do our last and you 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.430
 we go down in life to the enemy because 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.810
 we can do a lot of damage to a game 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.550
 dangerous for when we kill enemy 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.869
 recover us life and good lord of the 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.310
 wars of damage devastating blows 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.989
 what new provision of armor and 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.330
 havoc that gives us additional damage 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.880
 by defense very quickly 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.890
 Block unlockable to deny damage 2 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.020
 in recovery to have regeneration 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.610
 of life 3 in scars l petrano for 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.230
 more life and one in beastly watering for 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.530
 even more life I will give life 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.670
 good mortar by runes like 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.160
 we have here we are seeing here 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.830
 we have red penetration of 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.959
 yellow armor armor blue 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.580
 magic resistance 12 fifth essences of 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.750
 Theft of life and one of damage attack are 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.340
 enough standard 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.470
 to a character who is going to do 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.210
 damage to d so nothing guys this is the 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.530
 march and now I hope that I have 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.490
