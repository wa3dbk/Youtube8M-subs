that's super important with a fishing

you're standing in the middle of a river

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.700 
you're standing in the middle of a river
all<00:00:32.160> day<00:00:32.270> casting<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.360> nine<00:00:33.809> foot<00:00:33.840> pole<00:00:34.410> back

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
all day casting a nine foot pole back

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.080 
all day casting a nine foot pole back
and<00:00:34.890> forth<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.340> light<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.640> rod<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:35.969> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
and forth the light of the rod is the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.520 
and forth the light of the rod is the
longer<00:00:36.390> you'll<00:00:36.510> able<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.750> fish<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.140> also<00:00:37.410> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
longer you'll able to fish and also the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.750 
longer you'll able to fish and also the
lighter<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.040> more<00:00:38.190> delicate<00:00:38.399> it's

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
lighter it is the more delicate it's

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.619 
lighter it is the more delicate it's
going<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.000> be<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.239> you're<00:00:39.360> going<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.540> be<00:00:39.600> able

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
going to be so you're going to be able

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.959 
going to be so you're going to be able
to<00:00:39.780> feel<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.440> fish<00:00:41.040> on<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.430> line<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.640> little<00:00:41.760> bit

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
to feel a fish on the line a little bit

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.580 
to feel a fish on the line a little bit
easier<00:00:42.270> than<00:00:42.510> if<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.719> was<00:00:42.840> something<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.440> was

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
easier than if it was something that was

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.979 
easier than if it was something that was
harder<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:43.950> stiffer<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.270> rod<00:00:45.450> manages

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
harder and stiffer so this rod manages

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.959 
harder and stiffer so this rod manages
to<00:00:46.110> have<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.530> backbone<00:00:47.250> enough<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.610> cast<00:00:47.789> a

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
to have the backbone enough to cast a

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.060 
to have the backbone enough to cast a
really<00:00:48.210> far<00:00:48.390> line<00:00:48.600> but<00:00:49.079> it's<00:00:49.200> also<00:00:49.379> light<00:00:49.860> and

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
really far line but it's also light and

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.650 
really far line but it's also light and
flexible<00:00:50.190> enough<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.820> can<00:00:50.910> really<00:00:51.180> feel

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
flexible enough that you can really feel

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.970 
flexible enough that you can really feel
the<00:00:51.690> fish<00:00:52.230> hits<00:00:52.910> so<00:00:53.910> light<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:54.780> I'm<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
the fish hits so light so I'm in the

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.619 
the fish hits so light so I'm in the
Golden<00:00:56.250> Gate<00:00:56.340> casting<00:00:56.760> ponds<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.210> we're<00:00:57.539> here

really good i really like it it's got a

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.429 
really good i really like it it's got a
great<00:01:34.049> 28<00:01:34.530> millimeter<00:01:34.890> wide<00:01:35.310> angle<00:01:35.670> lens<00:01:35.850> and

great 28 millimeter wide angle lens and

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.440 
great 28 millimeter wide angle lens and
takes<00:01:37.439> pictures<00:01:37.740> relatively<00:01:38.189> snappily<00:01:38.640> one

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
takes pictures relatively snappily one

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.760 
takes pictures relatively snappily one
problem<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.049> takes<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.290> little<00:01:40.380> bit<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.560> time

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
problem is it takes a little bit of time

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.230 
problem is it takes a little bit of time
to<00:01:40.950> turn<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.250> on<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.700> if<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.880> think<00:01:42.119> your

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
to turn it on so if you think your

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.850 
to turn it on so if you think your
buddy's<00:01:42.479> going<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.689> catch<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.960> fish<00:01:43.140> keep<00:01:43.710> the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
buddy's going to catch a fish keep the

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.380 
buddy's going to catch a fish keep the
camera<00:01:44.220> on<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.640> gets<00:01:44.790> pretty<00:01:44.909> good<00:01:45.149> battery

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
camera on it gets pretty good battery

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.429 
camera on it gets pretty good battery
life<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.689> it's<00:01:45.780> not<00:01:45.869> really<00:01:45.930> much<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.259> a

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
life so it's not really much of a

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.749 
life so it's not really much of a
problem<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:47.250> interesting<00:01:47.579> thing<00:01:47.640> about

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
problem the interesting thing about

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.609 
problem the interesting thing about
fishes<00:01:48.180> at<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.360> territorial<00:01:48.930> they<00:01:49.079> camp<00:01:49.470> out

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
fishes at the territorial they camp out

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.410 
fishes at the territorial they camp out
in<00:01:49.680> little<00:01:50.280> spots<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.880> they<00:01:50.970> wait<00:01:51.149> for<00:01:51.180> the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
in little spots and they wait for the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.300 
in little spots and they wait for the
food<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.750> come<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.990> them<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.680> has<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.979> the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
food to come to them and it has the the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.280 
food to come to them and it has the the
right<00:01:53.460> combination<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.149> river<00:01:54.570> flow<00:01:54.899> and

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
right combination of river flow and

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.770 
right combination of river flow and
temperature<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:56.189> food<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.270> if<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.570> have

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
temperature and food and so if you have

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.990 
temperature and food and so if you have
a<00:01:57.869> GPS<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.439> can<00:01:58.560> actually<00:01:58.710> mark<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.700> spot

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
a GPS you can actually mark the spot

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.649 
a GPS you can actually mark the spot
where<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.450> fish<00:02:01.159> bested<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:03.360> then

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
where that fish bested you and and then

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:04.760 
where that fish bested you and and then
you<00:02:03.719> can<00:02:03.840> come<00:02:03.960> back<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.560> need<00:02:04.740> a

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
you can come back to it so you need a

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.730 
you can come back to it so you need a
GPS<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.610> can<00:02:05.759> do<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.000> Garmin's<00:02:06.750> new<00:02:07.079> Oregon

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
GPS that can do that Garmin's new Oregon

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.559 
GPS that can do that Garmin's new Oregon
400<00:02:08.340> T<00:02:08.459> is<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.700> really<00:02:09.000> good<00:02:09.149> candidate<00:02:09.509> for

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
400 T is a really good candidate for

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.550 
400 T is a really good candidate for
that<00:02:09.780> because<00:02:09.899> it's<00:02:10.140> waterproof<00:02:10.520> in<00:02:11.520> case<00:02:11.819> the

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
that because it's waterproof in case the

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.229 
that because it's waterproof in case the
fish<00:02:12.680> pulls<00:02:13.250> you<00:02:13.310> into<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.550> water<00:02:13.700> or<00:02:13.940> you're

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
fish pulls you into the water or you're

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.660 
fish pulls you into the water or you're
just<00:02:14.270> a<00:02:14.480> klutz<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:15.040> it's<00:02:16.040> got<00:02:16.190> a<00:02:16.220> really<00:02:16.489> nice

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
allow you to mark a waypoint so you

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.059 
allow you to mark a waypoint so you

couple years where they've been taking

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.890 
couple years where they've been taking
products<00:02:55.489> off<00:02:55.670> of<00:02:56.090> their<00:02:56.269> multi<00:02:56.569> tools<00:02:56.750> which
