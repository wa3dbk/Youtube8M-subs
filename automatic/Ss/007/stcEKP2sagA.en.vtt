but without further ado let's get right
on<00:00:32.550> into<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:33.079> so<00:00:34.079> first<00:00:34.320> off<00:00:34.590> just<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.550> brief

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
on into it so first off just a brief

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.500 
on into it so first off just a brief
overview<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.840> beats<00:00:37.399> basically

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
overview of the beats basically

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.030 
overview of the beats basically
everybody<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:40.110> i<00:00:40.140> know<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.440> us<00:00:40.739> heard<00:00:40.950> of

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
everybody that i know of us heard of

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.220 
everybody that i know of us heard of
these<00:00:41.180> you<00:00:42.180> could<00:00:42.300> probably<00:00:42.480> ask<00:00:42.719> somebody

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
these you could probably ask somebody

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.479 
these you could probably ask somebody
you<00:00:43.379> know<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.829> they<00:00:43.920> might<00:00:44.100> have<00:00:44.250> heard<00:00:44.430> of

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
you know and they might have heard of

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.490 
you know and they might have heard of
these<00:00:44.610> probably<00:00:45.360> because<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.780> name<00:00:46.020> the

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
these probably because of the name the

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.860 
these probably because of the name the
design<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:47.579> kind<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.879> thing<00:00:48.059> it's<00:00:48.480> i<00:00:48.690> guess

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
design that kind of thing it's i guess

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.479 
design that kind of thing it's i guess
just<00:00:49.020> like<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.200> coach<00:00:49.410> purse<00:00:49.440> or<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.250> kind<00:00:50.460> of

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
just like a coach purse or that kind of

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.439 
just like a coach purse or that kind of
thing<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.730> guess<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.500> so<00:00:52.500> overall<00:00:53.180> most<00:00:54.180> people

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
thing I guess and so overall most people

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.420 
thing I guess and so overall most people
front<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.750> these<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.199> that's<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.800> reason<00:00:55.949> for

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
front of these and that's the reason for

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.910 
front of these and that's the reason for
is<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.670> design<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.360> think<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:58.109> don't<00:00:58.500> know<00:00:58.559> what<00:00:58.859> do

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
is a design I think I don't know what do

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.799 
is a design I think I don't know what do
you<00:00:59.039> guys<00:00:59.190> think<00:00:59.250> but<00:01:00.090> as<00:01:00.149> far<00:01:00.300> as<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.600> design

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
you guys think but as far as the design

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.110 
you guys think but as far as the design
goes<00:01:01.050> these<00:01:01.320> are<00:01:01.559> pretty<00:01:01.859> nice<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.399> have<00:01:02.969> the

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
goes these are pretty nice I have the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.820 
goes these are pretty nice I have the
gray<00:01:03.300> model<00:01:03.719> or<00:01:03.899> silver<00:01:04.350> whatever<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.680> call

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
it as you can see here and if you're

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.630 
it as you can see here and if you're
wondering<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.830> got<00:01:07.979> these<00:01:08.100> from<00:01:08.250> bestbuy

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
wondering I got these from bestbuy

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.770 
wondering I got these from bestbuy
meeting<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.180> they<00:01:09.330> are<00:01:09.479> one<00:01:09.689> hundred

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
meeting that they are one hundred

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.469 
meeting that they are one hundred
percent<00:01:09.960> real<00:01:10.380> but<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.820> outside<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.360> do

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
percent real but on the outside you do

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.539 
percent real but on the outside you do
have<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.659> semi-gloss<00:01:13.170> finish<00:01:13.530> which<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.189> kind

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
have a semi-gloss finish which is kind

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.190 
have a semi-gloss finish which is kind
of<00:01:14.580> nice<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.970> on<00:01:15.090> my<00:01:15.240> particular<00:01:15.720> model<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
of nice and on my particular model the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.910 
of nice and on my particular model the
model<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:17.630> earcups<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:19.080> matte<00:01:19.320> finish<00:01:19.350> so

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
model the earcups is a matte finish so

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.210 
model the earcups is a matte finish so
that's<00:01:20.880> pretty<00:01:21.270> much<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.720> for<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.320> design<00:01:22.710> now

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
that's pretty much it for the design now

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.039 
that's pretty much it for the design now
as<00:01:23.310> far<00:01:23.490> as<00:01:23.549> their<00:01:23.850> ability<00:01:24.240> goes<00:01:24.420> these<00:01:24.780> are

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
as far as their ability goes these are

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.140 
as far as their ability goes these are
pretty<00:01:25.590> durable<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.100> flexible<00:01:26.159> making<00:01:27.000> them

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
pretty durable and flexible making them

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.609 
pretty durable and flexible making them
more<00:01:27.330> comfortable<00:01:27.540> on<00:01:27.930> your<00:01:27.960> head<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.259> mean<00:01:28.500> you

more comfortable on your head I mean you

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.429 
more comfortable on your head I mean you

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
can drop them stretch on whatever shake

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.780 
can drop them stretch on whatever shake
them<00:01:31.590> i<00:01:31.680> don't<00:01:31.710> know<00:01:31.920> it's<00:01:32.490> going<00:01:32.700> to

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
them i don't know it's going to

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.219 
them i don't know it's going to
basically<00:01:32.909> hold<00:01:33.570> up<00:01:33.750> from<00:01:33.960> what<00:01:34.079> I've<00:01:34.200> seen

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
basically hold up from what I've seen

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.560 
basically hold up from what I've seen
and<00:01:34.619> from<00:01:35.280> my<00:01:35.460> experience<00:01:35.490> they<00:01:36.119> have<00:01:36.240> hold<00:01:36.450> up

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
and from my experience they have hold up

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.480 
and from my experience they have hold up

I will have a link in the description of
someone<00:01:38.640> who<00:01:38.790> does<00:01:38.939> do<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> full<00:01:39.390> test<00:01:39.630> it's

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
someone who does do a full test it's

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.289 
someone who does do a full test it's
being<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.560> flexibility<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.460> comfort<00:01:41.909> I

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
being the flexibility and comfort I

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.929 
being the flexibility and comfort I
guess<00:01:42.509> these<00:01:43.170> do<00:01:43.530> have<00:01:43.799> little<00:01:44.430> adjusters

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
guess these do have little adjusters

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.060 
guess these do have little adjusters
like<00:01:45.240> most<00:01:45.479> headphones<00:01:45.869> have<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.470> they<00:01:47.009> do

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
like most headphones have and they do

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.399 
like most headphones have and they do
adjust<00:01:47.490> pre<00:01:47.820> smooth<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.420> what<00:01:48.930> that<00:01:49.079> added

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
adjust pre smooth and what that added

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.440 
adjust pre smooth and what that added
flexibility<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.220> plastic<00:01:50.820> design<00:01:50.970> it

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
flexibility of the plastic design it

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.359 
flexibility of the plastic design it
does<00:01:52.020> make<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.380> feel<00:01:52.409> pretty<00:01:52.920> good<00:01:53.100> on<00:01:53.220> your

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
does make it feel pretty good on your

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.660 
does make it feel pretty good on your
head<00:01:53.579> as<00:01:54.090> far<00:01:54.270> as<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.659> cushions<00:01:55.079> go<00:01:55.399> they<00:01:56.399> are

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
head as far as the cushions go they are

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.749 
head as far as the cushions go they are
also<00:01:57.180> very<00:01:57.659> nice<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.500> can<00:01:59.159> wear<00:01:59.369> these<00:01:59.520> for<00:01:59.670> an

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
also very nice I can wear these for an

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.910 
also very nice I can wear these for an
extended<00:02:00.119> period<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.450> time<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.960> think<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
extended period of time I think the

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.280 
extended period of time I think the
longest<00:02:02.250> I've<00:02:02.340> over<00:02:02.610> warum<00:02:03.000> was<00:02:03.360> like<00:02:03.659> two<00:02:04.079> or

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
longest I've over warum was like two or

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.219 
longest I've over warum was like two or
three<00:02:04.680> hours<00:02:05.299> also<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:06.329> fall<00:02:06.630> asleep<00:02:06.659> in<00:02:07.110> them

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
three hours also I fall asleep in them

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.350 
three hours also I fall asleep in them
before<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.829> I've<00:02:08.250> never<00:02:08.310> had<00:02:08.879> problems<00:02:09.270> with

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
before and I've never had problems with

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.910 
before and I've never had problems with
this<00:02:09.509> comfort<00:02:09.929> they're<00:02:10.140> never<00:02:10.349> tight<00:02:10.709> on<00:02:10.830> my

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
this comfort they're never tight on my

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.250 
this comfort they're never tight on my
head<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.400> just<00:02:12.239> think<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.450> these<00:02:12.629> are<00:02:12.840> overall

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
head I just think that these are overall

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.550 
head I just think that these are overall
there

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
there

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.140 
there
comfortable<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.220> like<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.370> said<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:14.700> added

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
comfortable and like I said that added

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.300 
comfortable and like I said that added
flexibility<00:02:16.110> does<00:02:16.410> make<00:02:16.709> it<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.040> fits

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
flexibility does make it so it fits

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.420 
flexibility does make it so it fits
heads<00:02:17.790> I<00:02:18.030> guess<00:02:18.209> a<00:02:18.390> bit<00:02:18.420> better<00:02:18.870> now<00:02:19.709> one<00:02:20.190> got<00:02:20.400> a

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
heads I guess a bit better now one got a

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.850 
heads I guess a bit better now one got a
downside<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.209> this<00:02:21.330> particular<00:02:21.930> headphone<00:02:22.650> is

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
downside to this particular headphone is

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.170 
downside to this particular headphone is
that<00:02:23.340> they<00:02:23.459> take<00:02:23.610> batteries<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:25.370> these<00:02:26.370> two

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
that they take batteries and these two

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.640 
that they take batteries and these two
take<00:02:27.480> as<00:02:27.720> you<00:02:27.810> can<00:02:27.930> see<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.260> triple-a

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
take as you can see to triple-a

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.280 
take as you can see to triple-a
batteries<00:02:29.099> the<00:02:29.849> bad<00:02:30.090> thing<00:02:30.120> about<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.720> is<00:02:30.870> is

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
batteries the bad thing about that is is

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.290 
batteries the bad thing about that is is
that<00:02:31.880> occasionally<00:02:32.880> you're<00:02:33.030> going<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.209> have

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
that occasionally you're going to have

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.640 
that occasionally you're going to have
to<00:02:33.390> replace<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.810> batteries<00:02:34.110> now<00:02:34.290> if<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:34.530> just

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
to replace the batteries now if you just

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.350 
to replace the batteries now if you just
got<00:02:34.830> rechargeable<00:02:35.430> batteries<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:35.940> kind<00:02:36.209> of

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
got rechargeable batteries that kind of

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.080 
got rechargeable batteries that kind of
fix<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.110> problem<00:02:37.530> but<00:02:38.190> it<00:02:38.670> is<00:02:38.880> kind<00:02:39.060> of

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
fix the problem but it is kind of

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.699 
fix the problem but it is kind of
annoying<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.660> have<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.810> replace<00:02:40.110> batteries<00:02:40.590> I

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
annoying to have to replace batteries I

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.160 
annoying to have to replace batteries I
never<00:02:40.980> had<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.400> replace<00:02:41.670> some<00:02:41.940> more<00:02:42.720> than<00:02:42.989> like

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
never had to replace some more than like

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.440 
never had to replace some more than like
a<00:02:43.380> two<00:02:43.739> or<00:02:44.250> three<00:02:44.550> times<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.940> a<00:02:44.970> pattern<00:02:45.180> for<00:02:45.420> a

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
a two or three times and a pattern for a

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.350 
a two or three times and a pattern for a
couple<00:02:45.810> of<00:02:45.840> months<00:02:45.930> now<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.640> so<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:48.090> battery

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
couple of months now and so the battery

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.120 
couple of months now and so the battery
life<00:02:48.480> is<00:02:48.540> pretty<00:02:48.810> good<00:02:49.049> and<00:02:49.319> this<00:02:49.590> will<00:02:49.709> switch

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
life is pretty good and this will switch

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.530 
life is pretty good and this will switch
right<00:02:50.310> here<00:02:50.459> is<00:02:50.549> what<00:02:50.670> turns<00:02:50.819> them<00:02:50.970> on<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.390> off

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
right here is what turns them on and off

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.750 
right here is what turns them on and off
as<00:02:51.810> you<00:02:52.410> can<00:02:52.500> see<00:02:52.650> has<00:02:52.799> a<00:02:52.830> little<00:02:53.040> red<00:02:53.160> what<00:02:53.400> red

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
as you can see has a little red what red

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.059 
as you can see has a little red what red
light<00:02:54.090> which<00:02:54.390> basically<00:02:54.690> means<00:02:54.959> that<00:02:55.170> it<00:02:55.680> is

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
light which basically means that it is

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.089 
light which basically means that it is
ready<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:56.819> go<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.269> that<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:58.049> battery<00:02:58.410> is<00:02:58.440> okay

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
ready to go and that the battery is okay

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.770 
ready to go and that the battery is okay
and<00:02:59.340> when<00:02:59.670> it<00:02:59.730> turns<00:02:59.910> orange<00:03:00.299> that<00:03:00.480> basically

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
and when it turns orange that basically

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.170 
and when it turns orange that basically
means<00:03:01.080> that<00:03:01.349> it's<00:03:01.680> about<00:03:02.069> to<00:03:02.250> die<00:03:02.400> it<00:03:02.880> also<00:03:03.030> has

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
means that it's about to die it also has

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.430 
means that it's about to die it also has
a<00:03:03.269> mute<00:03:03.420> button<00:03:03.450> for<00:03:03.750> if<00:03:04.019> somebody's<00:03:04.319> talking

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
to you can just press that and it mutes

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.900 
to you can just press that and it mutes

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
that kind of thing and basically the

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.750 
that kind of thing and basically the
cable<00:03:33.630> overall<00:03:34.109> is<00:03:34.410> a<00:03:34.440> really<00:03:34.829> nice<00:03:35.010> quality

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
cable overall is a really nice quality

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.599 
cable overall is a really nice quality
it's<00:03:36.060> monster<00:03:36.630> cable<00:03:37.130> actually<00:03:38.130> monsters<00:03:38.459> no

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
it's monster cable actually monsters no

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:39.920 
it's monster cable actually monsters no
longer<00:03:38.850> making<00:03:39.060> these<00:03:39.299> I<00:03:39.569> might<00:03:39.750> have<00:03:39.900> a

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
longer making these I might have a

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.599 
longer making these I might have a
separate<00:03:40.230> video<00:03:40.350> of<00:03:40.680> why<00:03:40.859> and<00:03:41.190> that<00:03:41.280> kind<00:03:41.549> of

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
separate video of why and that kind of

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.059 
separate video of why and that kind of
thing<00:03:41.700> but<00:03:42.389> the<00:03:42.930> quality<00:03:43.440> of<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.739> cable<00:03:44.010> is

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
thing but the quality of the cable is

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:45.289 
thing but the quality of the cable is
quite<00:03:44.250> nice<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.579> as<00:03:44.700> you<00:03:44.760> can<00:03:44.880> see<00:03:44.910> at<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.209> end

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
quite nice and as you can see at the end

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.009 
quite nice and as you can see at the end
it<00:03:45.690> has<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:46.230> el<00:03:46.980> jack<00:03:47.400> which<00:03:48.120> is<00:03:48.329> also<00:03:48.780> nice<00:03:48.959> for

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
it has a el jack which is also nice for

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:51.289 
it has a el jack which is also nice for
I<00:03:49.709> guess<00:03:50.250> putting<00:03:50.639> it<00:03:50.730> into<00:03:50.819> your<00:03:50.970> phone<00:03:51.120> which

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
I guess putting it into your phone which

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.520 
I guess putting it into your phone which
basically<00:03:51.540> means<00:03:51.750> it's<00:03:51.930> not<00:03:51.989> going<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.350> break

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
basically means it's not going to break

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.860 
basically means it's not going to break
also<00:03:53.220> as<00:03:53.280> you<00:03:53.340> can<00:03:53.489> see<00:03:53.609> they<00:03:53.790> fold<00:03:54.030> up<00:03:54.209> quite

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
also as you can see they fold up quite

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.599 
also as you can see they fold up quite
easily<00:03:55.019> to<00:03:55.319> make<00:03:55.470> them<00:03:55.590> very<00:03:55.859> portable<00:03:56.310> and

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
easily to make them very portable and

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.610 
easily to make them very portable and
speaking<00:03:57.329> of<00:03:57.420> portability<00:03:58.049> it<00:03:58.170> comes<00:03:58.380> with<00:03:58.560> a

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
speaking of portability it comes with a

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.949 
speaking of portability it comes with a
case<00:03:58.859> so<00:03:59.639> basically<00:04:00.120> once<00:04:00.299> they<00:04:00.510> fold<00:04:00.780> it<00:04:00.870> up

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
case so basically once they fold it up

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.870 
case so basically once they fold it up
you<00:04:01.109> can<00:04:01.230> put<00:04:01.440> them<00:04:01.560> in<00:04:01.709> this<00:04:01.829> case<00:04:01.889> and<00:04:02.400> travel

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
you can put them in this case and travel

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.759 
you can put them in this case and travel
with<00:04:03.030> them<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.750> case<00:04:03.959> is<00:04:04.079> made<00:04:04.200> off<00:04:04.380> kind<00:04:04.620> of<00:04:04.680> a

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
with them the case is made off kind of a

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.620 
with them the case is made off kind of a
rubbery<00:04:05.190> material<00:04:05.340> I<00:04:06.000> really<00:04:06.299> don't<00:04:06.359> know<00:04:06.450> how

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
rubbery material I really don't know how

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.240 
rubbery material I really don't know how
to<00:04:06.660> describe<00:04:06.780> it<00:04:07.079> beyond<00:04:07.440> that<00:04:07.709> but<00:04:07.950> it<00:04:08.069> does

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
to describe it beyond that but it does

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.110 
to describe it beyond that but it does
feel<00:04:08.459> pretty<00:04:08.489> solid<00:04:09.000> and<00:04:09.560> I<00:04:10.819> like<00:04:11.819> I<00:04:11.940> said

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
feel pretty solid and I like I said

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.890 
feel pretty solid and I like I said
never<00:04:12.450> had<00:04:12.630> any<00:04:12.780> problems<00:04:13.170> with<00:04:13.260> this<00:04:13.620> case

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
never had any problems with this case

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.240 
never had any problems with this case
kind<00:04:15.900> of<00:04:15.989> zips<00:04:16.200> out<00:04:16.350> like<00:04:16.530> a<00:04:16.560> clamshell<00:04:16.919> design

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
kind of zips out like a clamshell design

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.520 
kind of zips out like a clamshell design
and<00:04:17.729> also<00:04:18.180> right<00:04:18.539> here<00:04:18.750> you<00:04:18.840> have<00:04:18.870> a<00:04:19.019> clip<00:04:19.350> or

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
and also right here you have a clip or

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.409 
and also right here you have a clip or
carabiner<00:04:19.979> whatever<00:04:20.340> you<00:04:20.430> call<00:04:20.579> it<00:04:20.609> basically

carabiner whatever you call it basically

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:22.490 
carabiner whatever you call it basically
this<00:04:21.599> is<00:04:21.750> for<00:04:21.900> clipping<00:04:22.109> it<00:04:22.260> onto<00:04:22.440> your

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500

and overall muffle the sound and kind of

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.320 
and overall muffle the sound and kind of
ruin<00:06:16.199> it<00:06:16.349> that's<00:06:16.889> kind<00:06:17.099> of<00:06:17.159> a<00:06:17.250> downside<00:06:17.699> well

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
ruin it that's kind of a downside well

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.050 
ruin it that's kind of a downside well
actually<00:06:18.419> a<00:06:18.630> huge<00:06:18.930> downside<00:06:19.490> so<00:06:20.490> I<00:06:20.520> would<00:06:20.880> not

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
actually a huge downside so I would not

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.760 
actually a huge downside so I would not
recommend<00:06:21.180> paying<00:06:21.690> three<00:06:22.139> hundred<00:06:22.440> dollars

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
recommend paying three hundred dollars

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.870 
recommend paying three hundred dollars
just<00:06:23.039> for<00:06:23.159> the<00:06:24.800> sound<00:06:25.800> because<00:06:26.280> that<00:06:26.669> is

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
just for the sound because that is

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.180 
just for the sound because that is
definitely<00:06:27.360> not<00:06:27.659> worth<00:06:28.110> it<00:06:28.319> what<00:06:29.069> you're

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.190 
definitely not worth it what you're

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.709 
definitely not worth it what you're
paying<00:06:29.430> for<00:06:29.639> three<00:06:29.940> hundred<00:06:30.030> dollars<00:06:30.509> is

00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:30.719 
paying for three hundred dollars is

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:33.350 
paying for three hundred dollars is
basically<00:06:31.560> that<00:06:31.590> it<00:06:31.919> looks<00:06:32.130> name<00:06:32.639> designed

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
basically that it looks name designed

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.969 
basically that it looks name designed
that<00:06:33.719> kind<00:06:33.900> of<00:06:33.930> thing<00:06:34.080> which<00:06:34.229> i<00:06:34.380> said<00:06:34.710> earlier

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 
that kind of thing which i said earlier

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:38.329 
that kind of thing which i said earlier
in<00:06:35.250> the<00:06:35.370> video<00:06:35.990> so<00:06:36.990> if<00:06:37.469> someone<00:06:37.889> were<00:06:38.099> to<00:06:38.190> ask

00:06:38.329 --> 00:06:38.339 
in the video so if someone were to ask

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:39.010 
in the video so if someone were to ask
me

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.020 
me

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.270 
me
in<00:06:39.139> a<00:06:39.349> quick<00:06:39.650> second<00:06:40.220> what<00:06:40.910> the<00:06:42.280> basically

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 
in a quick second what the basically

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.140 
in a quick second what the basically
what<00:06:43.430> I<00:06:43.460> thought<00:06:43.639> about<00:06:43.819> the<00:06:43.940> beats

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.150 
what I thought about the beats

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:45.909 
what I thought about the beats
headphones<00:06:44.539> I<00:06:44.780> would<00:06:45.080> say<00:06:45.229> they're<00:06:45.410> okay<00:06:45.680> I

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 
headphones I would say they're okay I

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:48.339 
headphones I would say they're okay I
don't<00:06:46.550> think<00:06:46.610> I<00:06:47.090> definitely<00:06:47.960> don't<00:06:48.110> think

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:48.349 
don't think I definitely don't think

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:49.809 
don't think I definitely don't think
that<00:06:48.620> you<00:06:48.710> should<00:06:48.740> pay<00:06:49.039> three<00:06:49.550> hundred

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:49.819 
that you should pay three hundred

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:51.610 
that you should pay three hundred
dollars<00:06:50.060> for<00:06:50.330> them<00:06:50.419> and<00:06:50.629> there's<00:06:51.289> really<00:06:51.440> no

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.620 
dollars for them and there's really no

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.670 
dollars for them and there's really no
other<00:06:51.860> alternative<00:06:52.819> because<00:06:53.080> basically<00:06:54.080> any

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 
other alternative because basically any

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.409 
other alternative because basically any
other<00:06:54.949> cheap<00:06:55.250> ones<00:06:55.490> are<00:06:55.729> most<00:06:56.060> likely<00:06:56.330> going

00:06:56.409 --> 00:06:56.419 
other cheap ones are most likely going

00:06:56.419 --> 00:06:57.969 
other cheap ones are most likely going
to<00:06:56.569> be<00:06:56.629> fake<00:06:56.930> because<00:06:57.199> there<00:06:57.409> are<00:06:57.590> a<00:06:57.620> lot<00:06:57.949> of

00:06:57.969 --> 00:06:57.979 
to be fake because there are a lot of

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:00.399 
to be fake because there are a lot of
fix<00:06:58.340> going<00:06:58.580> out<00:06:58.849> here<00:06:59.120> a<00:06:59.270> lot<00:07:00.080> of<00:07:00.199> fakes<00:07:00.409> out

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:00.409 
fix going out here a lot of fakes out

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:02.230 
fix going out here a lot of fakes out
there<00:07:00.620> these<00:07:00.919> headphones<00:07:01.129> now<00:07:01.460> I<00:07:01.729> bet<00:07:02.090> you'd

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 
there these headphones now I bet you'd

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.850 
there these headphones now I bet you'd
is<00:07:02.330> probably<00:07:02.569> more<00:07:02.720> fakes<00:07:03.080> of<00:07:03.259> reals<00:07:03.590> out

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:03.860 
is probably more fakes of reals out

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.510 
is probably more fakes of reals out
there<00:07:04.039> honestly<00:07:04.400> so<00:07:05.330> I<00:07:06.190> would<00:07:07.190> not<00:07:07.370> recommend

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 
there honestly so I would not recommend

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.219 
there honestly so I would not recommend
these<00:07:07.970> unless<00:07:08.330> you're<00:07:08.539> going<00:07:08.690> for<00:07:08.810> a<00:07:09.020> pure

00:07:09.219 --> 00:07:09.229 
these unless you're going for a pure

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:12.189 
these unless you're going for a pure
design<00:07:09.590> so<00:07:10.370> that's<00:07:11.330> basically<00:07:11.539> it<00:07:11.870> for<00:07:11.960> this

00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:12.199 
design so that's basically it for this

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:13.629 
design so that's basically it for this
video<00:07:12.380> if<00:07:12.680> you<00:07:12.770> like<00:07:12.949> this<00:07:13.099> kind<00:07:13.280> of<00:07:13.370> concept
