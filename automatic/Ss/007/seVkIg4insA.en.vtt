go this is a Ziegler facial exerciser

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.889 
go this is a Ziegler facial exerciser
from<00:00:05.750> 1966

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
from 1966

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.129 
from 1966
these<00:00:07.290> are<00:00:07.500> electrodes<00:00:08.160> I<00:00:08.519> have<00:00:09.360> put<00:00:09.690> some

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
these are electrodes I have put some

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.589 
these are electrodes I have put some
electro-conductive<00:00:10.920> gel<00:00:11.070> on<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:11.940> little

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
electro-conductive gel on the little

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.400 
electro-conductive gel on the little
metal<00:00:13.080> pieces<00:00:14.870> and<00:00:17.930> this<00:00:18.930> is<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.230> on/off

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
metal pieces and this is the on/off

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.000 
metal pieces and this is the on/off
switch<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:20.250> it<00:00:20.550> goes<00:00:20.760> from<00:00:21.029> low<00:00:21.810> all<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.890> way

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
switch and it goes from low all the way

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.250 
switch and it goes from low all the way
to<00:00:23.180> totally<00:00:24.180> high<00:00:24.449> which<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.109> like

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
to totally high which is like

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.500 
to totally high which is like
electrocution<00:00:26.160> so<00:00:26.760> I'm<00:00:26.880> going<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.060> start<00:00:27.390> it

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
electrocution so I'm going to start it

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.250 
electrocution so I'm going to start it
on<00:00:27.689> low<00:00:27.750> right<00:00:28.710> now<00:00:28.740> just<00:00:29.429> on<00:00:29.699> my<00:00:30.510> cheek<00:00:30.900> I
