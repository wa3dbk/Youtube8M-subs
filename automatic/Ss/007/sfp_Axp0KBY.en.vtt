update takes will depend on the size of

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.309 
update takes will depend on the size of
the<00:02:40.590> update<00:02:41.209> but<00:02:42.209> it<00:02:42.390> generally<00:02:42.720> takes<00:02:42.900> a<00:02:43.110> few

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
the update but it generally takes a few

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:44.479 
the update but it generally takes a few
minutes<00:02:43.500> should<00:02:43.800> have<00:02:43.920> ice<00:02:44.040> will<00:02:44.250> actually

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
minutes should have ice will actually

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.600 
minutes should have ice will actually
power<00:02:44.760> down<00:02:45.000> as<00:02:45.300> we're<00:02:46.080> seeing<00:02:46.260> now<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:47.430> will

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
power down as we're seeing now it will

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.300 
power down as we're seeing now it will
reboot<00:02:48.390> itself<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:49.260> you'll<00:02:49.680> generally<00:02:50.100> get<00:02:50.280> a

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
reboot itself and you'll generally get a

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.100 
reboot itself and you'll generally get a
little<00:02:50.640> Android<00:02:51.000> figure<00:02:51.420> come<00:02:51.630> up<00:02:51.750> on<00:02:51.930> screen

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
little Android figure come up on screen

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.759 
little Android figure come up on screen
and<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.500> loading<00:02:52.950> bar<00:02:53.840> here<00:02:54.840> we<00:02:54.900> go<00:02:55.080> so<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:55.680> can

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
and a loading bar here we go so you can

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.040 
and a loading bar here we go so you can
see<00:02:56.010> it's<00:02:56.209> installing<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.330> system<00:02:57.690> update

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
see it's installing the system update

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.710 
see it's installing the system update
and<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.350> gives<00:02:58.500> you<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.620> little<00:02:58.769> percentage<00:02:59.720> as

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
and it gives you a little percentage as

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.690 
and it gives you a little percentage as
to<00:03:00.870> how<00:03:01.019> well<00:03:01.290> it's<00:03:01.709> going<00:03:02.040> so<00:03:02.400> this<00:03:02.580> is

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
to how well it's going so this is

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.060 
to how well it's going so this is
actually<00:03:03.000> going<00:03:03.150> reasonably<00:03:04.050> quickly<00:03:04.320> but

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
actually going reasonably quickly but

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.370 
actually going reasonably quickly but
sometimes<00:03:05.489> it<00:03:05.760> can<00:03:05.940> take<00:03:06.380> considerably

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
sometimes it can take considerably

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.009 
sometimes it can take considerably
longer<00:03:07.790> depending<00:03:08.790> again<00:03:08.970> on<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.570> size<00:03:09.840> of

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
longer depending again on the size of

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.990 
longer depending again on the size of
the<00:03:10.080> updates<00:03:10.470> so<00:03:11.190> this<00:03:11.340> is<00:03:11.489> just<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.790> stability

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
the updates so this is just a stability

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.830 
the updates so this is just a stability
update<00:03:12.630> so<00:03:12.870> it's<00:03:12.989> likely<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:14.040> take<00:03:14.250> less<00:03:14.760> time

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
update so it's likely to take less time

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:31.000 
update so it's likely to take less time
so<00:03:15.840> if<00:03:15.930> we<00:03:16.019> just<00:03:16.200> let<00:03:16.410> that<00:03:16.530> run<00:03:16.830> through

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.890 

and<00:03:31.550> it<00:03:31.670> is<00:03:31.760> important<00:03:32.269> to<00:03:32.390> note<00:03:32.569> that<00:03:32.599> whilst

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
and it is important to note that whilst

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.880 
and it is important to note that whilst
is<00:03:33.110> doing<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:33.650> update<00:03:34.269> don't<00:03:35.269> touch<00:03:35.540> it<00:03:35.810> just

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
is doing the update don't touch it just

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.280 
is doing the update don't touch it just
let<00:03:36.890> it<00:03:37.010> get<00:03:37.159> on<00:03:37.280> with<00:03:37.489> it<00:03:37.519> if<00:03:37.819> it<00:03:38.030> freezes<00:03:38.720> or

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
let it get on with it if it freezes or

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.229 
let it get on with it if it freezes or
something<00:03:39.799> like<00:03:40.010> that<00:03:40.280> you<00:03:40.760> don't<00:03:40.819> get<00:03:41.060> any

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
something like that you don't get any

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.000 
something like that you don't get any
response<00:03:41.659> to<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:41.810> device<00:03:42.080> for<00:03:42.440> considerable

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
response to the device for considerable

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.800 
response to the device for considerable
amount<00:03:43.190> of<00:03:43.220> time<00:03:43.280> then<00:03:44.209> you<00:03:44.420> need<00:03:44.540> to<00:03:44.659> take

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
amount of time then you need to take

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.600 
amount of time then you need to take
further<00:03:45.049> action<00:03:45.440> and<00:03:45.590> speak<00:03:45.769> to<00:03:45.920> Samsung<00:03:46.370> but

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
further action and speak to Samsung but

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.789 
further action and speak to Samsung but
if<00:03:47.239> it<00:03:47.480> seems<00:03:47.930> to<00:03:48.019> be<00:03:48.080> taking<00:03:48.379> a<00:03:48.440> while<00:03:48.560> just

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
if it seems to be taking a while just

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.500 
if it seems to be taking a while just
just<00:03:49.069> leave<00:03:49.250> it<00:03:49.489> the<00:03:49.700> best<00:03:49.910> thing<00:03:50.120> you<00:03:50.209> can<00:03:50.330> do

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
just leave it the best thing you can do

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.150 
just leave it the best thing you can do

then is connected to mains power to

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.130 
then is connected to mains power to

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
ensure the battery doesn't run out it's

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.680 
ensure the battery doesn't run out it's
got<00:03:54.290> sufficient<00:03:54.650> power<00:03:55.010> to<00:03:55.190> to<00:03:55.640> keep<00:03:55.849> the

got sufficient power to to keep the
update<00:03:57.140> going<00:03:57.730> but<00:03:58.730> better<00:03:58.940> still<00:03:59.329> is<00:03:59.480> to<00:03:59.599> make

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
update going but better still is to make

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.660 
update going but better still is to make
