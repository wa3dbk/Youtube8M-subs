00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
out and it locks out so you can't start

your car and in order to fix that you
they<00:00:37.440> have<00:00:37.850> three<00:00:38.850> options<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.390> can<00:00:39.510> either

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
they have three options you can either

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.370 
they have three options you can either
buy<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.870> used<00:00:40.500> terminal<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.490> the<00:00:42.480> entire<00:00:42.870> cable

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
buy a used terminal and the entire cable

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.170 
buy a used terminal and the entire cable
which<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:44.010> lot<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.250> mechanics<00:00:44.610> will<00:00:44.730> recommend

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
which a lot of mechanics will recommend

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.690 
which a lot of mechanics will recommend
because<00:00:45.630> the<00:00:46.140> recommend<00:00:46.500> X<00:00:46.980> don't<00:00:47.190> know<00:00:47.460> that

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
because the recommend X don't know that

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.430 
because the recommend X don't know that
there's<00:00:47.880> a<00:00:47.970> way<00:00:48.150> around<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.750> which<00:00:49.320> I'm

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
there's a way around that which I'm

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.780 
there's a way around that which I'm

going to show you today how did how to

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.610 
going to show you today how did how to
do<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.120> with<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.300> use<00:00:51.510> terminal<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.110> they're

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
do that with a use terminal and they're

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.200

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
would like to keep cables original so

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.149 
would like to keep cables original so
let's<00:01:27.420> get<00:01:27.570> started<00:01:27.930> here<00:01:28.110> for<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.650> first<00:01:28.950> you

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
let's get started here for so first you

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.160 
let's get started here for so first you
got<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.549> when<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.240> receive<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> unit<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.049> might

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
got to when you receive a unit it might

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.090 
got to when you receive a unit it might
look<00:01:31.320> like<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:31.680> might<00:01:31.890> look<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.070> little

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
look like this might look a little

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.340 
look like this might look a little
different<00:01:32.310> if<00:01:32.670> it's<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:33.030> x5<00:01:33.330> or<00:01:33.510> if<00:01:33.869> it's<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.080> z4

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.620 
different if it's in x5 or if it's a z4
they<00:01:35.250> have<00:01:35.400> different<00:01:35.729> terminal<00:01:36.119> leads<00:01:36.330> a

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
they have different terminal leads a

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.600 
they have different terminal leads a
some<00:01:37.320> take<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> 90<00:01:37.710> degree<00:01:37.979> turn<00:01:38.010> some<00:01:38.490> are

nice and green and beige when they're

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.069 
nice and green and beige when they're
deployed<00:03:50.500> it's<00:03:50.799> all<00:03:51.010> black<00:03:51.449> from<00:03:52.449> being<00:03:52.750> burnt

part away pretty much get the cabled end

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:04.080 
part away pretty much get the cabled end
that's<00:04:02.650> on<00:04:02.769> your<00:04:02.949> car<00:04:03.189> it<00:04:03.639> should<00:04:03.669> already<00:04:03.970> be
