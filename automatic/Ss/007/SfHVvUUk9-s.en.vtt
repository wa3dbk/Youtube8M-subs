00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 How about friends of youtube my 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.660
 name is jorge mendoza a pleasure to be 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.120
 with you again in a videotutorial 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.370
 more guitar and this time 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.030
 let's see in a simple way how 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.390
 to touch pillows of joseph jose 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.690
 we are going to need the following chords 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.690
 D minor 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.560
 sun 7 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.560
 the least 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.650
 I repeat re minor ' 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.690
 They are seven thousand friends 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.810
 If you need to stop in any of the 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.420
 chords you can pause the video and watch with 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.580
 careful the correct placement and what 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.480
 you will see in the diagrams that I am 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:50.300
 putting of the chords so as not to 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.100
 explain you finger by finger but I already 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.890
 I guess you already know some chords 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.980
 basic and it is simply to put you 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.020
 there the diagram for here to be 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.140
 more faster 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.479
 and more cash 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.330
 for the introduction you are going to use the 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.900
 D minor 27 and the minor 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.900
 in this way 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.570
 and more 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.329
 now how to do this arpeggio to do 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:31.890
 the trapeze what what you owe with the 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:33.659
 first it's bass bass from the accordion and 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.470
 after 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.020
 third rope 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.640
 next second and first rope 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.409
 together 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.719
 doing bass with thumb 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.799
 with the index touching the third string 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:53.609
 and with medium and annular together these 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:57.399
 playing the second and the first string 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:59.310
 respectively then we go third 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.760
 rope 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:07.300
 2nd and 1st meetings 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:10.830
 I repeat under the third string 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:16.560
 second and first rope 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:20.610
 then the intro would obviously be 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:24.490
 after it finished this one there 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:30.390
 repeat several times is to repeat 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:34.630
 here I am doing one two three times 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:39.670
 it can be more if you want it so 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:42.670
 do the bass and repeat repeats is this 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.670
 or 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.950
 the introduction 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.690
 for the verses you are going to use 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.690
 exactly the same chords 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.790
 I do not know 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.790
 s 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:12.260
 will light then re minor ' 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:15.500
 are 7 and the lowest are the three chords 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.739
 basic that you are going to use for this 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.739
 song 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.280
 I repeat then 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.030
 nothing 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.030
 for 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.819
 you continue with the verses in those same 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.970
 three chords the three chords there is a 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:47.180
 part that I could say is a bridge 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:50.530
 a variant that will go 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.530
 that goes to my greatest 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.360
 which is in the part that goes before the 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.360
 chorus 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.739
 nothing more 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.850
 you will be the least 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.590
 after seven 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:18.540
 then in that part but everything happens already 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.980
 not going up 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.980
 or the words 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:27.670
 ah 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.670
 and the figure 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:33.940
 up there will be the preparation for what 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:37.030
 what is the refrain 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.310
 then we have already got the intro the 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.550
 chords we already have the Spanish also 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.330
 of the verses and the part that goes before 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.990
 of the chorus 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:50.460
 if you need to go back to the video or pause 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:53.460
 where you need it 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:57.800
 then comes chorus for the 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.800
 chorus you're going to use these chords 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:09.430
 from highest to lowest 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:17.300
 then this 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.960
 in the radio you do it this way 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:25.419
 down 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:27.729
 down then 3 up and 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:32.470
 you close as down then 2 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:34.100
 down 3 up earth is 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:40.430
 as not down 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:42.710
 down down up and the last one was 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.570
