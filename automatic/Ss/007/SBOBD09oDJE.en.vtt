any year i think there's a possibility
at<00:04:24.450> least<00:04:24.480> that<00:04:24.690> it<00:04:24.870> might<00:04:25.020> be<00:04:25.170> more<00:04:25.320> exciting

at least that it might be more exciting
the<00:04:26.310> 20th<00:04:26.730> team<00:04:26.910> in<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.060> league<00:04:27.210> has<00:04:27.450> a<00:04:27.480> lower

the 20th team in the league has a lower

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.690 
the 20th team in the league has a lower
tax<00:04:27.960> people<00:04:28.350> personally<00:04:29.010> because<00:04:29.400> it<00:04:29.550> makes

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
tax people personally because it makes

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.130 
tax people personally because it makes
it<00:04:29.820> even<00:04:29.940> more<00:04:30.120> exciting<00:04:30.300> than<00:04:30.690> they<00:04:30.810> do<00:04:30.870> in

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
it even more exciting than they do in

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.870 
it even more exciting than they do in
the<00:04:31.320> same<00:04:31.530> way<00:04:31.770> that<00:04:31.950> in<00:04:32.100> high<00:04:32.250> scoring<00:04:32.550> sports

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
the same way that in high scoring sports

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.510 
the same way that in high scoring sports
like<00:04:33.060> basketball<00:04:33.290> the<00:04:34.290> following<00:04:34.590> is<00:04:34.830> not

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
like basketball the following is not

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.310 
like basketball the following is not

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
have the low scoring sport right because

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.880 
have the low scoring sport right because
the<00:04:39.270> goal<00:04:39.510> is<00:04:39.720> so<00:04:39.840> important<00:04:40.350> because<00:04:40.530> the

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
the goal is so important because the

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.470 
the goal is so important because the
gold<00:04:41.160> means<00:04:41.400> that<00:04:41.610> you've<00:04:41.730> celebrating<00:04:42.300> all

it's worth some inequality abilities and
I<00:05:48.270> wonder<00:05:48.600> if<00:05:48.720> in<00:05:48.930> a<00:05:49.200> landscape<00:05:49.560> where<00:05:49.830> TV
