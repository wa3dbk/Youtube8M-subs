00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
and that's really fun piece because

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.920 
and that's really fun piece because
we're<00:02:28.250> sort<00:02:28.430> of<00:02:28.490> doing<00:02:28.790> some<00:02:29.150> transitioning

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
we're sort of doing some transitioning

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.710

between<00:02:30.020> you<00:02:30.830> know<00:02:30.950> being<00:02:31.370> there<00:02:32.090> and<00:02:32.330> going

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
between you know being there and going

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.810 
between you know being there and going
invisible<00:02:32.990> so<00:02:33.410> I<00:02:33.440> think<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.400> way<00:02:34.550> that<00:02:34.580> the

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
invisible so I think the way that the

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.880 
invisible so I think the way that the
artwork<00:02:35.060> works<00:02:35.450> I<00:02:35.690> think<00:02:36.470> we're<00:02:36.620> going<00:02:36.740> to<00:02:36.800> be

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
artwork works I think we're going to be

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.050 
artwork works I think we're going to be
able<00:02:36.950> to<00:02:37.070> interpret<00:02:37.310> it<00:02:37.520> in<00:02:37.610> a<00:02:37.670> really<00:02:37.850> good

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
able to interpret it in a really good

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.990 
able to interpret it in a really good
way<00:02:38.209> and<00:02:39.310> another<00:02:40.310> piece<00:02:40.580> that<00:02:40.640> we've<00:02:40.880> been

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
way and another piece that we've been

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.790 
way and another piece that we've been
working<00:02:41.060> our<00:02:41.480> way<00:02:41.540> for<00:02:41.870> some<00:02:42.110> time<00:02:42.380> is<00:02:42.740> a

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
working our way for some time is a

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.710 
working our way for some time is a
daredevil<00:02:43.220> Comiket<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.209> daredevil<00:02:44.630> as<00:02:44.690> a

character is one of sideshows favorites

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.490 
character is one of sideshows favorites
and<00:02:46.910> we've<00:02:47.030> always<00:02:47.360> been<00:02:47.660> sort<00:02:47.990> of<00:02:48.050> back<00:02:48.350> and

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
and we've always been sort of back and

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.199 
and we've always been sort of back and
forth<00:02:48.560> on<00:02:48.890> what<00:02:49.160> kind<00:02:49.310> of<00:02:49.459> pose<00:02:49.670> and<00:02:49.940> what<00:02:50.060> kind

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
forth on what kind of pose and what kind

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:51.730 
forth on what kind of pose and what kind
of<00:02:50.240> attitude<00:02:50.390> to<00:02:50.660> give<00:02:50.900> him<00:02:51.020> literally<00:02:51.590> been

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
of attitude to give him literally been

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.380 
of attitude to give him literally been
kind<00:02:51.950> of<00:02:52.010> struggling<00:02:52.400> with<00:02:52.760> how<00:02:52.880> we<00:02:52.940> wanted<00:02:53.300> to

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
kind of struggling with how we wanted to

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.760 
kind of struggling with how we wanted to
interpret<00:02:53.870> this<00:02:53.959> character<00:02:54.380> I<00:02:54.410> think<00:02:54.680> we

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
interpret this character I think we

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.980 
interpret this character I think we
found<00:02:54.950> a<00:02:55.250> nice<00:02:55.820> way<00:02:56.150> to<00:02:56.180> kind<00:02:56.450> of<00:02:56.570> get<00:02:56.840> that

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
found a nice way to kind of get that

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.110 
found a nice way to kind of get that
sense<00:02:57.320> that<00:02:57.530> he's<00:02:57.740> crouching<00:02:58.310> over<00:02:58.610> something

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
sense that he's crouching over something

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.000 
sense that he's crouching over something
but<00:02:59.150> also<00:02:59.480> a<00:02:59.630> base<00:03:00.200> element<00:03:00.680> that<00:03:00.800> kind<00:03:00.950> of

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
but also a base element that kind of

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.890 
but also a base element that kind of
draws<00:03:01.220> in<00:03:01.400> a<00:03:01.490> little<00:03:01.730> bit<00:03:01.850> of<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.180> story<00:03:02.540> of

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900
