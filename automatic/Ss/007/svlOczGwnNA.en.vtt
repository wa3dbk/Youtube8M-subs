00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.450
 how are we working well what 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.960
 most important in these moments where 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.160
 one is about 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.350
 to accumulate work for 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.520
 four months no championship 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.350
 four and a half months 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.390
 and then 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.780
 the additions that we have made 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.650
 last night is done in say in posts 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.169
 precise 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.470
 to incorporate let's say more players in 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.900
 where maybe 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.840
 'We needed and to raise this is 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.060
 well I think we're satisfied with the 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.580
 work that we are doing 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.930
 waiting logically good to pass 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.390
 the days to start the matches 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.890
 friendly 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.899
 carlos as good afternoon two 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.309
 consultations one the first in the 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.280
 football practices that we have been able to see 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.290
 there is some tactical modification with 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.720
 about what it was last year 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.000
 I ask if you want that to be the 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.339
 operation is towards tactics in what 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.310
 that comes from the competition and if it is 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.610
 liking this new tactic and we are 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.440
 trying to get used to, let's see 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.440
 if we can adopt it 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.830
 I think we had a style 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.190
 of game that maybe we did not protect ourselves 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.790
 so much thinking about the arch of 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:30.360
 opposite as it has to be but good 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.040
 we'll see if this is not a system 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.370
 I can not contribute what we said 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.800
 us that of playing well and winning 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.920
 is working well comes from an injury 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.630
 important because it was a pretty tear 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.240
 important 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.009
 is working well I do not want to rush 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.630
 what I do and I do not want him to hurry 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.729
 neither because the cravings that 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.369
 what the soccer player can have is 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.140
 who wants to anticipate the times and 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:03.400
 anticipate the times 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.580
 from experience sometimes it takes us 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.619
 to have much more serious consequences 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.660
 that's why I prefer that román follow 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.380
 working for that there are players that 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.970
 stoppages before getting to have an injury 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.530
 as they said he was injured 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.930
 Claudio Perez and Claudio Perez was not 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.870
 injured they wanted to have one already but not 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.390
 matter not yet do not have any 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.880
 ledesma son says to Football 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.110
 He is preferring to rest not to 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.670
 forget that when we do soccer 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.290
 you believe in the moment you do not 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.560
 football the player thinks he's 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.200
 injured and it's not like that sometimes has a 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.580
 very large load of physical labor and what 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.730
 that I'm less interested that maybe 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.100
 do these 45 or 60 or 70 minutes 80 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.840
 football minutes we can do is 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.920
 much more important that accumulates the 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.660
 background work of resistance that such 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.780
 After what can give a party 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.310
 training for that 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.660
 do a tactical work we are going to 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.000
 acceptable and a little soccer 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.010
 also and then there will be some that 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.190
 they were outside but well I think that 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.460
 I'm looking for more about all that 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.350
 reach 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:12.840
 to be as physically as possible 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.500
 above all and then good to try that 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.690
 we adopt nothing we have to the system of 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.970
 game we hope to find a performance 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.650
 positive from the start not only 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.740
 we have to think that we have to be 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.550
 candidates 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:30.340
 and above all what 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.320
 we play the liberators cup always 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.700
 I say the team playing cup 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.510
 liberators 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.520
 The more you spend laps is a burden is 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.620
 We have lived a very important load 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.750
 many times we who prevented us from 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.460
 come out champion we come to be like 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.100
 had the second third but for the 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.650
 liberating cups then if the 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.740
 Argentine teams are passing rounds and 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.010
 that does what 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.510
 the championship will be hard we 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.300
 we have to try to take advantage of that 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.980
 situation both us and rival that 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.680
 we are two teams that we play in the 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.410
 liberators cup and that by custom 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.480
 we should be candidates and we 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.790
 we have to prove to ourselves that we are 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.770
 able as I am in my case to follow 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.690
 directing to mouth juniors and the 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.780
 players are showing they deserve 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:22.260
 be in the mouth juniors this is so I 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.090
 I have to be sure that in our country 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.250
 I always say arséne wenger to do 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.640
 10 years that does not win anything 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.130
 and I had decorate in now and says no 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.660
 they never told me to leave I never 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.820
 agrees that 10 years ago in the last 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.460
 title here what happens that they repeat it 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.230
 you just constantly carlos 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.540
 they asked about the physical state of juan 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.310
 roman riquelme I ask how I 'm going to 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.320
 fernando gago and if at the same time 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.630
 knowing that it will be an intense semester 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.520
 for the world cup has some care 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.320
 special knowing that the world 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.320
 of Brazil in the next semester 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.009
 I think that the most known is 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.499
 fernando 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:06.789
 and the best way to reach a world 

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:10.099
 is playing and playing at the best level 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:11.539
 because if you take too much care of yourself 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:14.149
 final will not ever be at 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:16.819
 better level not only football 

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:19.169
 but physical and the world must be 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:20.849
 well one month nothing more 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.370
 there are seven games that you have to be 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:25.889
 well and fernando is a player who is very 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.169
 generous that is very technical but also 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:31.020
 is very generous in the physical dismissal that 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:34.800
 sometimes we think that the technicians the 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.270
 technical players give us that plus but 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.819
 fernando very generous in the study 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.529
 physical then the best way to 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:44.099
 get to him to get to the world cup goes to 

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:47.060
 to have a championship like again 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:47.060
 He did not have it for a long time
