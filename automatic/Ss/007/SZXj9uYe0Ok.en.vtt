00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.670 

okay<00:00:14.270> the<00:00:14.450> first<00:00:14.720> thing<00:00:14.930> you<00:00:15.020> need<00:00:15.200> to<00:00:15.230> hook<00:00:15.470> up

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
okay the first thing you need to hook up

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.340 
okay the first thing you need to hook up
is<00:00:16.190> the<00:00:16.580> red<00:00:16.850> wire<00:00:17.119> with<00:00:17.390> the<00:00:17.510> green<00:00:17.840> trace

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
is the red wire with the green trace

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.269 
is the red wire with the green trace
this<00:00:18.860> is<00:00:19.010> a<00:00:19.040> positive<00:00:19.610> power<00:00:20.230> that<00:00:21.279> the

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
this is a positive power that the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.740 
this is a positive power that the
controller<00:00:22.760> uses<00:00:23.950> the<00:00:25.000> white<00:00:26.000> wire<00:00:26.330> with<00:00:26.630> the

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
controller uses the white wire with the

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.100 
controller uses the white wire with the
red<00:00:26.930> trace<00:00:27.580> sends<00:00:28.580> power<00:00:28.820> to<00:00:29.390> the<00:00:29.510> left<00:00:29.840> hand

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:30.110 
red trace sends power to the left hand

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.790 
red trace sends power to the left hand
headlight<00:00:31.210> the<00:00:32.210> white<00:00:32.720> wire<00:00:33.050> with<00:00:33.350> the<00:00:33.470> blue

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
headlight the white wire with the blue

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.340 
headlight the white wire with the blue
trace<00:00:34.270> sends<00:00:35.270> power<00:00:35.540> to<00:00:35.750> the<00:00:35.870> right<00:00:36.080> hand

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
trace sends power to the right hand

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.740 
trace sends power to the right hand
headlight<00:00:36.739> I<00:00:37.750> just<00:00:38.750> use<00:00:38.989> an<00:00:39.260> old<00:00:39.530> vacuum<00:00:40.750> power

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
headlight I just use an old vacuum power

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.030 
headlight I just use an old vacuum power
cable<00:00:42.230> and<00:00:42.519> just<00:00:43.519> looped<00:00:44.150> it<00:00:44.300> through<00:00:44.570> and<00:00:45.040> run

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
cable and just looped it through and run

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.069 
cable and just looped it through and run
it<00:00:46.190> through<00:00:46.220> where<00:00:46.970> the<00:00:47.120> air<00:00:47.239> con<00:00:47.510> pipes<00:00:47.780> go

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
it through where the air con pipes go

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:57.510 
it through where the air con pipes go
through

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.660 

you

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.170 

a<00:01:00.260> two-way<00:01:01.260> toggle<00:01:01.679> switch<00:01:02.359> with<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:05.180> middle

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
a two-way toggle switch with the middle

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.240 
a two-way toggle switch with the middle
wire<00:01:06.390> going<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.140> middle<00:01:07.619> pole<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
wire going to the middle pole of the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.330 
wire going to the middle pole of the
switch<00:01:08.399> and<00:01:09.320> either<00:01:10.320> side<00:01:10.590> going<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.189> either

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
switch and either side going to either

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.670 
switch and either side going to either
side<00:01:11.700> relating<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.930> headlight<00:01:13.259> on<00:01:13.500> the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
side relating to the headlight on the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.039 
side relating to the headlight on the
chassis<00:01:16.610> now<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.670> probably<00:01:17.970> guess<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.479> I

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
chassis now you probably guess that I

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.560 
chassis now you probably guess that I
put<00:01:19.530> my<00:01:19.710> switch<00:01:20.070> in<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.520> center<00:01:20.850> console<00:01:21.299> just

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
put my switch in the center console just

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.490 
put my switch in the center console just
down<00:01:21.840> here<00:01:22.250> you<00:01:23.250> dumb<00:01:23.960> puts<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.110> little<00:01:25.289> bit

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
down here you dumb puts it a little bit

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.649 
down here you dumb puts it a little bit
away<00:01:25.619> from<00:01:26.090> anyone<00:01:27.090> who<00:01:27.210> wants<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.479> have<00:01:27.630> a

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
away from anyone who wants to have a

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.920 
away from anyone who wants to have a
play<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:29.030> makes<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.180> be<00:01:30.270> hidden<00:01:30.450> for<00:01:30.899> the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
play and makes it be hidden for the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.770 
play and makes it be hidden for the
authorities<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.740> can<00:01:32.520> put<00:01:33.149> it<00:01:33.240> anywhere<00:01:33.300> you

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
authorities you can put it anywhere you

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.200 
authorities you can put it anywhere you
wish<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.140> suppose<00:01:34.440> but<00:01:35.130> on<00:01:35.310> just<00:01:35.940> seeing<00:01:36.119> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
wish I suppose but on just seeing the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.840 
wish I suppose but on just seeing the
most<00:01:36.360> logical<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.929> me<00:01:37.549> alright<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:38.700> when

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
most logical to me alright so when

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.010 
most logical to me alright so when
you've<00:01:39.000> got<00:01:39.179> it<00:01:39.210> all<00:01:39.420> hooked<00:01:39.600> up<00:01:39.810> and

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
you've got it all hooked up and

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.260 
you've got it all hooked up and
everything's<00:01:40.710> all<00:01:40.920> set<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.280> place<00:01:41.490> you're

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
everything's all set in place you're

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.210 
everything's all set in place you're
pretty<00:01:42.569> much<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:42.810> gonna<00:01:43.319> have<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.710> push<00:01:44.039> this

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
pretty much just gonna have to push this

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.630 
pretty much just gonna have to push this
to<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.030> left<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:47.130> get<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.429> left

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
to the left and you get the left

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.649 
to the left and you get the left
headlight<00:01:48.319> and<00:01:49.319> you<00:01:49.500> can<00:01:49.709> operate<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.659> half

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
headlight and you can operate it half

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.380 
headlight and you can operate it half
way<00:01:51.990> or<00:01:52.020> all<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.740> way<00:01:52.940> pretty<00:01:53.940> much<00:01:54.030> just

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
way or all the way pretty much just

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.020 
way or all the way pretty much just
gives<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.750> constant<00:01:55.140> power<00:01:55.319> and<00:01:55.740> then<00:01:56.640> going

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
gives it constant power and then going

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.510 
gives it constant power and then going
the<00:01:57.060> other<00:01:57.299> way

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
the other way

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.300 
the other way
well<00:01:59.520> obviously<00:01:59.640> operate<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.750> right<00:02:00.929> one<00:02:01.310> to

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
well obviously operate the right one to

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.999 
well obviously operate the right one to
give<00:02:02.459> my<00:02:02.610> housemates<00:02:03.060> duty<00:02:03.390> missing<00:02:07.009> and

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
give my housemates duty missing and

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.519 
give my housemates duty missing and
that's<00:02:08.250> it
