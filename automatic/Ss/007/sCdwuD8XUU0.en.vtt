00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
by a sous this graphics card ran about

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.990 
by a sous this graphics card ran about
two<00:00:19.590> hundred<00:00:19.650> dollars<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.640> going<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.880> be

two hundred dollars and is going to be

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.660 
two hundred dollars and is going to be
sufficient<00:00:21.359> for<00:00:21.570> my<00:00:21.779> needs<00:00:21.810> at<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:22.439> point<00:00:23.160> at

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
starting point for this pc build and for

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.229 
starting point for this pc build and for
my<00:00:34.680> needs<00:00:34.940> so<00:00:37.460> let's<00:00:38.460> open<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:38.820> up<00:00:38.879> because

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
my needs so let's open this up because

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.350 
my needs so let's open this up because
this<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.690> an<00:00:39.780> unboxing<00:00:40.079> video<00:00:40.469> for<00:00:40.860> this<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:42.059> I

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
this is an unboxing video for this and I

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.270 
this is an unboxing video for this and I
don't<00:00:42.480> think<00:00:42.660> I'll<00:00:42.809> need<00:00:42.840> my<00:00:43.170> cutter<00:00:44.180> because

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.590 

all<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.340> need<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.940> fingernail<00:00:51.690> there<00:00:52.110> we<00:00:52.199> go

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:09.980 

alright<00:00:58.280> slide<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.520> out<00:01:07.400> there<00:01:08.400> we<00:01:08.549> go<00:01:08.990> box

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
alright slide this out there we go box

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.440 
alright slide this out there we go box
within<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.380> box<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.890> sous<00:01:11.220> rock-solid<00:01:11.850> heart

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
within a box a sous rock-solid heart

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.620 
within a box a sous rock-solid heart
touching<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:14.520> reason<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:14.820> chose<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.060> sous<00:01:15.450> is

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
touching the reason I chose a sous is

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.330 
touching the reason I chose a sous is
because<00:01:15.810> they<00:01:15.900> have<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.049> great<00:01:16.350> record<00:01:16.650> for<00:01:17.220> the

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
because they have a great record for the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.289 
because they have a great record for the
reliability<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.090> their<00:01:18.240> components<00:01:20.210> open<00:01:21.210> it

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
reliability of their components open it

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.640 
reliability of their components open it
up<00:01:21.390> all<00:01:21.630> black<00:01:22.110> black<00:01:22.470> on<00:01:22.680> black<00:01:24.200> over<00:01:25.200> here<00:01:25.500> to

up all black black on black over here to

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.219 
up all black black on black over here to
the<00:01:25.680> right<00:01:25.790> you<00:01:26.790> have<00:01:27.530> some<00:01:28.530> connectors<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:30.229> a

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
the right you have some connectors and a

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.170 
the right you have some connectors and a
crossfire<00:01:31.860> bridge<00:01:33.439> which<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.619> great<00:01:34.939> in<00:01:35.939> case

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
crossfire bridge which is great in case

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.330 
crossfire bridge which is great in case
I<00:01:36.420> decide<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.049> do<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.530> later<00:01:37.950> on<00:01:38.130> down<00:01:38.280> the

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
I decide to do that later on down the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.780 
I decide to do that later on down the
line
