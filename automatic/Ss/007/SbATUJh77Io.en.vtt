00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
writings all the way in all the way at

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.229 
writings all the way in all the way at
that<00:03:18.389> side<00:03:18.599> but<00:03:18.900> anyway<00:03:19.859> keep<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:20.639> dimensions

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
that side but anyway keep the dimensions

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.270 
that side but anyway keep the dimensions
and<00:03:21.419> everything<00:03:21.480> as<00:03:21.810> they<00:03:21.930> are<00:03:22.280> animations

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
and everything as they are animations

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.699 
and everything as they are animations
like<00:03:24.090> they're<00:03:24.450> say<00:03:24.720> three<00:03:24.989> repetitions<00:03:25.169> that

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
like they're say three repetitions that

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.289 
like they're say three repetitions that
means<00:03:25.889> they'll<00:03:26.190> go<00:03:26.340> three<00:03:26.609> times<00:03:26.790> before<00:03:27.060> it

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
means they'll go three times before it

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.659 
means they'll go three times before it
stops<00:03:27.599> and<00:03:27.959> then<00:03:28.169> restarts<00:03:28.739> so<00:03:29.489> I'm<00:03:29.579> just

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
stops and then restarts so I'm just

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.330 
stops and then restarts so I'm just
going<00:03:29.819> to<00:03:29.849> leave<00:03:29.970> it<00:03:30.060> at<00:03:30.150> three<00:03:31.069> okay<00:03:32.069> we<00:03:32.310> just

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
going to leave it at three okay we just

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.970 
going to leave it at three okay we just
export<00:03:33.090> that<00:03:33.239> and<00:03:33.530> then<00:03:35.599> move<00:03:36.599> down<00:03:36.659> here

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
export that and then move down here

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.610 
export that and then move down here
and<00:03:39.790> there's<00:03:40.030> a<00:03:41.129> pretty<00:03:42.129> basic<00:03:43.260> gif<00:03:44.260> image

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620
