when<00:06:07.380> luffy<00:06:07.620> first<00:06:07.979> did<00:06:08.190> his<00:06:08.310> Red<00:06:08.490> Hawk<00:06:08.760> that

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
when luffy first did his Red Hawk that

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.120 
when luffy first did his Red Hawk that
was<00:06:09.330> freakin<00:06:09.630> epic<00:06:09.840> and<00:06:10.710> I<00:06:10.770> think<00:06:10.950> this<00:06:11.040> is

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
was freakin epic and I think this is

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.320 
was freakin epic and I think this is
obviously<00:06:11.250> the<00:06:11.430> first<00:06:11.610> time<00:06:11.760> he<00:06:11.850> did<00:06:12.000> it<00:06:12.150> and

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
obviously the first time he did it and

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.090 
obviously the first time he did it and
it's<00:06:12.720> I<00:06:12.810> think<00:06:13.200> this<00:06:13.410> has<00:06:13.530> been<00:06:13.560> hinted<00:06:14.010> at

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 
it's I think this has been hinted at

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.770 
it's I think this has been hinted at
what<00:06:14.280> this<00:06:14.640> is<00:06:14.790> going<00:06:14.880> to<00:06:14.970> be<00:06:15.090> what<00:06:15.270> gear<00:06:15.479> for

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
what this is going to be what gear for

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.240 
what this is going to be what gear for
this<00:06:15.990> it's<00:06:16.229> going<00:06:16.350> to<00:06:16.380> be<00:06:16.500> surrounding<00:06:17.130> the

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
this it's going to be surrounding the

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.370 
this it's going to be surrounding the
Red<00:06:17.430> Hawk<00:06:17.790> I<00:06:18.030> get<00:06:18.630> the<00:06:18.720> feeling<00:06:19.050> that<00:06:19.080> him

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
Red Hawk I get the feeling that him

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.800 
Red Hawk I get the feeling that him
using<00:06:19.740> armament<00:06:20.160> haki<00:06:20.190> with<00:06:20.880> his<00:06:21.000> jet<00:06:21.330> and

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
using armament haki with his jet and

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.080 
using armament haki with his jet and
he's<00:06:22.080> going<00:06:22.260> to<00:06:22.350> be<00:06:22.440> using<00:06:22.740> his<00:06:23.130> Red<00:06:23.520> Hawk<00:06:23.760> more

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.090 
he's going to be using his Red Hawk more

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:25.010 
he's going to be using his Red Hawk more
