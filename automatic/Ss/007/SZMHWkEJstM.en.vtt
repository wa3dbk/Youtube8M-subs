my opinion on this product so the first
thing<00:00:27.789> that<00:00:28.269> I<00:00:29.160> don't<00:00:30.160> really<00:00:30.400> care<00:00:30.670> for<00:00:30.970> is

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:31.179 
thing that I don't really care for is

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:33.630 
thing that I don't really care for is
the<00:00:31.300> price<00:00:31.599> I<00:00:31.929> believe<00:00:32.649> that<00:00:32.680> this<00:00:33.190> product

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
the price I believe that this product

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.639 
the price I believe that this product
was<00:00:33.760> like<00:00:33.969> around<00:00:34.120> twenty<00:00:34.600> dollars<00:00:34.960> and<00:00:35.230> as

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:35.649 
was like around twenty dollars and as

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:37.860 
was like around twenty dollars and as
you<00:00:35.770> can<00:00:35.920> see<00:00:35.950> it's<00:00:36.460> not<00:00:36.850> a<00:00:36.879> very<00:00:37.180> big<00:00:37.270> bottle

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
you can see it's not a very big bottle

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.229 
you can see it's not a very big bottle
it<00:00:38.050> is<00:00:38.739> in<00:00:38.950> fact<00:00:38.980> only<00:00:39.460> eight<00:00:39.910> and<00:00:40.149> a<00:00:40.210> half

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.939 
it is in fact only eight and a half
ounces<00:00:41.230> so<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:43.510> automatically<00:00:44.200> would<00:00:44.500> deter

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
ounces so that automatically would deter

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.240 
ounces so that automatically would deter
me<00:00:45.219> from<00:00:45.430> so<00:00:46.420> long<00:00:46.780> right<00:00:47.110> onto<00:00:47.260> that<00:00:47.559> that<00:00:47.949> is

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
me from so long right onto that that is

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.459 
me from so long right onto that that is
very<00:00:48.789> expensive<00:00:49.090> and<00:00:49.600> you<00:00:50.020> don't<00:00:50.199> get<00:00:50.350> very

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
very expensive and you don't get very

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.479 
very expensive and you don't get very
much<00:00:51.300> okay<00:00:52.300> so<00:00:52.629> it<00:00:52.899> has<00:00:53.020> a<00:00:53.289> really<00:00:53.559> fresh<00:00:54.010> scent

silky and smooth almost it up to the
point<00:01:28.540> where<00:01:28.810> you<00:01:29.170> can't<00:01:29.440> really<00:01:29.620> tell<00:01:30.070> if<00:01:30.370> you

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
point where you can't really tell if you

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.410 
point where you can't really tell if you
have<00:01:30.670> good<00:01:31.120> coverage<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:32.470> um<00:01:32.890> and<00:01:33.280> thats<00:01:33.820> it<00:01:34.120> i

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
have good coverage so um and thats it i

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.990 
have good coverage so um and thats it i
might<00:01:35.260> have<00:01:35.530> tended<00:01:36.010> to<00:01:36.160> use<00:01:36.340> like<00:01:36.520> a<00:01:36.550> little

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
might have tended to use like a little

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.640 
might have tended to use like a little
bit<00:01:37.120> more<00:01:37.360> than<00:01:37.570> i<00:01:37.660> need<00:01:37.690> it<00:01:37.990> to<00:01:38.020> just<00:01:38.350> because

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
bit more than i need it to just because

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.830 
bit more than i need it to just because
you<00:01:39.070> can't<00:01:39.280> really<00:01:39.340> tell<00:01:39.820> that<00:01:40.150> it<00:01:40.450> spread

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
you can't really tell that it spread

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.660 
you can't really tell that it spread
through<00:01:40.870> out<00:01:41.410> your<00:01:41.440> hair<00:01:41.830> evenly<00:01:42.280> when<00:01:42.550> you're

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
through out your hair evenly when you're

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.420 
through out your hair evenly when you're
washing<00:01:42.850> your<00:01:43.060> hair<00:01:43.800> basically<00:01:44.800> when<00:01:45.100> I<00:01:45.130> did

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
washing your hair basically when I did

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.120 
washing your hair basically when I did
uses<00:01:45.790> product<00:01:46.030> though<00:01:46.360> I<00:01:46.600> used<00:01:47.200> about<00:01:47.620> four

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
uses product though I used about four

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.340 
uses product though I used about four
squeezes<00:01:48.730> and<00:01:48.910> I<00:01:49.360> think<00:01:49.630> that<00:01:49.840> I'm<00:01:50.110> probably

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
squeezes and I think that I'm probably

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.470 
squeezes and I think that I'm probably
going<00:01:50.950> to<00:01:51.100> be<00:01:51.220> able<00:01:51.280> to<00:01:51.490> use<00:01:51.670> this<00:01:51.910> bottle<00:01:52.330> in

five washes maybe even four so I used it

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.040 
five washes maybe even four so I used it
twice<00:01:55.990> and<00:01:56.550> it's<00:01:57.550> almost<00:01:58.120> half<00:01:58.480> of<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.750> bottle

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
twice and it's almost half of the bottle

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.430 
twice and it's almost half of the bottle
is<00:01:59.200> now<00:01:59.380> gone<00:01:59.620> so<00:02:00.550> that<00:02:01.120> kind<00:02:02.110> of<00:02:02.170> sucks

compare everything to win but um I don't
know<00:05:33.370> I<00:05:33.430> just<00:05:33.520> think<00:05:33.760> that<00:05:33.970> if<00:05:34.270> you're<00:05:34.389> going

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
know I just think that if you're going

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:35.730 
know I just think that if you're going
to<00:05:34.570> use<00:05:34.690> a<00:05:34.750> cleansing<00:05:35.080> conditioner<00:05:35.590> you

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
to use a cleansing conditioner you

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.960 
to use a cleansing conditioner you
should<00:05:35.889> get<00:05:35.979> one<00:05:36.039> that<00:05:36.400> comes<00:05:36.550> in<00:05:36.699> a<00:05:36.760> bigger

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
should get one that comes in a bigger

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.839 
should get one that comes in a bigger
bottle<00:05:37.210> than<00:05:37.479> this<00:05:37.690> because<00:05:38.400> let's<00:05:39.400> face<00:05:39.520> it
