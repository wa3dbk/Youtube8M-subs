00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.650
 welcome a video tutorial speaks to you 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.300
 your server and brother d'angelo 10 in 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.610
 1666 this time I bring you a new 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.699
 tutorial in which we will be learning 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.579
 how to burn our image in format 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.199
 iso on a good dvd this is something 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.030
 simple but at the same time it 's something 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.220
 complicated since we have to 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.790
 make sure that when recording 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.160
 our iso image on the dvd does not 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.409
 mark any type of error since this 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.809
 could cause problems at the time 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:50.460
 to use our good disc we are going to 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.760
 start and be using a program 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.649
 called imgburn this program is 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.899
 free in case you do not have it 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.690
 You can download it from Google and 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.789
 install it on your pc good this me 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.800
 I recommend using this program instead 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.200
 of other programs because it's a program 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.929
 very simple to use and not brand 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.509
 many mistakes like other programs like this 

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:15.780
 let's start we 're going to need a 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:18.420
 virgin disk dvd format if your image 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.050
 same is less than 4 gigas 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.040
 you can use a dvd format disc - 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.490
 crm 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.120
 but if your disk is larger than 4 gigas 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.400
 you can use a dvd format dvd + be 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.710
 well let's start this tutorial is 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.720
 compatible for any iso format 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.340
 that you want to burn on a DVD so 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.170
 let's start let's introduce 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.170
 our disk in the dvd reader 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.790
 once you have read our disc 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.270
 we close the window and open our 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.270
 Program 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.149
 good as we see I will be using the 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.700
 imgburn here what we are going to select 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.590
 it is the first option that says to record 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.899
 image on the disk 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.840
 well let's start to configure what 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.060
 which is our program here in origin 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.879
 we are going to select the same image that 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:17.170
 we are going to burn so we select the 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:19.150
 iso image let's open in destination this 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.660
 option has to be in the unit 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.879
 where we have our dvd where we have 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.760
 our virgin must in this case what 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:30.400
 I have in the one of we marked the popcorn that 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.040
 says check to verify everything 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.299
 this process here in speed of 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.299
 writing let's select 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.969
 6x it is important that we do it to this 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:45.099
 speed since if you do it to a greater 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:47.409
 speed may mark many 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.629
 errors the number of copies 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:51.340
 we select one good this the only thing 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:53.799
 what has to be done done these 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.730
 we select this button that is to start 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:03:00.760
 to record in this part we can observe 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:03.760
 the process of recording our 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.879
 disk here we have to verify that no 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.730
 mark us with no single X because in 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:12.220
 occasions mark x and if we have a tache 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.439
 an X we have to cancel and 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.000
 make it good again because we're going to 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:18.000
 start and we will record 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.129
 and as we see it is going to start burning 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.500
 our virgin disco good for me here 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.269
 I pause the video so it does not get 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.290
 very long and I return when there 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.290
 finished this process 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.220
 good as we can see it's over 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.440
 burn the disc the bar has reached the 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.660
 one hundred percent is simply 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.390
 checking that everything is fine here 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.190
 we see the percentage and well this we are going to 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:59.130
 wait for these few seconds that are left 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.130
 to continue with this video tutorial 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.480
 well once it's finished we will be 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.420
 giving what is the disc already finished and 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.990
 this process has ended as we saw no 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.670
 had no error in this part and good 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:18.230
 this has been all 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.230
 we can close our program 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.390
 close our program and we have 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.600
 our burned image on our disk 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:30.930
 of DVD we can simply take it out and 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.820
 we can use this disk to use 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.210
 our image and that in any case in 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.090
 given that there is burnt gas 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.280
 an operating system automatically 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.340
 using the disc by inserting the 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.380
 dvd label to support yourself install your 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.910
 operating system but this has been all 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.960
 I hope you liked the tutorial 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.150
 that has served them 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.360
 do not forget to like the video and 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.979
 his brother Daniel of 6666 dismisses and we 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.400
 we see in the next tutorial until the 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.400
 next
