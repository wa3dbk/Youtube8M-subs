00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
have been a few problems before and this

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.300 
have been a few problems before and this
is<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.430> video<00:00:23.730> telling<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.330> how<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.570> fix<00:00:24.779> it

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
is a video telling you how to fix it

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.589 
is a video telling you how to fix it
so<00:00:26.310> what<00:00:26.519> was<00:00:26.640> happening<00:00:26.760> was<00:00:27.150> there<00:00:27.330> was<00:00:27.449> mob

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
so what was happening was there was mob

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.599 
so what was happening was there was mob
spawning<00:00:27.990> up<00:00:28.199> here<00:00:28.410> for<00:00:29.250> some<00:00:29.429> reason

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
spawning up here for some reason

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.269 
spawning up here for some reason
possibly<00:00:30.449> because<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.990> an<00:00:31.349> AI<00:00:31.500> update

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
possibly because of an AI update

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.220 
possibly because of an AI update
they<00:00:32.850> weren't<00:00:33.180> walking<00:00:33.450> off<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.870> edge<00:00:33.989> into

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230

they weren't walking off the edge into
the<00:00:34.380> water<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.890> they<00:00:35.100> weren't<00:00:35.280> falling<00:00:35.610> down

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
the water and they weren't falling down

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.740 
the water and they weren't falling down
into<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.510> hole<00:00:37.010> but<00:00:38.180> there<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.390> an<00:00:39.480> easy<00:00:39.629> way

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
into the hole but there is an easy way

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.280 
into the hole but there is an easy way
to<00:00:39.870> fix<00:00:40.079> this<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.969> go<00:00:42.780> there<00:00:43.140> also

to fix this and that is to go there also
if<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.800> haven't<00:00:43.950> built<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.250> it's<00:00:44.430> not

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
if you haven't built it it's not

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.220 
if you haven't built it it's not
supposed<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.030> be<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> hole<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.600> didn't<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.140> you

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
supposed to be a hole I didn't so you

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
easy way to fix this you can simply put

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.580 
easy way to fix this you can simply put
trapdoors<00:00:52.140> oh<00:00:52.469> crap<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.910> can<00:00:54.090> simply<00:00:54.329> put

trapdoors<00:00:56.840> redstone<00:00:57.840> along<00:00:59.210> each<00:01:00.210> side

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
trapdoors redstone along each side

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:02.840 
trapdoors redstone along each side
bollocks<00:01:01.559> excuse<00:01:02.399> my<00:01:02.520> language

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
bollocks excuse my language

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.509 
bollocks excuse my language
trapdoors<00:01:03.480> along<00:01:03.809> each<00:01:04.080> platform<00:01:04.470> put<00:01:05.400> them

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
trapdoors along each platform put them

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.130 
trapdoors along each platform put them
down<00:01:05.729> like<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.710> and<00:01:08.270> that<00:01:09.270> should<00:01:09.630> sort<00:01:09.930> it

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
down like that and that should sort it

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.530 
down like that and that should sort it
I'd<00:01:10.380> be<00:01:10.560> testing<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.100> it's<00:01:11.820> not<00:01:12.000> as<00:01:12.090> quick<00:01:12.299> as

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
I'd be testing this it's not as quick as

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.830 
I'd be testing this it's not as quick as
it<00:01:12.600> was<00:01:13.140> before<00:01:13.700> but<00:01:14.700> mobs<00:01:15.030> are<00:01:15.299> definitely

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
it was before but mobs are definitely

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.760 
it was before but mobs are definitely
falling<00:01:16.200> down<00:01:17.270> you<00:01:18.270> can<00:01:18.420> also<00:01:18.600> replace<00:01:19.170> these

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
falling down you can also replace these

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.690 
falling down you can also replace these
with<00:01:20.280> signs<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.180> will<00:01:21.299> also<00:01:21.540> work<00:01:22.670> but<00:01:23.670> I

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
with signs and that will also work but I

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.660 
with signs and that will also work but I
just<00:01:24.030> prefer<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.540> look<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:25.020> trap<00:01:25.560> trap<00:01:26.400> doors

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
just prefer the look of trap trap doors

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.649 
just prefer the look of trap trap doors
and<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:26.970> have<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.150> make<00:01:27.270> sure<00:01:27.390> they're<00:01:27.540> on<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
and you have to make sure they're on the

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.690 
and you have to make sure they're on the
top<00:01:27.930> not<00:01:28.560> on<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.829> bottom<00:01:29.100> like<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.520> one

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
top not on the bottom like that one

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.170 
top not on the bottom like that one
dated<00:01:30.090> their<00:01:31.549> top<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.759> better<00:01:33.920> I<00:01:34.920> also<00:01:35.790> show

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
dated their top is better I also show

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.910 
dated their top is better I also show
you<00:01:36.240> something<00:01:36.720> else<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.380> have<00:01:37.740> been

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
working on over here this is something

working on over here this is something
that<00:01:41.009> I'm<00:01:41.189> gonna<00:01:41.670> try<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.299> get<00:01:42.450> fixed<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.530> that

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
that I'm gonna try and get fixed so that

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.850 
that I'm gonna try and get fixed so that
it<00:01:43.770> works<00:01:44.180> it's<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.509> suggestion<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.590> someone

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
it works it's a suggestion that someone

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
said to me in the comments where I set

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.639 
said to me in the comments where I set
up<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.640> redstone<00:01:51.420> timer<00:01:51.780> here<00:01:52.140> wheres

flush the mobs into the ditches at the

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.859 
flush the mobs into the ditches at the
moment<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.579> don't<00:01:59.610> know<00:02:00.180> if<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.450> works

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
moment and don't know if it works

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.910 
moment and don't know if it works
I<00:02:01.020> tested<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.740> 100%<00:02:03.140> but<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.290> theory<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.890> should

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
I tested it 100% but in theory it should

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.880 
I tested it 100% but in theory it should
work<00:02:05.869> only<00:02:06.869> problem<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.380> water<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.680> not

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
work only problem is the water is not

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.220 
work only problem is the water is not
going<00:02:08.869> directly<00:02:09.869> into<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.920> stream

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230

delay<00:02:49.690> each<00:02:50.690> just<00:02:51.230> three<00:02:51.410> dispensers<00:02:52.000> one<00:02:53.000> in

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
delay each just three dispensers one in

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.559 
delay each just three dispensers one in
the<00:02:53.180> corner

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
the corner

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.569 
the corner
and<00:02:54.260> then<00:02:54.410> three<00:02:54.709> blocks<00:02:54.950> from<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.160> side<00:02:55.370> and

and then three blocks from the side and

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.039 
and then three blocks from the side and
they've<00:02:55.670> just<00:02:55.700> got<00:02:55.879> buckets<00:02:56.239> of<00:02:56.329> water<00:02:56.420> in<00:02:56.690> and

when it releases the water because the
bucket<00:03:02.329> now<00:03:02.450> picks<00:03:02.720> it<00:03:02.840> back<00:03:02.870> up<00:03:03.140> when<00:03:03.319> there's

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
bucket now picks it back up when there's
