00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.560
 circle tv today again machine 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.139
 supposedly for e100 about him I was already on the guide 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.700
 channel and then her feathers and dust just 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.450
 actually blew out the cars now 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.070
 well, absolutely not what I was trying to you 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.590
 something good to remove well and they think that 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.240
 here at least something is at least something 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.779
 it turned out now I will show you 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.609
 this video here but again, my opinion 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.710
 absolutely not changed the car as it was 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.340
 for me, sad shit remained to 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.439
 sorry 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.380
 because basically good in her 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.270
 quite a few and so what do we have 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.300
 a gun that shoots like 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.270
 powerfully 1750 average damage is of course 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.770
 cool we also have to punch two hundred 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.930
 ninety nine millimeters but she 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.700
 some kind of very strange damn it so 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.430
 why does not break though though 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.649
 vytselivat kind of a gun is very accurate nor 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.539
 horseradish misses see yourself at the end 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.449
 this fight will be such an example which is well 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.030
 I just don't know it in the carcass's chair 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.670
 general fire then 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.530
 what else the car does not drive very fast 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.240
 the car must have armor on it and there is no and 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.070
 they are not all scolded they sew like a piece 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.240
 poop 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.090
 that's why I don't know what's in it 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.520
 positive there is a gun with a good alpha 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.380
 yes but in principle for drawing and pretty 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.790
 difficult because reloading is wildly long 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.790
 Yes, and information, in principle, not the most 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.850
 fast 2 and 3 he tried to shoot at 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.770
 the tower got clear where the upper bound 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.250
 Of course ricochet fuck you punch them 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.189
 103 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.470
 although such a caliber should simply 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.280
 in the trash I do not know there otolbit this 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.430
 piece of armor 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.810
 but such are the cases carriage assault tiger 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.590
 better take for sure there 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.619
 like how swells on 2000 this 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.479
 not bad though the assault tiger ponerfili 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.130
 Can you imagine in the lower armor? 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.859
 breaks the general govnesche 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.200
 they gun I don't know why but maybe i 

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:52.850
 Krivoruky on the tower by the way the center is quite 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.560
 Statement normal to still have to get there 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.850
 aim and with such accuracy 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.909
 stabilization is something not very good 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.549
 that he is tiger yes yes yes my favorite tank 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.530
 ponerfili now breaking through on assault 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.079
 tigers fly out much, much less often 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.269
 but even in such a wilted state it 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.519
 the car is much better than the yaga e100 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.410
 but in any case the recharge is the same 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.660
 up a little longer mixing there too if 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.040
 gets you sure you only hear 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.190
 that mom don't worry 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.630
 and yet if I get there I don't know 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.090
 into the wall hall 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.430
 cars and just near get with 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.890
 the enemy took very, very much 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.680
 types rushing I did it in one 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.930
 shot minus the oval of three opponents well and 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.910
 In general , the tiger is ultimate 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.860
 option even punished in principle 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.769
 pretty well gave too slow it 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.750
 too, there is no much battle there but generally I 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.000
 git and this, too, does not boast out 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.380
 the guns are here well rather strange I 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.650
 I think it is very strange . 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.600
 Yaga car this is possible this machine 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.609
 just an amateur should be 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.709
 stand just somewhere far away 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.880
 although by the way here is this card here a lot 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.220
 all sorts of mounds lower armor sheet 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.750
 close up pretty well for 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.459
 Yagi I think well, in general, I do not know on this 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.530
 I never enjoy playing a car 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:13.190
 did not bring well as it should 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.580
 20 per m26 pershing by the way about pershing 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.980
 there will be a video very very soon 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.040
 I bought this car and realized that it was well 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.500
 just a rare govnishche like this 20 i 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.740
 I do not know what the developers thought when 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.460
 tried to enter this car in general is necessary 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.330
 her apat 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:34.450
 and now look just masterfully 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:37.420
 shot from me is a complete mix of seconds 8 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.940
 on the tank but of course the shell goes not 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.280
 in the tank yes no why not 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.260
 you can miss once 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.360
 opportunity but still 6 small thousand 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.400
 damage there i believe for yaga e100 this 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.560
 good result anyway u 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.270
 I don't do this very often 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.530
 Many Dayan they in general the and some 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.200
 because on the bbc. 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.970
 Well, that's my opinion of course can 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:59.650
 to disagree and I am sure that such 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.670
 there are but what is it just my opinion 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.670
 bye everyone
