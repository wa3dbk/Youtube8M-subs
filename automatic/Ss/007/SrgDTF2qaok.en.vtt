so I had to learn how to survive on my
own<00:00:16.490> sometimes<00:00:17.490> I<00:00:17.670> wondered<00:00:18.390> what<00:00:19.230> kind<00:00:19.529> of

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
own sometimes I wondered what kind of

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
it's one of my darkest fears if you took

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.280 
it's one of my darkest fears if you took
the<00:00:27.840> war<00:00:28.140> out<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.560> me

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:29.290
