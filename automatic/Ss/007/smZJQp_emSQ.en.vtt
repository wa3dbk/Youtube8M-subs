00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
yesterday by a publicist so I thought I

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:47.389 
yesterday by a publicist so I thought I
would<00:00:46.260> use<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.589> and<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.829> good<00:00:46.949> thing<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.159> it's

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
would use it and the good thing is it's

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.889 
would use it and the good thing is it's
this<00:00:47.730> color<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.059> actually<00:00:48.269> a<00:00:48.510> little<00:00:48.629> too

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
this color is actually a little too

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.930 
this color is actually a little too
light<00:00:49.109> for<00:00:49.140> me<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.679> since<00:00:49.920> she<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:51.980> much<00:00:52.980> more

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
light for me and since she is much more

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.079 
light for me and since she is much more
fair<00:00:54.390> than<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.839> am<00:00:55.460> thought<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.850> would<00:00:56.999> be<00:00:57.030> a

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
fair than I am thought this would be a

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.029 
fair than I am thought this would be a
good<00:00:57.179> opportunity<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.690> use<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.229> it's<00:00:58.949> going

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
good opportunity to use it so it's going

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.160 
good opportunity to use it so it's going
to<00:00:59.100> look<00:00:59.159> kind<00:00:59.519> of<00:00:59.670> really<00:01:00.179> pale<00:01:00.390> going<00:01:00.749> on<00:01:00.899> but

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170
