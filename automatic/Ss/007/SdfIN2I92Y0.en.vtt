00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
but that's okay all the servers seem to

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.220 
but that's okay all the servers seem to
work<00:03:05.130> just<00:03:05.610> fine<00:03:05.760> even<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.420> EU<00:03:06.750> servers

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230

one<00:03:12.900> of<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.650> servers<00:03:14.190> have<00:03:14.430> about<00:03:15.270> six

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
one of the servers have about six

maps that you can play conquests on the

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.470 
maps that you can play conquests on the
other<00:03:21.480> servers<00:03:22.350> you<00:03:23.250> can<00:03:23.430> play<00:03:23.610> conquest<00:03:24.270> on

other servers you can play conquest on

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.360 
other servers you can play conquest on
but<00:03:24.750> it's<00:03:24.870> only<00:03:25.230> one<00:03:25.530> map<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.250> that's

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
but it's only one map and that's

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.090 
but it's only one map and that's
operation<00:03:27.150> mortar<00:03:27.570> which<00:03:27.720> is<00:03:27.900> one<00:03:28.170> of<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.800> new
