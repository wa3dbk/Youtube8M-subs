00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.670
 tee 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.670
 Masu Tei 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:20.830
 Color of light emitted from LED lighting 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:23.060
 Information such as the id by to unbalance so that it does not know to the human eye 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:27.230
 It is a technique to go to bed 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.990
 By performing image processing on the smartphone side 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:34.730
 We have enhanced the embedded id 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:40.670
 Do not query servers in the cloud based on their id 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:47.980
 The much more that this technology is to work with the cloud in the communication speed itself is not so fast 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.980
 You will be able to guide you to rich content as well as videos 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:56.920
 We develop technology to embed information in picture so that it is not visible to people before developing this technology 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:02.440
 Has done 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:08.020
 When we thought that we would use this technology to more people 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:09.530
 I thought whether I could use the technology without being locked in 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.810
 LED lighting 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:20.600
 LED lighting can control various brightness intensity 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:27.140
 It is possible to control the tint here Our technology to LED lighting 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:28.900
 If it can be put in well, it may be said that the usage except the usage specialized to the image will be spread 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.190
 I thought so 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:40.150
 For example, information related to the items listed in the store showcase 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:41.440
 If the way is used, such as or offers in the price is the Toka and availability your Paso If there is one one 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:47.920
 am thinking 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:53.860
 Also , assuming the amount of art museums and museums , visitors will be able to show their smartphones on display 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.890
 The guidance of the exhibit etc. will be reproduced automatically when you receive it. 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:01.920
 I am 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:03.610
 Historic monuments, such as in, such as a building I am filling the information in the light-up light 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.330
 Historic 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.880
 If you want to be able to easily get the information you need on your smartphone 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.490
 Various people 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.890
 I think is possible 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:18.620
 This lighting technology 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:22.340
 This is a normal led lighting can be asked to use in exactly the same way 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.950
 Totally depending on that our technology is in there 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:30.400
 Such as we have not even thought 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.400
 I also hope that such new usage will come out
