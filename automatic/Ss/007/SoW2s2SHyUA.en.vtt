greatest<00:00:14.309> chassis<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.809> survivor<00:00:17.150> okay<00:00:18.150> so

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
greatest chassis the survivor okay so

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.320 
greatest chassis the survivor okay so
here<00:00:18.539> we<00:00:18.630> have<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.930> it's<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.439> survivor<00:00:20.180> as<00:00:21.180> you

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
here we have it it's the survivor as you

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.029 
here we have it it's the survivor as you
can<00:00:21.480> see<00:00:21.689> it's<00:00:21.900> quite<00:00:22.020> remarkably<00:00:22.740> different

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
can see it's quite remarkably different

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.730 
can see it's quite remarkably different
design<00:00:23.850> if<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.390> compared<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.080> colossus

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
design if you compared to the colossus

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.550 
design if you compared to the colossus
the<00:00:26.730> big<00:00:26.939> brothers<00:00:27.330> from<00:00:27.570> bitfenix<00:00:28.199> so<00:00:28.500> to

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
the big brothers from bitfenix so to

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.669 
the big brothers from bitfenix so to
speak<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:29.849> time<00:00:30.119> around<00:00:30.150> we<00:00:30.660> went<00:00:30.869> for<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.439> lot

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
speak this time around we went for a lot

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.110 
speak this time around we went for a lot
softer<00:00:32.460> edges<00:00:32.989> curved<00:00:33.989> design<00:00:34.700> but<00:00:35.700> there's

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
softer edges curved design but there's

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.119 
softer edges curved design but there's
actually<00:00:36.450> quite<00:00:36.690> some<00:00:37.140> ruggedness<00:00:37.590> hiding

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
actually quite some ruggedness hiding

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.660 
actually quite some ruggedness hiding
behind<00:00:38.280> all<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:40.129> just<00:00:41.129> like<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
behind all of this and just like in the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.660 
behind all of this and just like in the
automotive<00:00:42.270> industry<00:00:42.680> you<00:00:43.680> know<00:00:43.800> course<00:00:44.430> or

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
automotive industry you know course or

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.630 
automotive industry you know course or
built<00:00:44.879> they<00:00:45.059> have<00:00:45.180> kind<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.570> thin<00:00:46.050> shell

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
built they have kind of a thin shell

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.549 
built they have kind of a thin shell
covering<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.200> internal<00:00:49.200> parts<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.070> much

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
covering the internal parts the much

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.279 
covering the internal parts the much
tougher<00:00:52.559> steel<00:00:53.190> chassis<00:00:53.899> we<00:00:54.899> have<00:00:55.020> done<00:00:55.170> the

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
tougher steel chassis we have done the

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.029 
tougher steel chassis we have done the
same<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.559> survivor<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:57.050> so<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.350> outer<00:00:58.559> shell

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
same a survivor and so the outer shell

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.599 
same a survivor and so the outer shell
it<00:00:59.309> extends<00:01:00.030> beyond<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:01.219> internal<00:01:02.219> metal

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
it extends beyond the internal metal

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.080 
it extends beyond the internal metal
chassis<00:01:03.090> on<00:01:03.270> all<00:01:03.570> six<00:01:03.989> sides<00:01:04.260> actually<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:05.430> if

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
chassis on all six sides actually so if

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.770 
chassis on all six sides actually so if
you<00:01:06.330> would<00:01:06.540> bump<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.260> into<00:01:07.650> something<00:01:07.920> or

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
you would bump this into something or

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.380 
you would bump this into something or
possibly<00:01:09.780> drop<00:01:10.140> your<00:01:10.460> your<00:01:11.460> computer<00:01:11.939> system

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
possibly drop your your computer system

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.350 
possibly drop your your computer system
from<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.990> not<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:13.770> safe<00:01:14.070> height<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.880> idea<00:01:15.270> is

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
from a not so safe height the idea is

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.609 
from a not so safe height the idea is
just<00:01:15.900> like<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.259> course<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.820> outer<00:01:18.119> shell

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
just like on course that the outer shell

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.100 
just like on course that the outer shell
will<00:01:19.619> absorb<00:01:20.009> some<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.580> impact<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.390> of

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
will absorb some of this impact and of

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.660 
will absorb some of this impact and of
course<00:01:22.320> take<00:01:22.530> should<00:01:22.710> take<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.040> shock<00:01:23.369> away

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
course take should take the shock away

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.120 
course take should take the shock away
from<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.090> much<00:01:24.299> more<00:01:24.590> important<00:01:25.590> internal

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
from the much more important internal

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.109 
from the much more important internal
parts<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:27.650> it's<00:01:28.650> also<00:01:28.920> covered<00:01:29.400> just<00:01:29.909> like

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
parts and it's also covered just like

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.899 
parts and it's also covered just like
colossus<00:01:30.600> it's<00:01:30.780> covered<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:31.290> our<00:01:32.250> bitfenix

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
colossus it's covered in our bitfenix

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.420 
colossus it's covered in our bitfenix
soft<00:01:33.150> touch<00:01:33.390> material<00:01:33.900> which<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.650> very<00:01:35.220> nice

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
soft touch material which is very nice

doesn't have this glaring plastic

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.310 
doesn't have this glaring plastic
feeling<00:01:42.659> like<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.990> lot<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.320> plastic<00:01:43.770> does<00:01:45.320> it's

got a nice luster it's not very prone to
fingerprints<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:50.100> can<00:01:50.250> clean<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.490> up

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
fingerprints and you can clean it up

little<00:02:49.100> bit<00:02:49.220> closer<00:02:49.550> to<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:49.910> survivor<00:02:50.390> you

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
little bit closer to the survivor you

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.410 
little bit closer to the survivor you
can<00:02:51.020> see<00:02:51.200> we<00:02:51.380> have<00:02:51.410> designed<00:02:51.740> a<00:02:52.160> concealed<00:02:53.060> IO

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
can see we have designed a concealed IO

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.890 
can see we have designed a concealed IO
