quirkiness<00:00:23.760> with<00:00:24.150> with<00:00:24.840> these<00:00:24.990> adapters<00:00:26.750> as

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
quirkiness with with these adapters as

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.849 
quirkiness with with these adapters as
you'll<00:00:28.019> notice<00:00:28.250> right<00:00:29.660> here<00:00:30.660> would<00:00:31.410> normally

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
you'll notice right here would normally

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.799 
you'll notice right here would normally
be<00:00:32.009> your<00:00:32.540> f-stop<00:00:33.590> reading<00:00:35.329> these<00:00:36.329> adapters

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
be your f-stop reading these adapters

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:37.880 
be your f-stop reading these adapters
you<00:00:36.899> don't<00:00:37.020> have<00:00:37.140> any<00:00:37.260> control<00:00:37.649> over<00:00:37.680> your

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
you don't have any control over your

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.540 
you don't have any control over your
f-stop<00:00:38.100> but<00:00:39.030> with<00:00:39.180> these<00:00:39.329> old<00:00:39.540> film<00:00:39.780> ones<00:00:40.739> as

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
f-stop but with these old film ones as

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.040 
f-stop but with these old film ones as
you<00:00:41.670> might<00:00:41.850> know<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:44.360> f-stop<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.660> controlled

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
you might know the f-stop is controlled

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.069 
you might know the f-stop is controlled
on<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.289> lens<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:47.660> that's<00:00:48.660> all<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.960> would

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
on the lens so that's all you would

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.150 
on the lens so that's all you would
control<00:00:49.379> your<00:00:49.620> f-stop<00:00:51.289> other<00:00:52.289> things<00:00:52.620> that

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
control your f-stop other things that

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.319 
control your f-stop other things that
are<00:00:53.399> quirky<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:55.190> screen<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.399> LCD<00:00:56.789> screen<00:00:57.090> is

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
are quirky this screen the LCD screen is

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.799 
are quirky this screen the LCD screen is
actually<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.780> little<00:00:58.520> darker<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.809> actually

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
actually a little darker that actually

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.360 
actually a little darker that actually
is<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.260> you'll<00:01:01.410> need<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.649> use<00:01:01.680> your<00:01:02.039> lighting

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
is so you'll need to use your lighting

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.580 
is so you'll need to use your lighting
meter<00:01:02.550> here<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.780> could<00:01:03.930> see<00:01:06.290> there<00:01:07.290> like

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
meter here so you could see there like

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.570 
meter here so you could see there like
I'm<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.830> stopped<00:01:08.610> low<00:01:09.260> so<00:01:10.260> just<00:01:10.650> be<00:01:11.340> aware<00:01:11.369> that

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
I'm a stopped low so just be aware that

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.390 
I'm a stopped low so just be aware that
it's<00:01:12.000> gonna<00:01:12.119> be<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.330> little<00:01:12.570> bit<00:01:12.659> darker<00:01:13.049> so

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
it's gonna be a little bit darker so

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.850 
it's gonna be a little bit darker so
like<00:01:14.400> if<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.610> take<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.820> picture<00:01:14.970> now<00:01:15.470> see<00:01:16.470> it

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
like if I take a picture now see it

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.770 
like if I take a picture now see it
turns<00:01:17.100> up<00:01:17.220> be<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> little<00:01:17.759> brighter<00:01:17.970> then<00:01:18.270> so

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
turns up be a little brighter then so

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.030 
turns up be a little brighter then so
don't<00:01:18.960> trust<00:01:19.170> LCU<00:01:19.619> mine<00:01:21.470> but<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.860> cool<00:01:23.009> thing

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
don't trust LCU mine but the cool thing

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.460 
don't trust LCU mine but the cool thing
about<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:24.000> if<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.570> start<00:01:24.869> like<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.110> video

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
about that is if you start like a video

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.999 
about that is if you start like a video
mode<00:01:26.330> it's<00:01:27.330> it's<00:01:27.869> showing<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.290> what<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.860> is

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009

brighten up and you'll see what the
actual<00:01:38.119> image<00:01:39.119> looks<00:01:39.390> like<00:01:42.110> because<00:01:43.130> the

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
actual image looks like because the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.120 
actual image looks like because the
brightness<00:01:45.810> is<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.170> low<00:01:46.350> like<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:46.950> could

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
brightness is so low like that you could

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.190 
brightness is so low like that you could
go<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.610> adjust<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.720> haven't<00:01:48.960> done<00:01:49.079> this

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
go in and adjust it I haven't done this

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.749 
go in and adjust it I haven't done this
but<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.590> could<00:01:49.740> have<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.920> do<00:01:50.040> an<00:01:50.159> adjust<00:01:50.579> it

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
but you could have to do an adjust it

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.670 
but you could have to do an adjust it
for<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.810> brightness<00:01:52.020> off<00:01:52.350> but<00:01:52.500> on<00:01:52.590> the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
for the brightness off but on the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.030 
for the brightness off but on the
monitor<00:01:53.100> but<00:01:54.200> become<00:01:55.200> weird<00:01:55.439> if<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.860> went

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
monitor but become weird if you went

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.310 
monitor but become weird if you went
back<00:01:56.189> from<00:01:56.520> their<00:01:56.729> original<00:01:57.299> lens<00:01:57.899> here<00:01:58.200> on

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
back from their original lens here on

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.389 
back from their original lens here on
the<00:01:58.439> Olympus<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.920> then<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.100> keep<00:01:59.280> on

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
the Olympus and then you keep on

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.240 
the Olympus and then you keep on
switching<00:01:59.700> off<00:01:59.939> you'd<00:02:00.210> have<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.479> adjust<00:02:00.719> the

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
switching off you'd have to adjust the

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.039 
switching off you'd have to adjust the
monitor<00:02:02.250> each<00:02:02.399> time<00:02:02.700> another<00:02:03.659> thing<00:02:03.930> you

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
monitor each time another thing you

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.250 
monitor each time another thing you
could<00:02:04.200> get

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.260 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.800
