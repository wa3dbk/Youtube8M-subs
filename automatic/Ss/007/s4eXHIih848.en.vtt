operation DX and honestly I did not
think<00:00:18.950> I<00:00:19.189> would<00:00:19.369> be<00:00:19.550> talking<00:00:19.789> about<00:00:20.029> this<00:00:20.300> game

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:20.509

five new Titan class units these are

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:47.979 
five new Titan class units these are
essentially<00:00:46.879> super<00:00:47.210> units<00:00:47.539> that<00:00:47.719> take<00:00:47.960> a

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
essentially super units that take a

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.799 
essentially super units that take a
little<00:00:48.320> more<00:00:48.440> economy<00:00:48.949> to<00:00:49.100> build<00:00:49.250> and<00:00:49.809> they're

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
little more economy to build and they're

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:52.810 
little more economy to build and they're
harder<00:00:51.230> to<00:00:51.469> kill<00:00:51.739> if<00:00:52.039> you're<00:00:52.250> familiar<00:00:52.489> with

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
harder to kill if you're familiar with

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.990 
harder to kill if you're familiar with
games<00:00:53.180> like<00:00:53.649> supreme<00:00:54.649> commander<00:00:55.219> or<00:00:55.520> forged

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
games like supreme commander or forged

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.090 
games like supreme commander or forged
alliance<00:00:56.539> you<00:00:56.660> kind<00:00:57.320> of<00:00:57.410> get<00:00:57.559> the<00:00:57.680> idea<00:00:57.710> of

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
alliance you kind of get the idea of

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.189 
alliance you kind of get the idea of
what<00:00:58.370> these<00:00:58.489> are<00:00:58.670> all<00:00:58.760> about<00:00:58.789> they<00:00:59.750> do<00:00:59.809> have

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
what these are all about they do have

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.889 
what these are all about they do have
land-based<00:01:00.920> and<00:01:01.280> orbital<00:01:01.850> super<00:01:02.210> units<00:01:02.539> and

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
land-based and orbital super units and

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.229 
land-based and orbital super units and
they<00:01:03.590> add<00:01:03.769> a<00:01:03.800> kind<00:01:04.220> of<00:01:04.339> interesting<00:01:04.759> flavor<00:01:05.030> to

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
they add a kind of interesting flavor to

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.450 
they add a kind of interesting flavor to
the<00:01:05.360> game<00:01:05.539> in<00:01:05.920> addition<00:01:06.920> to<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:07.190> five<00:01:07.429> new

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
the game in addition to the five new

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.380 
the game in addition to the five new
Titans<00:01:08.270> there<00:01:08.630> is<00:01:08.840> 16<00:01:09.619> new<00:01:10.220> units<00:01:10.759> in<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:11.179> game

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
Titans there is 16 new units in the game

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.499 
Titans there is 16 new units in the game
so<00:01:11.780> various<00:01:12.200> tanks<00:01:12.679> in<00:01:12.830> orbital<00:01:13.400> units<00:01:13.729> some

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
so various tanks in orbital units some

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.960 
so various tanks in orbital units some
things<00:01:14.810> that<00:01:15.140> I<00:01:15.170> actually<00:01:15.590> wanted<00:01:16.369> to<00:01:16.490> see<00:01:16.729> in

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
things that I actually wanted to see in

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.270 
things that I actually wanted to see in
the<00:01:17.119> original<00:01:17.600> game<00:01:17.869> like<00:01:18.500> orbital

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
the original game like orbital

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.340 
the original game like orbital
battleships<00:01:19.939> that<00:01:20.090> can<00:01:20.390> hit<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:20.689> surface<00:01:21.140> and

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
battleships that can hit the surface and

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.980 
battleships that can hit the surface and
all<00:01:21.409> of<00:01:21.530> that<00:01:21.590> so<00:01:22.070> I<00:01:22.369> totally<00:01:23.330> dig<00:01:23.570> some<00:01:23.900> of

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
all of that so I totally dig some of

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.840 
all of that so I totally dig some of
these<00:01:24.140> new<00:01:24.409> units<00:01:24.860> I<00:01:25.070> think<00:01:25.310> they're<00:01:25.520> they're

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
these new units I think they're they're

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.999 
these new units I think they're they're
great<00:01:26.380> according<00:01:27.380> to<00:01:27.500> the<00:01:27.619> update

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
great according to the update

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.700 
great according to the update
information<00:01:28.490> they<00:01:29.450> also<00:01:29.689> say<00:01:30.350> that<00:01:30.560> they've

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
information they also say that they've

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.600 
information they also say that they've
added<00:01:30.979> multi<00:01:31.790> level<00:01:32.299> terrain<00:01:32.600> which<00:01:33.500> I<00:01:33.829> would

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
added multi level terrain which I would

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.270 
added multi level terrain which I would
have<00:01:34.759> thought<00:01:35.150> that<00:01:35.210> it<00:01:35.720> meant<00:01:36.049> that<00:01:36.350> vehicles

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
have thought that it meant that vehicles

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.550 
have thought that it meant that vehicles
could<00:01:37.520> get<00:01:37.759> up<00:01:37.939> on<00:01:38.090> higher<00:01:38.420> level<00:01:38.869> ground<00:01:39.079> and

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
could get up on higher level ground and

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.230 
could get up on higher level ground and
shoot<00:01:39.829> down<00:01:40.009> on<00:01:40.189> targets<00:01:40.610> to<00:01:40.880> improve

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
shoot down on targets to improve

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.940 
shoot down on targets to improve
accuracy<00:01:41.600> or<00:01:41.960> something<00:01:42.320> like<00:01:42.500> that

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
accuracy or something like that

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.310 
accuracy or something like that
I<00:01:42.979> don't<00:01:43.790> know<00:01:44.000> exactly<00:01:44.149> what<00:01:44.899> this<00:01:45.049> means

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
I don't know exactly what this means

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.440 
I don't know exactly what this means
because<00:01:45.860> it<00:01:46.100> doesn't<00:01:46.399> seem<00:01:46.610> like<00:01:46.970> you<00:01:47.149> can<00:01:47.329> do

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
because it doesn't seem like you can do

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.410 
because it doesn't seem like you can do
that<00:01:47.630> maybe<00:01:47.930> it<00:01:48.140> means<00:01:48.320> they<00:01:48.619> added<00:01:48.979> new<00:01:49.420> I

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
that maybe it means they added new I

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.539 
that maybe it means they added new I
don't<00:01:51.170> know<00:01:51.320> a<00:01:51.409> terrain<00:01:51.860> new<00:01:52.009> terrain<00:01:52.310> system

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
don't know a terrain new terrain system

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.840 
don't know a terrain new terrain system
that<00:01:53.090> I<00:01:53.469> honestly<00:01:54.469> don't<00:01:54.649> know<00:01:54.829> they<00:01:55.610> also

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
that I honestly don't know they also

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.870 
that I honestly don't know they also
added<00:01:56.240> a<00:01:56.540> new<00:01:56.960> tutorial<00:01:57.500> system<00:01:58.159> that<00:01:58.520> will

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
added a new tutorial system that will

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.240 
added a new tutorial system that will
help<00:01:59.240> new<00:01:59.630> players<00:01:59.810> get<00:02:00.409> acclimated<00:02:00.680> with

help new players get acclimated with
planetary<00:02:02.210> annihilation<00:02:02.860> although<00:02:03.860> if

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
planetary annihilation although if
