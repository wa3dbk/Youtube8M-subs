00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
feeling the pressure but other than that

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.120 
feeling the pressure but other than that
you<00:02:46.780> should<00:02:46.810> be<00:02:47.200> able<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:47.500> make<00:02:47.620> those<00:02:47.860> throws

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
you should be able to make those throws

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.850 
you should be able to make those throws
with<00:02:49.120> it<00:02:49.269> you<00:02:49.630> know<00:02:49.750> good<00:02:50.260> degree<00:02:50.380> of<00:02:50.650> success

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
with it you know good degree of success

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.729 
with it you know good degree of success
and<00:02:51.220> you<00:02:52.150> know<00:02:52.269> like<00:02:52.480> i<00:02:52.570> said<00:02:52.600> it's<00:02:52.989> west<00:02:53.530> coast

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
and you know like i said it's west coast

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.890 
and you know like i said it's west coast
often<00:02:54.040> so<00:02:54.220> it's<00:02:54.370> not<00:02:54.550> about<00:02:54.760> big<00:02:55.000> plays<00:02:55.269> it's

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
often so it's not about big plays it's

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.570 
often so it's not about big plays it's
about<00:02:56.050> making<00:02:56.320> sure<00:02:56.530> your<00:02:56.860> adage<00:02:57.070> you<00:02:57.459> know

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
about making sure your adage you know

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.790 
about making sure your adage you know
place<00:02:57.940> up<00:02:58.269> the<00:02:58.480> field<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:58.989> controlling<00:02:59.709> the

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
place up the field and controlling the

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.830 
place up the field and controlling the
game<00:02:59.950> that's<00:03:00.850> how<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.120> west<00:03:01.360> coast<00:03:01.540> often

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
game that's how the west coast often

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.680 
game that's how the west coast often
plays<00:03:02.050> out<00:03:02.260> so<00:03:02.970> hopefully<00:03:03.970> you<00:03:04.390> know<00:03:04.510> if

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
plays out so hopefully you know if

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:05.910 
plays out so hopefully you know if
that's<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:05.019> sort<00:03:05.200> of<00:03:05.260> thing<00:03:05.319> you<00:03:05.530> want<00:03:05.709> to<00:03:05.769> do

are<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.319> sort<00:03:08.530> of<00:03:08.560> place<00:03:08.769> for<00:03:08.980> you<00:03:09.100> moving<00:03:10.090> on

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
are the sort of place for you moving on

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.780 
are the sort of place for you moving on
another<00:03:10.660> shotgun<00:03:10.959> formation<00:03:11.680> this<00:03:12.069> time<00:03:12.370> it's

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
another shotgun formation this time it's

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.240 
another shotgun formation this time it's
a<00:03:12.970> run<00:03:13.269> and<00:03:14.200> this<00:03:14.530> is<00:03:14.650> what<00:03:14.830> makes<00:03:15.040> this

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
a run and this is what makes this

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.699 
a run and this is what makes this
particular<00:03:15.790> play<00:03:15.970> really<00:03:16.239> useful<00:03:16.750> it's<00:03:17.530> the

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
particular play really useful it's the

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.190 
particular play really useful it's the
HP<00:03:18.070> power<00:03:18.250> 0<00:03:18.489> in<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:18.760> split<00:03:19.000> offset<00:03:19.390> and<00:03:19.600> it's

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
HP power 0 in the split offset and it's

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.690 
HP power 0 in the split offset and it's
a<00:03:20.260> decent<00:03:20.590> running<00:03:20.739> play<00:03:20.980> because<00:03:21.310> it<00:03:21.489> will

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
a decent running play because it will

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.370 
a decent running play because it will
for<00:03:21.910> most<00:03:22.209> defenses<00:03:22.750> into<00:03:22.989> thinking<00:03:23.290> you're

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
for most defenses into thinking you're

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.380 
for most defenses into thinking you're
lining<00:03:23.620> up<00:03:23.829> in<00:03:23.950> a<00:03:24.010> pattern<00:03:24.040> formation<00:03:24.610> just

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
lining up in a pattern formation just

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.060 
lining up in a pattern formation just
switch<00:03:25.600> your<00:03:25.780> offensive<00:03:26.230> line<00:03:26.290> to<00:03:26.950> the

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
not going to be making much in the way

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.229 
not going to be making much in the way
of<00:04:02.440> yardage<00:04:02.890> here<00:04:03.130> you<00:04:03.609> just<00:04:03.910> want<00:04:04.120> to<00:04:04.180> wait

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
of yardage here you just want to wait

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:05.759 
of yardage here you just want to wait
for<00:04:04.359> the<00:04:04.540> blocks<00:04:04.780> to<00:04:04.959> develop<00:04:05.350> and<00:04:05.470> hit<00:04:05.650> the

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
for the blocks to develop and hit the

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.310 
for the blocks to develop and hit the
hole<00:04:05.950> that<00:04:06.130> develops<00:04:06.549> and<00:04:07.079> that's<00:04:08.079> pretty

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
hole that develops and that's pretty

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.599 
hole that develops and that's pretty
much<00:04:08.440> it<00:04:08.530> as<00:04:08.769> you<00:04:08.920> can<00:04:09.070> see<00:04:09.250> short-yardage

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609 
much it as you can see short-yardage

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:11.520 
much it as you can see short-yardage
situations<00:04:10.090> you're<00:04:10.750> not<00:04:10.989> going<00:04:11.320> to<00:04:11.410> be

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
situations you're not going to be

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.349 
situations you're not going to be
breaking<00:04:11.920> big<00:04:12.100> runs<00:04:12.310> with<00:04:12.489> these<00:04:12.670> at<00:04:13.180> all<00:04:15.359> also

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
breaking big runs with these at all also

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:17.969 
breaking big runs with these at all also
again<00:04:16.479> the<00:04:16.930> next<00:04:17.200> one<00:04:17.350> within<00:04:17.560> the<00:04:17.799> near

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
again the next one within the near

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.000 
again the next one within the near
formation<00:04:18.489> this<00:04:19.329> time<00:04:19.630> it's<00:04:19.959> the<00:04:20.169> x<00:04:20.470> option

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
formation this time it's the x option

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.540 
formation this time it's the x option
and<00:04:21.300> you<00:04:22.300> have<00:04:23.229> multiple<00:04:23.470> reads<00:04:24.010> in<00:04:24.190> this<00:04:24.340> one

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
and you have multiple reads in this one

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.550 
and you have multiple reads in this one
so<00:04:24.760> it's<00:04:24.909> a<00:04:24.970> pretty<00:04:25.150> versatile<00:04:25.720> play

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
so it's a pretty versatile play

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.110 
so it's a pretty versatile play
really<00:04:27.130> depends<00:04:27.490> on<00:04:27.550> whether<00:04:27.730> you're<00:04:27.910> facing

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
really depends on whether you're facing

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.480 
really depends on whether you're facing
a<00:04:28.330> rush<00:04:28.540> or<00:04:28.810> if<00:04:29.139> you<00:04:29.260> have<00:04:29.380> time<00:04:29.440> for<00:04:30.400> your
