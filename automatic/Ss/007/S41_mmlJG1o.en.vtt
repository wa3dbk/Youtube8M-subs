together<00:00:14.480> what's<00:00:15.480> really<00:00:15.750> nice<00:00:15.870> about<00:00:15.929> the

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
together what's really nice about the

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:25.310 
together what's really nice about the
canine<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:18.199> he<00:00:19.199> has<00:00:19.529> pull<00:00:20.160> back<00:00:20.369> action<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:24.320> like

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
canine is he has pull back action I like

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.410 
canine is he has pull back action I like
that<00:00:25.470> quite<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.769> lot<00:00:25.890> on<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.519> top<00:00:26.760> if<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.060> push

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
that quite a lot on the top if you push

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.470 
that quite a lot on the top if you push
his<00:00:27.630> control<00:00:27.960> panel<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.500> opens<00:00:28.800> up<00:00:29.150> his<00:00:30.150> side

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
his control panel it opens up his side

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:41.619 
his control panel it opens up his side
and<00:00:31.070> you<00:00:32.070> can<00:00:32.219> see<00:00:32.460> inside<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.969> him<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:37.730> back

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.779 

the<00:00:42.629> only<00:00:42.840> thing<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.140> wish<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.770> his<00:00:44.430> head

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
the only thing I wish is that his head

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.060 
the only thing I wish is that his head
had<00:00:45.090> some<00:00:45.360> more<00:00:45.510> movement<00:00:46.020> since<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.649> has<00:00:46.770> none

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
had some more movement since it has none

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.299 
had some more movement since it has none
if<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:48.180> notice<00:00:48.570> there's<00:00:49.079> no<00:00:49.410> articulation<00:00:50.070> in

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
if you notice there's no articulation in

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.790 
if you notice there's no articulation in
his<00:00:50.430> neck<00:00:50.730> now<00:00:51.510> obviously<00:00:51.719> in<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.230> doctor<00:00:52.590> who

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
his neck now obviously in the doctor who

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.889 
his neck now obviously in the doctor who
series<00:00:53.160> he<00:00:53.520> didn't<00:00:53.730> really<00:00:53.969> have<00:00:54.180> any<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.750> that

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
series he didn't really have any so that

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.660 
series he didn't really have any so that
would<00:00:55.020> make<00:00:55.170> sense<00:00:55.230> but<00:00:55.800> at<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.980> same<00:00:56.160> time<00:00:56.399> it

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
would make sense but at the same time it

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.420 
would make sense but at the same time it
probably<00:00:57.030> would<00:00:57.210> be<00:00:57.329> nice<00:00:57.949> proposing<00:00:58.949> him<00:00:59.190> if

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
probably would be nice proposing him if

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.950 
probably would be nice proposing him if
you<00:00:59.579> could<00:00:59.760> change<00:01:00.059> his<00:01:00.210> head<00:01:00.390> direction<00:01:00.899> a

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
you could change his head direction a

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.800 
you could change his head direction a
little<00:01:00.989> bit<00:01:01.969> now<00:01:02.969> when<00:01:03.660> we<00:01:03.780> get<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.080> Rose

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
little bit now when we get to Rose

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.359 
little bit now when we get to Rose
you're<00:01:06.810> going<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.020> notice<00:01:07.200> her<00:01:07.860> head<00:01:08.100> doesn't

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
you're going to notice her head doesn't

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.780 
you're going to notice her head doesn't
have<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.610> lot<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.820> movement<00:01:09.439> her<00:01:10.439> hair<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:11.159> kind

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
have a lot of movement her hair is kind

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.240 
have a lot of movement her hair is kind
of<00:01:11.850> rubbery<00:01:12.119> which<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.689> kind<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:12.960> nice<00:01:13.250> she

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
of rubbery which is kind of nice she

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.730 
of rubbery which is kind of nice she
does<00:01:14.520> look<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:15.060> lot<00:01:17.030> like<00:01:18.030> she<00:01:18.240> does<00:01:18.390> on<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
does look a lot like she does on the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.179 
does look a lot like she does on the
television<00:01:19.740> show<00:01:21.439> it's<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.500> well<00:01:22.680> detailed

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
television show it's a well detailed

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.710 
television show it's a well detailed
figure<00:01:23.640> her<00:01:24.330> shirt<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:25.770> soft<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.340> rubbery

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
figure her shirt the soft and rubbery

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.899 
figure her shirt the soft and rubbery
now<00:01:27.720> one<00:01:27.990> thing<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.380> noticed<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.490> she

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
now one thing that I noticed is that she

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.210 
now one thing that I noticed is that she
has<00:01:30.240> some<00:01:30.720> really<00:01:30.930> interesting<00:01:31.290> articulation

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
has some really interesting articulation

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.499 
has some really interesting articulation
that<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.430> don't<00:01:32.610> normally<00:01:32.759> see<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.360> action

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
that you don't normally see in action

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.319 
that you don't normally see in action
figure<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:35.520> fact<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.939> she<00:01:36.180> can

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
figure and that is the fact that she can

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.130 
figure and that is the fact that she can
actually<00:01:36.570> straddle<00:01:38.479> usually<00:01:39.479> action<00:01:39.810> figures

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
actually straddle usually action figures

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.380 
actually straddle usually action figures
legs<00:01:40.520> typically<00:01:41.520> just<00:01:41.670> go<00:01:41.850> forward<00:01:42.299> and

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
legs typically just go forward and

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.690 
legs typically just go forward and
backwards<00:01:44.720> there's<00:01:45.720> her<00:01:45.930> common<00:01:46.409> knee

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
backwards there's her common knee

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.620 
backwards there's her common knee
articulation<00:01:48.200> but<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.409> one<00:01:49.680> as<00:01:50.240> you<00:01:51.240> can<00:01:51.329> see

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
articulation but this one as you can see

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.490 
articulation but this one as you can see
is<00:01:51.780> hinged<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.680> legs<00:01:52.890> go<00:01:53.040> sideways<00:01:54.500> that's

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
is hinged so the legs go sideways that's

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.590 
is hinged so the legs go sideways that's
most<00:01:55.770> likely<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.399> make<00:01:56.579> up<00:01:56.759> for<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.030> fact<00:01:57.060> that

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
most likely to make up for the fact that

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.959 
most likely to make up for the fact that
if<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:57.990> look<00:01:58.229> there<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.979> no<00:01:59.189> articulation<00:01:59.790> on

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
if you look there is no articulation on

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.530 
if you look there is no articulation on
her<00:02:00.119> elbow<00:02:00.479> or<00:02:00.750> her<00:02:01.590> wrist<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.299> that's<00:02:03.299> most

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
her elbow or her wrist and that's most

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.090 
her elbow or her wrist and that's most
likely<00:02:03.630> probably<00:02:04.350> due<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.740> fact<00:02:04.920> that

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
likely probably due to the fact that

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.969 
likely probably due to the fact that
because<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.820> her<00:02:05.850> female<00:02:06.329> figure<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.799> would

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
because of her female figure it would

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.869 
because of her female figure it would
look<00:02:08.129> strange<00:02:08.429> if<00:02:08.940> she<00:02:09.090> had<00:02:09.330> big<00:02:10.459> hinges<00:02:11.459> on

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
look strange if she had big hinges on

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.550 
look strange if she had big hinges on
the<00:02:12.569> side

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
the side

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.009 
the side
so<00:02:14.560> it<00:02:14.980> also<00:02:15.370> comes<00:02:15.640> with<00:02:15.760> what<00:02:16.510> appears<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:16.989> be

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
so it also comes with what appears to be

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:22.709 
so it also comes with what appears to be
a<00:02:17.159> collectible<00:02:18.159> card<00:02:18.489> game<00:02:21.480> I've<00:02:22.480> never

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:22.719 
a collectible card game I've never

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:24.449 
a collectible card game I've never
really<00:02:23.049> gotten<00:02:23.079> into<00:02:23.409> the<00:02:23.680> card<00:02:23.920> game<00:02:24.129> thing

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
really gotten into the card game thing

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.059 
really gotten into the card game thing
so<00:02:24.909> I<00:02:25.209> have<00:02:25.510> no<00:02:25.750> clue<00:02:26.109> how<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.319> play<00:02:26.620> it<00:02:26.799> or<00:02:26.920> what

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
so I have no clue how to play it or what

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.920 
so I have no clue how to play it or what
you<00:02:27.219> do<00:02:27.340> with<00:02:27.519> it<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.930> can<00:02:28.959> see<00:02:29.230> this<00:02:29.379> is<00:02:29.530> Dalek

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
you do with it you can see this is Dalek

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.160 
you do with it you can see this is Dalek
still<00:02:31.930> kind<00:02:32.109> of<00:02:32.170> neat<00:02:32.319> to<00:02:32.470> have<00:02:33.870> here<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:34.959> is<00:02:35.049> in

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
still kind of neat to have here it is in
