recap of the sealed pools over the

recap of the sealed pools over the
weekend<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:25.529> pre-released<00:00:26.220> weekend<00:00:26.490> was<00:00:26.880> ok

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
weekend so pre-released weekend was ok

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.509 
weekend so pre-released weekend was ok
for<00:00:27.750> me<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.289> went<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.859> two<00:00:29.189> different

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
for me I went to two different

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.620 
for me I went to two different
tournaments<00:00:30.470> um<00:00:31.470> what<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.250> found<00:00:32.460> out<00:00:32.669> was<00:00:32.730> my

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
tournaments um what I found out was my

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.479 
tournaments um what I found out was my
predictions<00:00:34.050> were<00:00:34.200> mostly<00:00:34.559> right<00:00:34.829> but<00:00:35.219> for

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
predictions were mostly right but for

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.150 
predictions were mostly right but for
the<00:00:35.640> format<00:00:36.000> especially<00:00:36.570> in<00:00:36.719> sealed<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.320> bit

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
the format especially in sealed is a bit

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.610 
the format especially in sealed is a bit
slow<00:00:38.420> now<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.480> one<00:00:39.660> mistake<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:40.050> made<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.440> like

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
slow now the one mistake I made is like

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.850 
slow now the one mistake I made is like
you<00:00:41.219> it's<00:00:42.000> slow<00:00:42.390> but<00:00:42.690> what<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:42.989> can't<00:00:43.290> do<00:00:43.559> is

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
you it's slow but what you can't do is

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.529 
you it's slow but what you can't do is
expect<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.550> not<00:00:44.730> play<00:00:44.969> anything<00:00:45.180> for<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
expect to not play anything for the

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.630 
expect to not play anything for the
first<00:00:45.719> two<00:00:45.960> or<00:00:46.050> three<00:00:46.230> turns<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.860> then<00:00:47.370> expect

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
first two or three turns and then expect

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.729 
first two or three turns and then expect
to<00:00:47.760> win<00:00:47.879> from<00:00:48.059> there<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.989> still<00:00:49.230> need<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.440> curve

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
to win from there you still need a curve

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.130 
to win from there you still need a curve
you<00:00:49.950> still<00:00:50.129> need<00:00:50.309> one<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.670> two<00:00:50.850> drops<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
you still need one in two drops the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.049 
you still need one in two drops the
thing<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.500> once<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.309> start<00:00:53.520> playing<00:00:53.610> one<00:00:53.940> and

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
thing is once you start playing one and

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.549 
thing is once you start playing one and
two<00:00:54.149> drops<00:00:54.420> they<00:00:54.719> play<00:00:54.930> one<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.199> two<00:00:55.289> drops

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
two drops they play one and two drops

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.770 
two drops they play one and two drops
most<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.640> those<00:00:56.730> one<00:00:56.940> or<00:00:56.969> two<00:00:57.149> drops<00:00:57.329> are<00:00:57.629> going

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
most of those one or two drops are going

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.180 
most of those one or two drops are going
to<00:00:57.899> spend<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.260> rest<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.620> game<00:00:58.739> looking<00:00:59.010> at

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
to spend the rest of the game looking at

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.520 
to spend the rest of the game looking at
each<00:00:59.309> other<00:00:59.460> from<00:00:59.850> across<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.180> battlefield

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
each other from across the battlefield

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.560 
each other from across the battlefield
so<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.489> kind<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.789> slow<00:01:02.969> format<00:01:03.390> you

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
so it's that kind of slow format you

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.729 
so it's that kind of slow format you
know<00:01:03.660> then<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.019> start<00:01:04.229> playing<00:01:04.470> your<00:01:04.589> end

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
know then you start playing your end

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.460 
know then you start playing your end
junk<00:01:04.949> walls<00:01:05.220> you're<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> seraph<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.750> Dawn's<00:01:06.960> and

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
junk walls you're a seraph of Dawn's and

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.890 
junk walls you're a seraph of Dawn's and
you<00:01:08.040> know<00:01:08.280> then<00:01:08.580> eventually<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:09.210> ramp<00:01:09.510> up<00:01:09.659> and

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
you know then eventually you ramp up and

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.870 
you know then eventually you ramp up and
catch<00:01:10.080> your<00:01:10.260> big<00:01:10.439> bomb<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.010> whoever<00:01:11.250> cast<00:01:11.580> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
catch your big bomb and whoever cast the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.870 
catch your big bomb and whoever cast the
big<00:01:12.030> bomb<00:01:12.210> first<00:01:12.479> wins<00:01:12.799> so<00:01:13.799> it's<00:01:14.159> it's

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
big bomb first wins so it's it's

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.080 
big bomb first wins so it's it's
actually<00:01:15.180> not<00:01:15.299> my<00:01:15.479> favorite<00:01:15.810> format<00:01:16.259> I

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
actually not my favorite format I

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.640 
actually not my favorite format I
preferred<00:01:18.090> innistrad<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.840> lot<00:01:19.080> more<00:01:19.290> but<00:01:19.590> you

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
preferred innistrad a lot more but you

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.310 
preferred innistrad a lot more but you
know<00:01:19.830> we'll<00:01:20.490> see<00:01:20.520> how<00:01:20.909> draft<00:01:21.330> turns<00:01:21.600> out<00:01:21.810> and

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
know we'll see how draft turns out and

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.100 
know we'll see how draft turns out and
in<00:01:23.220> terms<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.790> color<00:01:24.000> predictions<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.750> said

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
in terms of the color predictions I said

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.100 
in terms of the color predictions I said
in<00:01:25.290> my<00:01:25.320> previous<00:01:25.619> video<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.330> white<00:01:27.330> green

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
in my previous video that white green

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.340 
in my previous video that white green
and<00:01:28.380> blue<00:01:28.829> or<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.340> colors<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.790> be<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.170> was<00:01:31.170> right

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
and blue or the colors to be I was right

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.530 
and blue or the colors to be I was right
for<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.560> most<00:01:31.710> part<00:01:32.090> obviously<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.390> all

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
for the most part obviously this is all

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.359 
for the most part obviously this is all
anecdotal<00:01:33.840> evidence<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.829> might<00:01:34.860> have

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
anecdotal evidence you might have

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.100 
anecdotal evidence you might have
evidence<00:01:35.759> contradicting<00:01:36.390> me<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.720> that's

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
evidence contradicting me and that's

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.410 
evidence contradicting me and that's
fine<00:01:37.229> go<00:01:38.189> ahead<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.579> voice<00:01:38.880> your<00:01:39.060> opinion

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
fine go ahead and a voice your opinion

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.480 
fine go ahead and a voice your opinion
if<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.570> do<00:01:39.689> but<00:01:40.500> at<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.950> first<00:01:41.070> pre<00:01:41.369> release

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
if you do but at the first pre release

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.969 
if you do but at the first pre release

something<00:05:41.139> for<00:05:41.289> one<00:05:41.520> not<00:05:42.520> too<00:05:42.669> terrible<00:05:43.090> but

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:43.930 
something for one not too terrible but

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.960 
something for one not too terrible but
if<00:05:44.200> you<00:05:44.320> want<00:05:44.530> the<00:05:44.740> true<00:05:45.190> synergies<00:05:45.610> you<00:05:45.820> gotta

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
if you want the true synergies you gotta

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.940 
if you want the true synergies you gotta
you<00:05:46.810> gotta<00:05:46.930> start<00:05:47.110> looking<00:05:47.139> to<00:05:47.470> the<00:05:47.500> other

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
you gotta start looking to the other

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.580 
you gotta start looking to the other
colors<00:05:48.190> so<00:05:48.580> for<00:05:49.389> example<00:05:49.450> Cathars<00:05:50.139> crusade

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
colors so for example Cathars crusade

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.529 
colors so for example Cathars crusade
when<00:05:51.460> a<00:05:51.490> creature<00:05:51.760> enters<00:05:52.240> the<00:05:52.419> battlefield

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:52.539 
when a creature enters the battlefield

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:54.330 
when a creature enters the battlefield
put<00:05:53.080> a<00:05:53.110> plus<00:05:53.380> one<00:05:53.530> plus<00:05:53.620> one<00:05:53.740> counter<00:05:54.160> on

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
put a plus one plus one counter on

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.460 
put a plus one plus one counter on
Audrey<00:05:54.669> features<00:05:55.000> so<00:05:55.930> that<00:05:55.960> means<00:05:56.260> when<00:05:56.380> you

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
Audrey features so that means when you

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.909 
Audrey features so that means when you
cast<00:05:57.000> natural<00:05:58.000> revolt<00:05:58.330> every<00:05:59.320> wonder

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 
cast natural revolt every wonder

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:01.469 
cast natural revolt every wonder
creature<00:06:00.039> gets<00:06:00.400> plus<00:06:00.580> three<00:06:01.270> plus<00:06:01.300> three

creature gets plus three plus three

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:04.020 
creature gets plus three plus three
counters<00:06:02.250> and<00:06:03.250> that's<00:06:03.460> pretty<00:06:03.639> good<00:06:03.760> you<00:06:04.000> know

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
counters and that's pretty good you know

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.120 
counters and that's pretty good you know
an<00:06:04.270> awfully<00:06:04.720> the<00:06:05.110> tokens<00:06:05.500> themselves<00:06:05.919> also

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
an awfully the tokens themselves also

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.879 
an awfully the tokens themselves also
get<00:06:06.430> the<00:06:06.550> bonus<00:06:06.699> so<00:06:07.000> you're<00:06:07.150> attacking<00:06:07.449> with

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:07.889

get the bonus so you're attacking with
344<00:06:08.889> hey<00:06:09.070> stirs<00:06:09.310> and<00:06:10.710> so<00:06:11.710> if<00:06:11.830> you<00:06:11.860> can't<00:06:12.220> afford

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
344 hey stirs and so if you can't afford

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.790 
344 hey stirs and so if you can't afford
that<00:06:12.970> rare<00:06:13.240> there's<00:06:13.570> also<00:06:13.720> an<00:06:13.870> uncommon<00:06:14.289> that

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
that rare there's also an uncommon that

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.950 
that rare there's also an uncommon that
does<00:06:15.010> the<00:06:15.370> same<00:06:15.610> thing<00:06:15.910> kind<00:06:16.270> of<00:06:16.360> the<00:06:16.570> name

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960

does the same thing kind of the name
gold<00:06:17.229> night<00:06:17.410> commander<00:06:17.860> you<00:06:18.669> know<00:06:18.760> when<00:06:19.330> I

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:19.360 
gold night commander you know when I

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.879 
gold night commander you know when I
creature<00:06:19.660> enters<00:06:20.229> the<00:06:20.289> battlefield<00:06:20.410> your

creature enters the battlefield your

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:23.939 
creature enters the battlefield your
creatures<00:06:21.220> get<00:06:21.370> +1<00:06:21.849> +1<00:06:22.030> until<00:06:22.660> end<00:06:22.840> of<00:06:22.870> turn<00:06:22.949> so

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:23.949 
creatures get +1 +1 until end of turn so

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:26.129 
creatures get +1 +1 until end of turn so
it's<00:06:24.190> a<00:06:24.250> temporary<00:06:24.580> boost<00:06:24.880> but<00:06:25.330> you<00:06:25.870> know<00:06:25.990> a

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:26.139 
it's a temporary boost but you know a

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:28.010 
it's a temporary boost but you know a
lot<00:06:26.349> of<00:06:26.380> symmetry<00:06:26.710> with<00:06:26.889> natural<00:06:27.250> revolt<00:06:27.490> and

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
lot of symmetry with natural revolt and

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.000 
lot of symmetry with natural revolt and
the<00:06:29.020> other<00:06:29.199> color<00:06:29.440> that<00:06:29.650> has<00:06:29.770> a<00:06:29.800> lot<00:06:29.979> of

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.010 
the other color that has a lot of

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.529 
the other color that has a lot of
symmetry<00:06:30.370> with<00:06:30.520> natural<00:06:30.789> revolt<00:06:31.060> would<00:06:31.419> be

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:31.539 
symmetry with natural revolt would be

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:36.029 
symmetry with natural revolt would be
black<00:06:33.150> so<00:06:34.150> yeah<00:06:34.660> it's<00:06:34.840> a<00:06:34.990> blood<00:06:35.530> artists

black so yeah it's a blood artists
that's<00:06:36.280> 01<00:06:36.789> when<00:06:37.030> a<00:06:37.060> creature<00:06:37.240> dies<00:06:37.539> you<00:06:38.320> know
