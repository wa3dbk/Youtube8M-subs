basic this is a real simple recipe it

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.750 
basic this is a real simple recipe it
produces<00:00:14.630> a<00:00:14.660> very<00:00:15.050> very<00:00:15.320> neutral<00:00:15.710> spirit<00:00:16.160> but

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
produces a very very neutral spirit but

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.700 
produces a very very neutral spirit but
it's<00:00:16.939> so<00:00:17.180> easy<00:00:17.420> to<00:00:17.630> do<00:00:17.810> just<00:00:18.050> thought<00:00:18.470> I'd<00:00:18.590> do<00:00:18.680> a

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
it's so easy to do just thought I'd do a

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.380 
it's so easy to do just thought I'd do a
real<00:00:18.950> quick<00:00:18.980> video<00:00:19.369> because<00:00:19.670> it<00:00:19.850> only<00:00:19.970> takes<00:00:20.090> a

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
real quick video because it only takes a

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.970 
real quick video because it only takes a
couple<00:00:20.420> of<00:00:20.750> minutes<00:00:20.869> there's<00:00:21.470> no<00:00:21.619> cooking

the sugar in one bucket but water from
another<00:01:57.830> bucket<00:01:58.370> I<00:01:58.460> poured<00:01:58.790> it<00:01:58.909> in<00:01:59.090> you<00:01:59.300> know

another bucket I poured it in you know

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.820 
another bucket I poured it in you know
mix<00:01:59.659> it<00:01:59.810> up<00:01:59.960> then<00:02:00.080> I'll<00:02:00.170> pour<00:02:00.350> it<00:02:00.470> back<00:02:00.500> and

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
mix it up then I'll pour it back and

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.800 
mix it up then I'll pour it back and
forth<00:02:01.040> to<00:02:01.100> air<00:02:01.310> rate<00:02:01.580> because<00:02:01.790> AXA<00:02:02.390> j'en<00:02:02.540> is<00:02:02.690> an

important function in in the actual

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.850 
important function in in the actual
fermentation<00:02:05.870> and<00:02:06.050> for<00:02:06.229> fermentation<00:02:06.530> you

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
fermentation and for fermentation you

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.619 
fermentation and for fermentation you
don't<00:02:07.010> want<00:02:07.130> any<00:02:07.250> oxygen<00:02:07.670> but<00:02:07.850> you<00:02:08.390> got<00:02:08.539> to

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
don't want any oxygen but you got to

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.839 
don't want any oxygen but you got to
have<00:02:08.750> oxygen<00:02:08.899> to<00:02:09.259> get<00:02:09.379> to<00:02:09.530> get<00:02:09.649> it<00:02:09.769> started<00:02:09.950> so

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
have oxygen to get to get it started so

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.099 
have oxygen to get to get it started so
we're<00:02:11.090> going<00:02:11.209> to<00:02:11.269> do<00:02:11.329> that<00:02:11.450> real<00:02:11.689> quick<00:02:11.930> and

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829 
know we always use the stars' and a

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:24.190 
know we always use the stars' and a
quick<00:02:22.099> spray<00:02:22.459> a<00:02:22.489> shake<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.209> I<00:02:23.629> can<00:02:24.019> start

quick spray a shake and I can start
using<00:02:24.439> that<00:02:24.739> now<00:02:24.980> I<00:02:25.010> did<00:02:25.310> sanitize<00:02:25.939> the

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
using that now I did sanitize the

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.580 
using that now I did sanitize the
buckets<00:02:26.480> before<00:02:26.599> I<00:02:26.840> started<00:02:27.140> using<00:02:27.349> them

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
buckets before I started using them

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.670 
buckets before I started using them
we're<00:02:28.579> going<00:02:28.819> to<00:02:29.319> dump<00:02:30.319> the<00:02:31.000> sugar<00:02:32.500> which<00:02:33.500> is<00:02:33.530> a

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
we're going to dump the sugar which is a

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.490 
we're going to dump the sugar which is a
real<00:02:34.069> simple<00:02:34.549> just<00:02:34.579> a<00:02:34.849> dump<00:02:35.090> now<00:02:35.359> if<00:02:35.989> you<00:02:36.109> using

real simple just a dump now if you using

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.410 
real simple just a dump now if you using
table<00:02:36.890> sugar<00:02:37.099> that<00:02:37.340> works<00:02:37.579> just<00:02:37.879> as<00:02:38.000> well<00:02:38.030> too

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
table sugar that works just as well too

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.940 
table sugar that works just as well too
you<00:02:38.569> may<00:02:38.720> find<00:02:39.019> though<00:02:39.290> that<00:02:39.500> you<00:02:39.650> have<00:02:39.799> to

for<00:02:42.379> the<00:02:42.500> for<00:02:43.189> the<00:02:43.250> sugar<00:02:43.430> to<00:02:43.700> dissolve<00:02:43.750> but<00:02:44.750> if

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
for the for the sugar to dissolve but if

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.050 
for the for the sugar to dissolve but if
you're<00:02:44.959> using<00:02:45.140> corn<00:02:45.530> sugar<00:02:45.859> corn<00:02:46.849> sugar

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.420 
just trying to aerate the wash so it's
got<00:03:13.790> some<00:03:13.819> oxygen<00:03:14.299> in<00:03:14.540> it<00:03:14.739> you'll<00:03:15.739> also<00:03:15.950> notice

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
got some oxygen in it you'll also notice

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.360 
got some oxygen in it you'll also notice
that<00:03:16.579> if<00:03:16.730> you're<00:03:16.879> using<00:03:16.909> a<00:03:17.329> taping<00:03:17.870> sugar<00:03:18.370> once

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
that if you're using a taping sugar once

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.390 
that if you're using a taping sugar once
you<00:03:19.459> make<00:03:19.639> this<00:03:19.849> mix<00:03:20.180> this<00:03:21.019> mix<00:03:21.440> will<00:03:21.650> be<00:03:21.709> like

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
you make this mix this mix will be like

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.939 
you make this mix this mix will be like
a<00:03:22.430> greenish<00:03:22.849> blue<00:03:23.359> and<00:03:24.199> it<00:03:24.440> makes<00:03:24.620> you<00:03:24.739> wonder

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:24.949 
a greenish blue and it makes you wonder

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:27.369 
a greenish blue and it makes you wonder
why<00:03:25.310> if<00:03:25.760> it's<00:03:26.000> white<00:03:26.239> sugar<00:03:26.569> in<00:03:26.840> clear<00:03:27.079> water

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:27.379 
why if it's white sugar in clear water

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:30.849 
why if it's white sugar in clear water
and<00:03:27.699> if<00:03:28.699> you<00:03:28.819> use<00:03:29.060> corn<00:03:29.359> sugar<00:03:29.660> you'll<00:03:30.530> notice

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
and if you use corn sugar you'll notice

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:32.920 
and if you use corn sugar you'll notice
that<00:03:30.949> it's<00:03:31.129> just<00:03:31.459> too<00:03:31.549> clear<00:03:31.819> just<00:03:32.690> the

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
that it's just too clear just the

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.330 
that it's just too clear just the
water's<00:03:33.230> just<00:03:33.440> as<00:03:33.530> clear<00:03:33.739> as<00:03:33.829> it<00:03:33.919> was<00:03:34.069> when<00:03:34.250> you

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
water's just as clear as it was when you

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.390 
water's just as clear as it was when you
started<00:03:34.639> so<00:03:35.480> that's<00:03:35.840> it<00:03:36.079> for<00:03:36.319> actually<00:03:36.980> mixing

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
started so that's it for actually mixing

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.129 
started so that's it for actually mixing
it<00:03:37.519> the<00:03:37.639> only<00:03:37.760> last<00:03:38.180> thing<00:03:38.269> I'll<00:03:38.510> do<00:03:38.690> just<00:03:38.989> for

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:39.139 
it the only last thing I'll do just for

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.039 
it the only last thing I'll do just for
simplicity<00:03:39.560> is<00:03:40.090> I'm<00:03:41.090> going<00:03:41.239> to<00:03:41.299> add<00:03:41.419> the<00:03:41.659> yeast

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
simplicity is I'm going to add the yeast

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.589 
simplicity is I'm going to add the yeast
nutrient<00:03:42.650> here<00:03:43.129> so<00:03:43.609> that<00:03:43.790> when<00:03:43.940> I<00:03:43.970> put<00:03:44.239> it<00:03:44.329> into

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 
nutrient here so that when I put it into

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.770 
nutrient here so that when I put it into
the<00:03:44.750> fast<00:03:45.260> ferment<00:03:45.739> it's<00:03:45.889> already<00:03:46.280> mixed<00:03:46.780> so

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
the fast ferment it's already mixed so

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.960 
the fast ferment it's already mixed so
that's<00:03:48.109> a<00:03:48.199> real<00:03:48.379> quick<00:03:48.409> mix<00:03:51.340> so<00:03:52.340> in<00:03:52.549> just<00:03:52.819> a

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
that's a real quick mix so in just a

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.490 
that's a real quick mix so in just a
second<00:03:53.329> here<00:03:53.419> we'll<00:03:53.569> get<00:03:53.659> set<00:03:53.930> back<00:03:54.139> up<00:03:54.349> and

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
second here we'll get set back up and

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.710 
second here we'll get set back up and
we're<00:03:54.620> going<00:03:54.709> to<00:03:54.829> transfer<00:03:55.250> this<00:03:55.549> into<00:03:56.449> the

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
we're going to transfer this into the

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.680 
we're going to transfer this into the
fast<00:03:56.930> ferment<00:03:57.470> pitch<00:03:57.799> our<00:03:58.010> yeast<00:03:58.280> and<00:03:58.690> we're

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
fast ferment pitch our yeast and we're

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.149 
fast ferment pitch our yeast and we're
going<00:03:59.810> to<00:03:59.840> call<00:03:59.989> it<00:04:00.139> a<00:04:00.229> day<00:04:00.470> all<00:04:00.739> right<00:04:00.979> we're

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:01.159 
going to call it a day all right we're

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.569 
going to call it a day all right we're
back

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
back

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:03.789 
back
we've<00:04:01.970> just<00:04:02.209> mixed<00:04:02.569> up<00:04:02.659> the<00:04:02.930> sugar<00:04:03.560> in<00:04:03.709> the

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
we've just mixed up the sugar in the

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.379 
we've just mixed up the sugar in the
water<00:04:04.010> you<00:04:04.250> know<00:04:04.340> I've<00:04:04.459> already<00:04:04.639> got<00:04:04.909> like<00:04:05.150> two

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:05.389 
water you know I've already got like two

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:06.909 
water you know I've already got like two
gallons<00:04:05.750> here<00:04:05.930> and<00:04:06.049> I've<00:04:06.109> got<00:04:06.139> three<00:04:06.530> gallons

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:06.919 
gallons here and I've got three gallons

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:08.710 
gallons here and I've got three gallons
sitting<00:04:07.220> there<00:04:07.430> and<00:04:08.090> all<00:04:08.329> I'm<00:04:08.449> going<00:04:08.569> to<00:04:08.629> do

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
sitting there and all I'm going to do

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.599 
sitting there and all I'm going to do
now<00:04:08.870> is<00:04:09.109> just<00:04:09.290> transfer<00:04:09.889> it<00:04:09.919> from<00:04:10.190> the<00:04:10.280> bucket

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
now is just transfer it from the bucket

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:12.250 
now is just transfer it from the bucket
which<00:04:10.970> I've<00:04:11.120> already<00:04:11.239> aerated<00:04:11.870> I'm<00:04:12.049> going<00:04:12.199> to

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
which I've already aerated I'm going to

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.839 
which I've already aerated I'm going to
transfer<00:04:12.590> it<00:04:12.650> right<00:04:12.739> into<00:04:13.099> the<00:04:13.190> fast<00:04:13.400> ferment

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
transfer it right into the fast ferment

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:15.490 
transfer it right into the fast ferment
hey<00:04:14.239> one<00:04:14.419> of<00:04:14.479> the<00:04:14.540> easiest<00:04:14.840> ways<00:04:15.049> to<00:04:15.079> do<00:04:15.349> that

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
hey one of the easiest ways to do that

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.800 
hey one of the easiest ways to do that
well<00:04:15.680> there's<00:04:15.889> a<00:04:15.949> couple<00:04:15.979> ways<00:04:16.510> one<00:04:17.510> would<00:04:17.720> be

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
well there's a couple ways one would be

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.210 
well there's a couple ways one would be
to<00:04:17.930> pick<00:04:18.049> up<00:04:18.229> this<00:04:18.349> three<00:04:18.590> gallon<00:04:18.889> bucket<00:04:19.190> and

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
to pick up this three gallon bucket and

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.920 
to pick up this three gallon bucket and
try<00:04:19.400> to<00:04:19.459> pour<00:04:19.729> it<00:04:19.849> of<00:04:19.940> course<00:04:20.090> even<00:04:20.810> though<00:04:20.900> I

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
try to pour it of course even though I

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.469 
try to pour it of course even though I
got<00:04:21.139> a<00:04:21.169> big<00:04:21.409> 6-inch<00:04:21.889> hole<00:04:22.099> here<00:04:22.430> you<00:04:23.090> tend<00:04:23.389> to

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
got a big 6-inch hole here you tend to

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:24.909 
got a big 6-inch hole here you tend to
get<00:04:23.630> sloppy<00:04:24.020> or<00:04:24.169> spilling<00:04:24.529> all<00:04:24.650> over<00:04:24.680> the

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
get sloppy or spilling all over the

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.629 
get sloppy or spilling all over the
place<00:04:25.010> I<00:04:25.340> took<00:04:25.400> one<00:04:25.700> of<00:04:25.789> my<00:04:25.849> old<00:04:26.029> distilling<00:04:26.659> of

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
place I took one of my old distilling of

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.059 
place I took one of my old distilling of
a<00:04:27.699> jugs<00:04:28.659> of<00:04:28.840> distilled<00:04:29.229> water<00:04:29.439> that<00:04:29.650> I<00:04:29.710> use<00:04:29.889> for

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:30.069 
a jugs of distilled water that I use for

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:32.459 
a jugs of distilled water that I use for
mixing<00:04:30.430> I<00:04:30.610> just<00:04:31.360> cut<00:04:31.479> the<00:04:31.569> top<00:04:31.749> out<00:04:31.930> of<00:04:31.990> it<00:04:32.289> and

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:32.469 
mixing I just cut the top out of it and

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:35.369 
mixing I just cut the top out of it and
so<00:04:32.740> I<00:04:32.800> got<00:04:33.310> myself<00:04:33.430> a<00:04:34.050> really<00:04:35.050> a<00:04:35.080> water

00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:35.379 
so I got myself a really a water

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:39.570 
so I got myself a really a water
transfer<00:04:35.979> gizmo<00:04:36.460> so<00:04:36.819> what<00:04:37.090> I'll<00:04:37.180> do<00:04:37.389> is<00:04:38.580> I'll

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
transfer gizmo so what I'll do is I'll

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.339 
transfer gizmo so what I'll do is I'll
reach<00:04:39.789> in<00:04:39.999> and<00:04:40.800> fill<00:04:41.800> that<00:04:41.830> up<00:04:43.020> and<00:04:44.020> I'm<00:04:44.199> just

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349 
reach in and fill that up and I'm just

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:48.269 
reach in and fill that up and I'm just
going<00:04:44.469> to<00:04:44.560> transfer<00:04:44.800> this<00:04:46.529> into<00:04:47.529> here<00:04:48.069> now

00:04:48.269 --> 00:04:48.279 
going to transfer this into here now

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:49.140 
going to transfer this into here now
you'll<00:04:48.430> notice<00:04:48.669> you're<00:04:48.789> going<00:04:48.909> to<00:04:48.969> get<00:04:49.120> a

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
you'll notice you're going to get a

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.119 
you'll notice you're going to get a
little<00:04:49.419> tiny<00:04:49.779> spillage<00:04:50.289> but<00:04:50.469> that<00:04:50.620> spillage

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:51.129 
little tiny spillage but that spillage

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:52.769 
little tiny spillage but that spillage
is<00:04:51.279> nothing<00:04:51.759> compared<00:04:52.300> to<00:04:52.360> what<00:04:52.599> you<00:04:52.749> could

00:04:52.769 --> 00:04:52.779 
is nothing compared to what you could

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:55.559 
is nothing compared to what you could
possibly<00:04:53.439> do<00:04:53.680> if<00:04:54.039> you<00:04:55.029> were<00:04:55.120> trying<00:04:55.330> to<00:04:55.360> pick

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:55.569 
possibly do if you were trying to pick

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:58.860 
possibly do if you were trying to pick
up<00:04:55.689> lift<00:04:56.110> that<00:04:56.229> whole<00:04:56.409> bucket<00:04:56.699> so<00:04:57.699> here<00:04:58.689> in<00:04:58.810> a

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
up lift that whole bucket so here in a

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.600 
up lift that whole bucket so here in a
few<00:04:59.050> moments<00:04:59.469> I'll<00:04:59.620> have<00:04:59.919> this<00:05:00.069> thing<00:05:00.340> full

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
few moments I'll have this thing full

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.990 
few moments I'll have this thing full
and<00:05:01.000> we'll<00:05:01.360> show<00:05:01.569> you<00:05:01.599> the<00:05:01.779> next<00:05:01.870> step<00:05:03.000> okay

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
and we'll show you the next step okay

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.179 
and we'll show you the next step okay
here<00:05:04.210> we're<00:05:04.479> back<00:05:04.689> we<00:05:05.379> just<00:05:05.590> poured<00:05:05.919> all<00:05:06.159> of

00:05:06.179 --> 00:05:06.189 
here we're back we just poured all of

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:08.309 
here we're back we just poured all of
the<00:05:06.340> the<00:05:07.150> last<00:05:07.360> of<00:05:07.539> the<00:05:07.629> mixture<00:05:07.930> in<00:05:08.080> here<00:05:08.139> and

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:08.319 
the the last of the mixture in here and

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:09.600 
the the last of the mixture in here and
I<00:05:08.349> showed<00:05:08.529> you<00:05:08.650> how<00:05:08.740> to<00:05:08.800> use<00:05:09.039> that<00:05:09.219> 1<00:05:09.400> gallon

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
I showed you how to use that 1 gallon

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.580 
I showed you how to use that 1 gallon
jug<00:05:10.029> so<00:05:10.300> now<00:05:10.840> we're<00:05:11.050> up<00:05:11.139> to<00:05:11.169> a<00:05:11.289> little<00:05:11.409> bit<00:05:11.469> over

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
jug so now we're up to a little bit over

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.469 
jug so now we're up to a little bit over
5<00:05:11.889> gallons<00:05:12.370> and<00:05:12.490> I've<00:05:12.550> got<00:05:12.669> my<00:05:12.789> master<00:05:13.120> ad<00:05:13.270> well

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
5 gallons and I've got my master ad well

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.050 
5 gallons and I've got my master ad well
the<00:05:13.870> last<00:05:14.050> step<00:05:14.349> is<00:05:14.529> really<00:05:14.740> is<00:05:14.949> to<00:05:15.159> to<00:05:15.759> add<00:05:15.909> the

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
the last step is really is to to add the

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.040 
the last step is really is to to add the
yeast<00:05:16.240> because<00:05:16.479> we've<00:05:16.599> already<00:05:16.719> put<00:05:16.960> the

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
yeast because we've already put the

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.689 
yeast because we've already put the
yeast<00:05:17.229> nutrient<00:05:17.710> in<00:05:17.889> we<00:05:18.039> took<00:05:18.219> that<00:05:18.370> short

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:18.699 
yeast nutrient in we took that short

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:20.429 
yeast nutrient in we took that short
step<00:05:19.000> to<00:05:19.180> show<00:05:19.330> a<00:05:19.360> shortcut<00:05:19.870> step<00:05:20.169> when<00:05:20.349> we

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:20.439 
step to show a shortcut step when we

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:22.740 
step to show a shortcut step when we
mixed<00:05:20.680> it<00:05:20.770> into<00:05:20.919> the<00:05:21.069> water<00:05:21.360> so<00:05:22.360> what<00:05:22.629> I'm

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
mixed it into the water so what I'm

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.059 
mixed it into the water so what I'm
going<00:05:22.839> to<00:05:22.900> do<00:05:22.990> now<00:05:23.139> is<00:05:23.289> just<00:05:23.469> introduce<00:05:23.889> the

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:24.069 
going to do now is just introduce the

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:25.170 
going to do now is just introduce the
yeast<00:05:24.339> and<00:05:24.520> then<00:05:24.610> we're<00:05:24.759> going<00:05:24.849> to<00:05:24.939> put<00:05:25.089> the

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
yeast and then we're going to put the

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.300 
yeast and then we're going to put the
lid<00:05:25.360> on<00:05:25.389> with<00:05:25.689> the<00:05:25.749> airlock<00:05:26.139> and<00:05:26.409> we're<00:05:27.219> gonna

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
lid on with the airlock and we're gonna

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.230 
lid on with the airlock and we're gonna
put<00:05:27.460> this<00:05:27.550> in<00:05:27.669> the<00:05:27.699> corner<00:05:27.969> and<00:05:28.029> let<00:05:28.150> it

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
put this in the corner and let it

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.170 
put this in the corner and let it
ferment<00:05:28.949> when<00:05:29.949> we<00:05:30.069> do<00:05:30.219> that<00:05:30.460> and<00:05:30.729> I<00:05:30.849> showed<00:05:31.060> you

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
ferment when we do that and I showed you

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.029 
ferment when we do that and I showed you
that<00:05:31.300> we<00:05:31.419> use<00:05:31.569> the<00:05:31.719> Daddy<00:05:31.930> yeast<00:05:32.289> just<00:05:32.740> the

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 
that we use the Daddy yeast just the

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:35.760 
that we use the Daddy yeast just the
distillers<00:05:33.729> active<00:05:34.180> dry<00:05:34.419> yeast<00:05:34.449> and<00:05:34.990> now

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
distillers active dry yeast and now

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.170 
distillers active dry yeast and now
you're<00:05:35.919> going<00:05:36.009> to<00:05:36.099> wonder<00:05:36.370> why<00:05:36.639> I'm<00:05:36.819> doing<00:05:37.089> it

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
you're going to wonder why I'm doing it

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.869 
you're going to wonder why I'm doing it
like<00:05:37.210> this<00:05:37.599> it's<00:05:37.870> a<00:05:37.960> big<00:05:38.139> tablespoon<00:05:38.879> that's

00:05:39.869 --> 00:05:39.879 
like this it's a big tablespoon that's

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:44.219 
like this it's a big tablespoon that's
one<00:05:41.879> that's<00:05:42.879> two<00:05:43.180> what<00:05:43.509> I<00:05:43.539> call<00:05:43.810> heaping

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:44.229 
one that's two what I call heaping

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:45.809 
one that's two what I call heaping
tablespoons<00:05:44.889> it<00:05:45.039> really<00:05:45.279> winds<00:05:45.580> up<00:05:45.669> being

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:45.819 
tablespoons it really winds up being

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:48.990 
tablespoons it really winds up being
about<00:05:46.120> one<00:05:46.389> point<00:05:46.599> three<00:05:46.930> ounces<00:05:46.960> or<00:05:47.620> 28<00:05:48.250> grams

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
about one point three ounces or 28 grams

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.869 
about one point three ounces or 28 grams
somewhere<00:05:49.870> like<00:05:50.050> that<00:05:50.080> but<00:05:50.550> remember<00:05:51.550> you<00:05:51.699> can

00:05:51.869 --> 00:05:51.879 
somewhere like that but remember you can

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:53.969 
somewhere like that but remember you can
pitch<00:05:52.120> not<00:05:52.569> enough<00:05:52.870> yeast<00:05:53.139> it's<00:05:53.500> kind<00:05:53.680> of<00:05:53.770> hard

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979 
pitch not enough yeast it's kind of hard

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:56.879 
pitch not enough yeast it's kind of hard
to<00:05:54.039> over<00:05:54.370> pitch<00:05:54.610> yeast<00:05:55.229> so<00:05:56.229> I've<00:05:56.500> got<00:05:56.649> enough

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:56.889 
to over pitch yeast so I've got enough

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:58.409 
to over pitch yeast so I've got enough
yeast<00:05:57.129> in<00:05:57.339> there<00:05:57.460> now<00:05:57.669> that'll<00:05:57.939> take<00:05:58.120> care<00:05:58.149> of

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
yeast in there now that'll take care of

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:00.600 
yeast in there now that'll take care of
that<00:05:58.569> and<00:05:58.839> that<00:05:59.080> bag<00:05:59.319> at<00:05:59.620> one<00:05:59.800> panel<00:06:00.189> last<00:06:00.399> me

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
that and that bag at one panel last me

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.879 
that and that bag at one panel last me
quite<00:06:00.639> a<00:06:00.909> while<00:06:01.029> you<00:06:01.930> one<00:06:02.169> of<00:06:02.259> the<00:06:02.319> last<00:06:02.560> things

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:02.889 
quite a while you one of the last things

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:04.350 
quite a while you one of the last things
I'm<00:06:03.069> going<00:06:03.189> to<00:06:03.250> do<00:06:03.370> now<00:06:03.580> is<00:06:03.849> now<00:06:04.000> that<00:06:04.149> I've<00:06:04.210> got

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
I'm going to do now is now that I've got

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.519 
I'm going to do now is now that I've got
the<00:06:04.479> yeast<00:06:04.659> in<00:06:04.899> there<00:06:04.990> and<00:06:05.110> you'll<00:06:05.199> notice<00:06:05.379> I

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:05.529 
the yeast in there and you'll notice I

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:06.899 
the yeast in there and you'll notice I
don't<00:06:05.589> really<00:06:05.919> have<00:06:06.099> to<00:06:06.279> stir<00:06:06.550> it<00:06:06.699> if<00:06:06.759> I<00:06:06.849> don't

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:06.909 
don't really have to stir it if I don't

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:08.369 
don't really have to stir it if I don't
want<00:06:07.060> to<00:06:07.360> I<00:06:07.389> could<00:06:07.629> just<00:06:07.659> leave<00:06:07.870> it<00:06:07.899> sit<00:06:08.169> there

00:06:08.369 --> 00:06:08.379 
want to I could just leave it sit there

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:10.769 
want to I could just leave it sit there
that'll<00:06:08.889> do<00:06:09.009> its<00:06:09.159> thing<00:06:09.659> remember<00:06:10.659> we're

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:10.779 
that'll do its thing remember we're

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:12.540 
that'll do its thing remember we're
going<00:06:10.870> to<00:06:10.930> have<00:06:10.990> to<00:06:11.139> open<00:06:11.379> up<00:06:11.439> the<00:06:11.500> valve<00:06:11.770> and

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
going to have to open up the valve and

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.300 
going to have to open up the valve and
fill<00:06:12.819> the<00:06:12.969> ball<00:06:13.180> up<00:06:13.800> and<00:06:14.800> we<00:06:14.919> can<00:06:15.069> do<00:06:15.159> that

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
fill the ball up and we can do that

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:16.559 
fill the ball up and we can do that
after<00:06:15.460> we<00:06:15.669> put<00:06:15.849> the<00:06:15.939> lid<00:06:16.120> on<00:06:16.300> but<00:06:16.419> we

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:16.569 
after we put the lid on but we

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:18.149 
after we put the lid on but we
definitely<00:06:16.810> want<00:06:17.169> to<00:06:17.229> do<00:06:17.379> that<00:06:17.529> before<00:06:17.740> we<00:06:17.979> put

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:18.159 
definitely want to do that before we put

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:20.610 
definitely want to do that before we put
the<00:06:18.250> airlock<00:06:18.610> on<00:06:18.849> I<00:06:19.149> use<00:06:19.839> my<00:06:20.020> handy<00:06:20.349> Starr

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
the airlock on I use my handy Starr

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.679 
the airlock on I use my handy Starr
saying<00:06:20.949> I<00:06:21.069> just<00:06:21.099> give<00:06:21.430> the<00:06:21.550> CAF<00:06:21.789> a<00:06:21.969> spray<00:06:22.270> it

00:06:22.679 --> 00:06:22.689 
saying I just give the CAF a spray it

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:24.869 
saying I just give the CAF a spray it
helps<00:06:22.990> seal<00:06:23.229> it<00:06:23.409> plus<00:06:23.740> you<00:06:24.370> know<00:06:24.490> we're<00:06:24.639> being

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:24.879 
helps seal it plus you know we're being

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:30.869 
helps seal it plus you know we're being
careful<00:06:25.120> sanitary<00:06:26.580> screw<00:06:27.580> the<00:06:27.699> lid<00:06:27.879> on<00:06:27.909> I<00:06:29.879> get

00:06:30.869 --> 00:06:30.879 
careful sanitary screw the lid on I get

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:33.389 
careful sanitary screw the lid on I get
a<00:06:30.909> good<00:06:31.180> nice<00:06:31.419> tight<00:06:31.750> seal<00:06:32.080> I've<00:06:33.009> got<00:06:33.219> my

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:33.399 
a good nice tight seal I've got my

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:36.209 
a good nice tight seal I've got my
airlock<00:06:33.759> half<00:06:34.449> full<00:06:34.659> of<00:06:34.689> water<00:06:34.810> I'll<00:06:35.800> place

00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:36.219 
airlock half full of water I'll place

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:39.220 
airlock half full of water I'll place
that<00:06:36.459> in<00:06:36.610> the<00:06:36.699> hole<00:06:36.879> and

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:39.230 
that in the hole and

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:44.350 
that in the hole and
tell<00:06:40.070> you<00:06:40.160> what<00:06:40.430> we're<00:06:41.150> at<00:06:41.950> about<00:06:42.950> 74<00:06:43.940> degrees

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 
tell you what we're at about 74 degrees

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.010 
tell you what we're at about 74 degrees
and<00:06:45.310> here<00:06:46.310> in<00:06:46.430> about<00:06:46.640> 12<00:06:47.120> hours<00:06:47.330> I<00:06:47.720> should<00:06:47.900> get

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020 
and here in about 12 hours I should get

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.720 
and here in about 12 hours I should get
a<00:06:48.050> really<00:06:48.410> good<00:06:48.560> fermentation<00:06:49.310> out<00:06:49.460> of<00:06:49.580> that

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:49.730 
a really good fermentation out of that

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.470 
a really good fermentation out of that
in<00:06:50.500> probably<00:06:51.500> about<00:06:51.590> 10<00:06:51.890> days<00:06:52.150> I'll<00:06:53.150> take<00:06:53.360> the

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:53.480 
in probably about 10 days I'll take the

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.150 
in probably about 10 days I'll take the
ball<00:06:53.690> off<00:06:53.930> the<00:06:53.960> bottom<00:06:54.410> don't<00:06:54.590> be<00:06:54.770> east<00:06:54.980> and

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:55.160 
ball off the bottom don't be east and

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.710 
ball off the bottom don't be east and
it'll<00:06:55.310> become<00:06:55.400> my<00:06:55.700> secondary<00:06:56.210> I'll<00:06:56.420> clarify

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:56.720 
it'll become my secondary I'll clarify

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.750 
it'll become my secondary I'll clarify
that<00:06:57.230> and<00:06:57.410> it's<00:06:57.710> time<00:06:57.860> well<00:06:58.100> here<00:06:58.370> we<00:06:58.520> are

00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:58.760 
that and it's time well here we are

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.120 
that and it's time well here we are
this<00:06:59.420> is<00:06:59.570> really<00:07:00.110> the<00:07:00.230> next<00:07:00.260> morning<00:07:00.980> I<00:07:01.100> just

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.130 
this is really the next morning I just

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.280 
this is really the next morning I just
thought<00:07:01.370> I'd<00:07:01.520> give<00:07:01.730> you<00:07:01.850> a<00:07:01.910> look<00:07:02.720> at<00:07:02.870> this<00:07:03.020> this

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:03.290 
thought I'd give you a look at this this

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.380 
thought I'd give you a look at this this
is<00:07:03.500> uh<00:07:03.530> this<00:07:03.860> is<00:07:03.920> what<00:07:04.310> we<00:07:04.400> did<00:07:04.610> yesterday<00:07:05.180> and

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:05.390 
is uh this is what we did yesterday and

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.380 
is uh this is what we did yesterday and
you'll<00:07:06.320> see<00:07:06.650> the<00:07:06.980> the<00:07:07.550> action<00:07:07.910> I've<00:07:08.030> got<00:07:08.210> what

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:08.390 
you'll see the the action I've got what

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.030 
you'll see the the action I've got what
we<00:07:08.510> call<00:07:08.690> what<00:07:08.870> we<00:07:08.990> call<00:07:09.230> this<00:07:09.410> is<00:07:09.620> not<00:07:09.770> as<00:07:09.920> much

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:10.040 
we call what we call this is not as much

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.770 
we call what we call this is not as much
of<00:07:10.100> a<00:07:10.310> violent<00:07:10.730> fermentation<00:07:11.360> but<00:07:11.510> but<00:07:11.690> that's

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:11.780 
of a violent fermentation but but that's

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.230 
of a violent fermentation but but that's
constant<00:07:12.470> oh<00:07:12.620> but<00:07:13.280> that's<00:07:13.400> the<00:07:13.580> results<00:07:14.090> of

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:14.240 
constant oh but that's the results of

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.140 
constant oh but that's the results of
our<00:07:14.690> sugar<00:07:15.470> wash<00:07:15.830> that<00:07:16.070> we<00:07:16.220> did<00:07:16.400> yesterday<00:07:16.940> and

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:17.150 
our sugar wash that we did yesterday and

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.310 
our sugar wash that we did yesterday and
you'll<00:07:17.870> notice<00:07:18.080> here<00:07:18.410> also<00:07:18.680> that<00:07:19.750> we're<00:07:20.750> at<00:07:20.990> a

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:21.320 
you'll notice here also that we're at a

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.770 
you'll notice here also that we're at a
little<00:07:22.250> bit<00:07:22.400> about<00:07:22.610> 80<00:07:22.940> degree<00:07:23.420> little<00:07:23.690> bit

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:23.780 
little bit about 80 degree little bit

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.100 
little bit about 80 degree little bit
over<00:07:24.020> 80<00:07:24.200> degrees<00:07:24.680> so<00:07:25.400> that<00:07:25.790> a<00:07:26.120> lot<00:07:26.480> that<00:07:26.840> tells

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:27.110 
over 80 degrees so that a lot that tells

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.110 
over 80 degrees so that a lot that tells
you<00:07:27.230> that<00:07:27.380> there<00:07:28.070> is<00:07:28.100> a<00:07:28.250> lot<00:07:28.520> of<00:07:28.550> action<00:07:29.000> going

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 
you that there is a lot of action going

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.970 
you that there is a lot of action going
on<00:07:29.360> inside<00:07:29.810> there<00:07:30.050> so<00:07:30.200> even<00:07:30.440> if<00:07:30.500> you<00:07:30.590> do<00:07:30.710> start

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:30.980 
on inside there so even if you do start

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.320 
on inside there so even if you do start
off<00:07:31.160> at<00:07:31.340> the<00:07:31.460> 74<00:07:32.090> degrees<00:07:32.860> there<00:07:33.860> is<00:07:34.010> some

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:34.330 
off at the 74 degrees there is some

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.180 
off at the 74 degrees there is some
spike<00:07:35.330> in<00:07:35.510> temperature<00:07:35.990> based<00:07:36.230> on<00:07:36.440> what<00:07:37.040> the

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:37.190 
spike in temperature based on what the

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:38.830 
spike in temperature based on what the
Easter<00:07:37.580> doing<00:07:37.970> inside<00:07:38.240> so<00:07:38.480> I<00:07:38.510> just<00:07:38.750> thought

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:38.840 
Easter doing inside so I just thought

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.000 
Easter doing inside so I just thought
I'd<00:07:38.960> give<00:07:39.110> you<00:07:39.230> a<00:07:39.260> look<00:07:39.470> at<00:07:39.560> that

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.010 
I'd give you a look at that

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:43.360 
I'd give you a look at that
that's<00:07:40.910> our<00:07:41.060> fast<00:07:41.330> ferment<00:07:41.840> fermenting<00:07:42.440> we'll

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:43.370 
that's our fast ferment fermenting we'll

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:44.290 
that's our fast ferment fermenting we'll
see<00:07:43.580> you<00:07:43.700> next<00:07:43.820> time

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:44.300 
see you next time

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.720 
see you next time
Thanks
