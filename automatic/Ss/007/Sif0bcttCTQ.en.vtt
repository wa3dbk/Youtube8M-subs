00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.280 
we're gonna have to use momentum to
filling<00:03:01.640> ourselves<00:03:02.090> over<00:03:03.040> make<00:03:04.040> a<00:03:04.069> hole<00:03:04.310> there

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
filling ourselves over make a hole there

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.619 
filling ourselves over make a hole there
portal<00:03:06.290> there<00:03:06.440> and<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.879> thing<00:03:08.030> is<00:03:08.090> we're<00:03:08.510> not

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
portal there and the thing is we're not

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.180 
portal there and the thing is we're not
going<00:03:08.810> to<00:03:08.870> get<00:03:09.049> enough<00:03:09.290> momentum<00:03:09.440> by<00:03:09.920> just

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
going to get enough momentum by just

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.610 
going to get enough momentum by just
jumping<00:03:10.640> into<00:03:10.819> this<00:03:11.030> one<00:03:11.269> right<00:03:11.480> because<00:03:12.470> then

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
jumping into this one right because then

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.380 
jumping into this one right because then
we<00:03:12.799> just<00:03:12.980> have<00:03:13.069> the<00:03:13.480> you<00:03:14.480> know<00:03:14.709> initial<00:03:15.709> jump

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
we just have the you know initial jump

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.759 
we just have the you know initial jump
mentum<00:03:17.390> but<00:03:17.599> we're<00:03:17.750> going<00:03:17.870> to<00:03:17.930> fall<00:03:18.500> out<00:03:18.530> of

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
mentum but we're going to fall out of

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.410 
mentum but we're going to fall out of
this<00:03:18.950> one<00:03:19.190> and<00:03:19.430> that<00:03:19.459> into<00:03:20.000> this<00:03:20.120> one<00:03:20.329> again

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
this one and that into this one again

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.000 
this one and that into this one again
and<00:03:20.750> then<00:03:20.900> out<00:03:21.079> of<00:03:21.140> that<00:03:21.410> one<00:03:21.709> and<00:03:21.860> then

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
and then out of that one and then

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.370 
and then out of that one and then
through<00:03:22.700> so<00:03:23.480> hopefully<00:03:23.750> we'll<00:03:24.079> put<00:03:24.290> it

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
through so hopefully we'll put it

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.110 
through so hopefully we'll put it
correctly<00:03:24.829> yep<00:03:25.250> all<00:03:25.610> right<00:03:27.760> all<00:03:28.760> right<00:03:28.819> next

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
correctly yep all right all right next

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.039 
correctly yep all right all right next
one<00:03:30.760> Exodus<00:03:31.760> through<00:03:32.299> here<00:03:32.599> so<00:03:32.870> we're<00:03:32.959> going

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
one Exodus through here so we're going

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.670 
one Exodus through here so we're going
to<00:03:33.140> get<00:03:33.260> through<00:03:33.530> there<00:03:33.680> I<00:03:33.739> guess<00:03:35.380> this<00:03:36.380> seems

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
to get through there I guess this seems

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.289 
to get through there I guess this seems
tricky<00:03:37.010> at<00:03:37.610> first<00:03:38.260> sight<00:03:39.260> I<00:03:40.180> remember<00:03:41.180> having

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
tricky at first sight I remember having

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:46.210 
tricky at first sight I remember having
some<00:03:42.100> initial<00:03:43.100> difficulties<00:03:43.670> with<00:03:43.910> it<00:03:45.220> now

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
some initial difficulties with it now

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.069 
some initial difficulties with it now
let's<00:03:46.489> see<00:03:46.880> so<00:03:47.180> we<00:03:47.269> can't<00:03:47.450> go<00:03:47.660> through<00:03:47.930> this

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
let's see so we can't go through this

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:49.960 
let's see so we can't go through this
one<00:03:48.290> because<00:03:48.500> then<00:03:48.769> the<00:03:48.950> portal<00:03:49.489> goes<00:03:49.819> away

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
one because then the portal goes away

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.990 
one because then the portal goes away
right<00:03:50.410> what<00:03:51.410> we<00:03:51.530> can<00:03:51.769> do<00:03:51.920> is<00:03:52.130> how<00:03:52.280> we<00:03:52.340> can<00:03:52.670> make

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
right what we can do is how we can make

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.819 
right what we can do is how we can make
it<00:03:53.290> can<00:03:54.290> do<00:03:54.410> this<00:03:54.620> and<00:03:55.930> then<00:03:56.930> run<00:03:57.290> through<00:03:57.319> and

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
it can do this and then run through and

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:07.140 
it can do this and then run through and
then<00:03:57.970> stop<00:03:58.989> well<00:03:59.989> it's<00:04:00.380> okay<00:04:01.840> well

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.420 

another<00:04:08.150> complimentary<00:04:08.780> lift<00:04:09.050> I<00:04:09.350> oh<00:04:09.680> my<00:04:10.100> this

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
another complimentary lift I oh my this

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:18.849 
another complimentary lift I oh my this
is<00:04:10.490> my<00:04:10.610> lucky<00:04:11.000> day<00:04:13.360> okay<00:04:14.360> third<00:04:14.750> room<00:04:17.350> so<00:04:18.350> what

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
is my lucky day okay third room so what

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:20.560 
is my lucky day okay third room so what
we're<00:04:19.010> going<00:04:19.100> to<00:04:19.190> do<00:04:19.340> is<00:04:19.549> basically<00:04:19.940> the<00:04:20.329> same

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
we're going to do is basically the same

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.740 
we're going to do is basically the same
as<00:04:21.070> the<00:04:22.070> last<00:04:22.190> place<00:04:22.520> only<00:04:22.820> we<00:04:23.210> can<00:04:23.420> use<00:04:23.600> the

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
as the last place only we can use the

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.360 
as the last place only we can use the
floor<00:04:24.020> right<00:04:24.350> here<00:04:24.380> so<00:04:24.800> we<00:04:24.890> can<00:04:24.980> have<00:04:25.130> to<00:04:25.220> make

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
floor right here so we can have to make

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.800 
floor right here so we can have to make
it<00:04:25.520> right<00:04:26.180> there<00:04:26.420> right<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:27.680> thing<00:04:27.860> is<00:04:28.810> it

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
it right there right the thing is it

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.840 
it right there right the thing is it
won't<00:04:29.990> we<00:04:30.260> want<00:04:30.470> to<00:04:30.680> reach<00:04:30.860> it<00:04:31.100> by<00:04:31.280> jumping<00:04:31.730> in

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
won't we want to reach it by jumping in

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.960 
won't we want to reach it by jumping in
through<00:04:32.420> here<00:04:32.630> will<00:04:33.230> just<00:04:33.560> fall<00:04:33.830> out<00:04:33.860> of<00:04:34.070> you

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
through here will just fall out of you

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.370 
through here will just fall out of you
know<00:04:35.060> they're<00:04:35.420> so<00:04:35.690> we're<00:04:35.780> going<00:04:35.900> to<00:04:35.960> need<00:04:36.050> more

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
know they're so we're going to need more

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.990 
know they're so we're going to need more
momentum<00:04:37.150> and<00:04:38.150> we<00:04:38.270> can<00:04:38.390> use<00:04:38.540> that<00:04:39.580> we<00:04:40.580> can<00:04:40.820> get

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
momentum and we can use that we can get

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.570 
momentum and we can use that we can get
that<00:04:41.150> from<00:04:41.540> jumping<00:04:41.870> in<00:04:42.020> here<00:04:44.890> and<00:04:45.890> making<00:04:46.280> one

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
that from jumping in here and making one

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:54.480 
that from jumping in here and making one
in<00:04:46.730> space<00:04:47.030> and<00:04:47.419> flying<00:04:48.790> awesome<00:04:50.950> so<00:04:51.950> next<00:04:52.280> up

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.760 

flies<00:04:55.490> over<00:04:55.850> don't<00:04:56.270> don't<00:04:56.510> boom<00:04:56.810> and<00:04:57.020> goes

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
flies over don't don't boom and goes

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.520 
flies over don't don't boom and goes
back<00:04:58.360> so<00:04:59.360> want<00:04:59.600> that<00:04:59.780> to<00:04:59.930> happen<00:04:59.960> on<00:05:00.230> the<00:05:00.350> other

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
back so want that to happen on the other

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.650 
back so want that to happen on the other
side<00:05:00.890> instead<00:05:01.250> right<00:05:01.790> shouldn't<00:05:02.540> be<00:05:02.630> too

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
side instead right shouldn't be too

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.880 
side instead right shouldn't be too
difficult<00:05:03.820> um<00:05:05.200> you<00:05:06.200> need<00:05:06.320> to<00:05:06.410> get<00:05:06.500> over<00:05:06.560> there

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
difficult um you need to get over there

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.320 
difficult um you need to get over there
now<00:05:07.070> so<00:05:07.340> first<00:05:07.640> momentum<00:05:09.940> right<00:05:10.940> there<00:05:11.300> I

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
now so first momentum right there I

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.399 
now so first momentum right there I
think<00:05:11.979> oops<00:05:12.979> hailey

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:15.409 
think oops hailey

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:19.929 
think oops hailey
so<00:05:15.830> one<00:05:16.389> look<00:05:17.389> out<00:05:17.629> there<00:05:17.929> and<00:05:18.580> well<00:05:19.580> in<00:05:19.759> there

00:05:19.929 --> 00:05:19.939 
so one look out there and well in there

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:21.429 
so one look out there and well in there
and<00:05:20.119> out<00:05:20.209> there<00:05:20.239> and<00:05:20.659> then<00:05:20.809> I'm<00:05:20.929> just<00:05:21.139> going<00:05:21.349> to

00:05:21.429 --> 00:05:21.439 
and out there and then I'm just going to

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:32.009 
and out there and then I'm just going to
move<00:05:21.529> the<00:05:21.769> orange<00:05:22.099> one<00:05:22.449> time<00:05:23.449> oh<00:05:24.610> well<00:05:25.610> work

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:32.019 

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:39.549 

see<00:05:33.019> and<00:05:34.389> bam<00:05:35.389> yeah<00:05:37.839> now<00:05:38.839> how<00:05:39.110> do<00:05:39.169> we<00:05:39.259> get<00:05:39.409> out

00:05:39.549 --> 00:05:39.559 
see and bam yeah now how do we get out

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:41.290 
see and bam yeah now how do we get out
of<00:05:39.589> there<00:05:39.800> well<00:05:40.369> we<00:05:40.550> can<00:05:40.699> just<00:05:40.729> the<00:05:40.909> same<00:05:41.059> thing

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
of there well we can just the same thing

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:47.979 
of there well we can just the same thing
really<00:05:44.169> no<00:05:45.169> that<00:05:45.439> was<00:05:45.529> almost<00:05:46.479> all<00:05:47.479> right<00:05:47.659> so

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:47.989 
really no that was almost all right so

00:05:47.989 --> 00:05:48.969 
really no that was almost all right so
we're<00:05:48.139> gonna<00:05:48.199> have<00:05:48.409> to<00:05:48.439> wait<00:05:48.619> for<00:05:48.649> another
