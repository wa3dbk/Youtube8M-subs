have<00:00:24.210> 93<00:00:24.689> results<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.470> would<00:00:25.710> just<00:00:25.830> use<00:00:26.010> link

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
have 93 results I would just use link

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.820 
have 93 results I would just use link
gopher<00:00:26.789> extract<00:00:27.359> all<00:00:27.570> links<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.230> have<00:00:28.619> all

my<00:00:31.560> flagger<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:33.120> would<00:00:33.300> just<00:00:33.540> flag<00:00:35.030> that's

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
my flagger and it would just flag that's

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.750 
my flagger and it would just flag that's
why<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.390> see<00:00:37.200> people<00:00:37.440> you<00:00:38.250> know<00:00:38.280> putting<00:00:38.670> the

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
work they spell out the number like so

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.380 
work they spell out the number like so
instead<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.640> 5<00:00:41.910> would<00:00:42.180> be<00:00:42.239> fi<00:00:42.780> ve<00:00:44.149> which<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.360> a

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
instead of 5 would be fi ve which is a

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.510 
instead of 5 would be fi ve which is a
good<00:00:45.780> way<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.250> deter<00:00:48.320> competitors<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:50.160> doing

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
that another way to deter them is just

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.750 
that another way to deter them is just
don't<00:00:56.969> even<00:00:57.239> put<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.480> phone<00:00:57.690> number<00:00:57.870> on<00:00:58.170> here

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
don't even put the phone number on here

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.819 
don't even put the phone number on here
and<00:00:59.760> put<00:01:00.510> just<00:01:00.629> put<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:00.989> your<00:01:01.079> photo<00:01:01.410> so

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
it's and then also I have a HTML code

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.960 
it's and then also I have a HTML code
that<00:01:06.210> well<00:01:06.840> just<00:01:07.170> basically<00:01:07.979> reduce<00:01:08.460> all<00:01:08.729> this

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
that well just basically reduce all this

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:18.690 
that well just basically reduce all this
see<00:01:09.510> all<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:11.900> if<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.170> put<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.619> here

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.410 

this<00:01:19.700> is

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
this is

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.080 
this is
all<00:01:21.900> basically<00:01:22.860> basically<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.520> keyword

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
all basically basically is keyword

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.740 
all basically basically is keyword
stuffing<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:25.259> it's<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.220> good<00:01:26.369> way<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:26.939> you

stuffing and it's a good way to just you

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.660 
stuffing and it's a good way to just you
know<00:01:27.900> stay<00:01:28.110> inconspicuous<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:29.159> then<00:01:29.280> put<00:01:29.520> you

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
know stay inconspicuous and then put you

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.399 
know stay inconspicuous and then put you

admin deletes for the phone number thing

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.779 
admin deletes for the phone number thing
a<00:01:41.789> quick<00:01:42.240> way<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.450> do<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.990> is<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.890> use<00:01:44.189> these<00:01:44.430> tool

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
a quick way to do it is I use these tool

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.440 
a quick way to do it is I use these tool
to<00:01:45.060> two<00:01:45.539> tools<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:46.259> use<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:47.039> one<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:47.580> let's<00:01:48.240> go

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
to two tools I use this one so let's go

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:57.859 
to two tools I use this one so let's go
with<00:01:54.170> just<00:01:55.170> start<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:55.950> now<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.789> gives<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.240> all

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
with just start and now it gives you all

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.830 
with just start and now it gives you all
these<00:01:58.470> variable<00:01:59.220> different<00:02:00.060> ways<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.659> doing

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
these variable different ways of doing

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.260 
these variable different ways of doing
it<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.619> just<00:02:02.310> part<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.700> experiment

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
it this is a just part of the experiment

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.050 
it this is a just part of the experiment
always<00:02:03.659> trying<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.020> alter<00:02:04.679> it<00:02:06.619> and<00:02:07.700> then<00:02:08.700> from

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
always trying to alter it and then from

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:17.940 
always trying to alter it and then from
there<00:02:09.269> I<00:02:09.299> have<00:02:09.660> another<00:02:09.989> one<00:02:10.319> that<00:02:12.980> that<00:02:13.980> will

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.010 

that<00:02:18.550> will<00:02:18.760> take<00:02:19.030> it<00:02:19.150> a<00:02:19.330> step<00:02:19.569> further

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:31.610 

and<00:02:23.530> then<00:02:23.770> say<00:02:25.830> let's<00:02:26.830> say<00:02:27.040> you<00:02:27.100> want<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.640> five

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.650 

zero<00:02:32.620> see<00:02:33.190> how<00:02:33.370> it<00:02:33.520> changes<00:02:33.940> automatically

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
zero see how it changes automatically

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.100 
zero see how it changes automatically
for<00:02:34.960> you<00:02:35.080> so<00:02:35.920> it<00:02:36.040> spells<00:02:36.310> out<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.580> word<00:02:36.970> and<00:02:37.840> it

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
for you so it spells out the word and it

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.300 
for you so it spells out the word and it
gives<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:38.350> hundred<00:02:38.680> different<00:02:38.800> you<00:02:39.190> know

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
gives you hundred different you know

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.010 
gives you hundred different you know
different<00:02:39.790> ways<00:02:39.940> of<00:02:40.180> spelling<00:02:40.420> your<00:02:40.720> number

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
different ways of spelling your number

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.100 
different ways of spelling your number
in<00:02:41.200> there<00:02:41.410> which<00:02:41.710> helps<00:02:41.860> a<00:02:42.100> lot<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:43.360> that<00:02:43.900> is

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
in there which helps a lot and that is

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.110 
in there which helps a lot and that is
how<00:02:44.290> I<00:02:44.320> you<00:02:45.100> know<00:02:45.220> kind<00:02:45.430> of<00:02:45.550> stay<00:02:45.730> under<00:02:46.000> the

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
how I you know kind of stay under the

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.860 
how I you know kind of stay under the
radar<00:02:46.150> as<00:02:46.840> much<00:02:47.140> as<00:02:47.290> possible
