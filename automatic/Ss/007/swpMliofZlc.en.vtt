needle through and do another stitch the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.060 
needle through and do another stitch the
same<00:01:16.649> way<00:01:16.860> making<00:01:17.490> sure<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:17.940> do<00:01:18.420> this<00:01:18.600> one

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
same way making sure to do this one

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.980 
same way making sure to do this one
starting<00:01:20.070> directly<00:01:20.610> above<00:01:20.970> where<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.390> needle

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
starting directly above where the needle

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.840 
starting directly above where the needle
the<00:01:22.380> thread<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.799> coming<00:01:23.039> through<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.520> bottom

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
the thread is coming through the bottom

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.600 
the thread is coming through the bottom
fabric<00:01:24.319> that<00:01:25.319> way<00:01:25.470> when<00:01:25.649> it<00:01:25.770> pulls<00:01:26.009> up<00:01:26.220> into

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
fabric that way when it pulls up into

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:37.630 
fabric that way when it pulls up into
the<00:01:26.700> top<00:01:26.909> fabric<00:01:27.300> it<00:01:27.690> will<00:01:27.840> disappear

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.310 

then<00:01:38.240> when<00:01:38.360> you're<00:01:38.479> sewing<00:01:38.690> you<00:01:38.930> see<00:01:39.140> how<00:01:39.260> you

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
then when you're sewing you see how you

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.410 
then when you're sewing you see how you
can<00:01:39.530> see<00:01:39.800> the<00:01:39.950> needle<00:01:40.280> on<00:01:40.430> the<00:01:40.460> top<00:01:40.790> side<00:01:41.060> if

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
can see the needle on the top side if

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.500 
can see the needle on the top side if
this<00:01:42.140> happens<00:01:42.590> you<00:01:42.680> went<00:01:42.920> too<00:01:43.070> far<00:01:43.100> through<00:01:43.700> so

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
this happens you went too far through so

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.630 
this happens you went too far through so
just<00:01:44.780> pull<00:01:45.020> it<00:01:45.140> back<00:01:45.350> and<00:01:45.620> make<00:01:46.159> sure<00:01:46.190> to<00:01:46.460> keep

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
just pull it back and make sure to keep

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.880 
just pull it back and make sure to keep
it<00:01:47.050> completely<00:01:48.050> hidden<00:01:50.619> and<00:01:51.619> then<00:01:51.740> you'll

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
it completely hidden and then you'll

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.310 
it completely hidden and then you'll
just<00:01:52.070> want<00:01:52.340> to<00:01:52.430> stitch<00:01:52.810> all<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:53.869> way<00:01:54.080> across

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
just want to stitch all the way across

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.050 
just want to stitch all the way across
until<00:01:54.890> you<00:01:55.280> get<00:01:56.090> to<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.270> end<00:01:56.509> of<00:01:56.750> the<00:01:56.869> opening

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
until you get to the end of the opening

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.460 
until you get to the end of the opening
when<00:01:59.060> you<00:01:59.210> do<00:01:59.390> and<00:01:59.630> you're<00:01:59.780> ready<00:01:59.900> to<00:02:00.020> end<00:02:00.290> it

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
when you do and you're ready to end it

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
off don't pull the needle all the way

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.820 
off don't pull the needle all the way
through<00:02:05.470> you<00:02:06.470> see<00:02:06.680> this<00:02:06.830> loop<00:02:07.820> here<00:02:08.679> put<00:02:09.679> the

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
through you see this loop here put the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.600 
through you see this loop here put the
needle<00:02:10.160> through<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.550> loop<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:12.140> pull<00:02:12.610> it

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
needle through the loop and pull it

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.310 
needle through the loop and pull it
really<00:02:13.970> tight<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.739> it'll<00:02:15.739> not<00:02:15.920> itself
