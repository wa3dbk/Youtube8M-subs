00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
problem just turn off the audio for one

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:37.800 
problem just turn off the audio for one
select<00:04:26.980> it<00:04:27.450> and<00:04:28.450> go<00:04:28.930> to<00:04:29.169> audio<00:04:29.560> someone<00:04:36.810> the

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
select it and go to audio someone the

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.340 
select it and go to audio someone the
world<00:04:37.930> is<00:04:38.200> audio<00:04:38.560> show<00:04:39.430> me<00:04:39.580> are<00:04:39.730> you<00:04:40.290> this<00:04:41.290> is

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
world is audio show me are you this is

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.320 
world is audio show me are you this is
probably<00:04:41.530> a<00:04:41.770> way<00:04:42.010> to<00:04:42.669> turn<00:04:42.880> off<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.210> audio

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
probably a way to turn off the audio

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.820 
probably a way to turn off the audio
just<00:04:43.750> do<00:04:43.930> that<00:04:44.140> and<00:04:45.690> if<00:04:46.690> not<00:04:46.900> well<00:04:47.260> just<00:04:47.650> turn

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
just do that and if not well just turn

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.670 
just do that and if not well just turn
off<00:04:48.040> your<00:04:48.070> audio<00:04:48.370> somehow<00:04:49.200> so<00:04:50.200> it<00:04:50.470> only

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
off your audio somehow so it only

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.730 
off your audio somehow so it only
records<00:04:51.130> one<00:04:51.660> piece<00:04:52.660> of<00:04:52.840> audio<00:04:52.990> so<00:04:53.620> that<00:04:55.740> so

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
records one piece of audio so that so

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.040 
records one piece of audio so that so
basically<00:04:57.100> that's<00:04:57.340> how<00:04:57.580> you<00:04:57.640> do<00:04:57.790> it<00:04:58.050> that's

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
basically that's how you do it that's

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.640 
basically that's how you do it that's
how<00:04:59.290> you<00:04:59.320> record<00:04:59.700> that's<00:05:00.700> they<00:05:01.260> talk<00:05:02.260> about

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
how you record that's they talk about

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.360 
how you record that's they talk about
that's<00:05:03.160> how<00:05:03.400> you<00:05:04.260> you<00:05:05.260> know<00:05:05.470> make<00:05:05.740> a<00:05:05.770> face<00:05:06.070> cam

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370
