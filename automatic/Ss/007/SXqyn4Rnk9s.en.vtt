 products also understands this 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.680
 the device is easy enough easy 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.670
 by pressing two buttons on the sides and 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.829
 set for example workers 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.570
 items on the chopper bowl 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.820
 we do not have a corolla for 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.960
 whipping so maybe cream whites 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.600
 it's not his horse 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.390
 in the kit a new model we have 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.360
 measuring cups which also have 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.680

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.079
 cooked product in the same device 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.030
 also want to note that the difference in 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.570
 the power of these devices speaks for 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.520
 philips because false 352 2 or 800 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.070
 city ​​stores this device is worth in 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.970
 around 2100 rubles this tripur is somewhat 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.860
 more expensive in the area 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.990
 in half of these two devices I would 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.030
 chose philips at the expense of more 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.040
 power more comfortable grip and 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.170
 I want more chopper 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.880
 show you how to use it very 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.880
 quickly grind for example carrot for 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.860
 zazharki for soup I can see that not 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.990
 only carrot and onion for example you 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.580
 be able to put here right away cut 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.880
 Of course it will need small 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.150
 in chunks 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:27.150
 install the cap and using the buttons 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.510
 in seconds we get this 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.420
 here 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.459
