00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:17.010
 and now we present missions for 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.369
 young and with several paula in the opi 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.369
 sieve 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.290
 designed for today we will 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.050
 talk about outline and lighting for 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.320
 perfect face simply what we're going 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.559
 to do is give a few drawings of where and 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.909
 how to apply our illuminator 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.040
 outline that is simply a powder a 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:52.559
 little darker to our skin tone 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.050
 to give a little shade to light up for 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.839
 highlight those features that we like and 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.239
 Well, that's basically what 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:02.549
 what we will do today and today begins a 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.320
 sequence of programs each program 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:07.140
 we're going to be talking about a kind of 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.009
 different face and today I wanted to start 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.409
 with the oval face since all 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:16.450
 we who have a type of face 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.210
 different to the endorsed we must 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.369
 that's the rule to resemble a face 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.680
 or then first you want to show them 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.270
 how is the oval face and what things 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.340
 must make a face next to 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.670
 accentuate much more his features and 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.670
 look a lot more slender and young like that 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.009
 as with alive then it is 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.610
 simply basically what we will do 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:43.940
 today I hope you like it and let's see it 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.640
 today we will talk about how to outline 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:51.350
 our oval face all the 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:54.170
 people we should resemble ourselves thanks to 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.820
 contouring and lighting 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.640
 we should resemble this kind of 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:02.000
 face then today what I'm going to do 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.880
 is simply to talk about if this kind of 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.550
 face is so perfect or well what 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.890
 we should all resemble him I'm going to 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.110
 show a few simple tricks that you 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.350
 people with this type of face are going to 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.140
 have or well they should do to 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.370
 highlight much more his features 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.360
 then first of all what we will do 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.850
 is to darken those areas that do not 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.720
 they like very very white we can use a 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:32.300
 dust like this that is more subidito to the 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.959
 normal skin tone and if suddenly 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.810
 we are a little bit more brunettes we use 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.940
 this other then I want to make them 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.220
 the test with the two can do is 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.220
 Take the powder with a brochette in this 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.570
 case I will do with this but then 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.910
 normally on my face I would do it with 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.940
 This one is much bigger 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:57.910
 so what I do is guide me from the 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.910
 ear to the lip 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.300
 yes 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.980
 yes 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.959
 you 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.959
 if I do it with this other 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:25.000
 the next step would be the blush for 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.680
 take with a little bottle like that and for 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.650
 face people 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.270
 let's do is accentuate what in the 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.550
 cheeks 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:37.260
 to realize that the cheekbones 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.260
 they stand out a lot more 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.640
 if they can see and as you are taking 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:46.750
 much more so the fair redondito 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.820
 just over the cheeks so that 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.550
 more protrude that cheekbone that have the 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.770
 people of our ball now what 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.310
 let's do is lighting and to 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.000
 this 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.099
 what we will do is take some shadows with 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.690
 glitter or an illuminator if we do not have 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:06.989
 illuminator we can take a shadow 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.360
 agreements like this golden brown a shadow 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.319
 agreed like this that resembles 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.319
 our skin tone 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:21.330
 a blanquita like this or simply 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:24.230
 our pearls illuminated now I'm going 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:27.420
 to show at what points to put the 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.980
 illuminated and now with this rachita but 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.810
 you can continue with the brush with your finger 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.300
 as you wish 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.720
 then I'm going to take this shadow with 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:40.730
 shine and will put it here on the 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.730
 lip heart 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.010
 I can put it here on the nose about 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.010
 the partition 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:55.929
 over our eyebrow here our arch of 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.929
 the eyebrow 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:05.550
 and remember to blur the three very well 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:08.409
 things that we have put the bronzer 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:11.110
 to make the outline of our face 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:13.360
 the blush and the highlighter to highlight 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.300
 the areas that we want to highlight from 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:20.129
 our face and I was missing the point 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.529
 under our mouth 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:25.739
 we could also do it with our 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:27.899
 pearls illuminators but what happens with 

00:05:25.739 --> 00:05:29.969
 our illuminating pearls our 

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:33.059
 Pearls and Nominee are more than everything 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:34.510
 to take a brush of these from this 

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:36.610
 kind 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:39.160
 in carla well of our pearls 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.980
 illuminators and before having done everything 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.470
 this having simply gone through 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:48.200
 all face 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.200
 It will give you beautiful lighting 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.570
 it would give a beautiful illumination to 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:57.170
 our face and thanks to the tones 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:06:00.460
 green would extinguish a little the redness that 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:04.460
 let's have our face illuminate 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:07.970
 hiding the reds the moraditos 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:10.250
 the little spots would help just that 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:13.130
 already if we want to use it only for 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:16.050
 illuminate I would advise them to take either 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:20.880
 our perlite 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:23.640
 golden or white and simply 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:27.500
 take a little out of the product that these are 

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.500
 those that illuminate 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.910
 in the blanquita these are the ones that 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:44.000
 and they dominate or they have a certain brilliance 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.380
 for an illumination then this would be 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.510
 the basics that the 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:50.880
 oval face people 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.740
 which is simply if they want if they want 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.980
 settle much more his features 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:58.590
 make them much more beautiful simply 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:01.020
 is to give those basic little touches 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:04.230
 good viewers as I know that already 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.610
 they gave all the basic process that 

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.740
 I should be a face person 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:10.770
 barred to settle much more his 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:14.490
 features as I told you at the beginning of 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:17.340
 program let's make a sequence a 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:21.110
 sequence with our square face 

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:23.930
 round face diamond face 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:26.240
 triangular 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:29.479
 with all face types and it's because of 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:32.419
 what then today we talk about the face 

00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:34.810
 oval to which we should try to 

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:37.699
 like to make visual tricks 

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:40.820
 so that our face with makeup 

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:42.740
 resembles a face next to you so 

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.690
 I hope you liked the program 

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.520
 of today if you are encouraged to do so 

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:49.250
 practice it and I remember the winter in his 

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.960
 photo here to tve at mission success 

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:53.090
 heretic point so that to appear in 

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.610
 the next program so this has 

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:59.169
 been all for today and you and I 

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:59.169
 we see next friday
