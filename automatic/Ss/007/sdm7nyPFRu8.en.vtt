00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
like that so let's just jump right into

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.580 
like that so let's just jump right into
it<00:01:14.600> because<00:01:14.719> there's<00:01:14.960> a<00:01:14.990> lot<00:01:15.020> to<00:01:15.409> talk<00:01:15.530> about

one<00:01:42.350> mod<00:01:42.530> pack<00:01:42.799> that<00:01:42.979> saves<00:01:43.310> a<00:01:43.430> lot<00:01:43.579> of<00:01:43.640> work

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
one mod pack that saves a lot of work

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.789 
one mod pack that saves a lot of work
because<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.899> way<00:01:45.020> they<00:01:45.229> have<00:01:45.380> it<00:01:45.500> right<00:01:45.530> now

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
because the way they have it right now

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.920

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
pages and it's really annoying

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.779 
pages and it's really annoying
it<00:01:50.090> took<00:01:50.210> me<00:01:50.390> a<00:01:50.420> while<00:01:50.539> to<00:01:50.750> set<00:01:50.899> it<00:01:51.020> up<00:01:51.109> but

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789

city border and to me to be honest I

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.550 
city border and to me to be honest I
first<00:03:21.829> of<00:03:21.980> all<00:03:22.069> I<00:03:22.220> can't<00:03:22.519> get<00:03:22.730> zoning<00:03:23.090> to<00:03:23.239> work

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
first of all I can't get zoning to work

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.680 
first of all I can't get zoning to work
but<00:03:24.560> what<00:03:24.739> I<00:03:24.769> can<00:03:25.130> say<00:03:25.459> is<00:03:25.700> that<00:03:25.940> there's<00:03:26.450> no

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
but what I can say is that there's no

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.780 
but what I can say is that there's no
need<00:03:26.930> for<00:03:26.989> zoning<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:27.769> the<00:03:28.160> reason<00:03:28.489> I<00:03:28.579> say

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
need for zoning and the reason I say

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.910 
need for zoning and the reason I say
that<00:03:28.819> is<00:03:29.239> because<00:03:29.269> with<00:03:29.870> RC<00:03:30.230> I<00:03:30.260> plop<00:03:30.620> all<00:03:30.829> you

that is because with RC I plop all you

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.430 
that is because with RC I plop all you
have<00:03:31.069> to<00:03:31.160> do<00:03:31.280> is<00:03:31.400> like<00:03:31.850> all<00:03:32.690> you<00:03:32.900> have<00:03:33.019> to<00:03:33.139> do<00:03:33.290> is

have to do is like all you have to do is

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.410 
have to do is like all you have to do is
plop<00:03:33.709> down<00:03:33.950> you<00:03:34.340> know<00:03:34.459> skyscrapers<00:03:35.180> you<00:03:35.269> don't

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
plop down you know skyscrapers you don't

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.120 
plop down you know skyscrapers you don't
have<00:03:35.510> to<00:03:35.600> wait<00:03:35.780> for<00:03:35.810> anything<00:03:36.170> you<00:03:36.859> don't<00:03:37.010> have

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
have to wait for anything you don't have

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.129 
have to wait for anything you don't have
to<00:03:37.600> you<00:03:38.600> know<00:03:40.329> go<00:03:41.329> through<00:03:41.359> the<00:03:41.630> hassle<00:03:41.810> of

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
to you know go through the hassle of

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.229 
to you know go through the hassle of
zoning<00:03:42.799> outside<00:03:43.190> the<00:03:43.340> box<00:03:43.549> and<00:03:43.850> just<00:03:43.970> place

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
zoning outside the box and just place

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.349 
zoning outside the box and just place
down<00:03:44.510> so<00:03:45.049> in<00:03:45.560> essence<00:03:46.549> you<00:03:46.730> really<00:03:46.970> don't<00:03:47.180> need

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
down so in essence you really don't need

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.360 
down so in essence you really don't need
zoning<00:03:47.900> so<00:03:48.410> as<00:03:48.500> you<00:03:48.620> can<00:03:48.739> see<00:03:48.950> I'm<00:03:49.160> just

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
zoning so as you can see I'm just

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.410 
zoning so as you can see I'm just
plopping<00:03:49.639> down<00:03:49.910> some<00:03:50.180> buildings<00:03:50.690> and<00:03:52.150> as<00:03:53.150> they

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
go along like that there you go

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.520 
go along like that there you go
so<00:03:58.579> there<00:03:58.970> we<00:03:59.060> go<00:03:59.180> I<00:03:59.420> got<00:03:59.450> some<00:03:59.840> buildings<00:04:00.260> up

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
questions on land value and water and

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.979 
questions on land value and water and
pollution<00:04:09.290> and<00:04:09.530> stuff<00:04:09.650> like<00:04:09.920> that<00:04:10.160> now<00:04:11.030> okay

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
pollution and stuff like that now okay

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.789 
pollution and stuff like that now okay
so<00:04:12.889> first<00:04:13.639> of<00:04:13.849> all<00:04:14.000> I<00:04:14.180> will<00:04:14.329> want<00:04:14.840> to<00:04:14.930> say<00:04:15.200> for

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
so first of all I will want to say for

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.690 
so first of all I will want to say for
land<00:04:16.310> value<00:04:16.789> as<00:04:17.560> you<00:04:18.560> can<00:04:18.680> see<00:04:18.889> the<00:04:19.070> land<00:04:19.280> value

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
land value as you can see the land value

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.909 
land value as you can see the land value
map<00:04:19.910> is<00:04:20.120> a<00:04:20.150> bit<00:04:20.419> skewed<00:04:20.840> and<00:04:21.079> that's<00:04:21.530> because

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
map is a bit skewed and that's because

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:23.770 
map is a bit skewed and that's because
it<00:04:22.099> takes<00:04:22.370> the<00:04:22.580> it<00:04:22.940> takes<00:04:23.150> the<00:04:23.300> whole<00:04:23.479> region

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
it takes the it takes the whole region

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.520 
it takes the it takes the whole region
and<00:04:24.169> it<00:04:24.889> condenses<00:04:25.370> it<00:04:25.550> into<00:04:25.820> the<00:04:25.910> city<00:04:26.090> tile

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
and it condenses it into the city tile

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.820 
and it condenses it into the city tile
so<00:04:27.550> let's<00:04:28.550> say<00:04:28.849> let's<00:04:29.720> see<00:04:29.900> here<00:04:30.020> here

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
so let's say let's see here here

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.730 
so let's say let's see here here
let's<00:04:31.280> say<00:04:31.430> we<00:04:31.550> put<00:04:31.729> a<00:04:31.789> park<00:04:32.120> somewhere<00:04:32.740> I'm

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
let's say we put a park somewhere I'm

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.649 
let's say we put a park somewhere I'm
going<00:04:33.800> to<00:04:33.979> put<00:04:34.099> a<00:04:34.129> Plaza<00:04:34.490> on<00:04:35.090> the<00:04:35.300> corner<00:04:35.629> right

00:04:35.649 --> 00:04:35.659 
going to put a Plaza on the corner right

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:38.830 
going to put a Plaza on the corner right
here<00:04:35.990> to<00:04:36.710> watch<00:04:37.190> look<00:04:37.669> really<00:04:38.030> carefully<00:04:38.210> at

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
here to watch look really carefully at

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.210 
here to watch look really carefully at
this<00:04:39.139> city<00:04:39.319> tile<00:04:39.620> at<00:04:39.889> this<00:04:40.069> map<00:04:40.310> right<00:04:40.490> here<00:04:41.169> as

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
this city tile at this map right here as

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.730 
this city tile at this map right here as
you<00:04:43.220> can<00:04:43.340> see<00:04:43.430> it's<00:04:43.909> it's<00:04:44.900> increasing<00:04:45.470> a<00:04:45.530> land

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
you can see it's it's increasing a land

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.399 
you can see it's it's increasing a land
value<00:04:46.099> but<00:04:46.310> it<00:04:46.400> shows<00:04:46.639> up<00:04:46.849> here<00:04:47.259> but<00:04:48.259> that

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:48.409 
value but it shows up here but that

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:51.360 
value but it shows up here but that
doesn't<00:04:48.680> mean<00:04:48.889> that<00:04:48.919> effect<00:04:49.370> doesn't<00:04:49.550> apply

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
doesn't mean that effect doesn't apply

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.249 
doesn't mean that effect doesn't apply
the<00:04:52.370> land<00:04:52.580> value<00:04:52.879> here<00:04:53.090> is<00:04:53.180> still<00:04:53.389> high<00:04:53.629> the

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:54.259 
the land value here is still high the

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:56.649 
the land value here is still high the
map<00:04:54.440> just<00:04:54.470> doesn't<00:04:55.099> show<00:04:55.129> it<00:04:55.490> so<00:04:55.819> with<00:04:56.509> your

00:04:56.649 --> 00:04:56.659 
map just doesn't show it so with your

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:58.809 
map just doesn't show it so with your
parks<00:04:56.990> and<00:04:57.169> stuff<00:04:57.349> you<00:04:57.979> just<00:04:58.220> have<00:04:58.340> to<00:04:58.490> put<00:04:58.699> it

00:04:58.809 --> 00:04:58.819 
parks and stuff you just have to put it

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:00.969 
parks and stuff you just have to put it
generally<00:04:59.629> in<00:04:59.810> the<00:04:59.930> location<00:05:00.500> where<00:05:00.530> you<00:05:00.830> want

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
generally in the location where you want

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.490 
generally in the location where you want
your<00:05:01.220> high<00:05:01.659> high<00:05:02.659> wealth<00:05:02.900> buildings<00:05:03.319> or

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
your high high wealth buildings or

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.499 
your high high wealth buildings or
medium<00:05:03.770> wealth<00:05:03.949> buildings<00:05:04.370> to<00:05:04.520> be<00:05:04.699> and<00:05:04.909> that

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:05.509 
medium wealth buildings to be and that

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:08.350 
medium wealth buildings to be and that
should<00:05:05.750> be<00:05:05.900> good<00:05:05.930> so<00:05:06.469> the<00:05:07.340> map<00:05:07.580> really<00:05:07.789> it's

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
should be good so the map really it's

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.809 
should be good so the map really it's
just<00:05:08.599> like<00:05:08.840> a<00:05:08.990> little<00:05:09.199> guide<00:05:09.560> but<00:05:10.340> it's<00:05:10.610> not

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:10.819 
just like a little guide but it's not

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:14.290 
just like a little guide but it's not
really<00:05:11.210> accurate<00:05:11.930> so<00:05:12.409> if<00:05:12.500> you<00:05:12.590> want<00:05:12.800> to<00:05:13.240> it<00:05:14.240> is

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
really accurate so if you want to it is

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.110 
really accurate so if you want to it is
accurate<00:05:14.900> I<00:05:15.050> mean<00:05:15.289> but<00:05:15.889> it's<00:05:16.039> just<00:05:16.280> scaled<00:05:16.639> to

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
accurate I mean but it's just scaled to

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.029 
accurate I mean but it's just scaled to
this<00:05:17.270> city<00:05:17.509> tile<00:05:17.810> but<00:05:18.560> it's<00:05:18.680> working<00:05:19.009> just

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
this city tile but it's working just

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:22.629 
this city tile but it's working just
fine<00:05:20.020> however<00:05:21.020> with<00:05:21.379> water<00:05:21.949> I<00:05:22.099> think<00:05:22.490> this

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 
fine however with water I think this

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:25.570 
fine however with water I think this
applies<00:05:22.969> to<00:05:23.000> water<00:05:23.419> sewage<00:05:23.780> iron<00:05:24.379> ore<00:05:24.949> ores

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
applies to water sewage iron ore ores

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.480 
applies to water sewage iron ore ores
and<00:05:26.060> coal<00:05:26.449> and<00:05:26.750> stuff<00:05:26.930> like<00:05:27.080> that<00:05:27.349> the<00:05:28.219> map

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
and coal and stuff like that the map

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.020 
and coal and stuff like that the map
here<00:05:29.300> is<00:05:29.479> uh<00:05:29.979> it's<00:05:30.979> kind<00:05:31.430> of<00:05:31.490> the<00:05:31.580> same<00:05:31.759> thing

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
here is uh it's kind of the same thing

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.890 
here is uh it's kind of the same thing
so<00:05:32.270> the<00:05:32.449> the<00:05:32.719> map<00:05:32.930> is<00:05:33.430> like<00:05:34.430> that<00:05:34.729> but<00:05:35.389> as<00:05:35.569> you

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
so the the map is like that but as you

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.719 
so the the map is like that but as you
can<00:05:36.050> see<00:05:36.289> if<00:05:36.620> you<00:05:36.860> put<00:05:37.069> a<00:05:37.099> water<00:05:37.340> pumping

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
can see if you put a water pumping

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:39.700 
can see if you put a water pumping
station<00:05:37.789> here<00:05:38.360> where<00:05:38.509> it's<00:05:38.779> all<00:05:38.870> blue<00:05:39.199> it

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
station here where it's all blue it

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.950 
station here where it's all blue it
doesn't<00:05:40.069> appear<00:05:40.310> full<00:05:40.610> but<00:05:41.330> if<00:05:41.449> you<00:05:41.569> were<00:05:41.719> to

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
doesn't appear full but if you were to

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.399 
doesn't appear full but if you were to
put<00:05:42.770> it<00:05:42.860> over<00:05:42.949> here<00:05:43.460> where<00:05:43.819> this<00:05:44.360> shows<00:05:44.659> the

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:45.409 
put it over here where this shows the

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:49.930 
put it over here where this shows the
blue<00:05:45.590> and<00:05:46.180> in<00:05:47.180> scale<00:05:47.690> it's<00:05:48.080> full<00:05:48.560> so<00:05:49.460> that's

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
blue and in scale it's full so that's

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.529 
blue and in scale it's full so that's
kind<00:05:50.210> of<00:05:50.270> just<00:05:50.419> a<00:05:50.690> little<00:05:51.069> tip<00:05:52.069> you<00:05:52.699> know<00:05:52.880> just

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:53.539 
kind of just a little tip you know just

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:55.870 
kind of just a little tip you know just
to<00:05:53.630> clear<00:05:53.870> things<00:05:53.900> up<00:05:54.319> with<00:05:54.529> the<00:05:54.770> maps<00:05:55.039> that<00:05:55.849> uh

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
to clear things up with the maps that uh

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.379 
to clear things up with the maps that uh
what<00:05:56.840> is<00:05:56.930> it<00:05:57.009> land<00:05:58.009> all<00:05:58.340> the<00:05:58.400> land<00:05:58.880> value<00:05:59.240> all

00:05:59.379 --> 00:05:59.389 
what is it land all the land value all

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:01.059 
what is it land all the land value all
the<00:05:59.419> ores<00:05:59.659> they've<00:06:00.020> been<00:06:00.139> scaled<00:06:00.469> up<00:06:00.680> but<00:06:00.949> the

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:01.069 
the ores they've been scaled up but the

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:02.890 
the ores they've been scaled up but the
map<00:06:01.250> just<00:06:01.279> shows<00:06:01.580> differently<00:06:02.210> so<00:06:02.659> don't

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
map just shows differently so don't

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:03.790 
map just shows differently so don't
worry<00:06:02.990> about<00:06:03.110> that

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
worry about that

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.480 
worry about that
and<00:06:03.889> I<00:06:04.849> think<00:06:05.419> that's<00:06:05.690> all<00:06:05.870> to<00:06:06.080> it<00:06:06.490> alright

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
and I think that's all to it alright

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.100 
and I think that's all to it alright
second<00:06:08.029> thing<00:06:08.150> I<00:06:08.240> want<00:06:08.419> to<00:06:08.479> talk<00:06:08.659> about<00:06:08.810> is

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
second thing I want to talk about is

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.459 
second thing I want to talk about is
borders<00:06:09.680> so<00:06:10.610> if<00:06:11.060> you<00:06:11.210> go<00:06:11.360> over<00:06:11.779> to<00:06:11.810> your<00:06:12.199> game

00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:12.469 
borders so if you go over to your game

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:16.540 
borders so if you go over to your game
play<00:06:12.740> and<00:06:12.949> you<00:06:13.810> unable<00:06:14.810> city<00:06:15.289> borders<00:06:15.770> as<00:06:16.340> you

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
play and you unable city borders as you

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.300 
play and you unable city borders as you
can<00:06:16.699> see<00:06:17.020> this<00:06:18.020> border<00:06:18.500> doesn't<00:06:18.770> really<00:06:19.069> match

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
can see this border doesn't really match

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.719 
can see this border doesn't really match
up<00:06:19.550> with<00:06:19.669> this<00:06:19.990> now<00:06:20.990> I'll<00:06:21.229> show<00:06:21.469> you<00:06:21.529> why<00:06:21.830> this

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:22.729 
up with this now I'll show you why this

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:26.140 
up with this now I'll show you why this
border<00:06:23.029> isn't<00:06:23.330> really<00:06:23.569> accurate<00:06:23.810> so<00:06:25.150> don't

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.150 
border isn't really accurate so don't

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.580 
border isn't really accurate so don't
use<00:06:26.360> this<00:06:26.509> as<00:06:26.569> a<00:06:26.690> guide

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
use this as a guide

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.709 
use this as a guide
my<00:06:27.949> recommendation<00:06:28.759> is<00:06:28.940> just<00:06:28.969> to<00:06:29.300> turn<00:06:29.479> it<00:06:29.599> off

00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:29.719 
my recommendation is just to turn it off

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:31.990 
my recommendation is just to turn it off
when<00:06:29.870> you<00:06:29.990> play<00:06:30.229> because<00:06:31.219> it<00:06:31.430> really<00:06:31.699> gets<00:06:31.879> in

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
when you play because it really gets in

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.200 
when you play because it really gets in
the<00:06:32.120> way<00:06:32.270> and<00:06:32.569> for<00:06:33.469> me<00:06:33.620> it<00:06:33.919> had<00:06:34.219> me<00:06:34.370> falsely

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210 
the way and for me it had me falsely

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:37.540 
the way and for me it had me falsely
believing<00:06:35.690> that<00:06:36.020> you're<00:06:36.770> allowed<00:06:37.159> to<00:06:37.190> place

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:37.550 
believing that you're allowed to place

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.589 
believing that you're allowed to place
things<00:06:38.419> here<00:06:38.870> but<00:06:39.259> in<00:06:39.380> reality<00:06:39.620> it's<00:06:40.339> not<00:06:41.330> that

00:06:41.589 --> 00:06:41.599 
things here but in reality it's not that

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:43.209 
things here but in reality it's not that
way<00:06:41.779> at<00:06:41.810> all<00:06:42.080> as<00:06:42.259> you<00:06:42.349> can<00:06:42.500> see<00:06:42.680> I<00:06:42.710> have<00:06:42.949> a<00:06:43.009> bus

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:43.219 
way at all as you can see I have a bus

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:44.190 
way at all as you can see I have a bus
terminal<00:06:43.399> and<00:06:43.940> I

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:44.200 
terminal and I

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.030 
terminal and I
can't<00:06:44.440> really<00:06:44.800> put<00:06:45.430> it<00:06:45.550> there<00:06:45.790> at<00:06:45.970> also<00:06:47.040> play

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.040 
can't really put it there at also play

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.640 
can't really put it there at also play
with<00:06:48.190> borders<00:06:48.490> off<00:06:48.810> remember<00:06:49.810> if<00:06:50.200> you<00:06:50.350> want<00:06:50.560> to

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:50.650 
with borders off remember if you want to

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.490 
with borders off remember if you want to
build<00:06:50.860> then<00:06:51.490> remember<00:06:51.820> it's<00:06:51.970> north<00:06:52.600> and<00:06:52.900> then

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:53.500 
build then remember it's north and then

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.580 
build then remember it's north and then
northeast<00:06:54.040> and<00:06:54.390> east<00:06:55.440> relatively<00:06:56.440> the<00:06:56.470> same

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:56.590 
northeast and east relatively the same

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.490 
northeast and east relatively the same
size<00:06:56.800> of<00:06:57.250> the<00:06:57.310> original<00:06:57.430> city<00:06:57.910> tile<00:06:58.150> and<00:06:58.500> like

00:06:59.490 --> 00:06:59.500 
size of the original city tile and like

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:04.440 
size of the original city tile and like
that<00:07:00.540> so<00:07:01.920> anyway<00:07:02.920> I<00:07:03.190> think<00:07:03.280> that's<00:07:03.700> all<00:07:03.880> for

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:04.450 
that so anyway I think that's all for

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.810 
that so anyway I think that's all for
the<00:07:04.650> misconceptions<00:07:05.650> I'm<00:07:06.340> going<00:07:06.580> to<00:07:06.640> show<00:07:06.760> you

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:06.820 
the misconceptions I'm going to show you

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.810 
the misconceptions I'm going to show you
how<00:07:07.090> to<00:07:07.150> actually<00:07:07.420> set<00:07:07.750> up<00:07:07.810> the<00:07:07.900> city<00:07:08.670> which<00:07:09.670> I

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:09.820 
how to actually set up the city which I

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.360 
how to actually set up the city which I
didn't<00:07:10.150> do<00:07:10.240> in<00:07:10.360> my<00:07:10.450> last<00:07:10.740> spotlight<00:07:11.740> so<00:07:12.040> here

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.370 
didn't do in my last spotlight so here

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:15.930 
didn't do in my last spotlight so here
we<00:07:12.460> go<00:07:12.610> so<00:07:14.130> if<00:07:15.130> you<00:07:15.250> installed<00:07:15.640> the<00:07:15.790> mod

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:15.940 
we go so if you installed the mod

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:16.710 
we go so if you installed the mod
correctly

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:16.720 
correctly

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.840 
correctly
meaning<00:07:17.080> you<00:07:17.410> dragged<00:07:17.800> all<00:07:18.040> the<00:07:18.190> files<00:07:18.460> into

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:18.850 
meaning you dragged all the files into

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.390 
meaning you dragged all the files into
the<00:07:19.120> SimCity<00:07:19.540> beta<00:07:19.810> folder<00:07:20.290> and<00:07:20.500> it's<00:07:21.220> all

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:21.400 
the SimCity beta folder and it's all

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.970 
the SimCity beta folder and it's all
good<00:07:22.090> and<00:07:22.300> working<00:07:22.510> order<00:07:22.990> to<00:07:23.560> make<00:07:23.740> a<00:07:23.770> new

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:23.980 
good and working order to make a new

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.610 
good and working order to make a new
city<00:07:24.250> basically<00:07:25.180> you<00:07:25.360> have<00:07:25.540> to<00:07:25.690> start<00:07:26.380> a<00:07:26.470> new

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:26.620 
city basically you have to start a new

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.070 
city basically you have to start a new
city<00:07:27.040> claim<00:07:27.340> a<00:07:27.460> new<00:07:27.490> city<00:07:27.940> tile<00:07:28.150> then<00:07:28.930> you're

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:29.080 
city claim a new city tile then you're

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.600 
city claim a new city tile then you're
going<00:07:29.260> to<00:07:29.380> load<00:07:29.590> it<00:07:29.740> then<00:07:30.340> you're<00:07:30.460> going<00:07:30.550> to

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:30.610 
going to load it then you're going to

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.280 
going to load it then you're going to
save<00:07:30.820> it<00:07:30.850> and<00:07:31.690> then<00:07:31.750> you're<00:07:31.900> going<00:07:32.020> to<00:07:32.080> quit

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:32.290 
save it and then you're going to quit

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:34.290 
save it and then you're going to quit
the<00:07:32.650> game<00:07:32.680> once<00:07:33.520> you<00:07:33.610> quit<00:07:33.760> the<00:07:33.910> game<00:07:33.940> you're

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:34.300 
the game once you quit the game you're

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.420 
the game once you quit the game you're
going<00:07:34.420> to<00:07:34.480> reload<00:07:34.780> the<00:07:34.930> game<00:07:35.080> again<00:07:35.440> and<00:07:35.710> then

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:36.430 
going to reload the game again and then

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:37.890 
going to reload the game again and then
you're<00:07:36.550> going<00:07:36.730> to<00:07:36.880> load<00:07:37.180> up<00:07:37.210> the<00:07:37.450> city<00:07:37.660> and

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:37.900 
you're going to load up the city and

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.900 
you're going to load up the city and
everything<00:07:38.380> should<00:07:38.740> be<00:07:38.800> working<00:07:39.070> in<00:07:39.640> order

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:39.910 
everything should be working in order

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:42.990 
everything should be working in order
I'm<00:07:40.750> not<00:07:40.810> quite<00:07:41.200> sure<00:07:41.230> if<00:07:41.710> it's<00:07:41.920> going<00:07:42.160> to<00:07:42.430> work

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:43.000 
I'm not quite sure if it's going to work

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.060 
I'm not quite sure if it's going to work
on<00:07:43.180> existing<00:07:43.540> cities<00:07:44.080> I<00:07:44.350> haven't<00:07:44.680> tested<00:07:44.830> it
