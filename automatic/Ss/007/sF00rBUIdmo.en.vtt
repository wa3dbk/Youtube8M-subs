00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.060
 hi everyone is jojo go 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.910
 today I offer you the test 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.559
 full of the mobile sosh a smartphone that 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.210
 has a specificity it is not expensive 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.840
 since you can have it for less 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.840
 from 100 euros 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.690
 as usual I will start with 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.340
 talk about design and the first thing 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.470
 we notice when the in hand is its 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.300
 lightness with its 97 g 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.460
 he is also very fine with a 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.749
 thickness of less than 8000 m we have 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.510
 really a good grip 

00:00:33.749 --> 00:00:37.979
 the front is black 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.960
 behind and plastic with an appearance 

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:41.370
 aluminum pleasant to the touch and 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.679
 first sight it looks solid 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.269
 you have hashtags and the logo 

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:47.069
 except that we find on the box 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.809
 packing not on the behind of 

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:50.399
 the device that gives a young side in 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.679
 bottom right you have water by the hour 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.199
 where quality is not bad lesson 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:58.049
 is not amazing but it's enough 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.209
 correct right you have a 

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:01.949
 location to put a sim card and 

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:04.530
 another for the memory card 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.780
 you can put up to 32 gigas per 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.850
 against to put your sim card by 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.230
 example do not even try with your 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.390
 fingers I did not succeed 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.420
 I had to use a pen for his purposes 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.160
 to sink well up you have a 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.690
 mini jack jack the power button for 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.670
 turn off and m invades your 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.660
 device and you also have a high 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.980
 speaker on the left as usual on 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.480
 found the volume buttons for 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.750
 increase lowered under I teach you 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.240
 not much and we go we have the microphone 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.020
 as well as a usb socket for power 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.020
 recharge your device 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.420
 at the bottom of the screen you have three 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.770
 touch buttons turn back the 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.660
 home button to go on the 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.030
 springboard and the settings button for 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.520
 all the apps and to finish in 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.020
 beauty the mobile that I propose a 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.490
 little blue light that will flash 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.350
 when you are going to receive a 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.500
 notification what is really very 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.500
 convenient 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.090
 the mobile search offers a screen 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.209
 4.3 inch touch with the 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:13.040
 screen lcd ips technology with a 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:15.890
 giant fwv definition of 480 by 854 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.959
 pixels with about 240 pixels per inch 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.730
 which is correct to avoid seeing 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.730
 the camera's pixels easily 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.540
 for the feature part the 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.299
 processor it's a double heart 1,3 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.129
 giguÃ¨re the ram is 500 mega 4 gigas of 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.469
 internal memory of which 2 gigas which is 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.519
 used by the android system but you 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:36.780
 can always add a map 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.480
 memory I call you back you can 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.760
 put a micro SD card up to 32 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:46.019
 gigas i did the test with geekbench 3 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.659
 single heart 322 in score and 580 in 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.430
 multi hearts and for information title 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:52.439
 these scores are much higher by 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.150
 compared to the iphone 4s at the level of 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:55.379
 battery we have a battery of 1700 mini 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.480
 amp you can not change 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.980
 it's a shame the battery for 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.139
 the moment level of autonomy I the 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.359
 is pretty good but I'm waiting for a 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:05.849
 week of use to be able to you 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:08.069
 to say what I really think so 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.299
 it will be enough to watch the video my opinion 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.739
 on the mobile search 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.810
 nothing complicated will be in the 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.359
 description of the video you have the 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.359
 bluetooth 4.0 wifi the gps 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:21.269
 the accelerometer a stick the internet in 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:23.370
 3g chips at the game graphics level 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.200
 it's not beautiful but I can when 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.209
 even play games smoothly 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.150
 I tested two games gourmands real 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.479
 racing 3 and iron man 3 a few small 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.729
 the G 

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:35.069
 on the other hand the games of the time paul style 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:36.239
 rudd and there is no problem 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.340
 graphics are correct 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.290
 the mobile search is not at all a 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.449
 portable console but you can when 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.799
 even play a few games without having 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:45.799
 actually bugs 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.849
 I did another test with 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.770
 the rhone application touches because 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.780
 that's how we pronounced who 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.900
 also allows you to have points 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.970
 scores in order to compare our 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.800
 phone with other phones and there 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.090
 we have a score of 10 thousand four hundred 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.760
 eight for this test 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.760
 it's the equivalent of galaxy s2 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.820
 we will now focus on 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.769
 the camera we had 5 megapixels 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.850
 with the flash behind as well as a 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:26.350
 vga camera of 0.3 megapixel at the level of 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.310
 the camera the application you 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.240
 offers some features 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.630
 interesting 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.490
 yes m panorama mode smile mode 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.900
 you can take pictures in a burst 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.900
 so several photos at a time 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.900
 I can turn off the flash 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.860
 change camera either in front of or 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:51.230
 behind and at the bottom left you have 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.330
 photo and video settings you 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:56.660
 can for example add filters 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:59.660
 in the photos we can add a 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.610
 self-timer then we can do full 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.800
 other things like for example 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.640
 add face detection that 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.640
 can be really practical 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.490
 in terms of photo quality it is 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.500
 correct as you see on the screen 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.630
 by cons for videos is not 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.790
 exceptional but good it's quite 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.020
 normal it's not a camera and I 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.070
 remind you that it's a smartphone 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.270
 which is less than 100 euros 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.270
 so do not ask too much 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.520
 for the operating system part one 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.380
 to android 4.2.2 jane there will 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.050
 future updates in the future 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.610
 you have the sosh stock rom that 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.740
 installed on it that picks up some 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.390
 effects found on the nexus 4 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.340
 you can do a lot of things 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.800
 on an android phone 1 change of 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.360
 theme be widgets edit the losc 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.930
 wind add features to 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.400
 right on the left 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.070
 you have many applications 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.480
 free and paid to download you 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.370
 is at least sure to find your 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.130
 happiness under android 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.930
 the navigation is really nice 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:12.190
 knowing that the screen is responsive we have 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.230
 really a pleasure to use this 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:15.760
 phone is for comparison I 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:18.460
 prefers the presentation of 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.470
 phone sms apps as well as the 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.530
 notification with respect to 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:25.810
 galaxy s 4 the mobile search is proposed 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.760
 at the price of 99 euros but until 20 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.410
 November 2013 you can have a 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.830
 reduction of EUR 30 thus allowing 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:34.780
 to have it for 69 euros the test video 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.490
 is over but soon I will 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.710
 will offer a video review on this 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.120
 device after one week of use 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:43.120
 to tell you roughly but points 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:45.190
 positive and negative that I found on 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.140
