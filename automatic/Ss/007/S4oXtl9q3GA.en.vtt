but<00:01:35.400> that's<00:01:35.549> not<00:01:35.700> holding<00:01:36.000> me<00:01:36.090> back<00:01:36.329> it's<00:01:36.689> just

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
but that's not holding me back it's just

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.020 
but that's not holding me back it's just
I<00:01:37.710> would<00:01:38.070> really<00:01:38.280> like<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.579> add<00:01:38.670> this<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.939> the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
I would really like to add this to the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.460 
I would really like to add this to the
gun<00:01:39.180> vs.<00:01:39.450> gun<00:01:39.570> series<00:01:39.930> i<00:01:40.020> think<00:01:40.049> that'd<00:01:40.320> go

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
gun vs. gun series i think that'd go

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.440 
gun vs. gun series i think that'd go
over<00:01:40.500> really<00:01:40.950> well<00:01:41.100> but<00:01:42.030> let's<00:01:42.210> go<00:01:42.299> ahead<00:01:42.329> and

at breaking down guns as drifter
although<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:54.180> guess<00:01:54.570> I'm<00:01:54.720> okay<00:01:54.990> but<00:01:55.259> let's<00:01:55.470> go

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
one of those default snipers it's one of

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.580 
one of those default snipers it's one of
the<00:02:00.360> first<00:02:00.630> ones<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.960> unlock<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.439> game

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
clear but I not I'm hoping to not start

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.420 
clear but I not I'm hoping to not start
some<00:02:10.770> sort<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.099> war<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.580> don't<00:02:12.300> give<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.540> shit

some sort of war I don't give a shit

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.640 
some sort of war I don't give a shit
about<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:14.030> DSR<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.689> balista<00:02:14.989> I'm<00:02:15.290> not<00:02:15.500> one<00:02:15.620> of

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
about the DSR the balista I'm not one of

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.050 
about the DSR the balista I'm not one of
those<00:02:15.799> people<00:02:16.129> who<00:02:16.189> are<00:02:16.280> gonna<00:02:16.370> say<00:02:16.579> oh<00:02:16.609> this

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
those people who are gonna say oh this

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.819 
those people who are gonna say oh this
guns<00:02:17.329> better<00:02:17.599> or<00:02:17.930> this<00:02:18.109> guns<00:02:18.319> better<00:02:18.560> it's

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829 
guns better or this guns better it's

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:22.240 
guns better or this guns better it's
like<00:02:19.159> the<00:02:19.400> MSR<00:02:19.969> and<00:02:20.239> l11<00:02:20.989> in<00:02:21.530> modern<00:02:21.890> warfare<00:02:21.950> 3

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
like the MSR and l11 in modern warfare 3

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.459 
like the MSR and l11 in modern warfare 3
whatever<00:02:23.090> you<00:02:23.269> got<00:02:23.450> whatever<00:02:24.019> gun<00:02:24.200> you<00:02:24.319> guys

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:24.469 
whatever you got whatever gun you guys

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:25.599 
whatever you got whatever gun you guys
think<00:02:24.709> is<00:02:24.769> better<00:02:24.950> you<00:02:25.129> know<00:02:25.250> that's<00:02:25.400> your

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:25.609 
think is better you know that's your

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:28.149 
think is better you know that's your
personal<00:02:26.030> opinion<00:02:26.150> me<00:02:26.989> i<00:02:27.230> just<00:02:27.290> used<00:02:27.769> both<00:02:27.980> of

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.159 
personal opinion me i just used both of

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.360 
personal opinion me i just used both of
them<00:02:28.310> so<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:29.359> DSR<00:02:29.810> starts<00:02:30.200> out<00:02:30.379> unlocked<00:02:31.250> at

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
them so the DSR starts out unlocked at

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.690 
them so the DSR starts out unlocked at
level<00:02:31.400> 4<00:02:31.819> with<00:02:32.299> a<00:02:32.329> damaged<00:02:32.719> of<00:02:32.870> 98<00:02:33.379> and<00:02:33.700> this

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
level 4 with a damaged of 98 and this

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.369 
level 4 with a damaged of 98 and this
gun<00:02:34.939> is<00:02:34.969> amazing<00:02:35.659> at<00:02:35.810> pretty<00:02:36.019> much<00:02:36.079> all

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
gun is amazing at pretty much all

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.140 
gun is amazing at pretty much all
distances<00:02:36.889> hopefully<00:02:37.489> people<00:02:37.879> don't

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
distances hopefully people don't

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.729 
distances hopefully people don't
complain<00:02:38.510> about<00:02:38.659> it<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:39.049> get<00:02:39.139> it<00:02:39.170> patched<00:02:39.439> or

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
complain about it and get it patched or

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.440 
complain about it and get it patched or
anything<00:02:40.069> but<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.909> only<00:02:41.060> time<00:02:41.239> you're<00:02:41.389> really

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
anything but the only time you're really

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.849 
anything but the only time you're really
going<00:02:41.629> to<00:02:41.689> get<00:02:41.810> a<00:02:41.840> hitmarker<00:02:42.049> on<00:02:42.439> this<00:02:42.620> gun<00:02:42.829> is

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
going to get a hitmarker on this gun is

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:44.470 
going to get a hitmarker on this gun is
if<00:02:43.099> you<00:02:43.189> shoot<00:02:43.370> someone<00:02:43.639> in<00:02:43.849> the<00:02:43.879> foot<00:02:44.209> it's

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
if you shoot someone in the foot it's

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.520 
if you shoot someone in the foot it's
got<00:02:44.870> a<00:02:45.109> headshot<00:02:45.889> multiplier<00:02:46.040> of<00:02:46.459> two<00:02:47.120> or<00:02:47.389> I

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
got a headshot multiplier of two or I

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.750 
got a headshot multiplier of two or I
think<00:02:48.530> so<00:02:48.829> I<00:02:48.859> never<00:02:48.980> really<00:02:49.250> understood<00:02:49.310> these

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
think so I never really understood these

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.479 
think so I never really understood these
multipliers<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.810> damage<00:02:51.109> multipliers<00:02:51.650> but

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
multipliers the damage multipliers but

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.179 
multipliers the damage multipliers but
like<00:02:52.730> a<00:02:52.939> headshot<00:02:53.840> is<00:02:54.019> x<00:02:54.319> 2<00:02:54.650> so<00:02:54.859> that<00:02:54.980> means

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:55.189 
like a headshot is x 2 so that means

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:56.830 
like a headshot is x 2 so that means
it's<00:02:55.459> going<00:02:55.579> to<00:02:55.639> be<00:02:55.760> a<00:02:55.790> one-hit<00:02:56.180> kill<00:02:56.540> to<00:02:56.720> the

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
it's going to be a one-hit kill to the

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.459 
it's going to be a one-hit kill to the
head<00:02:57.099> neck<00:02:58.099> or<00:02:58.400> upper<00:02:58.489> chest<00:02:59.359> and<00:02:59.750> most<00:03:00.290> likely

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:00.469 
head neck or upper chest and most likely

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:04.259 
head neck or upper chest and most likely
a<00:03:00.769> two-hit<00:03:01.310> kill<00:03:01.549> to<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:01.939> lower<00:03:02.719> stomach<00:03:03.139> and

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
a two-hit kill to the lower stomach and

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.879 
a two-hit kill to the lower stomach and
from<00:03:05.269> down<00:03:05.480> or<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:05.930> arms<00:03:06.230> and<00:03:06.409> stuff<00:03:06.620> so

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:06.889 
from down or the arms and stuff so

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:08.259 
from down or the arms and stuff so
that's<00:03:07.459> pretty<00:03:07.639> much<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.819> only<00:03:07.939> time<00:03:08.150> you're

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
that's pretty much the only time you're

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:09.759 
that's pretty much the only time you're
going<00:03:08.359> to<00:03:08.450> get<00:03:08.510> a<00:03:08.569> hitmarker<00:03:08.810> on<00:03:09.169> this<00:03:09.319> gun<00:03:09.530> and

the<00:03:15.200> best<00:03:15.349> of<00:03:15.530> quickscoping<00:03:16.069> although<00:03:16.400> in<00:03:16.519> mw2

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:16.939 
the best of quickscoping although in mw2

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:18.610 
the best of quickscoping although in mw2
I<00:03:17.120> used<00:03:17.449> to<00:03:17.569> do<00:03:17.659> that<00:03:17.690> shit<00:03:18.079> back<00:03:18.229> in<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.500> day

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
I used to do that shit back in the day

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.619 
I used to do that shit back in the day
and<00:03:18.739> it<00:03:18.859> was<00:03:18.889> a<00:03:18.979> lot<00:03:19.159> of<00:03:19.190> fun<00:03:19.359> one<00:03:20.359> thing<00:03:20.540> I

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:20.629 
and it was a lot of fun one thing I

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:22.059 
and it was a lot of fun one thing I
really<00:03:20.840> wish<00:03:20.989> they<00:03:21.169> would<00:03:21.319> actually<00:03:21.470> add<00:03:21.739> in<00:03:21.919> I

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
really wish they would actually add in I

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.559 
really wish they would actually add in I
know<00:03:22.129> this<00:03:22.310> is<00:03:22.430> zero<00:03:22.579> elephant<00:03:23.000> but<00:03:23.209> a<00:03:23.239> quick

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
know this is zero elephant but a quick

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.240 
know this is zero elephant but a quick
scoping<00:03:23.930> playlist<00:03:24.409> I<00:03:24.560> think<00:03:24.889> that<00:03:25.040> would<00:03:25.129> be

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
scoping playlist I think that would be

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.670 
scoping playlist I think that would be
pretty<00:03:25.370> badass<00:03:25.699> but<00:03:26.299> back<00:03:26.959> on<00:03:26.989> to<00:03:27.349> the<00:03:27.379> damage

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
pretty badass but back on to the damage

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.710 
pretty badass but back on to the damage
so<00:03:28.099> this<00:03:28.579> gun<00:03:28.790> you're<00:03:29.060> never<00:03:29.269> really<00:03:29.389> going<00:03:29.599> to

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
so this gun you're never really going to

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.140 
so this gun you're never really going to
run<00:03:29.840> into<00:03:29.989> hit<00:03:30.260> markers<00:03:30.650> at<00:03:30.919> least<00:03:31.129> for<00:03:31.400> me<00:03:31.489> now

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
run into hit markers at least for me now

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.670 
run into hit markers at least for me now
if<00:03:32.269> you're<00:03:32.419> quick<00:03:32.599> scoping<00:03:33.019> even<00:03:33.439> though<00:03:33.530> I<00:03:33.560> do

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
if you're quick scoping even though I do

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.009 
if you're quick scoping even though I do
some<00:03:33.979> quick<00:03:34.129> scoping<00:03:34.579> sometimes<00:03:35.209> I<00:03:35.510> never

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
some quick scoping sometimes I never

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:37.420 
some quick scoping sometimes I never
really<00:03:36.199> run<00:03:36.319> into<00:03:36.530> hit<00:03:36.650> markers<00:03:36.949> on<00:03:37.099> this<00:03:37.220> gun

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
really run into hit markers on this gun

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.059 
really run into hit markers on this gun

unless it's a lower body shot now it's

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.800 
unless it's a lower body shot now it's

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
sometimes I miss a lot so I like to

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.999 
sometimes I miss a lot so I like to
throw<00:03:46.909> on<00:03:47.090> the<00:03:47.269> extended<00:03:47.900> mags<00:03:48.109> and<00:03:48.439> the<00:03:48.560> FMJ

throw on the extended mags and the FMJ

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:50.589 
throw on the extended mags and the FMJ
because<00:03:49.519> mm<00:03:49.819> Jane<00:03:50.030> this<00:03:50.180> game<00:03:50.359> actually

because mm Jane this game actually

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:52.449 
because mm Jane this game actually
increases<00:03:51.319> your<00:03:51.409> bullet<00:03:51.739> damage<00:03:51.859> so<00:03:52.250> that's

increases your bullet damage so that's

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.550 
increases your bullet damage so that's
really<00:03:52.790> good<00:03:52.970> if<00:03:53.150> you<00:03:53.269> have<00:03:53.509> that<00:03:53.720> I<00:03:53.959> got<00:03:54.470> the

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:04.129 
haven't gotten those yet now the rate of

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:06.159 
haven't gotten those yet now the rate of
fire<00:04:04.370> is<00:04:04.400> 50<00:04:05.030> and<00:04:05.060> since<00:04:05.569> it's<00:04:05.720> a<00:04:05.780> bolt-action

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:06.169 
fire is 50 and since it's a bolt-action

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:08.409 
fire is 50 and since it's a bolt-action
sniper<00:04:06.680> it<00:04:07.159> really<00:04:07.370> doesn't<00:04:07.669> matter<00:04:07.759> and<00:04:08.090> it

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:08.419 
sniper it really doesn't matter and it

seems<00:04:08.629> the<00:04:08.750> bolt-action<00:04:09.019> snipers<00:04:09.680> are<00:04:09.889> pretty

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:10.189 
seems the bolt-action snipers are pretty

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:12.039
