are in the Lions paws they're spinning
right<00:00:28.840> so<00:00:29.380> to<00:00:29.439> continue<00:00:30.130> Maxis<00:00:30.880> you<00:00:31.180> have<00:00:31.390> to

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
right so to continue Maxis you have to

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.170 
right so to continue Maxis you have to
take<00:00:31.809> them<00:00:32.020> out<00:00:32.200> to<00:00:32.500> continue<00:00:33.370> Richthofen<00:00:34.059> you

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
take them out to continue Richthofen you

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.240 
take them out to continue Richthofen you
shoot<00:00:34.420> the<00:00:34.570> sliquifier<00:00:34.960> at<00:00:35.380> them<00:00:35.559> until<00:00:35.710> they

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
shoot the sliquifier at them until they

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.280 
shoot the sliquifier at them until they
start<00:00:36.520> spinning<00:00:36.760> once<00:00:37.450> they're<00:00:37.690> spinning<00:00:37.989> you

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
start spinning once they're spinning you

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.799 
start spinning once they're spinning you
can<00:00:38.500> no<00:00:38.679> longer<00:00:39.010> remove<00:00:39.550> them<00:00:39.789> therefore<00:00:40.120> you

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
can no longer remove them therefore you

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:42.119 
can no longer remove them therefore you
have<00:00:40.960> make<00:00:41.140> it<00:00:41.320> you've<00:00:41.589> made<00:00:41.620> your<00:00:42.070> choice

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
have make it you've made your choice

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.790 
have make it you've made your choice
even<00:00:42.760> with<00:00:42.879> Max's<00:00:43.390> you<00:00:44.109> can<00:00:44.289> take<00:00:44.499> them<00:00:44.679> out

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
even with Max's you can take them out

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.400 
even with Max's you can take them out
but<00:00:45.070> then<00:00:45.219> put<00:00:45.429> them<00:00:45.519> back<00:00:45.579> in<00:00:45.940> so<00:00:46.120> I<00:00:46.510> think<00:00:47.140> you

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
but then put them back in so I think you

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.950 
but then put them back in so I think you
can<00:00:47.620> go<00:00:47.769> back<00:00:47.949> at<00:00:48.460> least<00:00:48.670> at<00:00:48.850> that<00:00:48.879> point<00:00:49.269> to

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
can go back at least at that point to

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.290 
can go back at least at that point to
helping<00:00:50.410> Richthofen<00:00:50.949> but<00:00:51.129> once<00:00:51.370> you<00:00:51.640> get<00:00:52.120> them

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
helping Richthofen but once you get them

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.700 
helping Richthofen but once you get them
spinning<00:00:52.629> I<00:00:52.929> don't<00:00:52.960> believe<00:00:53.409> you<00:00:53.559> can

spinning I don't believe you can

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.630 
spinning I don't believe you can

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
again enlighten one Buddha it's pretty

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.830 
again enlighten one Buddha it's pretty
much<00:01:38.740> equivalent<00:01:38.980> so<00:01:39.700> we're<00:01:40.360> just<00:01:40.390> going<00:01:40.810> to

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
much equivalent so we're just going to

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.750 
much equivalent so we're just going to
to<00:01:41.470> kill<00:01:41.680> a<00:01:41.710> few<00:01:41.920> zombies<00:01:42.250> and<00:01:42.430> you<00:01:42.490> have<00:01:42.640> to
