00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
when you calculate the angle of degree

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.620 
when you calculate the angle of degree
put<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.649> piece<00:01:48.920> over<00:01:49.220> hole<00:01:49.640> then<00:01:49.970> grab<00:01:50.390> that

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
put the piece over hole then grab that

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.040 
put the piece over hole then grab that
bar<00:01:51.080> by<00:01:51.380> doing<00:01:51.950> this<00:01:52.159> math<00:01:52.550> you<00:01:52.909> get<00:01:53.270> a<00:01:53.450> percent

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 
bar by doing this math you get a percent

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.139 
bar by doing this math you get a percent
they<00:01:54.319> and<00:01:54.649> up<00:01:54.890> to<00:01:55.069> a<00:01:55.130> hundred<00:01:55.520> when<00:01:55.759> you<00:01:55.880> make<00:01:56.119> a

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
they and up to a hundred when you make a

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.330 
they and up to a hundred when you make a
pie<00:01:56.479> chart<00:01:56.899> but<00:01:57.409> time<00:01:57.649> plus<00:01:57.830> one<00:01:58.039> it<00:01:58.130> sounds

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
pie chart but time plus one it sounds

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.550 
pie chart but time plus one it sounds
like<00:01:58.520> a<00:01:58.610> measure<00:01:59.149> over<00:01:59.630> time<00:01:59.659> i<00:02:00.200> annihilate

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
like a measure over time i annihilate

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.540 
like a measure over time i annihilate
