really really careful with it see how
sharp<00:00:35.440> the<00:00:35.560> edges<00:00:35.620> are<00:00:36.300> what<00:00:37.300> we<00:00:37.420> cut<00:00:37.660> that

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
sharp the edges are what we cut that

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.940 
sharp the edges are what we cut that
with<00:00:38.050> is<00:00:38.290> this<00:00:39.300> okay<00:00:40.300> this<00:00:41.050> is<00:00:41.260> a<00:00:41.290> metal<00:00:41.710> cutter

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
with is this okay this is a metal cutter

with is this okay this is a metal cutter
the<00:00:42.670> metal<00:00:42.940> cutoff<00:00:43.210> blade<00:00:43.329> just<00:00:43.899> a<00:00:43.989> grinder

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
the metal cutoff blade just a grinder

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.040 
the metal cutoff blade just a grinder
but<00:00:45.160> I<00:00:45.190> found<00:00:45.489> it<00:00:45.730> up<00:00:45.850> so<00:00:46.030> no<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:47.710> one<00:00:47.980> is

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
but I found it up so no this one is

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.720 
but I found it up so no this one is
designed<00:00:50.050> to<00:00:50.290> grind<00:00:50.649> metal<00:00:51.040> so<00:00:51.190> this<00:00:51.370> will<00:00:51.579> get

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
designed to grind metal so this will get

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.910 
designed to grind metal so this will get
you<00:00:51.910> your<00:00:52.149> raw<00:00:52.809> metal<00:00:53.200> so<00:00:53.290> you<00:00:53.380> have<00:00:53.530> something

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
you your raw metal so you have something

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.540 
you your raw metal so you have something
-<00:00:54.070> well<00:00:54.280> -<00:00:54.579> okay<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:56.770> one<00:00:56.829> right<00:00:57.130> here<00:00:57.430> is<00:00:57.489> a

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
- well - okay this one right here is a

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.130 
- well - okay this one right here is a
little<00:00:57.670> bit<00:00:57.790> more<00:00:57.969> flexible<00:00:58.570> this<00:00:58.750> runs<00:00:58.989> off

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
little bit more flexible this runs off

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.080 
little bit more flexible this runs off
of<00:00:59.170> the<00:00:59.380> air<00:00:59.530> this<00:01:00.130> is<00:01:00.340> what<00:01:00.489> you<00:01:00.579> use<00:01:00.790> to<00:01:00.820> do<00:01:01.059> a

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
of the air this is what you use to do a

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.090 
of the air this is what you use to do a
finishing<00:01:01.390> if<00:01:02.230> you<00:01:02.320> want<00:01:02.500> to<00:01:02.590> come<00:01:02.710> over<00:01:02.829> here

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
finishing if you want to come over here

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.550 
finishing if you want to come over here
and<00:01:03.219> finish<00:01:03.430> it<00:01:03.670> off<00:01:03.790> now<00:01:04.780> all<00:01:04.989> this<00:01:05.170> stuff<00:01:05.439> is

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
and finish it off now all this stuff is

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.629 
and finish it off now all this stuff is
just<00:01:05.590> tack<00:01:06.009> welded<00:01:06.460> in<00:01:06.610> which<00:01:07.420> a<00:01:07.719> cap<00:01:08.049> will<00:01:08.350> is

00:01:08.629 --> 00:01:08.639 
just tack welded in which a cap will is

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:11.340 
just tack welded in which a cap will is
basically<00:01:09.639> if<00:01:09.850> you<00:01:10.479> have<00:01:10.630> something<00:01:11.109> that<00:01:11.139> you

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
basically if you have something that you

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.910 
basically if you have something that you
want<00:01:11.499> to<00:01:11.590> put<00:01:11.799> if<00:01:12.759> you<00:01:12.819> want<00:01:13.090> to<00:01:13.149> weld<00:01:13.359> this

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
want to put if you want to weld this

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.949 
want to put if you want to weld this
we'll<00:01:14.920> set<00:01:15.100> that<00:01:15.130> right<00:01:15.429> there

00:01:15.949 --> 00:01:15.959 
we'll set that right there

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:19.080 
we'll set that right there
we<00:01:16.959> can't<00:01:17.200> welter<00:01:17.619> that<00:01:17.740> until<00:01:18.009> it's<00:01:18.159> clean<00:01:18.399> if

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
we can't welter that until it's clean if

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.699 
we can't welter that until it's clean if
that's<00:01:19.329> not<00:01:19.539> clean<00:01:19.899> and<00:01:20.139> we<00:01:20.229> try<00:01:20.409> to<00:01:20.469> put<00:01:20.679> a

00:01:20.699 --> 00:01:20.709 
that's not clean and we try to put a

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:22.319 
that's not clean and we try to put a
weld<00:01:20.950> on<00:01:21.100> there<00:01:21.340> it's<00:01:21.759> just<00:01:21.909> going<00:01:22.060> to<00:01:22.149> just

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
weld on there it's just going to just

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:23.760 
weld on there it's just going to just
splatter<00:01:22.779> it's<00:01:23.049> not<00:01:23.200> going<00:01:23.380> to<00:01:23.469> penetrate

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
splatter it's not going to penetrate

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.649 
splatter it's not going to penetrate
that's<00:01:24.670> why<00:01:24.850> you<00:01:24.909> have<00:01:25.060> to<00:01:25.209> grind<00:01:25.420> it<00:01:25.600> down

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
that's why you have to grind it down

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.149 
that's why you have to grind it down
that's<00:01:26.020> what<00:01:26.170> these<00:01:26.289> tools<00:01:26.560> are<00:01:26.770> used<00:01:26.799> for

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
that's what these tools are used for

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:28.889 
that's what these tools are used for
before<00:01:27.459> I<00:01:27.549> do<00:01:27.609> this<00:01:27.999> you<00:01:28.149> need<00:01:28.270> to<00:01:28.389> understand

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
before I do this you need to understand

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.910 
before I do this you need to understand
that<00:01:29.229> it's<00:01:29.920> going<00:01:30.009> to<00:01:30.069> be<00:01:30.189> really<00:01:30.729> bright<00:01:31.920> even

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
that it's going to be really bright even

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.440 
that it's going to be really bright even
if<00:01:33.009> we<00:01:33.130> open<00:01:33.429> the<00:01:33.520> garage<00:01:33.639> which<00:01:34.060> we<00:01:34.209> probably

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
if we open the garage which we probably

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.760 
if we open the garage which we probably
will<00:01:34.779> because<00:01:34.959> there'd<00:01:35.170> be<00:01:35.229> a<00:01:35.259> lot<00:01:35.380> of<00:01:35.439> smell

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
will because there'd be a lot of smell

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.370 
will because there'd be a lot of smell
it'd<00:01:36.310> be<00:01:36.429> really<00:01:36.670> bright<00:01:37.109> encourage<00:01:38.109> you<00:01:38.229> not

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
it'd be really bright encourage you not

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.529 
it'd be really bright encourage you not
to<00:01:38.439> stare<00:01:38.829> at<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.009> light<00:01:39.159> if<00:01:39.939> you<00:01:40.090> guys<00:01:40.209> do

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
to stare at the light if you guys do

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:42.569 
to stare at the light if you guys do
you'll<00:01:41.469> wish<00:01:41.679> you<00:01:41.829> hadn't<00:01:42.219> because<00:01:42.399> you<00:01:42.490> will

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
you'll wish you hadn't because you will

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:45.449 
you'll wish you hadn't because you will
be<00:01:42.670> able<00:01:42.729> to<00:01:42.849> see<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:44.079> seriously<00:01:44.889> I<00:01:45.009> mean<00:01:45.249> it's

00:01:45.449 --> 00:01:45.459 
be able to see and seriously I mean it's

figure<00:06:17.680> it<00:06:17.860> out<00:06:17.979> okay<00:06:18.430> other<00:06:18.729> if<00:06:19.000> you<00:06:19.569> put<00:06:19.750> gas

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
figure it out okay other if you put gas

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:20.909 
figure it out okay other if you put gas
like<00:06:20.319> an<00:06:20.440> air<00:06:20.590> gun

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 
like an air gun

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:24.409 
like an air gun
you<00:06:21.460> get<00:06:21.580> a<00:06:21.610> really<00:06:21.819> nice<00:06:21.909> clean<00:06:22.300> shiny<00:06:22.749> will

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:24.419 
you get a really nice clean shiny will

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:27.869 
you get a really nice clean shiny will
look<00:06:25.419> at<00:06:25.599> it<00:06:25.749> and<00:06:26.430> you<00:06:27.430> can<00:06:27.610> see<00:06:27.759> the

00:06:27.869 --> 00:06:27.879 
look at it and you can see the

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:31.260 
look at it and you can see the
difference<00:06:28.379> it<00:06:29.379> just<00:06:29.650> changes<00:06:30.069> to<00:06:30.310> settings<00:06:30.550> I

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
difference it just changes to settings I

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.809 
difference it just changes to settings I
turned<00:06:31.689> the<00:06:31.840> speed<00:06:32.110> up<00:06:32.319> and<00:06:32.919> I<00:06:33.249> turn<00:06:33.520> the<00:06:33.639> heat

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:33.819 
turned the speed up and I turn the heat

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:37.050 
turned the speed up and I turn the heat
up<00:06:33.849> because<00:06:34.689> it's<00:06:34.840> thicker<00:06:35.080> metal<00:06:35.789> this<00:06:36.789> for

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:37.060 
up because it's thicker metal this for

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.550 
up because it's thicker metal this for
just<00:06:37.150> using<00:06:37.419> the<00:06:37.479> tack<00:06:37.689> things<00:06:37.930> in<00:06:38.080> place<00:06:38.289> I

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
just using the tack things in place I

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.290 
just using the tack things in place I
figured<00:06:39.129> it's<00:06:39.219> a<00:06:39.279> really<00:06:39.580> good<00:06:39.699> place<00:06:39.939> for<00:06:40.210> you

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.300 
figured it's a really good place for you

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.119 
figured it's a really good place for you
guys<00:06:40.360> to<00:06:40.539> start<00:06:41.020> if<00:06:41.289> it's<00:06:41.590> something<00:06:41.889> that<00:06:41.919> you

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:08.919 
I've always loved after then I think

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:10.769 
I've always loved after then I think
I've<00:07:09.009> had<00:07:09.129> five<00:07:09.400> of<00:07:09.430> these<00:07:09.669> I've<00:07:10.270> always<00:07:10.539> loved

00:07:10.769 --> 00:07:10.779 
I've had five of these I've always loved

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:12.990 
I've had five of these I've always loved
them<00:07:11.009> but<00:07:12.009> they<00:07:12.250> don't<00:07:12.370> have<00:07:12.580> enough

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.000 
them but they don't have enough

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.730 
them but they don't have enough
horsepower<00:07:13.360> they<00:07:14.050> don't<00:07:14.199> have<00:07:14.289> enough<00:07:14.469> cool

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:14.740 
horsepower they don't have enough cool

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.709 
horsepower they don't have enough cool
stuff<00:07:15.039> so<00:07:15.669> you<00:07:15.759> can<00:07:15.909> build<00:07:16.060> all<00:07:16.330> that<00:07:16.360> with

00:07:16.709 --> 00:07:16.719 
stuff so you can build all that with

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:18.450 
stuff so you can build all that with
fabrication<00:07:17.169> well<00:07:17.650> they<00:07:17.770> can<00:07:17.919> be<00:07:18.039> used<00:07:18.250> for

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:18.460 
fabrication well they can be used for

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.159 
fabrication well they can be used for
more<00:07:18.610> than<00:07:18.669> just<00:07:18.819> custom<00:07:19.360> fabrication<00:07:19.870> you

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:20.169 
more than just custom fabrication you

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:21.899 
more than just custom fabrication you
can<00:07:20.289> be<00:07:20.379> what<00:07:20.560> they<00:07:20.740> can<00:07:20.889> be<00:07:20.979> used<00:07:21.129> for<00:07:21.370> lots<00:07:21.669> of

00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:21.909 
can be what they can be used for lots of

00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:24.029 
can be what they can be used for lots of
things<00:07:22.150> get<00:07:22.389> this<00:07:23.020> is<00:07:23.229> what<00:07:23.379> I<00:07:23.409> using<00:07:23.949> the

00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:24.039 
things get this is what I using the

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:26.610 
things get this is what I using the
force<00:07:24.279> what<00:07:24.520> I<00:07:24.550> do<00:07:24.639> for<00:07:24.969> work<00:07:25.289> so<00:07:26.289> if<00:07:26.379> you<00:07:26.500> guys
