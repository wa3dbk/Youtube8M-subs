and after i am done here and as I I have
to<00:02:30.580> take<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.910> net<00:02:31.300> and<00:02:31.450> there<00:02:31.630> I<00:02:31.750> get<00:02:32.050> my<00:02:32.200> score

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
to take the net and there I get my score

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.800 
to take the net and there I get my score
streaks<00:02:32.740> but<00:02:32.920> it<00:02:33.220> was<00:02:33.370> kind<00:02:33.640> of<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:33.820> surprise<00:02:34.120> I

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
streaks but it was kind of a surprise I

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.790 
streaks but it was kind of a surprise I
didn't<00:02:35.080> know<00:02:35.470> why<00:02:35.620> I<00:02:35.650> was<00:02:35.680> so<00:02:35.920> close<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.840> I

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
didn't know why I was so close so and I

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.340 
didn't know why I was so close so and I
made<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.340> right<00:02:39.490> choice<00:02:39.850> there<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.420> for<00:02:41.200> that

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
made the right choice there and for that

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.370 
made the right choice there and for that
I<00:02:41.410> got<00:02:41.950> my<00:02:42.180> because<00:02:43.180> of<00:02:43.360> that<00:02:43.630> for<00:02:44.020> that<00:02:44.260> i

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
I got my because of that for that i

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.870 
I got my because of that for that i
don't<00:02:44.560> know<00:02:44.620> why<00:02:44.770> i<00:02:44.800> say<00:02:45.010> that<00:02:45.040> because<00:02:45.370> of

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
don't know why i say that because of

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.490 
don't know why i say that because of
that<00:02:46.030> I<00:02:46.060> got<00:02:46.330> my<00:02:46.510> score<00:02:46.750> streaks<00:02:47.050> and<00:02:47.230> and

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
voila sometimes it helps just doing the

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.340 
voila sometimes it helps just doing the
smart<00:02:50.890> thing<00:02:51.340> and<00:02:51.520> I<00:02:51.940> did<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.050> smart<00:02:53.140> thing

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
smart thing and I did the smart thing

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:00.030 
smart thing and I did the smart thing
there<00:02:53.740> and<00:02:54.010> it<00:02:54.580> paid<00:02:54.790> off<00:02:54.820> so<00:02:55.420> yeah<00:02:55.810> and<00:02:59.040> so

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
there and it paid off so yeah and so

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.480 
there and it paid off so yeah and so

like that but I'm gonna try to make

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.250 
like that but I'm gonna try to make

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
though anyway the pants my tryout pantsy

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.350 
though anyway the pants my tryout pantsy
gets<00:03:56.920> harder<00:03:57.310> and<00:03:57.370> harder<00:03:57.459> the<00:03:57.910> more<00:03:58.090> I<00:03:58.150> play

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
gets harder and harder the more I play

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.520 
gets harder and harder the more I play
league<00:03:58.540> play<00:03:58.750> and<00:03:59.160> I<00:04:00.160> found<00:04:00.670> some<00:04:01.200> some<00:04:02.200> some

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
league play and I found some some some

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.650 
league play and I found some some some
people<00:04:02.830> aren't<00:04:02.920> that<00:04:03.100> good<00:04:03.390> which<00:04:04.390> I<00:04:04.630> actually

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
people aren't that good which I actually

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.930 
people aren't that good which I actually
appreciate<00:04:07.660> because<00:04:08.320> then<00:04:09.160> it's<00:04:09.370> time<00:04:09.580> for<00:04:09.850> me

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
appreciate because then it's time for me

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.120 
appreciate because then it's time for me
to<00:04:10.090> have<00:04:10.209> a<00:04:10.239> good<00:04:10.480> game<00:04:10.690> perhaps<00:04:11.620> I<00:04:11.770> won't<00:04:11.950> get

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
to have a good game perhaps I won't get

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.610 
to have a good game perhaps I won't get
negative<00:04:12.580> kill<00:04:13.030> death<00:04:13.239> ratio<00:04:13.360> perhaps<00:04:14.350> I<00:04:14.440> can

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
negative kill death ratio perhaps I can

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.890 
negative kill death ratio perhaps I can
top<00:04:14.890> the<00:04:15.070> scoreboards<00:04:15.700> so<00:04:16.180> those<00:04:16.390> games<00:04:16.690> are

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
top the scoreboards so those games are

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.289 
top the scoreboards so those games are
good<00:04:17.109> in<00:04:17.530> that<00:04:17.710> way<00:04:17.979> and

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.180 

but<00:04:21.299> that's<00:04:21.989> that<00:04:22.470> they<00:04:22.740> only<00:04:23.300> they<00:04:24.300> only

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
but that's that they only they only

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:31.610 
but that's that they only they only
