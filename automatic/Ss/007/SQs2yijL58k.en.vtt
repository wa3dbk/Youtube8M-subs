00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
put both you put the end through the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.310 
put both you put the end through the
loop<00:01:05.400> like<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:06.540> i<00:01:06.600> started<00:01:06.810> doing<00:01:07.049> it

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.469 
like that but instead i put one end
through<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.790> loop<00:01:12.439> and<00:01:13.790> then<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:15.060> brought<00:01:15.299> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
through the loop and then I brought the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.370 
through the loop and then I brought the
other<00:01:15.720> end<00:01:16.020> around<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:17.100> other<00:01:17.280> side<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:18.380> just

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
not sort of like weird because i find

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.340 
not sort of like weird because i find
the<00:01:40.920> regular<00:01:41.549> way<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.759> wear<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.150> we<00:01:42.780> put<00:01:43.020> both

the regular way to wear it we put both
and<00:01:43.680> sit<00:01:43.979> through<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.369> loop<00:01:44.520> it's<00:01:44.790> kind<00:01:45.060> of

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
and sit through the loop it's kind of

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.510 
and sit through the loop it's kind of
weird<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.540> me<00:01:45.750> because<00:01:45.869> it's<00:01:46.770> like<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.100> big<00:01:47.369> in

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
weird to me because it's like so big in

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.539 
weird to me because it's like so big in
the<00:01:47.610> top<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.030> then<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.360> just<00:01:48.509> hangs<00:01:48.840> down<00:01:49.549> and

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
the top and then it just hangs down and

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.249 
the top and then it just hangs down and
that<00:01:50.640> like<00:01:50.850> hangs<00:01:51.149> weirdly<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.930> especially

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
that like hangs weirdly and especially

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.810 
that like hangs weirdly and especially
if<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.619> wear<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.799> was<00:01:52.890> just<00:01:53.070> t-shirt<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.700> looks

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
if you wear it was just t-shirt it looks

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.730 
if you wear it was just t-shirt it looks
kind<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.090> weird<00:01:54.149> but<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.659> lies<00:01:55.229> kind<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.649> our
