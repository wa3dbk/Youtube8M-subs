shelf itself has some some cooling holes
in<00:01:05.320> there<00:01:05.470> so<00:01:05.680> if<00:01:05.799> you<00:01:05.890> have<00:01:06.040> a<00:01:06.070> hard<00:01:06.310> drive<00:01:06.460> up

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
in there so if you have a hard drive up

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.249 
in there so if you have a hard drive up
there<00:01:06.850> that'll<00:01:07.240> help<00:01:07.299> get<00:01:07.450> some<00:01:07.600> air<00:01:07.810> to<00:01:08.140> the

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
there that'll help get some air to the

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:09.359 
there that'll help get some air to the
hard<00:01:08.439> drive<00:01:08.560> it's<00:01:08.770> not<00:01:08.860> sealing<00:01:09.130> up<00:01:09.280> the

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
hard drive it's not sealing up the

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:10.830 
hard drive it's not sealing up the
bottom<00:01:09.579> of<00:01:09.610> the<00:01:09.700> hard<00:01:09.880> drive<00:01:10.090> but<00:01:10.570> there<00:01:10.750> isn't

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
bottom of the hard drive but there isn't

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.709 
bottom of the hard drive but there isn't
any<00:01:11.079> kind<00:01:11.259> of<00:01:11.380> a<00:01:11.469> non-skid<00:01:12.070> surface<00:01:12.390> no<00:01:13.390> lip<00:01:13.600> on

00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:13.719 
any kind of a non-skid surface no lip on

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:14.880 
any kind of a non-skid surface no lip on
the<00:01:13.780> front<00:01:13.810> of<00:01:14.020> this<00:01:14.140> one<00:01:14.200> or<00:01:14.469> some<00:01:14.680> have

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
the front of this one or some have

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.580 
the front of this one or some have
non-skid<00:01:15.670> and<00:01:15.880> some<00:01:16.030> have<00:01:16.210> a<00:01:16.240> lip

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
non-skid and some have a lip

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.569 
non-skid and some have a lip
realistically<00:01:17.590> you're<00:01:17.979> not<00:01:18.189> gonna<00:01:18.310> have<00:01:18.549> a

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:18.579 
realistically you're not gonna have a

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:20.279 
realistically you're not gonna have a
hard<00:01:18.820> drive<00:01:18.969> that's<00:01:19.240> gonna<00:01:19.390> walk<00:01:19.689> away<00:01:20.020> on<00:01:20.049> you

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:20.289 
hard drive that's gonna walk away on you

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:21.510 
hard drive that's gonna walk away on you
them<00:01:20.469> most<00:01:20.799> of<00:01:20.859> the<00:01:20.950> time<00:01:20.979> they'll<00:01:21.250> slide

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
them most of the time they'll slide

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.099 
them most of the time they'll slide
around<00:01:21.640> so<00:01:21.850> this<00:01:22.090> is<00:01:22.240> I<00:01:22.420> think<00:01:22.719> this<00:01:22.960> would

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:23.109 
around so this is I think this would

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:25.260 
around so this is I think this would
definitely<00:01:23.259> work<00:01:23.530> it's<00:01:23.950> just<00:01:24.159> a<00:01:24.460> little<00:01:25.119> bit

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
definitely work it's just a little bit

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.670 
definitely work it's just a little bit
different<00:01:25.539> than<00:01:25.630> some<00:01:25.659> of<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:25.899> others<00:01:26.140> the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
different than some of the others the

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.590 
different than some of the others the
top<00:01:26.950> though<00:01:27.250> has<00:01:27.789> not<00:01:27.820> only<00:01:28.299> kind<00:01:28.420> of<00:01:28.539> a

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
top though has not only kind of a

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.649 
top though has not only kind of a
rubberized<00:01:28.899> non-slip<00:01:29.740> surface<00:01:30.729> on<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:31.390> sides

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
rubberized non-slip surface on the sides

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.929 
rubberized non-slip surface on the sides
it<00:01:32.020> has<00:01:32.259> a<00:01:32.500> lip<00:01:32.770> and<00:01:32.890> a<00:01:32.950> front<00:01:33.189> and<00:01:33.399> that<00:01:33.579> list

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
it has a lip and a front and that list

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.139 
it has a lip and a front and that list
also<00:01:34.210> has<00:01:34.750> the<00:01:35.710> same<00:01:36.399> kind<00:01:36.759> of<00:01:36.789> a<00:01:36.880> non-slip

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
also has the same kind of a non-slip

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.300 
also has the same kind of a non-slip
surface<00:01:37.630> so<00:01:38.049> my<00:01:38.229> laptop<00:01:38.409> is<00:01:38.770> sitting<00:01:39.009> on<00:01:39.100> here

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
surface so my laptop is sitting on here

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.969 
surface so my laptop is sitting on here
it's<00:01:39.670> literally<00:01:40.109> completely<00:01:41.109> isolated<00:01:41.649> from

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
it's literally completely isolated from

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.859 
it's literally completely isolated from
this<00:01:42.130> metal<00:01:42.490> stand<00:01:42.789> it<00:01:43.030> basically<00:01:43.420> is<00:01:43.570> not

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
this metal stand it basically is not

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.919 
this metal stand it basically is not

shelf up down three positions so the

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.980 
shelf up down three positions so the
flexibility<00:04:48.190> adjustability<00:04:48.940> is<00:04:49.270> limited

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
flexibility adjustability is limited

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.930 
flexibility adjustability is limited
with<00:04:50.139> this<00:04:50.350> but<00:04:50.830> again<00:04:51.100> it's<00:04:51.460> designed<00:04:51.580> I

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
with this but again it's designed I

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.120 
with this but again it's designed I
think<00:04:51.970> as<00:04:52.300> it<00:04:52.449> is<00:04:52.570> to<00:04:53.500> be<00:04:53.590> a<00:04:53.620> really<00:04:53.860> good<00:04:53.979> tool

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
think as it is to be a really good tool

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.700 
think as it is to be a really good tool
for<00:04:54.250> DJ's<00:04:54.960> stability<00:04:55.960> I<00:04:56.110> want<00:04:56.410> to<00:04:56.470> show<00:04:56.560> you<00:04:56.650> a

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
for DJ's stability I want to show you a

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:57.870 
for DJ's stability I want to show you a
couple<00:04:56.979> of<00:04:57.010> things<00:04:57.190> here<00:04:57.430> we're<00:04:57.699> just<00:04:57.729> gonna

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
couple of things here we're just gonna

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.540 
couple of things here we're just gonna
take<00:04:58.150> this<00:04:58.300> down<00:04:58.539> first

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
take this down first

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.260 
take this down first
of<00:05:00.550> course<00:05:00.850> it's<00:05:01.620> under<00:05:02.620> my<00:05:03.160> DMS<00:05:03.460> 4.1<00:05:04.030> so

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
of course it's under my DMS 4.1 so

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.909 
of course it's under my DMS 4.1 so
that's<00:05:04.600> locking<00:05:05.050> it<00:05:05.139> down<00:05:05.169> but<00:05:05.740> here's

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
that's locking it down but here's

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:07.110 
that's locking it down but here's
another<00:05:06.160> cool<00:05:06.550> feature<00:05:06.760> with<00:05:07.030> this

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
another cool feature with this

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.029 
another cool feature with this
particular<00:05:07.570> guy<00:05:07.889> if<00:05:08.889> you<00:05:09.039> take<00:05:09.310> a<00:05:09.340> look<00:05:09.669> right

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
particular guy if you take a look right

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.310 
particular guy if you take a look right
here<00:05:12.039> on<00:05:12.729> the<00:05:13.120> bottom<00:05:13.419> when<00:05:13.750> I<00:05:13.780> open<00:05:14.139> this<00:05:14.260> up

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
here on the bottom when I open this up

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.710 
here on the bottom when I open this up
there's<00:05:15.130> two<00:05:15.370> little<00:05:15.460> thumb<00:05:15.760> screws<00:05:16.060> and<00:05:16.300> I

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
there's two little thumb screws and I

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.439 
there's two little thumb screws and I
can<00:05:16.900> turn<00:05:17.320> these<00:05:17.470> in<00:05:17.889> to<00:05:18.789> the<00:05:19.690> foot<00:05:21.300> they<00:05:22.300> will

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:22.449 
can turn these in to the foot they will

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:24.930 
can turn these in to the foot they will
actually<00:05:22.570> go<00:05:22.840> inside<00:05:23.380> this<00:05:23.590> little<00:05:23.800> leg<00:05:24.100> and

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
actually go inside this little leg and

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.850 
actually go inside this little leg and
when<00:05:25.060> they<00:05:25.120> do<00:05:25.180> that<00:05:25.389> it<00:05:26.110> locks<00:05:26.380> them<00:05:26.590> in<00:05:26.710> there

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
when they do that it locks them in there

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.700 
when they do that it locks them in there
so<00:05:27.550> if<00:05:27.669> I'm<00:05:27.820> sitting<00:05:28.180> here<00:05:28.330> and<00:05:28.599> I<00:05:29.169> have<00:05:29.410> both

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
so if I'm sitting here and I have both

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.140 
so if I'm sitting here and I have both
of<00:05:29.740> those<00:05:29.950> in<00:05:30.010> and<00:05:30.460> it's<00:05:30.669> under<00:05:30.849> my<00:05:30.970> control

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
of those in and it's under my control

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.260 
of those in and it's under my control
the<00:05:31.479> controller<00:05:31.780> this<00:05:32.440> can't<00:05:33.090> if<00:05:34.090> someone

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
the controller this can't if someone

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.450 
the controller this can't if someone
comes<00:05:34.690> up<00:05:34.780> and<00:05:34.930> grabs<00:05:35.169> it<00:05:35.380> and<00:05:35.560> pulls<00:05:35.770> it<00:05:36.190> won't

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
comes up and grabs it and pulls it won't

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.460 
comes up and grabs it and pulls it won't
tip<00:05:36.669> out<00:05:36.880> without<00:05:37.240> taking<00:05:37.570> everything<00:05:38.080> with

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
tip out without taking everything with

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.650 
tip out without taking everything with
neat<00:05:39.250> feature<00:05:39.580> that<00:05:39.849> it<00:05:39.940> can<00:05:40.090> actually<00:05:40.389> lock

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
neat feature that it can actually lock

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.200 
neat feature that it can actually lock
itself<00:05:41.139> into<00:05:41.740> then<00:05:42.280> I<00:05:42.400> degree<00:05:42.729> angle<00:05:42.970> at<00:05:43.060> the

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
itself into then I degree angle at the

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.070 
itself into then I degree angle at the
base<00:05:43.530> it's<00:05:44.530> a<00:05:44.620> heavy<00:05:44.830> stand<00:05:45.750> you'll<00:05:46.750> notice

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
base it's a heavy stand you'll notice

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.200 
base it's a heavy stand you'll notice
that<00:05:47.260> it's<00:05:47.710> a<00:05:47.830> little<00:05:48.039> thicker<00:05:48.280> the<00:05:48.700> foot<00:05:48.970> here

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
that it's a little thicker the foot here

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.969 
that it's a little thicker the foot here
that<00:05:49.360> goes<00:05:49.510> under<00:05:49.810> is<00:05:49.930> thicker<00:05:50.200> and<00:05:50.620> mesons

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:50.979 
that goes under is thicker and mesons

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:52.680 
that goes under is thicker and mesons
that's<00:05:51.160> why<00:05:51.310> that<00:05:51.430> VMs<00:05:51.760> 4<00:05:52.030> was<00:05:52.210> riding<00:05:52.510> up<00:05:52.570> a

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
that's why that VMs 4 was riding up a

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.450 
that's why that VMs 4 was riding up a
little<00:05:52.840> bit<00:05:52.960> it<00:05:53.139> was<00:05:53.680> actually<00:05:54.039> riding<00:05:54.250> on

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
little bit it was actually riding on

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.270 
little bit it was actually riding on
this<00:05:54.669> instead<00:05:55.060> of<00:05:55.150> the<00:05:55.210> feet<00:05:55.389> of<00:05:55.510> the<00:05:55.570> VMS<00:05:55.870> for
