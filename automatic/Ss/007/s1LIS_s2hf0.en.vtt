sli and just let i'd show you it's a

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.750 
sli and just let i'd show you it's a
quick<00:00:21.570> note<00:00:21.859> that<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:22.980> see<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.250> crossfire

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
quick note that you see the crossfire

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.390 
quick note that you see the crossfire
bridge<00:00:24.410> that<00:00:25.410> you<00:00:25.650> have<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.980> attached<00:00:26.160> to

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
bridge that you have the attached to

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.790 
bridge that you have the attached to
cards<00:00:26.699> with<00:00:27.170> cable<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.230> actually<00:00:28.680> slightly

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
cards with cable is actually slightly

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.220 
cards with cable is actually slightly
larger<00:00:31.800> than<00:00:31.830> an<00:00:32.070> SLI<00:00:32.489> cable<00:00:34.880> and<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:36.600> SLI

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
larger than an SLI cable and this SLI

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.869 
larger than an SLI cable and this SLI
cable<00:00:37.770> came<00:00:38.100> with<00:00:38.309> my<00:00:38.430> mother<00:00:38.640> whored

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
cable came with my mother whored

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.229 
cable came with my mother whored
actually<00:00:40.430> very<00:00:41.430> tiny<00:00:41.700> bit<00:00:41.879> smaller<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:44.239> these

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
actually very tiny bit smaller so these

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.209 
actually very tiny bit smaller so these
cables<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:46.079> don't<00:00:46.289> believe<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:47.010> be

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
cables I don't believe to be

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.110 
cables I don't believe to be
interchangeable<00:00:49.430> alright<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:50.700> I'll<00:00:50.969> be

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
interchangeable alright so I'll be

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.790 
interchangeable alright so I'll be
coming<00:00:51.360> back<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.840> when<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.020> have<00:00:52.289> my<00:00:52.620> new

cards installed right here you have it

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.010 
cards installed right here you have it
the<00:00:55.410> two<00:00:55.739> gigabyte<00:00:56.129> gtx<00:00:56.399> 670<00:00:57.210> s<00:00:57.329> are<00:00:57.570> installed

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
the two gigabyte gtx 670 s are installed

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.709 
the two gigabyte gtx 670 s are installed
and<00:00:58.579> i<00:00:59.579> also<00:00:59.730> did<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.030> little<00:01:00.149> bit<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.300> extra

and i also did a little bit of extra

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.779 
and i also did a little bit of extra
tithing<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.649> cables<00:01:02.100> around<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.579> area

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
tithing of the cables around this area

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.960 
tithing of the cables around this area
in<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.690> case<00:01:04.309> super<00:01:05.309> there<00:01:05.460> for<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.700> little<00:01:05.850> bit

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
in the case super there for a little bit

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.380 
in the case super there for a little bit
more<00:01:06.320> and<00:01:07.320> yeah<00:01:08.189> these<00:01:08.340> cards<00:01:08.790> were<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.030> little

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
more and yeah these cards were a little

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.750 
more and yeah these cards were a little
bit<00:01:09.600> longer<00:01:09.750> but<00:01:10.500> but<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.130> little<00:01:11.430> bit<00:01:11.520> over<00:01:11.610> an

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
bit longer but but a little bit over an

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.359 
bit longer but but a little bit over an
inch<00:01:11.880> longer<00:01:12.119> than<00:01:12.439> my<00:01:14.420> radio<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.540> 650s<00:01:16.470> so

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
inch longer than my radio in 650s so

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.010 
inch longer than my radio in 650s so
it's<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.850> little<00:01:17.880> bit<00:01:18.060> more<00:01:18.240> finagling<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.780> get

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
it's a little bit more finagling to get

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.560 
it's a little bit more finagling to get
spot<00:01:19.470> imparting<00:01:20.060> and<00:01:21.060> because<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.299> that<00:01:21.420> a

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
spot imparting and because of that a

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.350 
spot imparting and because of that a
extra<00:01:22.530> long<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> plastic<00:01:23.580> shroud<00:01:23.820> on<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.119> front

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
extra long a plastic shroud on the front

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.530 
extra long a plastic shroud on the front
of<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.570> card<00:01:25.100> and<00:01:26.100> also<00:01:26.430> why<00:01:26.580> i<00:01:26.610> had<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.880> adjust

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
of the card and also why i had to adjust

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.440 
of the card and also why i had to adjust
one<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.960> pins<00:01:28.259> on<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:29.729> Appian<00:01:30.030> connector

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
one of the pins on the Appian connector

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.630 
one of the pins on the Appian connector
because<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.750> couldn't<00:01:30.960> get<00:01:31.110> laid<00:01:31.229> after<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.770> so

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
because I couldn't get laid after and so

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.429 
because I couldn't get laid after and so
I<00:01:32.670> had<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.939> use<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.090> mini<00:01:33.329> screwdriver<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:34.200> align

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
I had to use a mini screwdriver to align

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.510 
I had to use a mini screwdriver to align
the<00:01:34.560> pin<00:01:35.540> so<00:01:36.950> for<00:01:37.950> those<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.280> haven't

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
the pin so for those of you haven't

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.580 
the pin so for those of you haven't
