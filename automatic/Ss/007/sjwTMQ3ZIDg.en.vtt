tutorial - wine dad's do is odd series

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.509 
tutorial - wine dad's do is odd series
but<00:00:08.160> this<00:00:08.280> is<00:00:08.490> serious<00:00:08.880> I'll<00:00:09.090> be<00:00:09.240> explaining

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:10.519 
but this is serious I'll be explaining

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.430 
but this is serious I'll be explaining
blender<00:00:11.519> modifiers<00:00:12.120> specifically<00:00:12.780> they

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
blender modifiers specifically they

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.519 
blender modifiers specifically they
blend<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.860> deform<00:00:14.280> modifier<00:00:15.080> if<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.350> don't

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
blend a deform modifier if you don't

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:17.510 
blend a deform modifier if you don't
have<00:00:16.650> some<00:00:16.859> what<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:17.010> mean

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
have some what I mean

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.870 
have some what I mean
before<00:00:17.850> modifier<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.480> us<00:00:18.690> basically

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
before modifier is us basically

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.150 
before modifier is us basically
modifiers<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:21.449> blender<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:21.990> effects<00:00:22.590> the

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
modifiers in blender that effects the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.080 
modifiers in blender that effects the
shape<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.670> objects<00:00:24.600> dynamically<00:00:25.519> so<00:00:26.519> let's

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
shape of objects dynamically so let's

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.730 
shape of objects dynamically so let's
start<00:00:27.390> off<00:00:27.599> with<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.900> first<00:00:28.080> one<00:00:28.230> for<00:00:28.529> today

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
start off with the first one for today

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.240 
start off with the first one for today
which<00:00:28.949> would<00:00:29.130> be<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.369> cast<00:00:29.609> modifier<00:00:31.250> Skippy

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
which would be the cast modifier Skippy

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.100 
which would be the cast modifier Skippy
nobody<00:00:32.520> I'm<00:00:32.790> not<00:00:32.969> sure<00:00:33.090> because<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.450> want<00:00:33.989> this

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
nobody I'm not sure because I want this

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.950 
nobody I'm not sure because I want this
to<00:00:34.350> be<00:00:34.380> like<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.860> final<00:00:35.250> ones<00:00:35.430> we'll<00:00:36.329> explain

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
to be like the final ones we'll explain

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.959 
to be like the final ones we'll explain
everything

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
everything

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.720 
everything
so<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.329> Cosmo<00:00:39.690> defier<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.620> haven't<00:00:41.550> started

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
so the Cosmo defier is I haven't started

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.819 
so the Cosmo defier is I haven't started
with<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.180> because<00:00:42.329> it's<00:00:42.629> very<00:00:42.660> interesting<00:00:43.110> on

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
with it because it's very interesting on

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.850 
with it because it's very interesting on
phones<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.280> play<00:00:44.489> with<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.420> if<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:46.079> want<00:00:46.739> to

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
phones to play with so if you want to

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.279 
phones to play with so if you want to
get<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.399> select<00:00:48.059> make<00:00:48.539> sure<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.780> selecting

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
get it select make sure you selecting

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.270 
get it select make sure you selecting
the<00:00:49.350> object<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:51.020> go<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.379> deform<00:00:53.070> under

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
the object and go to the deform under

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.810 
the object and go to the deform under
the<00:00:53.699> deform<00:00:54.120> tab<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.629> select<00:00:55.110> cast<00:00:55.520> up<00:00:56.520> so

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
the deform tab and select cast up so

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.990 
the deform tab and select cast up so
once<00:00:57.360> in<00:00:57.600> before<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.550> set<00:00:59.550> up<00:00:59.699> for<00:00:59.910> this

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
once in before you set up for this

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.090 
once in before you set up for this
fastest<00:01:00.480> qualifier<00:01:01.140> make<00:01:01.739> sure<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.010> are

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
fastest qualifier make sure you are

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.030 
fastest qualifier make sure you are
playing<00:01:02.370> delimited<00:01:03.300> mesh<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:04.350> harp<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.830> of

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
playing delimited mesh the harp and of

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.060 
playing delimited mesh the harp and of
vertices<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.939> play<00:01:06.180> with<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.710> if<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.860> have

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
vertices to play with and if you have

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.780 
vertices to play with and if you have
that<00:01:08.250> you're<00:01:08.909> good<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.240> go<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:10.340> what's<00:01:11.340> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
that you're good to go so what's the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.080 
that you're good to go so what's the
cuts<00:01:12.570> modifier<00:01:12.990> UI<00:01:13.310> interface<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.640> very<00:01:14.820> easy

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
cuts modifier UI interface is very easy

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.830 
cuts modifier UI interface is very easy
you<00:01:15.920> have<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.189> apply<00:01:17.610> that's<00:01:18.180> after<00:01:18.479> you

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
you have the apply that's after you

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.050 
you have the apply that's after you
finish<00:01:19.140> creating<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:20.009> basic<00:01:20.220> deformation

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
finish creating the basic deformation

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.510 
finish creating the basic deformation
you<00:01:21.090> can<00:01:21.450> apply<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.470> could<00:01:22.680> also<00:01:22.979> apply<00:01:23.430> a

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
you can apply it you could also apply a

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.200 
you can apply it you could also apply a
shape<00:01:24.270> key<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.860> copy<00:01:25.860> its<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.640> another<00:01:26.850> mod<00:01:27.090> or

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
shape key and copy its to another mod or

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.420 
shape key and copy its to another mod or
something<00:01:27.600> like<00:01:27.689> that

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
something like that

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.240 
something like that
um<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:29.850> let's<00:01:30.270> start<00:01:30.659> off<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.200> let's<00:01:32.040> see<00:01:32.159> how

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
um so let's start off and let's see how

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.719 
um so let's start off and let's see how
it<00:01:32.369> works

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
it works

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.469 
it works
so<00:01:33.600> I'm<00:01:33.720> putting<00:01:33.930> back<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:35.119> cursor<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.390> the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
so I'm putting back the cursor in the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:44.030 
so I'm putting back the cursor in the
center<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:38.360> let's<00:01:39.360> add<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:40.490> microsphere<00:01:43.040> let's

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
center and let's add a microsphere let's

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.520 
center and let's add a microsphere let's
make<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.430> transparent<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.479> how<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.140> do<00:01:46.350> that

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
make it transparent and how to do that

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.190 
make it transparent and how to do that
good<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:46.979> object<00:01:47.430> panel<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.049> under<00:01:49.049> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
good this object panel and under the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.760 
good this object panel and under the
display<00:01:49.880> should<00:01:50.880> transfer<00:01:51.570> x-ray<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.439> makes

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
display should transfer x-ray it makes

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.800 
display should transfer x-ray it makes
it<00:01:52.950> specially<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.610> can<00:01:53.820> see<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.450> any

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
it specially so you can see it any

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.010 
it specially so you can see it any
position<00:01:55.729> so<00:01:56.729> if<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.939> select<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.390> icon<00:01:57.540> spare

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
position so if I select the icon spare

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.609 
position so if I select the icon spare
and<00:01:58.280> go<00:01:59.280> back<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.670> modifier<00:02:00.119> tab<00:02:00.500> for<00:02:01.500> this

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
and go back to the modifier tab for this

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.950 
and go back to the modifier tab for this
control<00:02:02.070> objects<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:03.149> we<00:02:03.360> all<00:02:03.450> be<00:02:03.570> selects

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
control objects that we all be selects

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.870 
control objects that we all be selects
in<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.170> ecosphere

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
in the ecosphere

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.050 
in the ecosphere
and<00:02:06.200> so<00:02:07.200> now<00:02:08.179> if<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.360> move<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.690> eye

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
and so now if I move the eye

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.960 
and so now if I move the eye
where<00:02:10.330> it<00:02:10.959> starts<00:02:13.050> deforming<00:02:14.220> perfectly<00:02:15.250> so

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
where it starts deforming perfectly so

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.550 
where it starts deforming perfectly so
we<00:02:16.630> also<00:02:16.989> given<00:02:17.349> the<00:02:17.500> power<00:02:18.780> power<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:20.050> control

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
we also given the power power to control

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.839 
we also given the power power to control
the<00:02:21.340> way<00:02:21.670> it<00:02:21.880> effects<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:23.830> object<00:02:24.280> so<00:02:24.700> we<00:02:24.819> can

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
the way it effects the object so we can

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.790 
the way it effects the object so we can
change<00:02:25.239> these<00:02:25.360> two<00:02:25.540> points<00:02:25.870> to<00:02:26.020> reduce<00:02:26.560> the

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
change these two points to reduce the

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.630 
change these two points to reduce the
flux<00:02:27.040> or<00:02:27.250> it<00:02:27.340> effects<00:02:28.000> and<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.980> can<00:02:30.010> increase

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
flux or it effects and you can increase

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.020 
flux or it effects and you can increase
it<00:02:30.819> to<00:02:31.599> one<00:02:31.989> which<00:02:32.319> it's<00:02:32.739> I<00:02:33.250> don't<00:02:33.459> think<00:02:33.730> and

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
it to one which it's I don't think and

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.009 
it to one which it's I don't think and
what<00:02:34.209> we<00:02:34.360> use<00:02:34.480> it<00:02:36.000> yeah<00:02:37.060> which<00:02:37.360> may<00:02:37.780> be<00:02:37.810> helpful

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
what we use it yeah which may be helpful

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:38.940 
what we use it yeah which may be helpful
I<00:02:38.440> don't<00:02:38.680> know

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
I don't know

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.850 
I don't know
so<00:02:39.580> let's<00:02:39.790> just<00:02:39.940> leave<00:02:40.120> it<00:02:40.180> at<00:02:40.540> 0.3<00:02:41.170> I<00:02:41.380> think<00:02:41.709> is

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
so let's just leave it at 0.3 I think is

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.900 
so let's just leave it at 0.3 I think is
good<00:02:42.430> Oh<00:02:42.760> point<00:02:43.060> three<00:02:43.390> six<00:02:44.459> you<00:02:45.459> could<00:02:45.670> also

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
good Oh point three six you could also

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.620 
good Oh point three six you could also
affect<00:02:46.239> the<00:02:46.810> radius<00:02:47.730> this<00:02:48.730> size<00:02:49.299> and<00:02:49.630> also

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
affect the radius this size and also

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.690 
affect the radius this size and also
influence<00:02:52.630> the<00:02:52.890> axis<00:02:53.890> is<00:02:54.069> going<00:02:54.220> to<00:02:54.310> affect

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
influence the axis is going to affect

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.870 
influence the axis is going to affect
you<00:02:55.299> could<00:02:55.510> make<00:02:55.810> it<00:02:55.959> to<00:02:56.080> just<00:02:56.290> affect<00:02:56.739> the

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
you could make it to just affect the

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.990 
you could make it to just affect the
x-axis<00:02:57.880> or<00:02:58.090> make<00:02:58.989> it<00:02:59.140> affect<00:02:59.650> just<00:02:59.860> Y<00:03:00.190> so<00:03:00.760> let's

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
x-axis or make it affect just Y so let's

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.630 
x-axis or make it affect just Y so let's
leave<00:03:01.180> it<00:03:01.299> as<00:03:01.480> default<00:03:01.630> and<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:03.010> let's<00:03:03.250> affect

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
leave it as default and the let's affect

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.620 
leave it as default and the let's affect
X<00:03:03.880> Y<00:03:04.150> Z<00:03:04.450> Z<00:03:05.160> another<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.610> most<00:03:06.849> important<00:03:07.299> parts

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
X Y Z Z another the most important parts

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.470 
X Y Z Z another the most important parts
if<00:03:08.349> you<00:03:08.410> know<00:03:08.650> you<00:03:08.890> can<00:03:09.130> also<00:03:09.400> set<00:03:09.849> birthdays

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
if you know you can also set birthdays

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.880 
if you know you can also set birthdays
group<00:03:11.310> for<00:03:12.310> it<00:03:12.459> which<00:03:12.910> is<00:03:13.239> definitely<00:03:14.140> you<00:03:14.829> are

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:50.379 
between the parts that are no moving and

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:53.909 
between the parts that are no moving and
those<00:04:50.680> that<00:04:50.860> are<00:04:51.009> moving<00:04:51.190> so<00:04:51.970> the<00:04:52.960> part<00:04:53.349> -<00:04:53.590> red

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
those that are moving so the part - red

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:58.980 
those that are moving so the part - red
is<00:04:53.970> 100%<00:04:55.050> what's<00:04:56.050> the<00:04:56.379> blue<00:04:57.009> part<00:04:57.280> is<00:04:57.550> not<00:04:58.150> has

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
is 100% what's the blue part is not has

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.219 
is 100% what's the blue part is not has
no<00:04:59.229> effect<00:04:59.550> this<00:05:00.550> kind<00:05:00.819> of<00:05:00.909> blue-green<00:05:01.810> I

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
no effect this kind of blue-green I

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:07.760 
no effect this kind of blue-green I
don't<00:05:02.560> know<00:05:02.669> it's<00:05:03.990> kind<00:05:04.990> of<00:05:05.940> normal

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
don't know it's kind of normal

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.659 
don't know it's kind of normal
okay<00:05:09.300> think<00:05:10.300> what<00:05:10.479> good<00:05:10.719> now<00:05:11.219> what<00:05:12.219> we<00:05:12.430> want<00:05:12.580> to

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
okay think what good now what we want to

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.469 
okay think what good now what we want to
do<00:05:12.849> next<00:05:13.030> is<00:05:14.099> selects<00:05:15.099> the<00:05:15.310> sphere<00:05:16.000> and<00:05:16.210> go

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
do next is selects the sphere and go

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:18.890 
do next is selects the sphere and go
back<00:05:16.659> to<00:05:16.810> the<00:05:16.900> modifier<00:05:17.259> and<00:05:17.530> apply<00:05:18.280> the<00:05:18.669> group

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
back to the modifier and apply the group

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.830 
back to the modifier and apply the group
so<00:05:19.900> once<00:05:20.289> you've<00:05:20.500> done<00:05:20.740> that<00:05:21.210> you<00:05:22.210> can<00:05:22.240> now<00:05:22.449> go

and control that specific specific

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:31.140 
and control that specific specific
motion<00:05:28.599> which<00:05:29.229> works<00:05:29.590> perfectly<00:05:29.860> you<00:05:30.699> can

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
motion which works perfectly you can

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.999 
motion which works perfectly you can
reduce<00:05:31.779> the<00:05:31.960> amount<00:05:31.990> or<00:05:32.440> you<00:05:32.500> can<00:05:32.710> increase

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 
reduce the amount or you can increase

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.360 
reduce the amount or you can increase
your<00:05:33.130> mouse<00:05:33.779> points<00:05:34.779> 1<00:05:35.009> depending<00:05:36.009> on<00:05:36.159> what

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
your mouse points 1 depending on what
