00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello again sitech friends and today you 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.259
 I want to present good as it is 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.010
 custom the latest reviews we have 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.769
 made a new bass terminal 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.430
 cost a Chinese terminal again what 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.160
 we have purchased on the website 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.170
 jiang bites and it is a terminal that has 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.869
 cost scarcely 55 euros without 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.939
 I agree with the truth that it is a terminal that 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.820
 for what it costs although I read by 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.390
 in many forums that good the new the 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.910
 new junk phone option 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.890
 Chinese phone anyway, my opinion is 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.780
 which is a phone that for the price 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.030
 what size is quite good here 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.340
 we can see more what is achieved 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.620
 understand obviously but good is already 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.050
 this information tells us that it is a 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.690
 phone that has 3g a Chinese phone 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.040
 for 30 and for forgiveness for 55 euros that 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.860
 has connectivity h 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.660
 h is due to in 2100 megahertz of 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.450
 agreement that is important I repeat it 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:06.380
 always many publications from me 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:09.480
 of my page the 2100 megahertz are not 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:13.680
 the same as the 900 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.480
 it works very well but good 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.580
 you have followed it in enough in 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.400
 enough publications as recommended 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.350
 are phones that have both 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.070
 coverage bands but in the absence of 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.320
 of 900 megaherties well received is 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.690
 the one of 2,100 we continue with the unboxing 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.790
 of the telephone 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.160
 here we will choose a booklet of 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.960
 instructions which I honestly believe 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.550
 that will be of little help to us as 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.550
 you can see everything is absolutely everything 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:50.080
 about what is the booklet of 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.060
 guarantee something that in principle also 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.230
 it's going to be of little theory 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.230
 let's get to Chinese store 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.250
 Here we are determined 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:05.610
 perfectly wrapped in bags 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.610
 perfectly wrapped 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.860
 let's see 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.860
 take it out here 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.900
 wrong 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.260
 as you see is a terminal 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.959
 very very very much like we did 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:29.849
 the review did not too long ago 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:33.390
 from the psd to 9,300 let's go we'll finish 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.620
 in many forums because of its low cost 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.810
 of this terminal 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.730
 they talked a lot they found solutions 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.959
 for your router which makes me 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.900
 surprise that for this we have 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.810
 listing hardly attention because 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.700
 good 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.660
 physically the phone is very very 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.050
 similar but 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.520
 stations are superior the great 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.010
 problem that the terminal had to 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.690
 it was the rom memory this terminal comes 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.860
 perfectly solved since it has 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.690
 according to biological specifications 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.760
 in agreement 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.230
 well here, if we continue to take 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:14.510
 little things we see a battery 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.510
 we see your headphones 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.030
 open it for you to see 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.839
 [Music] 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.280
 we have 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:34.990
 your suction cup headphones 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:38.280
 a very important detail detail since 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:41.069
 sorry we were not seeing anything 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.440
 detail event headphones 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.819
 quite important that most 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.660
 phones and even congregates more 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.500
 high 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.590
 [Music] 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.140
 both the microphone and the 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.940
 the phone hanger and the 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:01.960
 pretty peg 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:05.740
 it has more history and good what 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:08.680
 we will keep going to entertain a lot 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:11.890
 here the cable cited as always and many 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.920
 sometimes it happens to us we have cable quoted no 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.690
 they agree not 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.220
 you will not have the possibility of using all 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.700
 the microusb cables 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.780
 that we have here the heart 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.530
 we will be a bit limited to using the 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.530
 his own 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:35.460
 but it's not a battery because it's 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:38.050
 pretty good 2050 megahertz sorry 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.169
 milliamps and 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.090
 and good 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:45.600
 I try it and 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.880
 and the consumption is quite pretty good 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.169
 I mean, the day the phone 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.729
 it happens without any kind of problem that 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:59.259
 you carry a bag with 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:59.259
 instead for the circulars and here 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.520
 power adapter according 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:13.740
 Chinese bullying adapter with your 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.740
 corresponding European adapter 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:25.280
 if we look at the phone the phone is 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.280
 a clear imitation of a galaxy nights 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.349
 your usb plug your plastic which already 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.500
 half I have detached it for that use 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:37.300
 for little here 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.300
 a power button plug jack 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:43.540
 i 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:45.960
 volume up volume down all the 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.720
 chrome finish 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.240
 in the back we have the speaker 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.509
 of a bottom part certainly in the 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:57.539
 we have it in that corner and a 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:06:00.169
 pretty pretty important detail is 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:02.350
 that this terminal comes 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:04.840
 with 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:07.150
 with a led flash for a camera 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.850
 photos is worth the photo camera is a 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:12.130
 camera of 5 megapixels and good 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:14.230
 the photos then in the line of a 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.240
 Chinese phone ok we can not no 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:19.060
 We can boast of photographs but 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.560
 but neither are they trash 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.150
 true 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.680
 I've been testing a little now 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.509
 the good camera if you feel 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:30.520
 I repeat all this that has been in the 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:30.520
 context of a 55 euro telephone 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:36.349
 a terminal that perfectly covers the 

00:06:33.289 --> 00:06:37.760
 expectations go in the price at which 

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:39.920
 we can count 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:43.460
 if someone is interested, he wants 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:45.740
 buy it you do not know how you do not know where 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.530
 can you contact me on the page 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:51.650
 web or is directly managed the 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:54.070
 buy or I'll tell you where you can 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.070
 get 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:07:00.750
 that's all friends as the famous said 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:04.140
 the famous cartoon character 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:07.740
 shortly I will make a video review in the 

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:09.510
 phone working and how like 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.160
 Spanishize the agreement because 

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:14.160
 just as it happened to us with the csd this 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.449
 phone comes good in Chinese and without 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.969
 bubble 

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:19.969
 greetings and until the next video
