we<00:01:41.310> just<00:01:41.640> saw<00:01:41.820> where<00:01:42.360> velocity<00:01:43.020> took<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:43.710> one

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
we just saw where velocity took this one

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.679 
we just saw where velocity took this one
from<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.189> very<00:01:44.460> beginning<00:01:44.880> they<00:01:45.030> use<00:01:45.299> to

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
from the very beginning they use to

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.050 
from the very beginning they use to
global<00:01:46.170> Ultimates<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.979> continually<00:01:47.579> catch

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
only do they burn him low but they also

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.830 
only do they burn him low but they also
get<00:02:02.070> his<00:02:02.310> ultimate<00:02:02.820> out<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.149> him<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.689> let's

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
get his ultimate out of him so let's

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.069 
get his ultimate out of him so let's

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
low but they do the smart thing they

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.520
