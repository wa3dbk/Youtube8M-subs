00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
problem and now as soon as I heard what

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.769 
problem and now as soon as I heard what
was<00:00:20.369> going<00:00:20.520> on<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:20.939> was<00:00:21.270> like<00:00:21.420> well<00:00:21.600> that's

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
was going on I was like well that's

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.679 
was going on I was like well that's
quite<00:00:22.199> obviously<00:00:22.560> see<00:00:22.769> turbo<00:00:23.010> seal<00:00:23.430> so

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
quite obviously see turbo seal so

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.089 
quite obviously see turbo seal so
bellowing<00:00:24.689> blew<00:00:25.019> smoke<00:00:25.230> out<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.800> exhaust

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
bellowing blew smoke out of the exhaust

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.050 
bellowing blew smoke out of the exhaust
and<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:27.480> complete<00:00:27.869> lack<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.109> power<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.650> mean

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
and a complete lack of power I mean

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.519 
and a complete lack of power I mean
basics<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.240> should<00:00:30.570> have<00:00:30.660> been<00:00:30.869> picked<00:00:31.410> up

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
basics that should have been picked up

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.209 
basics that should have been picked up
straight<00:00:32.009> away<00:00:32.840> so<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:34.410> this<00:00:34.559> video<00:00:34.739> what<00:00:35.100> I'm

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
straight away so in this video what I'm

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.340 
straight away so in this video what I'm
aiming<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.000> do<00:00:36.329> is<00:00:36.360> guys<00:00:36.690> I'm<00:00:36.930> bear<00:00:37.110> with<00:00:37.230> my

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
voice because I am losing my voice it's

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.209 
voice because I am losing my voice it's
getting<00:00:40.140> colder<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.590> guess<00:00:40.710> it's<00:00:40.860> taking<00:00:41.129> a

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
getting colder and I guess it's taking a

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.610 
getting colder and I guess it's taking a
toll<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:41.489> me<00:00:42.020> what<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.050> want<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.290> do<00:00:43.410> in<00:00:43.530> this

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
a turbo and what a bad turbo looks like

seen<00:01:12.869> various<00:01:13.320> levels<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.770> turbo<00:01:14.220> destruction

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
seen various levels of turbo destruction

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.730 
seen various levels of turbo destruction
I<00:01:15.330> had<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> Fiesta<00:01:16.470> RS<00:01:16.860> turbo<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> 91<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.740> similar

thing bellowing blue smoke but I was

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.990 
thing bellowing blue smoke but I was
just<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.470> really<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.950> seals<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.580> rest<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.909> it

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
just the really the seals the rest of it

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.740 
just the really the seals the rest of it
wasn't<00:01:24.270> too<00:01:24.360> bad<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.520> but<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.729> here<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.689> is

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
wasn't too bad and but this here this is

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.830 
wasn't too bad and but this here this is
the<00:01:27.990> one<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.290> came<00:01:28.470> out<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.860> her<00:01:29.009> car<00:01:29.360> so<00:01:30.360> when

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
the one that came out of her car so when

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.060 
the one that came out of her car so when
you<00:01:30.990> check<00:01:31.200> these<00:01:31.409> things<00:01:31.650> what<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.860> want<00:01:31.979> to

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
you check these things what you want to

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.679 
you check these things what you want to
do<00:01:32.189> is<00:01:32.340> now<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.880> compressor<00:01:33.479> right

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
do is now this is the compressor right

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.560 
do is now this is the compressor right
here<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.340> this<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.400> what<00:01:35.729> forces<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.420> air

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
here and this is what forces the air

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.330 
here and this is what forces the air
into<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.960> intercooler<00:01:37.350> compressed<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.159> goes

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
into the intercooler compressed and goes

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.420 
into the intercooler compressed and goes
into<00:01:38.520> your<00:01:38.670> engine<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.119> gives<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:40.220> bang<00:01:41.220> for

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
into your engine and gives you bang for

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.760 
into your engine and gives you bang for
your<00:01:41.520> buck<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.700> guess<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.810> back<00:01:43.020> part<00:01:43.320> there<00:01:43.560> is

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
your buck I guess the back part there is

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.830 
your buck I guess the back part there is
your<00:01:43.979> actual<00:01:44.310> turbine<00:01:44.790> housing<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.630> is

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
your actual turbine housing so this is

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.719 
your actual turbine housing so this is
your<00:01:46.140> up<00:01:46.590> pipe<00:01:47.009> connection

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
your up pipe connection

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.389 
your up pipe connection
so<00:01:48.210> that's<00:01:48.390> your<00:01:48.479> exhaust<00:01:48.810> gas<00:01:49.189> coming<00:01:50.189> in

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
so that's your exhaust gas coming in

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.340 
so that's your exhaust gas coming in
there<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.909> drives<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.570> turbine<00:01:52.049> which<00:01:52.229> I'm

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
there that drives the turbine which I'm

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.300 
there that drives the turbine which I'm
going<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.500> show<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.920> minute

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
going to show you in a minute

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.359 
going to show you in a minute
and<00:01:53.399> then<00:01:54.000> exits<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:55.409> downpipe<00:01:55.890> at<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.219> back

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
and then exits the downpipe at the back

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.940 
and then exits the downpipe at the back
there<00:01:56.610> which<00:01:56.759> connects<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.270> flange<00:01:57.950> so

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
there which connects to that flange so

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.030 
there which connects to that flange so
and<00:01:59.299> moving<00:02:00.299> on<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:00.780> I've<00:02:01.350> got<00:02:01.530> great<00:02:01.799> lighting

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
and moving on so I've got great lighting

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.350 
and moving on so I've got great lighting
in<00:02:02.189> here<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.579> what<00:02:02.729> I'm<00:02:02.790> going<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:02.969> show<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.119> is

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
in here so what I'm going to show you is

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.670 
in here so what I'm going to show you is
now<00:02:03.479> normally<00:02:03.930> what<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.170> want<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.350> check<00:02:04.500> on<00:02:04.649> a

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
now normally what you want to check on a

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.270 
now normally what you want to check on a
turbo<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.280> something<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.850> call<00:02:06.030> shaft<00:02:06.479> play

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
turbo is something to call shaft play

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.680 
turbo is something to call shaft play
and<00:02:08.280> it's<00:02:08.429> how<00:02:08.580> much<00:02:08.759> movement<00:02:09.119> you've<00:02:09.420> got<00:02:09.599> in

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
and it's how much movement you've got in

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.390 
and it's how much movement you've got in
your<00:02:09.810> shaft<00:02:10.050> now<00:02:10.229> some<00:02:10.500> turbos<00:02:10.950> do<00:02:11.160> have<00:02:11.370> a

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
your shaft now some turbos do have a

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.830 
your shaft now some turbos do have a
little

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
little

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.229 
little
of<00:02:11.930> forward<00:02:12.830> and<00:02:12.920> backward<00:02:13.010> movement<00:02:13.730> so<00:02:14.209> you

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
of forward and backward movement so you

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.360 
of forward and backward movement so you
can<00:02:14.480> sort<00:02:14.660> of<00:02:14.720> like<00:02:14.930> push<00:02:15.709> it<00:02:15.739> in<00:02:16.010> and<00:02:16.220> out<00:02:16.310> like

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
can sort of like push it in and out like

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.540 
can sort of like push it in and out like
that<00:02:16.640> a<00:02:16.819> little<00:02:17.120> bit<00:02:17.560> along<00:02:18.560> its<00:02:18.709> axes<00:02:19.129> in<00:02:19.400> and

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
that a little bit along its axes in and

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:20.740 
that a little bit along its axes in and
out<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:19.790> might<00:02:19.910> go<00:02:20.060> click<00:02:20.330> click<00:02:20.360> click<00:02:20.720> and

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
out you might go click click click and

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.630 
out you might go click click click and
you<00:02:20.930> can<00:02:20.959> sort<00:02:21.260> them<00:02:21.319> move<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.069> a<00:02:22.160> tiny<00:02:22.430> little

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
you can sort them move it a tiny little

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.020 
you can sort them move it a tiny little
bit<00:02:22.879> nuts<00:02:23.000> that's<00:02:23.629> not<00:02:23.810> too<00:02:23.989> too<00:02:24.230> bad<00:02:25.030> what

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
bit nuts that's not too too bad what

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.059 
bit nuts that's not too too bad what
you're<00:02:26.150> looking<00:02:26.390> for<00:02:26.690> is<00:02:26.930> any<00:02:27.170> kind<00:02:27.470> of<00:02:27.590> wobble

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
you're looking for is any kind of wobble

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.059 
you're looking for is any kind of wobble
in<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.489> shaft<00:02:28.760> which<00:02:29.690> suggests<00:02:30.110> bearings<00:02:30.739> or

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
in the shaft which suggests bearings or

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.789 
in the shaft which suggests bearings or
other<00:02:31.400> faults<00:02:31.819> within<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.209> turbo<00:02:32.660> so<00:02:33.379> quick

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
other faults within the turbo so quick

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.380 
other faults within the turbo so quick
check<00:02:34.040> you<00:02:34.160> can<00:02:34.310> do<00:02:34.459> is<00:02:34.580> you<00:02:34.670> pop<00:02:34.879> your<00:02:35.060> inlet

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
check you can do is you pop your inlet

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.750 
check you can do is you pop your inlet
hose<00:02:35.599> off<00:02:35.870> here<00:02:36.110> for<00:02:36.349> your<00:02:36.470> air<00:02:37.250> breather

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
hose off here for your air breather

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.400 
hose off here for your air breather
system<00:02:37.940> you<00:02:38.299> probably<00:02:38.420> got<00:02:38.720> hose<00:02:38.930> and<00:02:39.170> a<00:02:39.230> MAF

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
system you probably got hose and a MAF

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.940 
system you probably got hose and a MAF
sensor<00:02:39.440> or<00:02:40.129> something<00:02:40.519> like<00:02:40.700> that<00:02:40.760> and

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
sensor or something like that and

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.199 
sensor or something like that and
connected<00:02:42.950> here<00:02:43.099> with<00:02:43.280> a<00:02:43.310> Jubilee<00:02:43.760> clip<00:02:44.030> or<00:02:44.180> a

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
connected here with a Jubilee clip or a

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.819 
connected here with a Jubilee clip or a
hose<00:02:44.390> clamp<00:02:44.569> wherever<00:02:45.019> you<00:02:45.319> are<00:02:45.349> in<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.709> world

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
hose clamp wherever you are in the world

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.910 
hose clamp wherever you are in the world
so<00:02:46.790> you<00:02:46.849> pop<00:02:47.060> that<00:02:47.269> off<00:02:47.420> take<00:02:48.319> the<00:02:48.440> hose<00:02:48.620> off

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
so you pop that off take the hose off

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.380 
so you pop that off take the hose off
and<00:02:49.130> you<00:02:49.190> can<00:02:49.310> normally<00:02:49.430> get<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:49.849> finger<00:02:50.269> in

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
and you can normally get a finger in

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.350 
and you can normally get a finger in
there<00:02:50.569> to<00:02:50.599> feel<00:02:50.780> this<00:02:51.230> especially<00:02:51.650> on<00:02:52.360> Subarus

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
there to feel this especially on Subarus

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.020 
there to feel this especially on Subarus
and<00:02:53.569> stuff<00:02:53.750> so<00:02:54.440> what<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:55.489> want<00:02:55.610> to<00:02:55.700> do<00:02:55.819> is<00:02:55.940> you

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
and stuff so what you want to do is you

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.850 
and stuff so what you want to do is you
just<00:02:56.209> want<00:02:56.360> to<00:02:56.390> wiggle<00:02:56.780> you<00:02:57.500> want<00:02:57.680> to<00:02:57.739> wiggle

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
just want to wiggle you want to wiggle

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.619 
just want to wiggle you want to wiggle
that<00:02:58.069> turbine<00:02:58.549> and<00:02:58.730> see<00:02:58.819> if<00:02:58.910> there's<00:02:59.090> any<00:02:59.299> left

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
that turbine and see if there's any left

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.140 
that turbine and see if there's any left
or<00:02:59.930> right<00:03:00.200> over<00:03:00.500> up<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:00.739> down<00:03:00.950> play<00:03:01.250> so<00:03:01.910> here

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
or right over up and down play so here

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.580 
or right over up and down play so here
we<00:03:02.239> go<00:03:04.569> so<00:03:05.569> I'm<00:03:05.690> going<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:05.870> try<00:03:06.049> and<00:03:06.200> move<00:03:06.319> my

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
we go so I'm going to try and move my

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.800 
we go so I'm going to try and move my
finger<00:03:07.099> I'll<00:03:07.640> use<00:03:07.940> my<00:03:08.090> other<00:03:08.180> finger<00:03:08.299> so<00:03:08.720> we

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
finger I'll use my other finger so we

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:15.030 
finger I'll use my other finger so we
got<00:03:08.930> better<00:03:09.110> lighting<00:03:12.700> we<00:03:13.700> have<00:03:14.000> I<00:03:14.180> have<00:03:14.360> never

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
got better lighting we have I have never

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:23.410 
got better lighting we have I have never
seen<00:03:16.040> a<00:03:16.400> turbo<00:03:17.920> as<00:03:18.920> bad<00:03:19.760> as<00:03:19.910> this<00:03:22.239> it's<00:03:23.239> just

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
seen a turbo as bad as this it's just

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.259 
seen a turbo as bad as this it's just
really<00:03:23.720> really<00:03:23.959> bad<00:03:24.230> things<00:03:24.560> and<00:03:25.090> that<00:03:26.090> goes

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
really really bad things and that goes

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.690 
really really bad things and that goes
all<00:03:26.630> the<00:03:26.660> way<00:03:26.840> through<00:03:27.260> and<00:03:27.500> if<00:03:27.920> I<00:03:28.130> rotate<00:03:28.579> this

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
all the way through and if I rotate this

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.250 
all the way through and if I rotate this
around<00:03:28.880> so<00:03:29.359> I<00:03:29.420> can<00:03:29.480> actually<00:03:29.840> show<00:03:30.049> you<00:03:30.079> the

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
around so I can actually show you the

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.129 
around so I can actually show you the
compare<00:03:31.099> the<00:03:31.269> turbine<00:03:32.269> stage<00:03:32.569> here<00:03:32.870> look

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:38.229 

get<00:03:36.139> some<00:03:36.349> light<00:03:36.530> it's<00:03:37.489> all<00:03:37.609> wiggle<00:03:37.910> this<00:03:38.090> as

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
get some light it's all wiggle this as

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:45.900 
get some light it's all wiggle this as
well<00:03:38.480> it's<00:03:39.049> quite<00:03:39.290> deep<00:03:39.500> in<00:03:39.680> there<00:03:43.959> she's<00:03:44.959> gone

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
well it's quite deep in there she's gone

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
well it's quite deep in there she's gone
so<00:03:46.910> that<00:03:47.090> was<00:03:47.180> causing<00:03:47.540> all<00:03:47.599> kinds<00:03:47.660> of

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
so that was causing all kinds of

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.390 
so that was causing all kinds of
problems<00:03:47.989> and<00:03:48.319> you<00:03:48.410> can<00:03:48.590> see<00:03:48.919> the<00:03:49.099> amount<00:03:49.340> of

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
problems and you can see the amount of

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.670 
problems and you can see the amount of
oil<00:03:49.579> that's<00:03:50.060> in<00:03:50.269> here<00:03:50.569> right<00:03:50.780> slide<00:03:51.380> the<00:03:51.500> whole

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
oil that's in here right slide the whole

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.680 
oil that's in here right slide the whole
way<00:03:51.859> through<00:03:52.160> this<00:03:52.340> thing<00:03:52.400> is<00:03:52.730> just<00:03:53.000> caked<00:03:53.450> up

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
way through this thing is just caked up

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.240 
way through this thing is just caked up
in<00:03:53.870> oil<00:03:56.019> this<00:03:57.019> turbo<00:03:57.470> was<00:03:57.590> not<00:03:57.769> a<00:03:57.799> happy<00:03:58.010> camper

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
in oil this turbo was not a happy camper

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.509 
in oil this turbo was not a happy camper
that's<00:03:58.609> for<00:03:58.819> sure<00:03:58.970> so<00:03:59.349> new<00:04:00.349> one<00:04:00.560> in<00:04:00.739> no<00:04:01.190> smoke

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
that's for sure so new one in no smoke

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:06.640 
that's for sure so new one in no smoke
and<00:04:02.380> subsequently<00:04:03.849> from<00:04:04.849> this<00:04:05.060> install<00:04:05.650> we

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
and subsequently from this install we

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.129 
and subsequently from this install we
did<00:04:06.889> find<00:04:07.190> another<00:04:07.430> problem<00:04:08.030> we<00:04:08.209> now<00:04:08.540> have<00:04:08.840> a

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
did find another problem we now have a

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.770 
did find another problem we now have a
down<00:04:09.560> pipe<00:04:09.889> catalytic<00:04:10.669> converter<00:04:11.329> fail<00:04:11.569> and

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
down pipe catalytic converter fail and

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.870 
down pipe catalytic converter fail and
it's<00:04:11.900> rattling<00:04:12.290> around<00:04:12.470> like<00:04:12.650> a<00:04:12.680> mofo<00:04:13.519> in

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
it's rattling around like a mofo in

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.970 
it's rattling around like a mofo in
there<00:04:14.060> so<00:04:14.239> the<00:04:14.329> next<00:04:14.540> thing<00:04:14.780> is<00:04:14.900> to<00:04:14.930> sort<00:04:15.799> the

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
there so the next thing is to sort the

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.219 
there so the next thing is to sort the
downpipe<00:04:16.459> out<00:04:16.789> and<00:04:17.180> I<00:04:17.870> could<00:04:18.049> have<00:04:18.139> been

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
downpipe out and I could have been

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.170 
downpipe out and I could have been
partly<00:04:18.680> because<00:04:18.799> of<00:04:19.039> us<00:04:19.160> installing<00:04:19.729> this<00:04:19.909> it

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
partly because of us installing this it

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.310 
partly because of us installing this it
could<00:04:20.329> have<00:04:20.419> been<00:04:20.510> partly<00:04:20.930> because<00:04:21.049> it<00:04:21.289> was

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
could have been partly because it was

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.660 
could have been partly because it was
already<00:04:21.560> on<00:04:21.799> its<00:04:21.950> way<00:04:22.010> out

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
already on its way out

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.570 
already on its way out
who<00:04:24.030> knows<00:04:24.300> but<00:04:24.630> em<00:04:24.840> I<00:04:24.870> guess<00:04:25.680> that<00:04:25.890> if<00:04:26.010> the<00:04:26.430> new

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
who knows but em I guess that if the new

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.310 
who knows but em I guess that if the new
turbo<00:04:26.970> found<00:04:27.210> the<00:04:27.330> next<00:04:27.510> week<00:04:27.690> is<00:04:27.870> point<00:04:28.170> in

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
turbo found the next week is point in

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.050 
turbo found the next week is point in
the<00:04:28.440> system<00:04:28.650> blowing<00:04:29.250> air<00:04:29.400> through<00:04:29.430> properly

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
the system blowing air through properly

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.380 
the system blowing air through properly
and<00:04:30.710> it<00:04:31.710> has<00:04:31.950> disintegrated<00:04:32.880> and<00:04:32.970> causing<00:04:33.300> all

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
and it has disintegrated and causing all

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.320 
and it has disintegrated and causing all
kinds<00:04:33.690> of<00:04:33.720> wonderful<00:04:33.870> noises<00:04:34.530> so<00:04:35.490> there<00:04:36.240> you

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330
