00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.609 
absolutely astonishing especially when
you<00:01:24.299> look<00:01:24.450> at<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.630> price<00:01:24.869> tag<00:01:24.900> that's<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.500> his

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
you look at the price tag that's on his

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.980 
you look at the price tag that's on his
head<00:01:25.830> which<00:01:26.460> isn't<00:01:26.880> even<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.330> thousand<00:01:27.840> coins

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
head which isn't even a thousand coins

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.840 
head which isn't even a thousand coins
he's<00:01:28.290> an<00:01:28.409> absolute<00:01:28.650> bargain<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.759> this

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
he's an absolute bargain so in this

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.460 
he's an absolute bargain so in this
price<00:01:30.060> game<00:01:30.270> then<00:01:30.450> we<00:01:30.540> do<00:01:30.659> get<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.990> halftime<00:01:31.170> we

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
price game then we do get to halftime we

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
from doof main man and you know I'm

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.429 
from doof main man and you know I'm
really<00:01:39.270> cuz<00:01:39.420> I'm<00:01:39.630> really<00:01:39.900> started<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.259> think

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
really cuz I'm really started to think

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.109 
really cuz I'm really started to think
to<00:01:40.500> myself<00:01:40.590> why<00:01:41.009> did<00:01:41.220> I<00:01:41.250> even<00:01:41.340> drop<00:01:41.820> him<00:01:42.000> I

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
to myself why did I even drop him I

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.429 
to myself why did I even drop him I
don't<00:01:42.329> even<00:01:42.479> know<00:01:42.689> why<00:01:42.869> if<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.110> watched<00:01:43.290> a

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
don't even know why if you watched a

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.410 
don't even know why if you watched a
previous<00:01:43.860> episode<00:01:44.009> which<00:01:44.790> was<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:45.030> live

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
previous episode which was a live

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.679 
previous episode which was a live
commentary<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.170> was<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.710> 20<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.670> in<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.909> 86th

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
commentary I was a 20 and in the 86th

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.969 
commentary I was a 20 and in the 86th
minute<00:01:48.780> or<00:01:49.020> something<00:01:49.229> really<00:01:49.619> late<00:01:49.799> on<00:01:49.950> I

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
minute or something really late on I

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.230 
minute or something really late on I
think<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.280> might<00:01:50.430> have<00:01:50.490> even<00:01:50.610> been<00:01:50.880> as<00:01:51.030> late<00:01:51.210> as

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
think it might have even been as late as

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.840 
think it might have even been as late as
the<00:01:51.450> 88th<00:01:51.899> minute<00:01:52.020> joof<00:01:52.829> actually<00:01:53.340> got<00:01:53.490> us<00:01:53.670> the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
the 88th minute joof actually got us the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.700 
the 88th minute joof actually got us the
winner<00:01:54.030> so<00:01:54.270> why<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.509> dropped<00:01:54.960> him<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.350> do<00:01:55.409> not

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
winner so why I dropped him I do not

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.319 
winner so why I dropped him I do not
know<00:01:55.890> but<00:01:56.340> as<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.610> can<00:01:56.700> see<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.090> game

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
know but as you can see in this game

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.940

literally from like the halfway line you

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.589 
literally from like the halfway line you
can<00:02:20.129> send<00:02:20.400> out<00:02:20.549> rockets<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.209> whenever<00:02:21.389> it's

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
against me it always feels as if every

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.459 
against me it always feels as if every
single<00:02:23.760> chance<00:02:23.969> that<00:02:24.510> benefit<00:02:24.930> does<00:02:25.079> get<00:02:25.319> will

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:25.469 
single chance that benefit does get will

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:27.050 
single chance that benefit does get will
get<00:02:25.829> whenever<00:02:26.010> I'm<00:02:26.249> playing<00:02:26.459> against<00:02:26.819> him<00:02:26.939> as

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
get whenever I'm playing against him as

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.970 
get whenever I'm playing against him as
my<00:02:27.209> position<00:02:27.629> it<00:02:28.049> does<00:02:28.260> get<00:02:28.439> buried<00:02:28.739> into<00:02:28.859> the

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
my position it does get buried into the

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.140 
my position it does get buried into the
back<00:02:29.189> of<00:02:29.219> the<00:02:29.370> net<00:02:29.519> so<00:02:29.670> that<00:02:29.700> wasn't<00:02:30.120> really

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
back of the net so that wasn't really

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.580 
back of the net so that wasn't really
nice<00:02:30.420> goal<00:02:30.629> coming<00:02:30.810> from<00:02:31.019> him<00:02:31.230> but<00:02:31.349> I<00:02:31.409> did

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
nice goal coming from him but I did

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.990 
nice goal coming from him but I did
score<00:02:31.709> quite<00:02:32.069> a<00:02:32.099> couple<00:02:32.459> after<00:02:32.760> you<00:02:32.819> didn't

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
score quite a couple after you didn't

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.699 
score quite a couple after you didn't
score<00:02:33.180> that<00:02:33.299> and<00:02:33.870> we<00:02:33.959> did<00:02:34.109> pick<00:02:34.290> up<00:02:34.379> three

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709

taking the three points and ever since

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.890 
taking the three points and ever since
then<00:04:16.979> my<00:04:17.400> opposition<00:04:17.729> decided<00:04:18.419> to<00:04:18.509> bring<00:04:18.690> out

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.990 
then my opposition decided to bring out
his<00:04:19.079> goalkeeper<00:04:19.680> at<00:04:19.799> every<00:04:20.130> chance<00:04:20.340> i<00:04:20.549> did<00:04:20.820> get
