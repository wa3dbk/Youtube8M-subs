00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello very good to everyone in this video 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.250
 I will explain how to solve the 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.250
 problem the nvidia driver left 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.990
 work and he recovered 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.990
 to begin this problem is due to two 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.670
 incompatibility or performance reasons 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.470
 if it were incompatibility it 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.110
 I would solve as simple as here 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.689
 control panel programs and 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.440
 features and uninstall 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.030
 nvidia driver 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:30.200
 and then download the latest version 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.200
 from the official page 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.590
 here 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.990
 good 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.960
 now the other solution would be that 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.820
 problem yields usually soil that 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.000
 be in games and programs we could x 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.960
 touch 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.030
 edict worse we did 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.640
 Once here inside you already showed that the 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.450
 local machine 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.450
 exist 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.449
 happens he found the control set him 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.519
 We asked to know without bringing here 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:12.600
 we would do the new 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:14.920
 and in 2004 this 732 wright batt invites 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.610
 your shops in solidarity types 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.610
 they know 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.940
 the operating system for this team 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.750
 properties we can in case of 64 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.750
 we have here 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.510
 54 in the case and here we would put the 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.140
 first name 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.520
 must be 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:43.340
 direct closure 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.300
 once done laurinos and we put 8 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.220
 we accept closing 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.690
 well now what we will achieve with this 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.240
 is to give more time to the video board 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.740
 to show the graphics on the monitor 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.510
 and so we would solve the problem of 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.890
 nvidia driver of the social game and 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.470
 he recovered 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:03.000
 well I hope you serve them thanks 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.000
 watch the video and see you next time
