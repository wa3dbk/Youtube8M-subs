I<00:02:13.580> pretty<00:02:14.000> much<00:02:14.120> slept<00:02:14.390> almost<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:15.050> entire

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
I pretty much slept almost the entire

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.830 
I pretty much slept almost the entire
drive<00:02:15.500> but<00:02:15.940> it<00:02:16.940> wasn't<00:02:17.210> even<00:02:17.270> that<00:02:17.360> much<00:02:17.630> of<00:02:17.780> a

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
drive but it wasn't even that much of a

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.330 
drive but it wasn't even that much of a
drive<00:02:18.020> was<00:02:18.230> like<00:02:18.320> 45<00:02:18.740> minutes<00:02:18.950> or<00:02:19.190> whatever

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
drive was like 45 minutes or whatever

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.620 
drive was like 45 minutes or whatever
but<00:02:19.700> I<00:02:20.320> wake<00:02:21.320> up<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:21.740> it<00:02:22.130> is<00:02:22.250> snowing<00:02:22.970> it's

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
but I wake up and it is snowing it's

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.670 
but I wake up and it is snowing it's
like<00:02:23.810> a<00:02:23.840> blizzard<00:02:24.260> out<00:02:24.590> there<00:02:24.620> it<00:02:25.370> was<00:02:25.610> insane

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
like a blizzard out there it was insane

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.830 
like a blizzard out there it was insane
so<00:02:27.680> I<00:02:28.100> wasn't<00:02:28.370> pretty<00:02:29.060> crazy<00:02:29.360> and<00:02:29.600> when<00:02:29.720> we

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
so I wasn't pretty crazy and when we

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.540 
so I wasn't pretty crazy and when we
were<00:02:29.960> at<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.590> College<00:02:30.920> in<00:02:30.950> Pennsylvania<00:02:31.100> I

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
wanted their driveway shoveled so I just

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.490 
wanted their driveway shoveled so I just
shovel<00:03:54.260> their<00:03:54.380> driveway<00:03:54.410> and<00:03:56.049> so<00:03:57.049> I<00:03:57.080> was<00:03:57.380> gone

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
shovel their driveway and so I was gone

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.070

for<00:03:57.530> quite<00:03:57.769> a<00:03:57.920> few<00:03:58.010> uh<00:03:58.360> for<00:03:59.360> nine<00:03:59.540> hours<00:03:59.569> I

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
for quite a few uh for nine hours I

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.900 
for quite a few uh for nine hours I
guess<00:04:00.140> quite<00:04:00.799> a<00:04:00.830> few<00:04:01.069> minutes<00:04:01.220> maybe<00:04:01.640> half

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
guess quite a few minutes maybe half

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.839 
guess quite a few minutes maybe half
hour<00:04:02.120> but<00:04:02.690> anyways<00:04:02.959> that's<00:04:03.200> not<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:03.500> point

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
hour but anyways that's not the point

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.009 
hour but anyways that's not the point
that's<00:04:04.849> a<00:04:04.910> pretty<00:04:05.060> interesting<00:04:05.269> thing<00:04:05.720> you

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
that's a pretty interesting thing you

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:07.180 
that's a pretty interesting thing you
guys<00:04:06.170> should<00:04:06.349> probably<00:04:06.440> know<00:04:06.739> about<00:04:06.769> I<00:04:07.040> do

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
that sometimes let's say someone

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:10.180 
that sometimes let's say someone
interrupts<00:04:09.440> meet<00:04:09.680> in<00:04:09.799> the<00:04:09.890> middle<00:04:09.980> of<00:04:10.130> the

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
interrupts meet in the middle of the

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.780

i'll stop the commentary and then i'll
redo<00:04:15.709> it<00:04:15.890> but<00:04:16.100> it<00:04:16.430> sounds<00:04:16.700> like<00:04:17.000> i'm<00:04:17.180> still

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450

redo it but it sounds like i'm still
doing<00:04:17.600> it<00:04:17.840> so<00:04:18.109> if<00:04:18.769> you<00:04:19.010> guys<00:04:19.160> can<00:04:19.340> never<00:04:19.459> point
