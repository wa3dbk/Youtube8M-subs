00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
right away got two main features that's

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.749 
right away got two main features that's
all<00:00:10.080> it<00:00:10.320> is<00:00:10.349> adapting<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.429> newest<00:00:11.670> version

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
all it is adapting to the newest version

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.300 
all it is adapting to the newest version
of<00:00:12.210> Minecraft<00:00:12.719> 1.5<00:00:13.250> x<00:00:15.440> well<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.710> little<00:00:16.980> tweak

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
of Minecraft 1.5 x well a little tweak

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.000 
of Minecraft 1.5 x well a little tweak
of<00:00:17.430> redstone<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:18.170> also<00:00:19.170> those<00:00:19.470> cables<00:00:19.920> right

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
of redstone and also those cables right

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.599 
of redstone and also those cables right
here<00:00:20.340> which<00:00:20.609> are<00:00:21.500> let<00:00:22.500> me<00:00:22.619> see<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.890> name<00:00:24.289> it<00:00:25.289> is

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
here which are let me see the name it is

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.050 
here which are let me see the name it is
wired<00:00:26.609> modems<00:00:27.359> as<00:00:28.160> opposed<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.580> wireless

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
wired modems as opposed to wireless

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.089 
wired modems as opposed to wireless
modems<00:00:30.449> now<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.349> let's<00:00:31.470> get<00:00:31.590> started<00:00:31.920> right

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
modems now and let's get started right

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.250 
modems now and let's get started right
away<00:00:32.390> first<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.510> all<00:00:33.540> let's<00:00:33.750> have<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.930> look<00:00:34.079> at

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
away first of all let's have a look at

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.470 
away first of all let's have a look at
VRS<00:00:35.160> API<00:00:35.870> s<00:00:36.870> like<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:38.149> you<00:00:39.149> see<00:00:39.329> there

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
VRS API s like that and you see there

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.319 
VRS API s like that and you see there
are<00:00:39.540> few<00:00:39.780> more<00:00:39.960> functions<00:00:40.460> get<00:00:41.460> analog<00:00:41.940> inputs

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
are few more functions get analog inputs

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.470 
are few more functions get analog inputs
get<00:00:42.570> or<00:00:42.930> set<00:00:43.530> analog<00:00:44.100> output<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.789> get<00:00:45.030> analog

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
get or set analog output and get analog

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.410 
get or set analog output and get analog
output<00:00:46.100> now<00:00:47.570> basically<00:00:48.570> if<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.469> do<00:00:50.420> set

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
output now basically if you do set

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.299 
output now basically if you do set
output<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.379> said<00:00:52.530> with<00:00:52.680> thing<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.070> true

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
output and you said with thing to true

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.700 
output and you said with thing to true
it<00:00:53.550> will<00:00:53.969> be<00:00:54.059> equivalent<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.570> doing<00:00:54.780> set

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
it will be equivalent to doing set

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.250 
it will be equivalent to doing set
analog<00:00:56.129> outputs<00:00:56.610> with<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> number<00:00:57.809> which<00:00:58.230> will

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
analog outputs with a number which will

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.770 
analog outputs with a number which will
have<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.620> value<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:59.359> 15<00:01:00.359> which<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.379> maximum

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
have a value of 15 which is the maximum

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.600 
have a value of 15 which is the maximum
mid<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.199> maximum<00:01:04.500> distance<00:01:04.739> Summerson<00:01:05.460> can

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
mid the maximum distance Summerson can

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.670 
mid the maximum distance Summerson can
go<00:01:05.760> now<00:01:06.299> let's<00:01:06.600> check<00:01:06.930> out<00:01:07.110> those<00:01:07.290> functions

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
go now let's check out those functions

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.830 
go now let's check out those functions
right<00:01:07.799> now<00:01:08.010> baidu<00:01:08.880> going<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.600> lower

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
right now baidu going to the lower

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.149 
right now baidu going to the lower
console<00:01:10.350> like<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.520> doing<00:01:12.180> our<00:01:12.450> s<00:01:12.659> dot

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
console like that and doing our s dot

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:20.130 
console like that and doing our s dot
set<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:15.600> log<00:01:16.400> out<00:01:17.400> Kurt

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.899 

the<00:01:20.740> side<00:01:21.130> will<00:01:21.550> be<00:01:21.580> left<00:01:22.510> and<00:01:23.490> we<00:01:24.490> all<00:01:24.580> set

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
the side will be left and we all set

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.080 
the side will be left and we all set
about<00:01:25.030> to<00:01:25.210> a<00:01:25.240> value<00:01:25.450> of<00:01:25.810> four<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:27.490> you<00:01:27.760> can<00:01:27.909> see

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
about to a value of four and you can see

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.050 
about to a value of four and you can see
where<00:01:28.300> stone<00:01:28.540> is<00:01:28.690> going<00:01:28.990> or<00:01:29.860> signal<00:01:30.790> doing<00:01:30.970> up

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
where stone is going or signal doing up

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.460 
where stone is going or signal doing up
to<00:01:31.210> there<00:01:31.390> but<00:01:31.630> this<00:01:31.780> lamp<00:01:31.990> is<00:01:32.080> still<00:01:32.350> on

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
to there but this lamp is still on

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.620 
to there but this lamp is still on
because<00:01:33.190> that's<00:01:33.340> how<00:01:33.520> r<00:01:33.850> is<00:01:34.000> still<00:01:34.240> works<00:01:34.479> but

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
because that's how r is still works but

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.780 
because that's how r is still works but
you<00:01:34.810> get<00:01:34.960> one<00:01:35.170> two<00:01:35.500> three<00:01:36.360> four<00:01:38.610> pieces<00:01:39.610> of

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
you get one two three four pieces of

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.600 
you get one two three four pieces of
wire<00:01:40.000> which<00:01:40.270> are<00:01:40.479> ignited<00:01:40.960> and<00:01:41.310> we<00:01:42.310> can<00:01:42.460> just

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
wire which are ignited and we can just

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.749 
wire which are ignited and we can just
set<00:01:42.820> that<00:01:42.850> also<00:01:43.270> to<00:01:43.330> sex<00:01:43.930> for<00:01:44.140> example<00:01:44.530> it<00:01:45.490> will

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
set that also to sex for example it will

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.130 
set that also to sex for example it will
go<00:01:46.060> even<00:01:46.210> further<00:01:46.509> and<00:01:48.180> let's<00:01:49.180> put<00:01:49.390> open<00:01:49.720> 20

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
go even further and let's put open 20

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.680 
go even further and let's put open 20
and<00:01:50.970> Shazam<00:01:51.970> as<00:01:52.240> you<00:01:52.509> can<00:01:52.630> see<00:01:52.810> it<00:01:53.380> went<00:01:53.920> off

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
and Shazam as you can see it went off

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.290 
and Shazam as you can see it went off
now<00:01:56.460> there<00:01:57.460> are<00:01:57.490> probably<00:01:57.820> a<00:01:57.940> whole<00:01:58.090> bunch<00:01:58.240> of

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
now there are probably a whole bunch of

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.730 
now there are probably a whole bunch of
things<00:01:58.390> you<00:01:58.570> can<00:01:58.720> do<00:01:58.840> a<00:01:58.869> redstone<00:01:59.289> I<00:01:59.410> haven't

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
things you can do a redstone I haven't

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.190 
things you can do a redstone I haven't
really<00:02:01.259> done<00:02:02.259> much<00:02:02.320> testing<00:02:02.979> but<00:02:03.130> yeah<00:02:03.670> well

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
really done much testing but yeah well

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.180 
really done much testing but yeah well
that's<00:02:05.200> some<00:02:05.530> stuff<00:02:05.710> you<00:02:05.800> can<00:02:05.920> do<00:02:06.070> by

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
that's some stuff you can do by

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.479 
that's some stuff you can do by
ourselves<00:02:06.270> now<00:02:07.270> let<00:02:07.720> me<00:02:07.750> show<00:02:07.869> you<00:02:08.369> what<00:02:09.369> you

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
ourselves now let me show you what you

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.630 
ourselves now let me show you what you
can<00:02:09.610> do<00:02:09.729> with<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:09.940> cables<00:02:10.300> it's<00:02:10.899> pretty<00:02:11.260> fun

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
can do with the cables it's pretty fun

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.130 
can do with the cables it's pretty fun
we<00:02:12.640> can<00:02:12.790> do<00:02:12.910> some<00:02:13.060> interesting<00:02:13.239> things<00:02:13.450> anyway

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
we can do some interesting things anyway

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.820 
we can do some interesting things anyway
however<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.040> first<00:02:15.220> thing<00:02:15.370> let's<00:02:15.640> see<00:02:16.830> the

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
however the first thing let's see the

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.199 
however the first thing let's see the
functions<00:02:18.250> would<00:02:18.370> belong<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:19.090> this

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
functions would belong to this

method and call remote and let's see so

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.590 
method and call remote and let's see so
will<00:02:59.380> pretty<00:03:00.010> much<00:03:00.070> try<00:03:00.430> all<00:03:00.640> methods<00:03:00.850> so

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
will pretty much try all methods so

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.240 
will pretty much try all methods so
first<00:03:01.840> thing<00:03:01.930> on<00:03:02.049> to<00:03:02.170> do<00:03:02.350> is<00:03:02.620> you<00:03:03.040> want<00:03:03.070> to

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
first thing on to do is you want to

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.140 
first thing on to do is you want to
activate<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:05.110> modem<00:03:05.709> like<00:03:06.130> this<00:03:06.370> you<00:03:06.970> don't

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
activate the modem like this you don't

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.030 
activate the modem like this you don't
need<00:03:07.239> to<00:03:07.390> activate<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:08.230> one<00:03:08.350> on<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.650> computer

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
need to activate the one on the computer

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.680 
need to activate the one on the computer
right<00:03:09.070> here<00:03:09.250> because<00:03:09.640> I<00:03:11.100> thought<00:03:12.100> I<00:03:12.670> guess<00:03:13.239> if

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
right here because I thought I guess if

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.800 
right here because I thought I guess if
it's<00:03:14.170> on<00:03:14.380> it<00:03:15.340> will<00:03:15.549> mean<00:03:15.700> you<00:03:15.730> can<00:03:16.060> send<00:03:16.510> some

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
it's on it will mean you can send some

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.289 
it's on it will mean you can send some
data<00:03:16.959> through<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.920> wires<00:03:18.130> however<00:03:18.910> if<00:03:19.150> it's

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
data through the wires however if it's

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.479 
data through the wires however if it's
off<00:03:19.450> you<00:03:19.570> can<00:03:19.690> still<00:03:19.930> receive<00:03:20.380> some<00:03:21.250> data

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
off you can still receive some data

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.310 
off you can still receive some data
through<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:21.850> modem<00:03:22.180> so<00:03:22.870> what<00:03:23.019> you'll<00:03:23.140> see

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
through the modem so what you'll see

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.390 
through the modem so what you'll see
anyway

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
anyway

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.869 
anyway
now<00:03:24.700> let's<00:03:24.939> go<00:03:25.030> to<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.269> lure<00:03:25.450> console<00:03:25.900> and

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
now let's go to the lure console and

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.610 
now let's go to the lure console and
let's<00:03:27.879> stick<00:03:28.120> less<00:03:28.659> for<00:03:29.079> fessel<00:03:29.379> wrap

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
let's stick less for fessel wrap

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.550 
let's stick less for fessel wrap
peripheral<00:03:30.549> by<00:03:30.730> doing<00:03:31.799> less<00:03:33.510> quality<00:03:34.510> as<00:03:34.959> a

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
on the right side there we go now let us

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.060 
on the right side there we go now let us
see<00:03:48.330> what<00:03:48.690> one<00:03:48.900> to<00:03:48.990> do<00:03:49.170> first<00:03:49.800> of<00:03:49.890> all<00:03:49.980> is<00:03:50.160> do

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
see what one to do first of all is do

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.070 
see what one to do first of all is do
gets<00:03:53.070> names<00:03:53.430> remote<00:03:53.850> so<00:03:54.360> let's<00:03:54.720> stick<00:03:54.870> Lee<00:03:55.050> I

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080

printer so just as a that's as an

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.170 
printer so just as a that's as an
example<00:04:10.170> so<00:04:10.980> let's<00:04:11.130> do<00:04:11.280> that<00:04:11.430> get<00:04:11.880> names

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
example so let's do that get names

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.340 
example so let's do that get names
remote<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:14.000> there<00:04:15.000> should<00:04:15.360> be<00:04:15.510> two<00:04:15.960> things<00:04:16.230> in

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
remote and there should be two things in

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.700 
remote and there should be two things in
the<00:04:16.410> table<00:04:16.730> so<00:04:17.730> one<00:04:18.260> we<00:04:19.260> have<00:04:19.410> monitor<00:04:19.890> 0<00:04:20.190> and

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:21.710 
the table so one we have monitor 0 and

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:26.030 
the table so one we have monitor 0 and
print<00:04:22.710> 20<00:04:23.720> /<00:04:24.720> that's<00:04:24.840> cool<00:04:25.020> let's<00:04:25.890> deactivate

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
print 20 / that's cool let's deactivate

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.730 
print 20 / that's cool let's deactivate
velcro<00:04:26.670> to<00:04:26.790> now<00:04:26.940> you<00:04:27.720> have<00:04:27.870> the<00:04:28.110> names<00:04:28.410> of<00:04:28.650> the

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
velcro to now you have the names of the

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.340 
velcro to now you have the names of the
two<00:04:28.980> monitors<00:04:29.490> so<00:04:29.970> this<00:04:30.870> is<00:04:31.020> going<00:04:31.170> to<00:04:31.230> be

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
two monitors so this is going to be

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.470 
two monitors so this is going to be
useful<00:04:31.680> for<00:04:31.710> later<00:04:32.000> then<00:04:33.000> we<00:04:33.240> have<00:04:33.450> another

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
useful for later then we have another

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.070 
useful for later then we have another

function gets type remote services to

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.760 
function gets type remote services to
get<00:04:37.200> the<00:04:37.290> type<00:04:37.530> now<00:04:38.370> let's<00:04:38.970> use<00:04:39.320> get<00:04:40.320> method

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
get the type now let's use get method

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.350 
get the type now let's use get method
remote<00:04:41.040> Vista<00:04:41.340> will<00:04:41.490> be<00:04:41.610> together<00:04:41.760> methods

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
remote Vista will be together methods

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
which belong to a specific beautiful so

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.130 
which belong to a specific beautiful so
we're<00:04:44.400> going<00:04:44.550> to<00:04:44.970> do<00:04:45.120> t<00:04:45.420> equal<00:04:46.200> P<00:04:46.410> dot<00:04:46.800> get

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
we're going to do t equal P dot get

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.620 
we're going to do t equal P dot get
methods

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
methods

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.150 
methods
remote<00:04:51.620> and<00:04:53.410> we<00:04:54.410> are<00:04:54.530> going<00:04:54.680> to<00:04:54.740> indicate

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
remote and we are going to indicate

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.200 
remote and we are going to indicate
which<00:04:55.880> will<00:04:56.150> be<00:04:56.380> monitor<00:04:57.610> or<00:04:58.610> which<00:04:58.820> will<00:04:59.030> be

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
which will be monitor or which will be

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.390 
which will be monitor or which will be
the<00:04:59.810> peripheral<00:05:00.350> we<00:05:00.440> often<00:05:00.740> SPECT<00:05:01.040> so<00:05:01.250> in<00:05:01.340> this

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
the peripheral we often SPECT so in this

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:10.210 
the peripheral we often SPECT so in this
case<00:05:01.550> it<00:05:01.730> is<00:05:01.820> monitor<00:05:03.910> motor<00:05:05.530> monitor<00:05:06.850> and<00:05:09.220> it

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
case it is monitor motor monitor and it

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.870 
case it is monitor motor monitor and it
would<00:05:10.400> be<00:05:10.430> 0<00:05:10.850> there<00:05:11.690> we<00:05:11.780> go<00:05:11.930> and<00:05:12.610> we'll<00:05:13.610> get<00:05:13.820> a

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
would be 0 there we go and we'll get a

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.610 
would be 0 there we go and we'll get a
whole<00:05:14.210> bunch<00:05:14.240> of<00:05:14.630> function<00:05:15.080> so<00:05:15.290> what<00:05:15.500> we're

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
whole bunch of function so what we're

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:21.840 
whole bunch of function so what we're
going<00:05:15.710> to<00:05:15.800> do<00:05:15.920> is<00:05:16.070> for<00:05:16.430> i<00:05:17.230> equal<00:05:18.230> 12<00:05:20.230> max<00:05:21.230> of<00:05:21.470> T

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
going to do is for i equal 12 max of T

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:32.770 
going to do is for i equal 12 max of T
do<00:05:23.200> print<00:05:26.830> 20<00:05:27.830> of<00:05:27.980> position<00:05:28.430> I<00:05:30.820> VX<00:05:31.820> and<00:05:32.120> we'll

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
do print 20 of position I VX and we'll

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.690 
do print 20 of position I VX and we'll
get<00:05:32.930> all<00:05:33.140> the<00:05:33.800> functions<00:05:34.190> which<00:05:34.340> belong<00:05:34.670> to

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
get all the functions which belong to

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.720 
get all the functions which belong to
the<00:05:34.820> peripheral<00:05:35.360> so<00:05:36.110> that's<00:05:36.290> cool<00:05:36.520> that<00:05:37.520> means

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:37.730 
the peripheral so that's cool that means

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.330 
the peripheral so that's cool that means
all<00:05:37.910> those<00:05:38.270> functions<00:05:38.660> you<00:05:39.290> can<00:05:39.470> use<00:05:39.740> by<00:05:40.010> doing

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
all those functions you can use by doing

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:47.200 
all those functions you can use by doing
p<00:05:41.210> dot<00:05:41.570> cream<00:05:43.000> remote<00:05:44.000> call<00:05:44.570> I<00:05:44.600> think<00:05:46.210> go

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
p dot cream remote call I think go

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.850 
p dot cream remote call I think go
remote<00:05:47.600> call<00:05:47.840> and<00:05:49.900> what<00:05:50.900> you<00:05:51.050> indicate<00:05:51.590> first

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
remote call and what you indicate first

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.850 
remote call and what you indicate first
is<00:05:52.010> which<00:05:52.220> will<00:05:52.400> be<00:05:52.520> the<00:05:52.640> periphery<00:05:53.210> on<00:05:53.420> to<00:05:53.860> use

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
is which will be the periphery on to use

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.460 
is which will be the periphery on to use
a<00:05:54.890> function<00:05:55.130> on<00:05:55.490> so<00:05:55.790> it<00:05:55.880> will<00:05:56.000> be<00:05:56.030> monitor<00:05:56.570> 0

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.650 

then<00:06:01.250> you<00:06:01.430> give<00:06:01.610> a<00:06:01.640> name<00:06:01.850> of<00:06:01.910> a<00:06:02.030> function<00:06:02.180> so

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 
then you give a name of a function so

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.300 
then you give a name of a function so
how<00:06:02.960> about<00:06:03.050> right<00:06:04.390> and<00:06:05.890> finally<00:06:06.890> a<00:06:06.920> few

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
how about right and finally a few

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.070 
how about right and finally a few
arguments<00:06:07.550> whatever<00:06:08.330> arguments<00:06:08.840> you<00:06:08.900> want

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080 
arguments whatever arguments you want

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.770 
arguments whatever arguments you want
some<00:06:09.680> case<00:06:09.890> white<00:06:10.130> how<00:06:10.490> about<00:06:10.520> some<00:06:11.030> basic

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780 
some case white how about some basic

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:19.690 
some case white how about some basic
text<00:06:12.290> like<00:06:12.430> Hello<00:06:13.430> well<00:06:14.090> oh<00:06:18.220> what<00:06:19.220> did<00:06:19.310> I<00:06:19.460> write

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:19.700 
text like Hello well oh what did I write

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.180 
text like Hello well oh what did I write
this<00:06:19.910> time<00:06:20.180> or<00:06:20.900> maybe<00:06:21.140> it's<00:06:21.320> cool<00:06:21.620> remote<00:06:21.980> not

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
this time or maybe it's cool remote not

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:28.860 
this time or maybe it's cool remote not
remote<00:06:22.490> call<00:06:22.730> yeah<00:06:23.120> silly<00:06:24.050> me<00:06:25.060> now<00:06:26.060> dang<00:06:26.570> it<00:06:27.530> oh

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
remote call yeah silly me now dang it oh

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:36.820 
remote call yeah silly me now dang it oh
well<00:06:29.870> attempt<00:06:30.320> number<00:06:30.560> two<00:06:34.720> call<00:06:35.720> real<00:06:36.620> note

well attempt number two call real note
and<00:06:37.450> this<00:06:38.450> time<00:06:38.570> it<00:06:38.690> works<00:06:38.900> as<00:06:39.170> you<00:06:39.290> can<00:06:39.440> see<00:06:39.620> on

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:39.650 
and this time it works as you can see on

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.400 
and this time it works as you can see on
the<00:06:39.860> verb<00:06:40.040> monitor<00:06:40.460> it<00:06:40.760> says<00:06:41.090> saying<00:06:41.480> hello

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:42.410 
the verb monitor it says saying hello

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.270 
the verb monitor it says saying hello
world<00:06:43.090> now<00:06:44.090> I<00:06:44.600> guess<00:06:45.590> that's<00:06:45.800> pretty<00:06:46.010> much<00:06:46.070> all

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 
world now I guess that's pretty much all

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.590
