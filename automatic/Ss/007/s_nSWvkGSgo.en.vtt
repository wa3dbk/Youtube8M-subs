 hello everyone welcome to my channel i am 

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.620
 Fira and today I bring you a small video 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:10.030
 so you can decide what the series is 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.700
 of repechaje maker that you want to see now 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.559
 in the channel a few hours ago I went up the 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.450
 last episode of uruguay and I warned 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:20.170
 that would upload this video for you 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:22.090
 you can vote which is the game that more 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.090
 you want to see now in this style 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.730
 of horror rpg maker that we like a lot 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.259
 all and good this game well what 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.170
 we would start next Wednesday in 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.570
 the same schedule that was in Uruguay and 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:37.210
 I have contemplated three options worth 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.420
 good let's start with the first my 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.059
 first option is to go and as you like 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.160
 call it this game that I think everything 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.320
 the world will already know that it is super 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.180
 Nice it's about a girl 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.899
 small that is lost in a gallery of 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.239
 art there he also meets a boy and 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.250
 they have to come out it's worth the goal of 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.870
 play out is not an art gallery 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.010
 you are right 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.160
 traps of evil pictures and things 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.100
 horrible vouchers 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.110
 this is the first option I would play at 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:13.150
 ibi point 1 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:17.260
 and point to 1.05 which is this good 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:20.470
 it's an expansion so to speak that they have 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.240
 finished translating it last month that 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.119
 has some new dialogues some 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.820
 pictures I think you can also check out 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.860
 a couple of more ends with marc and with the 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.650
 character of the sea and those who know the 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.399
 prologue you will know who I think also 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:39.490
 has a new a new room or something like that 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:41.259
 and I do not know if some small changes in 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.259
 the story is the same everything else 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.750
 everything is like that but it has little ones 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.890
 changes then this would be the first 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.170
 option 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.800
 our second option is corset party 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.540
 review 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.690
 this is not the corso party that is for 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.230
 psp him with his party that is in 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:02.330
 English and I think they will translate it 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.920
 this is one of rpg maker that they have 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.830
 translated last month 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.720
 and that I think they have the same 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.510
 characters the same argument that they are 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.760
 some guys that make a kind of 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.180
 strange ritual in the institute 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.120
 they fall like another 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.370
 that is the same institute but as 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.900
 demoniac is a strange little thing 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.780
 but I think the development of the 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.660
 story is different from that of the corset 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.960
 from the psp 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.640
 this would be our second option no no 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.890
 I know if someone has already played 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.140
 contrary that I know there are many 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.660
 people who have already uploaded it I do not know if this 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.370
 game is uploaded in Spanish then 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.610
 Well, if you want to see this, it's a bit 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:49.390
 you can choose with more part 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.870
 porsche party reuil and as third 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.330
 option 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.430
 the other day consulting the blog of 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.350
 boy who translates these rpg games 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.940
 maker and he had translated a little game 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.990
 what is called killer bear 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:07.220
 which I think is a pretty short game 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:09.200
 and that basically is I think it's a 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:13.100
 parody of the American movies of 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.710
 terror or the guy to the scary type movie 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.830
 but yes but without that easy humor and 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:21.290
 stupid is worth then this game is very 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.850
 cortito I think but good is an option 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.830
 also that I did not know her 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.390
 personally so if you want 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.180
 see it I think it's about some guys that 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.250
 they are in a house having a party and 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.280
 there is a killer dressed as a bear who 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.260
 that's called killer bear that goes the 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.210
 candles kills or does not kill them at the end but 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.620
 well I think it's about that 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.270
 which it is in the house where the action is 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.090
 of a party between that murderer called 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:48.320
 killer dea then these are the three 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.090
 options you have until we are going to put 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.010
 until Monday or until Tuesday that 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.500
 come to vote 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.900
 so that I have time to download the 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.790
 game play it and so on so good 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.390

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.879

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.870

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:27.410
