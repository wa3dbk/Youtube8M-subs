glitch no today this is a this is an

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.589 
glitch no today this is a this is an
accuracy<00:00:08.370> glitch<00:00:08.730> I<00:00:08.880> think<00:00:09.059> it's<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.210> bit<00:00:09.360> old

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
accuracy glitch I think it's a bit old

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.690 
accuracy glitch I think it's a bit old
but<00:00:10.170> I<00:00:10.469> still<00:00:10.920> think<00:00:11.099> it's<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.250> really<00:00:11.519> awesome

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
but I still think it's a really awesome

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.480 
but I still think it's a really awesome
one<00:00:12.030> that<00:00:12.389> I<00:00:12.420> occasionally<00:00:12.900> use<00:00:13.219> just<00:00:14.219> we<00:00:14.340> need

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
one that I occasionally use just we need

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.450 
one that I occasionally use just we need
a<00:00:14.519> bit<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.849> an<00:00:14.940> upper<00:00:15.299> hand<00:00:15.509> in<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.780> game<00:00:16.460> so

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
a bit of an upper hand in the game so

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.490 
a bit of an upper hand in the game so
what<00:00:17.640> we're<00:00:17.789> gonna<00:00:17.880> do<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.330> we<00:00:18.810> are<00:00:18.900> going<00:00:19.050> to

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
what we're gonna do is we are going to

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.019 
what we're gonna do is we are going to
aim<00:00:20.039> down<00:00:20.279> sights<00:00:20.570> you're<00:00:21.570> into<00:00:22.100> fire<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.609> hold

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
aim down sights you're into fire so hold

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.720 
aim down sights you're into fire so hold
on<00:00:24.150> don't<00:00:24.300> trigger<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:25.250> while<00:00:26.250> you're<00:00:26.460> firing

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
on don't trigger and while you're firing

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.669 
on don't trigger and while you're firing
you<00:00:27.119> want<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.660> knife<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:28.800> like<00:00:29.630> that<00:00:30.630> now<00:00:31.470> you

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
you want to knife so like that now you

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.200 
you want to knife so like that now you
can<00:00:31.830> see<00:00:32.009> that<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.340> crosshair<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:32.969> in<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
can see that the crosshair is in the

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.209 
can see that the crosshair is in the
middle<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.480> screen<00:00:33.630> far<00:00:34.469> smaller<00:00:34.829> than<00:00:35.010> the

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
middle of screen far smaller than the

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.270 
middle of screen far smaller than the
word<00:00:35.340> before<00:00:35.510> so<00:00:36.510> if<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.690> find<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.500> wall<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:38.100> shoot

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
word before so if I find a wall to shoot

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.110 
word before so if I find a wall to shoot
at<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:39.059> will<00:00:39.270> stay<00:00:39.510> like<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.690> for<00:00:41.120> forever

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
at this will stay like this for forever

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.020 
at this will stay like this for forever
as<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.050> work<00:00:43.410> until<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.370> start<00:00:44.610> throwing<00:00:44.670> again

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
as a work until you start throwing again

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.240 
as a work until you start throwing again
so<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.600> can<00:00:45.809> use<00:00:46.050> other<00:00:46.260> guns<00:00:46.559> switch<00:00:46.920> back<00:00:47.129> at

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
so you can use other guns switch back at

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.799 
so you can use other guns switch back at
me<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.460> same

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
me the same

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.049 
me the same
so<00:00:48.809> we're<00:00:48.930> gonna<00:00:49.020> do<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.440> going<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.860> stand<00:00:50.460> our

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
so we're gonna do is going to stand our

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.970 
so we're gonna do is going to stand our
distance<00:00:51.480> right<00:00:51.690> up<00:00:51.780> against<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.170> I'm<00:00:52.829> gonna

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
distance right up against this I'm gonna

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.130 
distance right up against this I'm gonna
fire<00:00:53.219> at<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.370> wall<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.760> couple<00:00:54.239> shots<00:00:54.719> there

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
fire at the wall a couple shots there

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.869 
fire at the wall a couple shots there
you<00:00:55.230> go<00:00:55.440> that's<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.860> spread<00:00:56.100> on<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.370> everyone

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
you go that's a spread on it everyone

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.540 
you go that's a spread on it everyone
moved<00:00:57.059> aside<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.780> for<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.710> normal<00:00:59.190> as<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.460> can

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
moved aside and for it normal as you can

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.619 
moved aside and for it normal as you can
see<00:00:59.609> it's<00:00:59.730> gone<00:00:59.820> back<00:01:00.059> after<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.719> fired<00:01:01.410> a

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
see it's gone back after I fired a

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.090 
see it's gone back after I fired a
couple<00:01:03.629> shots<00:01:03.780> either<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.799> see<00:01:04.979> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
couple shots either you see the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.250 
couple shots either you see the
difference<00:01:05.489> there<00:01:05.729> in<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.659> spread<00:01:06.990> of

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
difference there in the the spread of

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.830 
difference there in the the spread of
the<00:01:07.470> bullets<00:01:07.830> having<00:01:08.520> done<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:09.479> little

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
the bullets having done this little

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.340 
the bullets having done this little
glitch<00:01:10.130> do<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.189> again<00:01:11.430> there<00:01:12.270> we<00:01:12.390> go<00:01:12.420> much

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
glitch do it again there we go much

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.780 
glitch do it again there we go much
tighter<00:01:13.650> spread<00:01:15.470> so<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.009> very

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
tighter spread so that is the very

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.880 
tighter spread so that is the very
useful<00:01:18.180> glitch<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.110> works<00:01:19.259> pretty<00:01:19.530> much<00:01:19.680> with

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
useful glitch it works pretty much with

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.490 
useful glitch it works pretty much with
every<00:01:20.280> gun<00:01:20.520> if<00:01:21.299> we<00:01:21.450> go<00:01:21.570> ahead<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.840> suicide<00:01:22.350> and

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
every gun if we go ahead and suicide and

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.969 
every gun if we go ahead and suicide and
choose<00:01:22.619> another<00:01:22.860> gun<00:01:23.689> you<00:01:24.689> will<00:01:24.869> see<00:01:25.680> this

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
choose another gun you will see this

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.770

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
choose a machine gun it's quite hard on

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.969 
choose a machine gun it's quite hard on
single<00:01:28.619> fire<00:01:28.799> guns<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.970> sniper<00:01:30.240> rifle<00:01:30.979> mm

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
you might be able to do it if you're

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.330 
you might be able to do it if you're
lucky<00:01:33.390> but<00:01:33.689> not<00:01:34.020> every<00:01:34.320> time<00:01:34.530> but<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.070> can't
