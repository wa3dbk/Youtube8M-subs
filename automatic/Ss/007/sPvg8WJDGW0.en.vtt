00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:26.599 
ability to deal with this properly is

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.460 
ability to deal with this properly is
that<00:00:26.659> correct<00:00:27.019> absolutely<00:00:27.230> yeah<00:00:28.039> well<00:00:28.460> now

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
that correct absolutely yeah well now

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.689 
that correct absolutely yeah well now
when<00:00:30.470> you're<00:00:30.589> done<00:00:30.739> with<00:00:30.980> this<00:00:31.130> I<00:00:31.310> mean<00:00:31.550> for

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
when you're done with this I mean for

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:32.950 
when you're done with this I mean for
sure<00:00:31.819> you<00:00:31.909> want<00:00:32.060> to<00:00:32.090> try<00:00:32.239> to<00:00:32.300> use<00:00:32.509> it<00:00:32.660> all<00:00:32.750> up

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
sure you want to try to use it all up

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.779 
sure you want to try to use it all up
but<00:00:33.260> I<00:00:33.320> can<00:00:33.559> feel<00:00:33.859> that<00:00:34.070> it's<00:00:34.280> pretty<00:00:34.609> much

00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:34.789 
but I can feel that it's pretty much

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:36.849 
but I can feel that it's pretty much
going<00:00:34.969> solid<00:00:35.420> inside<00:00:35.719> and<00:00:35.960> separated<00:00:36.469> so<00:00:36.649> I

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:36.859 
going solid inside and separated so I

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:38.139 
going solid inside and separated so I
don't<00:00:37.219> think<00:00:37.399> you're<00:00:37.489> gonna<00:00:37.579> be<00:00:37.789> doing<00:00:38.030> that

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
don't think you're gonna be doing that

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.479 
don't think you're gonna be doing that
and<00:00:38.359> now<00:00:38.960> it's<00:00:39.379> simple<00:00:39.739> as<00:00:39.829> just<00:00:39.980> taking<00:00:40.280> it<00:00:40.370> to

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
and now it's simple as just taking it to

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.400 
and now it's simple as just taking it to
your<00:00:40.579> nearest<00:00:40.730> drop<00:00:41.000> zone<00:00:41.269> and<00:00:41.420> it's<00:00:42.199> really

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
your nearest drop zone and it's really

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.110 
your nearest drop zone and it's really
easy<00:00:42.590> to<00:00:42.680> find<00:00:42.920> as<00:00:43.160> well<00:00:43.280> you<00:00:43.430> can<00:00:43.550> just<00:00:43.730> go<00:00:43.879> on

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
easy to find as well you can just go on

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.119 
easy to find as well you can just go on
to<00:00:44.269> make<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:44.600> drop<00:00:44.809> dot<00:00:45.019> CA<00:00:45.289> if<00:00:45.649> you're<00:00:46.010> not

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
to make the drop dot CA if you're not

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.860 
to make the drop dot CA if you're not
sure<00:00:46.370> where<00:00:46.579> your<00:00:46.699> drop<00:00:46.879> zone<00:00:46.910> is<00:00:47.329> it<00:00:47.600> could<00:00:47.750> be

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
sure where your drop zone is it could be

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.450 
sure where your drop zone is it could be
a<00:00:47.899> retail<00:00:48.230> store<00:00:48.500> it<00:00:48.679> could<00:00:48.829> be<00:00:48.920> a<00:00:48.949> municipal

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
a retail store it could be a municipal

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.639 
a retail store it could be a municipal
facility<00:00:49.489> something<00:00:50.239> like<00:00:50.359> that<00:00:50.539> but<00:00:51.140> they're

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
facility something like that but they're

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:53.110 
facility something like that but they're
gonna<00:00:51.739> make<00:00:51.980> the<00:00:52.100> drop<00:00:52.280> CA<00:00:52.850> and<00:00:53.030> you're

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
gonna make the drop CA and you're

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.000 
gonna make the drop CA and you're
telling<00:00:53.420> earlier<00:00:53.510> I<00:00:53.690> think<00:00:53.929> i<00:00:54.170> plug<00:00:54.710> in<00:00:54.890> my

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.279 
telling earlier I think i plug in my
postal<00:00:55.460> code<00:00:55.609> yeah<00:00:55.910> and<00:00:56.120> boom<00:00:56.600> it<00:00:56.870> pops<00:00:56.899> right

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
postal code yeah and boom it pops right

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.380 
postal code yeah and boom it pops right
up<00:00:57.350> exactly<00:00:57.920> what<00:00:58.309> the<00:00:58.460> nearest<00:00:58.850> ones<00:00:59.089> are<00:00:59.269> and

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
up exactly what the nearest ones are and

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.849 
up exactly what the nearest ones are and
you<00:00:59.480> can<00:00:59.629> just<00:00:59.809> take<00:00:59.960> this<00:01:00.140> the<00:01:00.499> thing<00:01:00.739> is

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
recycled back into paint oil filters

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.929 
recycled back into paint oil filters
they<00:01:24.259> can<00:01:24.409> get<00:01:24.530> recycled<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:25.369> oil<00:01:25.549> can<00:01:25.820> get

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
they can get recycled the oil can get

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:27.520 
they can get recycled the oil can get
recycled<00:01:26.360> back<00:01:26.479> into<00:01:26.509> new<00:01:27.020> oil<00:01:27.229> and<00:01:27.470> the

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
recycled back into new oil and the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.859 
recycled back into new oil and the
filters<00:01:27.860> get<00:01:28.009> broken<00:01:28.310> down<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:28.759> then<00:01:29.210> used<00:01:29.689> in

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
filters get broken down and then used in

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.350 
filters get broken down and then used in
to<00:01:30.020> make<00:01:30.619> a<00:01:30.649> new<00:01:30.860> material<00:01:30.979> so<00:01:31.490> all<00:01:31.820> this<00:01:32.180> stuff

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
to make a new material so all this stuff

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.480 
to make a new material so all this stuff
can<00:01:32.570> be<00:01:32.630> managed<00:01:32.960> properly<00:01:33.200> and<00:01:33.649> it<00:01:34.310> is

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
can be managed properly and it is

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.850 
can be managed properly and it is
hazardous<00:01:35.060> it's<00:01:35.659> special<00:01:36.229> waste<00:01:36.409> as<00:01:36.649> things

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
hazardous it's special waste as things
