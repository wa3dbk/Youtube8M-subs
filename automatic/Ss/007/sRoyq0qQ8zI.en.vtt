00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:36.230

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.210
 an anvil does it and you can do that 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.280

 and then we'll do a pig and 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:06.560
 then this pigs is called 10 spd that 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:13.910
 Of course, it also works with other pugs 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:16.820
 For example , we take a witch 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:33.980
