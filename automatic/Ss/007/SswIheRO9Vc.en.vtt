it<00:01:26.160> is<00:01:26.280> quite<00:01:26.430> dominant<00:01:26.940> still<00:01:27.510> in<00:01:27.660> its<00:01:27.780> own

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
it is quite dominant still in its own

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.480 
it is quite dominant still in its own
right<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.380> if<00:01:28.800> you<00:01:28.890> want<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.130> test<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.460> you

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
right and if you want to test it you

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.160 
right and if you want to test it you
might<00:01:29.700> want<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.910> reconsider<00:01:30.080> because<00:01:31.080> you

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
might want to reconsider because you

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:40.840 
might want to reconsider because you
might<00:01:31.320> get<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.500> little<00:01:31.770> sloppy<00:01:31.950> slap<00:01:32.250> otherwise

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.310 

but<00:01:41.850> for<00:01:42.150> some<00:01:42.300> reason<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.660> switched<00:01:42.930> things<00:01:43.110> up

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
but for some reason I switched things up

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.140 
but for some reason I switched things up
and<00:01:43.440> I<00:01:43.500> think<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:43.920> really<00:01:44.250> plays<00:01:44.400> into<00:01:44.820> last

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
and I think this really plays into last

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.420 
and I think this really plays into last
week<00:01:45.420> with<00:01:45.900> the<00:01:45.930> overreaching<00:01:46.680> both<00:01:47.190> the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
week with the overreaching both the

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.210 
week with the overreaching both the
mental<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.030> physical<00:01:48.240> toll<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.920> week<00:01:49.920> took

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
mental and physical toll that week took

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.800 
mental and physical toll that week took
on<00:01:50.400> me<00:01:50.550> that<00:01:50.760> I<00:01:50.880> just<00:01:51.119> thought<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.420> needed<00:01:51.450> a

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
on me that I just thought I needed a

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.719 
on me that I just thought I needed a
change<00:01:51.840> now<00:01:52.320> normally<00:01:52.830> I<00:01:53.040> wouldn't<00:01:53.520> make<00:01:53.670> that

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
change now normally I wouldn't make that

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.030 
change now normally I wouldn't make that
change<00:01:54.119> unless<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.840> was<00:01:54.990> after<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.650> training

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
change unless it was after a training

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.040 
change unless it was after a training
cycle<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:56.880> for<00:01:57.150> one<00:01:57.270> reason<00:01:57.300> or<00:01:57.630> another

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
cycle and for one reason or another

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.750 
cycle and for one reason or another
I<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.500> wanted<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.830> mix<00:01:58.950> things<00:01:59.160> up<00:01:59.400> and<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.700> do

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
I just wanted to mix things up and I do

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.389 
I just wanted to mix things up and I do
that<00:02:00.090> every<00:02:00.119> six<00:02:00.540> months<00:02:00.840> or<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.110> today<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:02.130> have

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
that every six months or so today I have

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.669 
that every six months or so today I have
no<00:02:02.610> excuse<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.360> despite<00:02:04.050> that<00:02:04.080> fact<00:02:04.229> things

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
no excuse and despite that fact things

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:06.800 
no excuse and despite that fact things
were<00:02:05.039> moving<00:02:05.280> pretty<00:02:05.700> well<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:06.270> little<00:02:06.539> bit<00:02:06.690> of

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
were moving pretty well a little bit of

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.660 
were moving pretty well a little bit of
foreshadowing<00:02:07.020> with<00:02:07.590> we're<00:02:08.190> moving<00:02:08.520> pretty

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
foreshadowing with we're moving pretty

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.969 
foreshadowing with we're moving pretty
well<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:09.570> you're<00:02:09.720> see<00:02:09.869> for<00:02:10.050> 95<00:02:10.440> for<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.679> single

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
well so you're see for 95 for a single

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.100 
well so you're see for 95 for a single
jumped<00:02:11.250> up<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.490> 545<00:02:12.180> this<00:02:12.450> is<00:02:12.600> somewhat<00:02:12.930> close

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
jumped up to 545 this is somewhat close

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.510 
jumped up to 545 this is somewhat close
to<00:02:13.140> what<00:02:13.440> we<00:02:13.530> worked<00:02:13.710> with<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.950> last<00:02:14.100> week<00:02:14.340> for

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
to what we worked with the last week for

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.630 
to what we worked with the last week for
a<00:02:14.580> four<00:02:14.880> by<00:02:15.030> three<00:02:15.200> so<00:02:16.200> we<00:02:16.290> did<00:02:16.440> 557<00:02:17.280> for<00:02:17.460> four

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
a four by three so we did 557 for four

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.760 
a four by three so we did 557 for four
sets<00:02:17.850> of<00:02:17.970> three<00:02:18.210> last<00:02:18.510> week<00:02:18.690> what<00:02:19.050> you<00:02:19.170> saw<00:02:19.380> was

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
sets of three last week what you saw was

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.080 
sets of three last week what you saw was
very<00:02:21.260> very<00:02:22.610> tough<00:02:23.610> on<00:02:23.790> me

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
very very tough on me

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.910 
very very tough on me
and<00:02:24.180> this<00:02:24.660> 545<00:02:25.170> moves<00:02:25.440> pretty<00:02:25.590> slow<00:02:25.890> but

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
and this 545 moves pretty slow but

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.830 
and this 545 moves pretty slow but
despite<00:02:26.310> that<00:02:26.340> I<00:02:26.550> really<00:02:26.910> wanted<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.180> hit<00:02:27.300> 585

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
despite that I really wanted to hit 585

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.600 
despite that I really wanted to hit 585
for<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.080> triple<00:02:28.319> and<00:02:28.590> while<00:02:29.069> I'm<00:02:29.160> setting<00:02:29.490> up

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
for a triple and while I'm setting up

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.520 
for a triple and while I'm setting up
I'm<00:02:29.790> starting<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.240> reconsider<00:02:30.569> my<00:02:30.870> grip<00:02:31.319> just

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
I'm starting to reconsider my grip just

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.110 
I'm starting to reconsider my grip just
because<00:02:31.830> things<00:02:32.040> weren't<00:02:32.310> moving<00:02:32.640> as<00:02:32.730> fast<00:02:32.910> as

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
because things weren't moving as fast as

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.760 
because things weren't moving as fast as
I'd<00:02:33.270> like<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.170> actually<00:02:34.319> have<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.590> little

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
I'd like and I actually have a little

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.890 
I'd like and I actually have a little
bit<00:02:35.010> of<00:02:35.100> confusion<00:02:35.310> here<00:02:35.790> on<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.090> bar<00:02:36.360> because

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
bit of confusion here on the bar because

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.590 
bit of confusion here on the bar because
I<00:02:37.020> get<00:02:37.260> down<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:38.040> get<00:02:38.220> low<00:02:38.490> and<00:02:38.520> I<00:02:39.120> don't<00:02:39.210> really

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
I get down to get low and I don't really

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.680 
I get down to get low and I don't really
know<00:02:39.870> where<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.260> go<00:02:40.580> settle<00:02:41.580> on<00:02:41.760> this<00:02:41.910> grip<00:02:42.210> get

know where to go settle on this grip get

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.440 
know where to go settle on this grip get
set<00:02:43.020> get<00:02:43.530> ready<00:02:43.560> for<00:02:43.920> this<00:02:44.069> pull<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.670> things

because it's funny to me because I know

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.130 
because it's funny to me because I know
this<00:02:50.970> is<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.150> weight<00:02:51.360> that<00:02:51.480> I<00:02:51.600> can<00:02:51.780> do<00:02:51.900> for<00:02:52.110> a

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
this is a weight that I can do for a

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.910 
this is a weight that I can do for a
triple<00:02:52.410> usually<00:02:53.690> without<00:02:54.690> too<00:02:55.470> much<00:02:55.680> effort

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
triple usually without too much effort

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.190 
triple usually without too much effort
effort<00:02:56.520> yes<00:02:57.090> but<00:02:57.300> not<00:02:57.420> too<00:02:57.600> much<00:02:57.750> because<00:02:57.930> I've

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
effort yes but not too much because I've

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
effort yes but not too much because I've
really<00:02:58.410> been<00:02:58.530> progressing<00:02:58.920> well<00:02:59.040> in<00:02:59.160> this

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
really been progressing well in this

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.040 
really been progressing well in this
program<00:02:59.430> however<00:03:00.390> I<00:03:00.420> just<00:03:00.660> take<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:00.840> couple

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
program however I just take a couple

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.990 
program however I just take a couple
steps<00:03:01.200> back<00:03:01.440> put<00:03:01.920> my<00:03:02.040> belt<00:03:02.250> on<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:02.700> decide<00:03:02.970> to

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
steps back put my belt on and decide to

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.800 
steps back put my belt on and decide to
get<00:03:03.180> these<00:03:03.330> poles

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
get these poles

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.110 
get these poles
out<00:03:03.900> of<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.440> way<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:04.980> although<00:03:05.550> these<00:03:05.880> are
