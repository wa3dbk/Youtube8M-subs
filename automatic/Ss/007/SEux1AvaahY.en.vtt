00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 Engineer friends in this video goes 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:09.350
 it's about five really cool photography 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.350
 Tricks let's see if you already know them 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.080
 You already have trick number one 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.880
 a pantyhose over your lens 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.890
 probably not yet pulled though 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.750
 you can with very very cool effects 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.609
 simply achieve take the tights 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.920
 the thin side that where where in the end 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.380
 the feet the legs come in over the 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.530
 Objectively turn and then nice open 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.059
 hides retro potash shoot the horny 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.700
 is the whole thing looks like that 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.219
 a bit sepia moderately through this 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.530
 brown pantyhose so next time 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:48.239
 a model simply say hey tirol 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.129
 Pantyhose trick number 2 is suitable 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.020
 especially when I'm filming I'm fine 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.820
 a year so a little video on 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.020
 uploaded to his youtube channel 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.489
 freelancer 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.309
 in the end, it's easy 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.350
 just take your objectively from the 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.570
 camera is the course and smaller 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.119
 he simply ignores warnings 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.890
 cheeky then press on record and then 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.920
 you can just free that objectively 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.689
 move forward and he goes up 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.220
 down and it gladly they can 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.900
 Do not just sharpen up front 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.210
 behind control how else with the 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.100
 focus ring but could also be from the left 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.250
 to the right and from top to bottom 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.630
 steer and so very very cool bent 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.540
 achieve effects and if it is objective 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.640
 you fritter keep away from the camera 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.939
 then you can be a bit macro 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.450
 with your normal 50mm lens 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.450
 fix 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.090
 with a cigarette box you can 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.220
 Not just kill yourself if you're someone 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.590
 in the family or friends smoking 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.550
 could I have the empty one 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.370
 remove the cigarette box and the 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.940
 harvest on your flash in the camera run 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.380
 stick 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.650
 you can be very cool with that 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.300
 throw diffuse light because they are a small 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.830
 art softbox now sees a 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.350
 But a little runs out of it but that satisfies 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.410
 purpose here paint compare a picture without 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.260
 flash a picture with the normal 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.960
 internal flash of the camera and here one 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.090
 picture with the cigarette box makes 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.550
 already make a difference or pay attention 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.990
 that you have the cigarette boxes 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.330
 so a little bit rips you apart 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.800
 a lot of white space has reflected the 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.200
 that means the lightning has to be in the end 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.420
 flash up and then from the 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.920
 white surface of the cigarette box 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.920
 to be reflected forward 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.480
 you certainly do not know the problem that 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.060
 The sky is too bright at 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.890
 Landscapes below is everything 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.230
 tiptopp beautiful long - exposure of the 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.390
 sky is burning no more details 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.860
 what can you do either ? 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.670
 Use gradient filter which is but 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.370
 quite expensive 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.400
 But there is also a photography trick 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.220
 and his hand just use the 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:52.010
 half of the exposure time before hand 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.290
 keep the objectively and half before that 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.870
 So as far as the sky goes in 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.360
 picture up to the horizon means best 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.180
 at 30 seconds exposure time 15 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.640
 seconds, the hand halfway objective has 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.150
 Do not you think that's really the case here 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:11.480
 a photo without the hand variant and here 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.320
 a photo by hand variant crass 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.320
 difference or 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.050
 and the last drink another 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.990
 Cigarette box and this cellophane 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.340
 bag from below it would be off 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.410
 alternatively another 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.770
 Transparent film is important only 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.210
 that he is half open landis objective 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.040
 Hold and then for example if you 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.350
 You can photograph portraits with it 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.030
 nice over radiation effects out 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.340
 You actually get them in photoshop 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.200
 with his course would do something 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.950
 It's all possible with such a small one 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.670
 easy bag kept clean and looks very 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.250
 cool out 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.650
 here again a picture without and here one 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.210
 picture with a bag pretty cool or 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.990
 he can get the cigarette box yes 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.990
 but use it to grow 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.430
 that were 5 photography tricks i hope 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.140
