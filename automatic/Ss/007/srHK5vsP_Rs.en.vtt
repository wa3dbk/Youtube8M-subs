00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 is it really the new coach of the 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.790
 club the team another 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.309
 face has given another 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.889
 has given Loki schmidt was yes 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.440
 also in cologne in the talk before peter 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.330
 stÃ¶ger in the raffle so came the new 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.049
 york and white I think so too 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.420
 coach out 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.180
 So now in Salzburg me quite good 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.650
 played role but had success so 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.760
 and he has had three months now 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.730
 to prepare the customer for the team 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.029
 get to the point with one 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.590
 very aggressive offensive style and that 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.969
 looks good so that leverkusen 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.460
 a good role this could gamble 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.739
 this offensive style makes the difference 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.920
 the team from last year is going on 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.610
 on it as aggressive is said okay bvb 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.200
 is in it is that the kind of play with 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.480
 the leverkusen and also rogers 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.649
 want to succeed and for the 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.489
 leverkusen wants to stand 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.750
 yes I think that was yesterday 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.460
 obviously and I did that was yes 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.440
 already said that after nine 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.760
 seconds with 1 0 in the lead goes from it 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.460
 naturally never run out 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.079
 but the way bayer in the way 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.270
 follow-up time in the first half 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.460
 has done exactly as I believe 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.580
 that was clearer pointer like 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.020
 It should look like this season 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.090
 i believe that you are with the trainer 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.159
 really made something very important 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.590
 have found an important building block 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.600
 i still have it against salzburg 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.159
 Winter hit as the Bavarians back then 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.150
 has beaten in the preparation 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.860
 I talked to him briefly 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.780
 i can found his ideas his 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.729
 philosophy very interesting and very 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.409
 good with but a bit skeptical 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.939
 because I do not know if the defensive of 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.799
 leverkusen is really as stable as 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.689
 she was yesterday I think it was 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.450
 Yesterday also because so dortmund 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.700
 just offensively not very good 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.470
 not everything played there 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.570
 but has is very exciting 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.040
 right defender has the young kroate 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.479
 I think he played very well 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.640
 played for me so that was very 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.470
 snappy very aggressive I believe this 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.930
 philosophy or that too now 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.030
 leverkusen does not say okay we want 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.770
 the annoy all but us 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.970
 make our style into the goal and that 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.470
 aim by that for me ever notice 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.030
 I think the transfer of knowledge has 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.979
 leverkusen in fact with the trainer 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.009
 When you made Salzburg last year 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.810
 seen you have seen them very much 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.039
 have defended high and aggressive the 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.200
 all the year I believe 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.750
 the europe league once went to amsterdam 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.120
 won away 40 or 41 and so away 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.069
 have extra apart so so 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.840
 that is clearly his handwriting 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.359
 did it in the short time 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.939
 that they keep coming back if you are in the 94th 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:26.069
 The gate once again takes the Arabi in full 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:27.170
 sprint was about to be under pressure again 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.129
 putting wins the ball 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.870
 that is the goal that you have in 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.519
 Salzburg made exactly that with 56 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.439
 Immediately go forward always 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.629
 again that's the philosophy I think 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:38.790
 so it came to me over so he has 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.200
 worked last year and if that's it 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.849
 Of course it is possible to persevere 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.980
 very run-intensive game but have that 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.470
 They also manage in Salzburg then 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.599
 will leverkusen for a few more 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.919
 Surprises can worry monthly 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.919
 currently would be football
