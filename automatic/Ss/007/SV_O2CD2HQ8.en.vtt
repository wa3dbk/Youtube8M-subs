00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.670
 welcome again they have offered 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.529
 products by hydro point in this 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.200
 we will present the guide for the 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.870
 crop in slap the procedure for 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.630
 use is the easy easy first 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:22.919
 we will mark with a pen at a distance 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:24.960
 of 17.6 39.2 60.8 and 82.4 centimeters to 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:27.239
 Then we will continue to open 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.779
 our compass to 4 centimeters 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:33.090
 approximately we will place the compass in 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.980
 our brand and we will continue to mark 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.320
 the circumference 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.630
 it is recommended that these marks be 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.680
 find well centered since this 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.900
 way our plant will grow right 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.080
 the coconut fiber slap are 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:51.890
 made from 20% short fiber and 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.739
 80% coconut powder which is sifted 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.120
 Sterilized wash is treated and 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.559
 compressed in this way decreases 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.360
 radically the shipping costs of this 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.940
 same 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:09.220
 We will do this step in the 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.220
 four brands of our esla 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.259
 since you have marked the four circles 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.740
 We will continue to cut with scissors 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.570
 following very well the circumference of 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.310
 same way this step we are going to 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.659
 repeat in the four circles that 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.659
 we mark the side 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.350
 the cover of the slap is polyethylene 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.230
 built white on the outside and black on 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.630
 inside this cover is characterized by 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.810
 its thermal properties and decreases the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.090
 presence of niko vargas the ability to 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.180
 water care will allow us 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.130
 that the irrigation is more accurate also the 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.460
 variation and availability of 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.950
 nutrients will be much better 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.979
 then we will place our lab 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.500
 in a channel soon we will 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.979
 saturate with approximately 15 liters of 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.259
 water we recommend that you leave it from 1 to 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.420
 2 days for the most particles 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.830
 small is decompressed and there is a 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.830
 hydration throughout the slam 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.959
 after 48 hours have passed 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.720
 hydrated the lab we continue to perform 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.470
 the cuts for draining first with 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.660
 a marker 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.900
 we will make an inverted t in the part 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.069
 top later with a cutter we will cut 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.069
 according to the brand 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.710
 after it has been drained 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.080
 we will continue to transplant 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.030
 We will do the transplant with 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.060
 seedlings that have the fourth leaf 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.640
 true first we will make a hole 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.290
 with his hand in the gives giving a 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.120
 enough space for our 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.120
 seedling between perfectly 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.630
 then we are going to extract our seedling 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.240
 determiner with the help of an abbot the 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:08.130
 language remember we have to have 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.130
 careful not to hurt the root much 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.730
 we will place our seedling in the 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.740
 first hole of the slap with the same 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.830
 slap fill the empty spaces 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.560
 taking care not to compress much as 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.320
 we can damage the root is recommended 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:36.090
 Place a seedling per hole to 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.090
 that there is a good growth of the same 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.730
 remember that he is the one for the germinated 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.459
 and the seeds are in our 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.880
