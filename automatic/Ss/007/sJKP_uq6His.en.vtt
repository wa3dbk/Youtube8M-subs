I've<00:00:02.399> repeated<00:00:02.879> often<00:00:03.090> the<00:00:03.570> theory<00:00:03.929> being

our shredding ability but to highlight

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.900 
our shredding ability but to highlight
how<00:00:49.079> much<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.500> player<00:00:49.739> influences<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.640> sound

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
how much the player influences the sound

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.790 
how much the player influences the sound
eventually<00:00:51.690> I'd<00:00:51.870> like<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.230> try<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.559> test

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
eventually I'd like to try this test

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.610 
eventually I'd like to try this test

with bass guitar as well however finding
for<00:00:55.890> basis<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.550> can<00:00:56.699> learn<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.969> simple<00:00:57.360> riff

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
for basis that can learn a simple riff

for basis that can learn a simple riff
and<00:00:57.899> show<00:00:58.289> up<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.620> studio<00:00:58.949> on<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.190> same

day might be somewhat difficult perhaps
I'd<00:01:02.219> have<00:01:02.370> better<00:01:02.579> luck<00:01:02.789> finding<00:01:03.030> velocity<00:01:03.780> of

for<00:01:04.830> best<00:01:05.010> results<00:01:05.519> I'd<00:01:05.670> recommend<00:01:06.119> listening

for best results I'd recommend listening

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.780 
for best results I'd recommend listening
to<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.930> experiment<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:07.619> some<00:01:08.070> decent<00:01:08.250> studio

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
to this experiment on some decent studio

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.510 
to this experiment on some decent studio
monitors<00:01:09.320> laptop<00:01:10.320> speakers<00:01:10.740> ain't<00:01:11.010> gonna<00:01:11.310> cut

it<00:01:11.549> yet<00:01:11.790> cheap<00:01:12.060> bastards

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.199 

so<00:02:21.930> there<00:02:22.170> you<00:02:22.290> have<00:02:22.319> it<00:02:22.769> I<00:02:22.799> found<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.849> results

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
so there you have it I found the results

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.020 
so there you have it I found the results
to<00:02:24.299> be<00:02:24.420> pretty<00:02:24.659> surprising<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.459> didn't<00:02:26.459> get<00:02:26.790> the

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
to be pretty surprising I didn't get the

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.420 
to be pretty surprising I didn't get the
massive<00:02:27.480> tonal<00:02:27.840> shift<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.260> was<00:02:28.409> expecting<00:02:28.920> but

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
massive tonal shift I was expecting but

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.880 
massive tonal shift I was expecting but
I<00:02:29.459> got<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.730> far<00:02:30.150> more<00:02:30.420> subtle<00:02:30.959> variation<00:02:31.709> I

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
I got a far more subtle variation I

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.339 
I got a far more subtle variation I
found<00:02:32.849> the<00:02:32.940> differences<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.420> be<00:02:33.569> in<00:02:33.870> clarity

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
found the differences to be in clarity

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.979 
found the differences to be in clarity
and<00:02:34.560> articulation<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.540> that's<00:02:36.540> what<00:02:36.780> makes

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
and articulation and that's what makes

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.259 
and articulation and that's what makes
for<00:02:37.079> a<00:02:37.260> good<00:02:37.500> scientific<00:02:37.950> experiment<00:02:38.730> when

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
for a good scientific experiment when

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.640 
for a good scientific experiment when
you<00:02:39.390> don't<00:02:39.690> get<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.989> results<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:40.530> were

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
you don't get the results you were

you don't get the results you were
