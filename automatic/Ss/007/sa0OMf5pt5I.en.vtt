00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
five different stages of the puzzle

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.860 
five different stages of the puzzle
Alpha<00:02:14.140> Beta<00:02:14.380> Gamma<00:02:14.740> Delta<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.400> epsilon<00:02:15.870> and

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
Alpha Beta Gamma Delta and epsilon and

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.440 
Alpha Beta Gamma Delta and epsilon and
then<00:02:17.110> also<00:02:17.380> each<00:02:17.890> of<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.250> puzzle<00:02:18.610> mode<00:02:18.760> allows

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
get one of those metals so it says right

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.070 
get one of those metals so it says right
here<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:42.100> best<00:02:42.370> time<00:02:42.610> is<00:02:42.820> 72<00:02:43.300> my<00:02:43.540> best<00:02:43.810> time<00:02:44.020> in

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080
