example<00:00:34.170> we<00:00:34.260> could<00:00:34.379> look<00:00:34.440> at<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.679> guitarist

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
example we could look at a guitarist

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.650 
example we could look at a guitarist
that's<00:00:35.340> into<00:00:35.579> metal<00:00:35.940> let's<00:00:36.210> say<00:00:36.420> they're<00:00:36.629> a

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
that's into metal let's say they're a

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.779 
that's into metal let's say they're a
teenage<00:00:37.079> guitarist<00:00:37.739> they're<00:00:37.949> 13<00:00:38.339> years<00:00:38.579> old

00:00:38.779 --> 00:00:38.789 
teenage guitarist they're 13 years old

teenage guitarist they're 13 years old
now<00:00:39.059> at<00:00:39.539> this<00:00:39.690> age<00:00:39.870> you're<00:00:40.199> probably<00:00:40.440> not

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
now at this age you're probably not

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.709 
now at this age you're probably not
going<00:00:40.859> to<00:00:40.920> be<00:00:41.010> as<00:00:41.129> open-minded<00:00:41.489> as<00:00:42.030> say<00:00:42.539> when

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
going to be as open-minded as say when

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.599 
going to be as open-minded as say when
you're<00:00:42.870> thirty<00:00:43.079> years<00:00:43.320> old<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.829> if<00:00:44.429> you're

00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:44.609 
you're thirty years old so if you're

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:46.160 
you're thirty years old so if you're
going<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.999> a<00:00:45.120> teacher<00:00:45.420> that's<00:00:45.660> teaching<00:00:45.780> you

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170

jazz<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.710> classical<00:00:46.820> it's<00:00:47.820> unlikely<00:00:48.629> that

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
jazz and classical it's unlikely that

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.869 
jazz and classical it's unlikely that
you're<00:00:48.989> going<00:00:49.019> to<00:00:49.379> enjoy<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.429> if<00:00:50.609> you

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
you're going to enjoy that if you

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.939 
you're going to enjoy that if you
dedicate<00:00:51.359> yourself<00:00:52.019> to<00:00:52.109> the<00:00:52.320> styles<00:00:52.769> that<00:00:52.829> you

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
dedicate yourself to the styles that you

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.130

love you're going to get technically

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.229 
love you're going to get technically
good<00:00:55.320> at<00:00:55.499> those<00:00:55.649> styles<00:00:56.159> anyway<00:00:56.519> now<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:56.999> lot<00:00:57.210> of

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
good at those styles anyway now a lot of

the<00:00:57.390> Styles<00:00:57.809> tend<00:00:58.019> to<00:00:58.140> crossover<00:00:58.589> as<00:00:58.890> far<00:00:59.100> as

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
the Styles tend to crossover as far as

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.579 
the Styles tend to crossover as far as
technique<00:00:59.640> goes<00:00:59.670> so<00:01:00.239> jazz<00:01:01.019> and<00:01:01.230> metal<00:01:01.499> are

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
technique goes so jazz and metal are

technique goes so jazz and metal are
actually<00:01:01.859> quite<00:01:02.069> similar<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.640> some<00:01:02.819> respects

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
actually quite similar in some respects

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.090 
actually quite similar in some respects
there's<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.569> definite<00:01:04.019> emphasis<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:04.589> technique

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
there's a definite emphasis on technique

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.880 
there's a definite emphasis on technique
and<00:01:05.309> technical<00:01:05.759> ability<00:01:06.180> speed<00:01:07.140> picking<00:01:07.439> you

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890

you get to a certain point in your life
as<00:01:13.079> a<00:01:13.110> guitarist<00:01:13.530> then<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.369> know<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
as a guitarist then you know the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.969 
as a guitarist then you know the
open-mindedness<00:01:15.750> kind<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.439> naturally<00:01:16.860> just

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
open-mindedness kind of naturally just

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.380 
open-mindedness kind of naturally just
happens<00:01:17.430> now<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.790> other<00:01:18.000> thing<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.149> don't

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
happens now the other thing you don't

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.090 
happens now the other thing you don't
want<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.689> do<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.079> practice<00:01:19.380> stuff<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.040> you

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
want to do is practice stuff that you

want to do is practice stuff that you
can<00:01:20.219> already<00:01:20.430> play<00:01:20.790> with<00:01:21.630> your<00:01:21.750> eyes<00:01:21.869> closed

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
can already play with your eyes closed

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.940 
can already play with your eyes closed
standing<00:01:22.979> up<00:01:23.630> doing<00:01:24.630> handstands<00:01:25.560> whatever

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
standing up doing handstands whatever

standing up doing handstands whatever
you<00:01:26.189> know<00:01:26.930> so<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:27.990> basically<00:01:28.200> want<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.590> focus

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
you know so you basically want to focus

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
very well for me I'm not very good at

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.749 
very well for me I'm not very good at
down<00:01:33.810> picking<00:01:34.200> at<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.409> certain<00:01:34.860> speed<00:01:35.219> so<00:01:35.250> I

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
down picking at a certain speed so I

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.080 
down picking at a certain speed so I
find<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.990> know<00:01:37.140> focusing<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:38.030> metallica<00:01:39.030> or

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
excellent example it's a very good down

picking<00:01:45.180> work<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.869> use<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.109> because<00:01:46.700> I'm

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
picking work and I use that because I'm

picking work and I use that because I'm
not<00:01:47.880> able<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.180> do<00:01:48.359> that<00:01:48.479> with<00:01:48.630> down<00:01:48.840> picking<00:01:49.259> at

not able to do that with down picking at

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:51.230 
not able to do that with down picking at
the<00:01:50.039> full<00:01:50.250> speed<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.670> can<00:01:50.880> do<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.149> with

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
the full speed I can do it with

alternate<00:01:51.780> picking<00:01:51.960> but<00:01:52.560> my<00:01:52.710> down<00:01:52.920> picking<00:01:53.310> is

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
alternate picking but my down picking is

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.580 
alternate picking but my down picking is
not<00:01:53.549> as<00:01:53.670> good<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.180> for<00:01:54.420> me<00:01:54.600> that's<00:01:55.079> what<00:01:55.289> I<00:01:55.320> need

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
not as good so for me that's what I need

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
to improve so be careful about noodling

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
you do that another helpful tip would be

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.940 
you do that another helpful tip would be
to<00:02:22.239> set<00:02:22.599> some<00:02:22.780> goals<00:02:22.959> ice<00:02:23.379> to<00:02:23.590> do<00:02:23.650> that<00:02:23.799> in<00:02:23.890> the

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
to set some goals ice to do that in the

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.649 
to set some goals ice to do that in the
early<00:02:24.189> days<00:02:24.400> so<00:02:24.730> what<00:02:24.970> I<00:02:25.000> would<00:02:25.209> actually<00:02:25.329> do

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
early days so what I would actually do

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.420 
early days so what I would actually do
is<00:02:25.780> document<00:02:25.959> what<00:02:26.409> I<00:02:26.439> did<00:02:26.709> I<00:02:26.950> got<00:02:27.159> that<00:02:27.280> idea

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
is document what I did I got that idea

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.569 
is document what I did I got that idea
from<00:02:27.640> Steve<00:02:28.090> by<00:02:28.360> who<00:02:29.110> would<00:02:29.260> do<00:02:29.470> that

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
from Steve by who would do that

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.890 
from Steve by who would do that
ridiculous<00:02:30.610> ten<00:02:30.819> hour<00:02:30.970> workout<00:02:31.450> that<00:02:31.629> he<00:02:31.690> did

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
ridiculous ten hour workout that he did

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.509 
ridiculous ten hour workout that he did
he<00:02:32.200> would<00:02:32.379> actually<00:02:32.920> write<00:02:33.099> down<00:02:33.129> everything

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
he would actually write down everything

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.280 
he would actually write down everything
he<00:02:33.670> did<00:02:33.909> the<00:02:34.239> tempos<00:02:34.629> that<00:02:34.810> he<00:02:34.870> was<00:02:34.989> able<00:02:35.140> to

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
he did the tempos that he was able to

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.259 
he did the tempos that he was able to
achieve<00:02:35.440> on<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:35.980> exercises<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:36.819> so<00:02:37.000> forth

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
achieve on the exercises and so forth

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.380 
achieve on the exercises and so forth
and<00:02:37.510> then<00:02:38.230> what<00:02:39.159> I<00:02:39.190> added<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:39.760> that<00:02:39.909> was<00:02:40.150> just

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
and then what I added to that was just

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.180 
and then what I added to that was just
some<00:02:40.540> thoughts<00:02:40.810> on<00:02:41.170> where<00:02:41.409> I<00:02:41.440> was<00:02:41.709> going<00:02:42.069> at

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
some thoughts on where I was going at

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.830 
some thoughts on where I was going at
the<00:02:42.280> time<00:02:42.489> so<00:02:42.849> you<00:02:43.150> know<00:02:43.329> you<00:02:43.390> can<00:02:43.569> put<00:02:43.689> those

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
the time so you know you can put those

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.330 
the time so you know you can put those
in<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.109> back<00:02:44.290> of<00:02:44.409> the<00:02:44.470> book<00:02:44.620> perhaps<00:02:44.980> and

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
in the back of the book perhaps and

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.069 
in the back of the book perhaps and
you'll<00:02:45.819> find<00:02:46.090> there<00:02:46.299> that<00:02:46.329> as<00:02:46.569> you<00:02:46.810> practice

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
you'll find there that as you practice

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.630 
you'll find there that as you practice
and<00:02:47.349> progress<00:02:47.680> some<00:02:47.950> of<00:02:48.040> those<00:02:48.099> goals<00:02:48.430> may

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
and progress some of those goals may

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.399 
and progress some of those goals may
change<00:02:49.030> so<00:02:49.299> it's<00:02:49.450> important<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:49.900> update<00:02:50.079> them

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:50.409 
change so it's important to update them

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:52.559 
change so it's important to update them
on<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:50.560> regular<00:02:50.709> basis<00:02:51.370> but<00:02:51.579> by<00:02:52.150> setting<00:02:52.540> goals

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
on a regular basis but by setting goals

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.390 
on a regular basis but by setting goals
at<00:02:52.989> least<00:02:53.170> you've<00:02:53.319> got<00:02:53.470> a<00:02:53.500> bit<00:02:54.010> of<00:02:54.129> an<00:02:54.220> idea

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
at least you've got a bit of an idea

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.399 
at least you've got a bit of an idea
about<00:02:54.700> where<00:02:55.180> you're<00:02:55.329> going<00:02:55.569> and<00:02:55.959> you're<00:02:56.379> not

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:56.409 
about where you're going and you're not

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.379 
about where you're going and you're not
going<00:02:56.590> to<00:02:56.650> be<00:02:56.769> sort<00:02:56.980> of<00:02:57.040> lost<00:02:57.250> at<00:02:57.430> sea<00:02:57.700> as

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:58.389 
going to be sort of lost at sea as

00:02:58.389 --> 00:02:59.940 
going to be sort of lost at sea as
you're<00:02:58.569> making<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:58.989> journey<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.379> getting

you're making the journey to getting

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.949 
you're making the journey to getting

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.580 
decided to throw me in the deep end
there<00:03:22.299> and<00:03:22.449> although<00:03:22.720> I<00:03:22.840> didn't<00:03:23.199> do<00:03:23.290> a<00:03:23.319> lot<00:03:23.560> of

you know at a certain point in the in

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.530 
you know at a certain point in the in
the<00:04:28.920> process<00:04:29.400> so<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:30.000> last<00:04:30.180> thing<00:04:30.390> I'd

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
the process so the last thing I'd

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.450 
the process so the last thing I'd
recommend<00:04:31.020> is<00:04:31.140> practicing<00:04:31.710> regularly<00:04:31.920> our

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
recommend is practicing regularly our

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.670 
recommend is practicing regularly our
brains<00:04:32.820> and<00:04:33.090> bodies<00:04:33.150> actually<00:04:33.960> really<00:04:34.290> enjoy

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
brains and bodies actually really enjoy

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.280 
brains and bodies actually really enjoy
habit<00:04:35.280> or<00:04:35.490> routine<00:04:35.720> so<00:04:36.720> you're<00:04:36.870> going<00:04:37.080> to<00:04:37.140> get

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
habit or routine so you're going to get

habit or routine so you're going to get
the<00:04:37.410> best<00:04:37.620> result<00:04:38.100> by<00:04:38.310> doing<00:04:38.730> the<00:04:39.150> same<00:04:39.450> amount

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
the best result by doing the same amount

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.050 
the best result by doing the same amount
of<00:04:39.870> practice<00:04:40.320> generally<00:04:40.920> at<00:04:41.400> the<00:04:41.460> same<00:04:41.790> time

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
of practice generally at the same time

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.030 
of practice generally at the same time
every<00:04:42.390> day<00:04:42.420> and<00:04:42.900> then<00:04:43.440> you<00:04:43.620> know<00:04:43.740> when<00:04:43.950> you

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
every day and then you know when you

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.590 
every day and then you know when you
need<00:04:44.160> to<00:04:44.340> increase<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:44.730> amount<00:04:44.940> of<00:04:45.210> practice

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
need to increase the amount of practice

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.780 
need to increase the amount of practice
then<00:04:45.780> you<00:04:45.810> do<00:04:46.020> that<00:04:46.230> and<00:04:46.410> continue<00:04:46.920> that<00:04:47.100> into

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
then you do that and continue that into

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.310 
then you do that and continue that into
a<00:04:48.060> regimented<00:04:49.050> regular<00:04:50.360> occurance<00:04:51.360> so<00:04:52.140> on<00:04:52.230> the

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
a regimented regular occurance so on the

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.190 
a regimented regular occurance so on the
flipside<00:04:52.680> to<00:04:52.740> that<00:04:52.890> I'd<00:04:53.160> recommend<00:04:53.600> not<00:04:54.600> going

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
flipside to that I'd recommend not going

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.680 
flipside to that I'd recommend not going
to<00:04:55.320> extremes<00:04:55.890> and<00:04:56.250> practicing<00:04:57.060> for<00:04:57.240> insane

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
to extremes and practicing for insane

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.380 
to extremes and practicing for insane
amounts<00:04:58.110> every<00:04:58.290> day<00:04:58.620> because<00:04:59.040> your<00:04:59.790> muscles

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
amounts every day because your muscles

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.270 
amounts every day because your muscles
aren't<00:05:00.570> going<00:05:00.750> to<00:05:00.810> like<00:05:00.990> that<00:05:01.020> at<00:05:01.440> all<00:05:01.770> and<00:05:02.070> the

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
aren't going to like that at all and the

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.860 
aren't going to like that at all and the
other<00:05:02.400> thing<00:05:02.610> is<00:05:02.790> it<00:05:03.390> gets<00:05:03.600> to<00:05:03.750> a<00:05:03.780> certain

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
other thing is it gets to a certain

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.810 
other thing is it gets to a certain
point<00:05:04.170> where<00:05:04.560> the<00:05:04.830> muscles<00:05:05.190> will<00:05:05.310> just<00:05:05.490> become

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
point where the muscles will just become

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.210 
point where the muscles will just become
fatigued<00:05:06.240> anyway<00:05:06.720> so<00:05:06.780> any<00:05:07.140> amount<00:05:07.620> of<00:05:07.920> extra

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
fatigued anyway so any amount of extra

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.530 
fatigued anyway so any amount of extra
practice<00:05:08.550> that<00:05:08.670> you<00:05:08.730> do<00:05:08.880> is<00:05:08.970> actually<00:05:09.150> doing

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
practice that you do is actually doing

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.890 
practice that you do is actually doing
little<00:05:10.170> to<00:05:10.290> no<00:05:10.530> good<00:05:10.770> anyway<00:05:11.070> and<00:05:11.480> in<00:05:12.480> relation

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
little to no good anyway and in relation

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.510 
little to no good anyway and in relation
to<00:05:12.930> that<00:05:13.140> point<00:05:13.410> there<00:05:13.950> have<00:05:14.070> been<00:05:14.220> a<00:05:14.280> couple

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
to that point there have been a couple

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.950 
to that point there have been a couple
of<00:05:14.640> times<00:05:14.850> in<00:05:15.030> my<00:05:15.090> life<00:05:15.330> where<00:05:15.510> I've<00:05:15.600> given<00:05:15.900> the

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
of times in my life where I've given the

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.260 
of times in my life where I've given the
guitar<00:05:16.260> away<00:05:16.530> for<00:05:16.740> a<00:05:16.800> period<00:05:17.010> the<00:05:17.850> maximum

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
guitar away for a period the maximum

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.420 
guitar away for a period the maximum
being<00:05:18.450> about<00:05:18.720> six<00:05:19.020> months<00:05:19.410> when<00:05:19.680> I<00:05:19.710> was<00:05:19.920> about

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
being about six months when I was about

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.850 
being about six months when I was about
sixteen<00:05:20.970> or<00:05:21.000> something<00:05:21.450> and<00:05:21.900> I<00:05:22.440> was<00:05:22.530> just<00:05:22.680> more

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
sixteen or something and I was just more

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.260 
sixteen or something and I was just more
interested<00:05:23.190> in<00:05:23.250> going<00:05:23.520> out<00:05:23.610> with<00:05:23.670> friends<00:05:24.150> and

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
interested in going out with friends and

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.680 
interested in going out with friends and
having<00:05:24.630> a<00:05:24.720> good<00:05:24.840> time<00:05:25.050> so<00:05:25.500> at<00:05:26.280> that<00:05:26.520> point<00:05:26.820> I

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
having a good time so at that point I

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.750 
having a good time so at that point I
just<00:05:27.870> forgot<00:05:28.290> about<00:05:28.320> it<00:05:28.560> and<00:05:28.830> when<00:05:29.550> I<00:05:29.580> was

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
just forgot about it and when I was

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:31.340 
just forgot about it and when I was
ready<00:05:29.940> to<00:05:30.090> come<00:05:30.240> back<00:05:30.300> you<00:05:30.810> know<00:05:30.840> the<00:05:31.050> desire

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
ready to come back you know the desire

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.100 
ready to come back you know the desire
came<00:05:31.650> back<00:05:31.830> to<00:05:31.950> play<00:05:32.160> again<00:05:32.190> and<00:05:33.110> weirdly

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
came back to play again and weirdly

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.810 
came back to play again and weirdly
enough<00:05:34.290> I<00:05:34.500> was<00:05:34.650> playing<00:05:34.980> a<00:05:35.100> lot<00:05:35.250> quicker<00:05:35.490> and<00:05:35.760> a

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
enough I was playing a lot quicker and a

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.850 
enough I was playing a lot quicker and a
lot<00:05:35.940> more<00:05:36.000> precisely<00:05:36.570> everything<00:05:37.560> was<00:05:37.710> just

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
lot more precisely everything was just

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.410 
lot more precisely everything was just
really<00:05:38.040> falling<00:05:38.460> into<00:05:38.610> place<00:05:38.730> I<00:05:39.000> was<00:05:39.150> doing<00:05:39.360> a

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:39.420 
really falling into place I was doing a

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.120 
really falling into place I was doing a
lot<00:05:39.570> of<00:05:39.630> practice<00:05:40.050> before<00:05:40.410> then<00:05:40.650> anyways

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
lot of practice before then anyways

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.550 
lot of practice before then anyways
after<00:05:41.670> that<00:05:42.000> break<00:05:42.300> for<00:05:42.870> some<00:05:43.080> reason

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
after that break for some reason

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.650 
after that break for some reason
everything<00:05:44.460> just<00:05:44.580> really<00:05:44.910> absorbed<00:05:45.390> into<00:05:45.570> my

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
everything just really absorbed into my

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.410 
everything just really absorbed into my
muscles<00:05:46.200> and<00:05:46.410> I<00:05:46.590> guess<00:05:47.000> through<00:05:48.000> that<00:05:48.180> process

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:48.420 
muscles and I guess through that process

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.080 
muscles and I guess through that process
of<00:05:48.870> giving<00:05:49.260> it<00:05:49.380> away<00:05:49.470> my<00:05:49.950> body<00:05:50.490> had<00:05:50.760> a<00:05:50.790> chance

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
of giving it away my body had a chance

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.730 
of giving it away my body had a chance
to<00:05:51.270> recuperate<00:05:51.690> and<00:05:51.930> really<00:05:52.170> incorporate

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
to recuperate and really incorporate

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.190 
to recuperate and really incorporate
what<00:05:52.890> I've<00:05:53.010> been<00:05:53.190> doing<00:05:53.690> into<00:05:54.690> its<00:05:54.840> muscle

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.200 
what I've been doing into its muscle

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.320 
what I've been doing into its muscle
memory<00:05:55.560> and<00:05:55.590> lo<00:05:56.220> and<00:05:56.340> behold<00:05:56.460> I<00:05:56.790> got<00:05:56.970> a<00:05:57.030> lot

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
memory and lo and behold I got a lot

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.820 
memory and lo and behold I got a lot
better<00:05:57.360> without<00:05:57.870> even<00:05:58.290> actually<00:05:58.560> doing

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
better without even actually doing

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.320 
better without even actually doing
anything<00:05:59.160> so<00:05:59.370> there<00:05:59.550> is<00:05:59.640> a<00:05:59.670> good<00:05:59.850> argument<00:06:00.030> for

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
anything so there is a good argument for

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.850 
anything so there is a good argument for
taking<00:06:00.750> a<00:06:00.810> break<00:06:00.840> every<00:06:01.320> now<00:06:01.440> and<00:06:01.560> again<00:06:01.590> as

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
taking a break every now and again as

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.370 
taking a break every now and again as
well<00:06:02.100> and<00:06:02.370> just<00:06:03.270> getting<00:06:03.540> some<00:06:03.810> balance<00:06:04.170> there

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
well and just getting some balance there

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.840 
well and just getting some balance there
you<00:06:04.500> know<00:06:04.620> it's<00:06:04.770> like<00:06:04.980> anything<00:06:05.250> in<00:06:05.490> life<00:06:05.520> if

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
you know it's like anything in life if

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.610 
you know it's like anything in life if
you<00:06:05.910> do<00:06:06.090> too<00:06:06.270> much<00:06:06.450> of<00:06:06.510> it<00:06:06.780> it's<00:06:07.380> probably

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
you do too much of it it's probably

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.430 
you do too much of it it's probably
going<00:06:08.010> to<00:06:08.070> mess<00:06:08.220> you<00:06:08.370> up
