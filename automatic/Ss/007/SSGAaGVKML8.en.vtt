 it's really a good test and if it's not accurate 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.230
 so why not be able to find there bigger surprise 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.870
 for me, please respect 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.870

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.380
 the series the words 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.660

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.490
 the high degree 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.840
 for the eight students of the troupe under a willow in which city but the 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.310
 climate is more for moods 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.340
 this pass in France but leclerc 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.340
 as usual you always have to be ready to dare 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.890
 it's ecstasy 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.830
 his asylum application to the professionals 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.610

 little video under andoid not complete 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.380
 but the simple game summed up the phenomenon went 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.450

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.949
 these unemployed for a lack of marine reproach 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:18.239
 mambÃ© and its surroundings of 5 minutes the explanation does not really count 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:21.909
 we also see the trails 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.909
 I think the best paid 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.549
 beefy 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.909

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.879
 so go take a walk but he can grow 

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:40.179
 we did it more or less 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:41.319
 exit 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.499

 marc the classic shot 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.379
 it's the case 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:23.379

 per person 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.319
 then we see the dirt

 this site which is necessarily 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.859
 for my part 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.859
 when good thoughts and their fabulous hands 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.379
 a whole series of neighboring countries 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:33.379
 they can 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:37.349
 speed 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.860
 more than justified 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.490
 we knew each other's time 

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:52.189
 it works very well here 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:54.699
 carson palmer

 in proportion to bring back career 

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:59.599
 but it will happen to the thumb 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.789
 apocalypse 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:04.789
 for lejdd en because I do not advise them frequently 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:08.969

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.800
 this source still does not find 

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:47.409
 the interest of the team 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:49.900
 nobody in the national

 all this for a skin 

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:56.669
 Geneva in front of some 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:58.770

 our colleague 

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:14.009
 always very spectacular 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:15.289
 three weeks ago 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:17.249
 85th 

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:19.240
 in this system 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.669
 the launch by the club in hand to further tax the site 

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:26.210
 recently started to overflow it must stop 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:27.990
 by their flexibility 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.380
 that was a few words words of appeasement to persevere the 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.380
 trial for procedural reasons before asking for abandonment 

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:40.610
 she began to break good prince albert got a little wrong what is 

00:06:40.609 --> 00:06:43.609
 important it's his only loss against federate 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.180
 of the 

00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:54.869
 we would be the break 

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:01.229
 piquemal system that has a price 

00:07:03.559 --> 00:07:05.990
 we start to see what 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.990
 we will speak again 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:14.969
 chance 

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:17.330
 I do not tend to this 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.020
 their part a bit of a system 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.020
 that's even more important 

00:07:25.119 --> 00:07:28.119
 so what 

00:07:29.339 --> 00:07:31.999
 he was staying 

00:07:31.999 --> 00:07:34.999
 it's funny 

00:07:35.509 --> 00:07:38.199
 and here it was, shaking hands 

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:40.580

 canadians seemed seduced by this about europe and i 

00:07:57.809 --> 00:08:00.389
 take again the passage of johnny 

00:08:00.389 --> 00:08:02.749

00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:05.800
 it's really important in the symbian calf's feet went because this 

00:08:05.799 --> 00:08:09.029
 amount not knowing well and then we know that the job in the correct way 

00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.830
 it is necessary 

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.909
