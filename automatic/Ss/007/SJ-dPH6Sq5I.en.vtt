00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
white the exact same as the home kit so

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.240 
white the exact same as the home kit so
the<00:03:20.260> design<00:03:20.620> itself<00:03:21.040> is<00:03:21.220> exactly<00:03:21.580> the<00:03:21.730> same<00:03:23.250> so

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
the design itself is exactly the same so

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.370 
the design itself is exactly the same so
it's<00:03:24.400> a<00:03:24.550> basic<00:03:24.880> base<00:03:25.240> design<00:03:25.540> of<00:03:25.720> three<00:03:26.200> in

it's a basic base design of three in

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:36.930 
it's a basic base design of three in
black<00:03:30.060> next<00:03:31.060> is<00:03:31.150> option<00:03:31.420> 29<00:03:31.989> in<00:03:32.320> white<00:03:35.940> then

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
black next is option 29 in white then

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:43.259 
black next is option 29 in white then
option<00:03:37.330> 81<00:03:37.870> in<00:03:38.110> the<00:03:38.290> black<00:03:41.489> option<00:03:42.489> is<00:03:42.790> six<00:03:43.030> in

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
white and then option three in black so

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.530 
white and then option three in black so
it's<00:03:50.350> exactly<00:03:50.800> the<00:03:51.010> same<00:03:51.190> as<00:03:51.459> the<00:03:51.640> home<00:03:51.790> kit<00:03:52.060> on

simple design you get a better view of

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.440 
simple design you get a better view of
something<00:04:15.280> in<00:04:15.459> a<00:04:15.519> minute<00:04:15.610> but<00:04:15.910> that's<00:04:16.060> you<00:04:16.299> see

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.570 
I'll leave it on the screen for five six
seconds<00:04:35.320> maybe<00:04:35.560> just<00:04:36.250> so<00:04:36.370> you<00:04:36.460> can<00:04:36.640> get<00:04:36.789> a

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
seconds maybe just so you can get a

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.780 
seconds maybe just so you can get a
basically<00:04:40.900> I'll<00:04:41.900> do<00:04:42.080> so<00:04:42.860> that<00:04:42.980> is<00:04:43.100> the<00:04:43.220> color

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
basically I'll do so that is the color

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.460 
basically I'll do so that is the color
you<00:04:43.880> want<00:04:44.030> for<00:04:44.120> the<00:04:44.270> base<00:04:44.450> color<00:04:44.750> and<00:04:44.960> then

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
you want for the base color and then

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.180 
you want for the base color and then
design<00:04:45.800> one<00:04:46.130> is<00:04:46.400> option<00:04:46.850> 43<00:04:47.750> and<00:04:47.990> the<00:04:48.980> green

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
design one is option 43 and the green

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.950 
design one is option 43 and the green
you<00:04:49.310> want<00:04:49.460> for<00:04:49.610> this<00:04:49.700> is<00:04:50.060> basically<00:04:50.480> a<00:04:50.600> little

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
you want for this is basically a little

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.950 
you want for this is basically a little
bit<00:04:51.080> darker<00:04:51.530> than<00:04:51.650> on<00:04:51.740> you<00:04:51.920> just<00:04:52.040> made<00:04:52.810> so<00:04:53.810> it's

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
bit darker than on you just made so it's

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.420 
bit darker than on you just made so it's
three<00:04:54.910> 32<00:04:55.910> and<00:04:56.150> 18<00:04:57.140> I<00:04:57.410> think<00:04:57.740> it's<00:04:57.890> two<00:04:58.130> down<00:04:58.370> on

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
three 32 and 18 I think it's two down on

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.480 
three 32 and 18 I think it's two down on
each<00:04:58.730> of<00:04:58.910> them<00:04:59.000> finish<00:04:59.360> go<00:04:59.540> check<00:05:00.400> didn't<00:05:01.400> mean

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
each of them finish go check didn't mean

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.720 
each of them finish go check didn't mean
to<00:05:01.610> do<00:05:01.700> that<00:05:01.730> I've<00:05:02.090> messed<00:05:02.390> up<00:05:02.540> completely

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
to do that I've messed up completely

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.640 
to do that I've messed up completely
let's<00:05:04.730> go<00:05:04.850> back<00:05:05.030> and<00:05:05.180> change<00:05:05.390> it<00:05:05.570> a<00:05:05.630> door<00:05:06.290> check

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
let's go back and change it a door check

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:12.610 
let's go back and change it a door check
so<00:05:07.220> that's<00:05:07.400> that<00:05:11.230> do<00:05:12.230> you<00:05:12.290> know<00:05:12.380> what<00:05:12.440> I'm

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
so that's that do you know what I'm

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:13.810 
so that's that do you know what I'm
actually<00:05:12.770> gonna<00:05:13.100> leave<00:05:13.280> it<00:05:13.430> on<00:05:13.490> the<00:05:13.610> screen

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
actually gonna leave it on the screen

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:14.800 
actually gonna leave it on the screen
for<00:05:14.030> you<00:05:14.150> I'll<00:05:14.360> show<00:05:14.600> you
