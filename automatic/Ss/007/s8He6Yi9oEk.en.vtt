we're building out the capacity of the

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.440 
we're building out the capacity of the
two<00:01:44.750> operations<00:01:45.350> in<00:01:45.470> Mexico<00:01:46.090> and<00:01:47.090> we<00:01:47.240> should

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
two operations in Mexico and we should

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.300 
two operations in Mexico and we should
hit<00:01:48.409> four<00:01:48.650> and<00:01:48.740> a<00:01:48.770> half<00:01:48.799> million<00:01:49.159> ounces

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
hit four and a half million ounces

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.310 
hit four and a half million ounces
silver<00:01:49.700> plus<00:01:50.060> maybe<00:01:50.390> twenty<00:01:50.720> five<00:01:50.869> thousand
