try<00:01:06.330> out<00:01:06.450> some<00:01:06.630> more<00:01:06.720> practical<00:01:07.320> weapon

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
try out some more practical weapon

controls one fun side effect of the
current<00:01:10.650> system<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.280> it's<00:01:11.850> easy<00:01:12.060> to

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
current system is that it's easy to

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.120 
current system is that it's easy to
fling<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.600> weapons<00:01:12.960> by<00:01:13.380> letting<00:01:13.680> them<00:01:13.770> go<00:01:13.979> at

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
fling the weapons by letting them go at

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.980 
fling the weapons by letting them go at
the<00:01:14.250> right<00:01:14.369> time<00:01:14.610> like<00:01:15.270> while<00:01:15.450> doing<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.780> flip

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
the right time like while doing a flip

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.660 
the right time like while doing a flip
if<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.590> do<00:01:16.740> this<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.130> can<00:01:17.250> see<00:01:17.400> how<00:01:17.490> each

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
if you do this you can see how each

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.429 
if you do this you can see how each
weapon<00:01:17.880> has<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.210> realistic<00:01:18.840> center<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.259> mass

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
weapon has a realistic center of mass

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.830 
weapon has a realistic center of mass
but<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.100> rotates<00:01:20.430> around<00:01:20.580> for<00:01:21.330> example<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
but it rotates around for example the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.140 
but it rotates around for example the
rapier<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.530> balanced<00:01:23.009> around<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.310> guard<00:01:23.549> so

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
rapier is balanced around the guard so

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.179 
rapier is balanced around the guard so
it<00:01:24.240> rotates<00:01:24.570> near<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.960> grip<00:01:25.170> conversely<00:01:25.950> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
it rotates near the grip conversely the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.160 
it rotates near the grip conversely the
hammer<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.640> very<00:01:26.850> top<00:01:27.090> heavy<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.810> rotates

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
hammer is very top heavy so it rotates

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.219 
hammer is very top heavy so it rotates
around<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.530> neck<00:01:29.600> weapons<00:01:30.600> can<00:01:30.810> also<00:01:30.960> have

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
around the neck weapons can also have

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.109 
around the neck weapons can also have
their<00:01:31.470> own<00:01:31.500> specific<00:01:31.860> animations<00:01:32.729> which

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
their own specific animations which

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.749 
their own specific animations which
override<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.750> character<00:01:34.110> animation<00:01:34.759> for
