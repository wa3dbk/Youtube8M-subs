00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.230 

so<00:00:01.920> here<00:00:02.100> we<00:00:02.190> are<00:00:02.340> in<00:00:02.370> Vegas<00:00:02.520> at<00:00:03.179> the

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
so here we are in Vegas at the

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.840 
so here we are in Vegas at the
stratosphere<00:00:03.840> and<00:00:04.560> we've<00:00:04.950> installed<00:00:05.460> a

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
stratosphere and we've installed a

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.250 
stratosphere and we've installed a
meridian<00:00:06.810> on<00:00:07.130> a<00:00:08.130> ride<00:00:08.760> called<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.420> sky<00:00:09.840> jump

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
meridian on a ride called the sky jump

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.999 
meridian on a ride called the sky jump
and<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.160> sky<00:00:11.580> jump<00:00:11.969> allows<00:00:12.330> you<00:00:12.809> to<00:00:13.559> jump<00:00:13.889> off

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
and the sky jump allows you to jump off

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.939 
and the sky jump allows you to jump off
the<00:00:14.370> top<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.330> stratosphere<00:00:15.540> at<00:00:16.199> eight

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
the top of the stratosphere at eight

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.510 
the top of the stratosphere at eight
hundred<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:18.260> fifty<00:00:19.260> five<00:00:19.439> feet<00:00:19.710> or<00:00:19.890> 260

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
hundred and fifty five feet or 260

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.359 
hundred and fifty five feet or 260
meters<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.240> free<00:00:22.140> fall<00:00:22.439> down<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.130> side<00:00:23.340> of

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
meters and free fall down the side of

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.400 
meters and free fall down the side of
the<00:00:23.519> building<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.900> reason<00:00:25.080> we're

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
the building and so the reason we're

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.040 
the building and so the reason we're
being<00:00:25.619> brought<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.099> because<00:00:26.599> on<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.779> side

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
being brought in is because on the side

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
being brought in is because on the side
of<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.260> right<00:00:28.470> here<00:00:28.800> they<00:00:29.279> have<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.580> GoPro<00:00:30.240> and

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
of the right here they have a GoPro and

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.310 
of the right here they have a GoPro and
we're<00:00:32.070> using<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.790> Meridian<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.719> transmit

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
we're using the Meridian to transmit

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.400 
we're using the Meridian to transmit
live<00:00:34.590> pitches<00:00:35.190> off<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.210> GoPro<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:37.079> they<00:00:37.230> can

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
live pitches off the GoPro so they can

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.410 
live pitches off the GoPro so they can
have<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.590> in<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.860> shop<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.309> also<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.149> they<00:00:39.270> can

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
have it in the shop and also so they can

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.680 
have it in the shop and also so they can
stream<00:00:39.780> live<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.920> pictures<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.300> internet

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
stream live the pictures to the internet

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.479 
stream live the pictures to the internet
and<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.200> anywhere<00:00:43.379> anyone<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.070> world<00:00:44.219> can

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
and so anywhere anyone in the world can

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.479 
and so anywhere anyone in the world can
watch<00:00:44.820> their<00:00:45.059> friends<00:00:45.649> jump<00:00:46.649> off<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.129> top<00:00:47.340> of

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
watch their friends jump off the top of

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.439 
watch their friends jump off the top of
the<00:00:47.550> building<00:00:47.840> so<00:00:48.840> here<00:00:49.170> we<00:00:49.260> have<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.500> GoPro

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
the building so here we have the GoPro

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.830 
the building so here we have the GoPro
hdmi<00:00:51.449> out<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:51.960> GoPro<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:53.600> inside<00:00:54.600> this

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
hdmi out of the GoPro and inside this

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.900 
hdmi out of the GoPro and inside this
waterproof<00:00:55.620> box<00:00:55.860> we<00:00:56.160> have<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> Meridian

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
waterproof box we have a Meridian

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.860 
waterproof box we have a Meridian
transmitter<00:00:57.680> and<00:00:58.680> we<00:00:58.859> have<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.070> HD<00:00:59.579> hdmi<00:01:00.390> to

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
transmitter and we have a HD hdmi to

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.349 
transmitter and we have a HD hdmi to
hdmi<00:01:01.010> converter<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.579> go<00:01:02.699> into<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.000> Meridian

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
hdmi converter to go into the Meridian

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.660 
hdmi converter to go into the Meridian
and<00:01:03.480> then<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.439> transmitter<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.430> being

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
and then the transmitter is being

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.270 
and then the transmitter is being
transmitted<00:01:06.299> through<00:01:06.600> these<00:01:06.920> four<00:01:07.920> antennas

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
transmitted through these four antennas

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.160 
transmitted through these four antennas
so<00:01:08.880> we<00:01:09.030> have<00:01:09.240> 4<00:01:10.369> 205<00:01:11.369> sa<00:01:11.670> NT<00:01:11.880> 205's<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.140> that

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
so we have 4 205 sa NT 205's and so that

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.770 
so we have 4 205 sa NT 205's and so that
focuses<00:01:14.040> all<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.430> power<00:01:14.670> down<00:01:15.240> towards<00:01:15.720> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
focuses all the power down towards the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.070 
focuses all the power down towards the
ground<00:01:16.610> and<00:01:17.610> then<00:01:17.970> on<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.270> received<00:01:18.720> side<00:01:18.960> of

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
ground and then on the received side of

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.450 
ground and then on the received side of
things<00:01:19.259> we<00:01:20.189> have<00:01:20.549> five<00:01:22.130> antennas<00:01:23.130> along<00:01:23.369> this

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
things we have five antennas along this

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.429 
things we have five antennas along this
railing<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.270> can<00:01:24.390> see<00:01:24.570> there's<00:01:24.810> one<00:01:25.369> two

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
railing so you can see there's one two

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:32.690 
railing so you can see there's one two
three<00:01:29.479> four<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:31.049> then<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.070> fifth<00:01:32.310> one<00:01:32.520> is

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
three four and then the fifth one is

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.499 
three four and then the fifth one is
over<00:01:32.970> here<00:01:33.470> and<00:01:34.470> those<00:01:35.100> five<00:01:35.579> antennas<00:01:36.390> are

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
over here and those five antennas are

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.300 
over here and those five antennas are
pointing<00:01:36.810> straight<00:01:37.020> up<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.860> top<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.100> the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.580 
through LMR 400 which is just behind the
railing<00:01:45.149> there<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:46.079> can<00:01:46.170> see<00:01:46.350> them<00:01:46.470> more

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
railing there and you can see them more

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.530 
railing there and you can see them more
coming<00:01:46.890> up<00:01:46.950> in<00:01:47.130> there

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
coming up in there

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.720 
coming up in there
and<00:01:48.630> then<00:01:49.050> those<00:01:49.230> four<00:01:49.650> cables<00:01:50.040> plus<00:01:50.580> 05

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
and then those four cables plus 05

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.480 
and then those four cables plus 05
cables<00:01:51.360> five<00:01:51.570> receive<00:01:51.990> antennas<00:01:52.470> then<00:01:53.190> go<00:01:53.370> and

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
cables five receive antennas then go and

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.210 
cables five receive antennas then go and
decide<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:54.060> Pelican<00:01:54.450> case<00:01:54.780> which<00:01:55.680> has<00:01:55.980> a

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
decide this Pelican case which has a

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.390 
decide this Pelican case which has a
meridian<00:01:56.880> receiver<00:01:57.480> inside<00:01:57.840> there<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:58.830> we<00:01:59.220> get

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
meridian receiver inside there so we get

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.250 
meridian receiver inside there so we get
very<00:01:59.490> nice<00:01:59.730> and<00:01:59.910> waterproof<00:02:00.440> in<00:02:01.440> the<00:02:01.680> case<00:02:03.260> and

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
very nice and waterproof in the case and

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.010 
very nice and waterproof in the case and
so<00:02:04.680> we<00:02:04.800> get<00:02:04.950> live<00:02:05.130> pictures<00:02:05.600> we<00:02:06.600> have<00:02:06.780> two<00:02:06.990> more

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
so we get live pictures we have two more

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.630 
so we get live pictures we have two more
jump<00:02:07.410> from<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.800> top<00:02:07.830> of<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.130> building<00:02:08.310> and

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
jump from the top of the building and

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.170 
jump from the top of the building and
right<00:02:09.119> down<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:10.009> right<00:02:11.009> down<00:02:11.070> the<00:02:11.220> ride<00:02:11.490> so<00:02:11.910> he

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
right down the right down the ride so he

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.050 
right down the right down the ride so he
had<00:02:12.300> live<00:02:12.450> pictures<00:02:12.750> all<00:02:12.900> they<00:02:13.020> done

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
had live pictures all they done

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.980 
had live pictures all they done
something<00:02:15.060> else<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.300> interesting<00:02:15.840> is<00:02:15.960> that

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
something else is interesting is that

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.840 
something else is interesting is that
we've<00:02:16.260> had<00:02:16.440> some<00:02:16.650> problems<00:02:17.130> with<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.460> hdmi

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
we've had some problems with the hdmi

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.840 
we've had some problems with the hdmi
arm<00:02:18.630> at<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.840> GoPro<00:02:19.410> with<00:02:19.920> all<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.190> vibrations

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
arm at the GoPro with all the vibrations

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.720 
arm at the GoPro with all the vibrations
of<00:02:20.970> this<00:02:21.120> ride<00:02:21.740> it<00:02:22.740> really<00:02:23.100> causes<00:02:23.430> some

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
of this ride it really causes some

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.610 
of this ride it really causes some
issues<00:02:23.820> and<00:02:24.270> we're<00:02:24.570> losing<00:02:24.990> pictures<00:02:25.320> because

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
issues and we're losing pictures because

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.530 
issues and we're losing pictures because
the<00:02:25.860> vibration<00:02:26.670> when<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.030> wind<00:02:27.209> hits<00:02:27.270> these

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
the vibration when the wind hits these

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.840 
the vibration when the wind hits these
cables<00:02:28.050> over<00:02:28.260> here<00:02:28.470> it<00:02:29.040> kind<00:02:29.280> of<00:02:29.340> creates<00:02:29.580> this

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
cables over here it kind of creates this

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.210 
cables over here it kind of creates this
frequency<00:02:30.480> harmonic<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:31.260> these<00:02:31.770> things<00:02:32.040> kind

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
frequency harmonic and these things kind

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.090 
frequency harmonic and these things kind
of<00:02:32.280> vibrated<00:02:33.000> around<00:02:33.240> about<00:02:33.420> guessing<00:02:34.290> they

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
of vibrated around about guessing they

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.250 
of vibrated around about guessing they
can<00:02:35.220> probably<00:02:35.459> just<00:02:35.520> hear<00:02:35.760> they're<00:02:36.260> around

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
can probably just hear they're around

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.080 
can probably just hear they're around
about<00:02:37.440> 800,000<00:02:38.220> about<00:02:38.400> eight<00:02:38.490> hundred<00:02:38.520> Hertz

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
about 800,000 about eight hundred Hertz

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.660 
about 800,000 about eight hundred Hertz
and<00:02:40.080> that<00:02:40.470> vibration<00:02:41.070> is<00:02:41.160> I<00:02:41.250> think<00:02:41.310> going<00:02:41.550> into

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
and that vibration is I think going into

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.280 
and that vibration is I think going into
the<00:02:41.910> HDMI<00:02:42.209> connector<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:42.900> it's<00:02:43.020> just<00:02:43.170> really

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
the HDMI connector and it's just really

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.010 
the HDMI connector and it's just really
kind<00:02:43.560> of<00:02:43.650> causing<00:02:44.550> issues<00:02:44.640> so<00:02:45.000> interesting<00:02:45.930> if

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
kind of causing issues so interesting if

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.690 
kind of causing issues so interesting if
you're<00:02:46.110> trying<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.380> do<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.560> job<00:02:46.890> like<00:02:47.160> this<00:02:47.459> I'd

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
you're trying to do a job like this I'd

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.320 
you're trying to do a job like this I'd
really<00:02:48.120> recommend<00:02:48.270> to<00:02:48.810> get<00:02:48.989> away<00:02:49.080> from<00:02:49.320> HDMI

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
really recommend to get away from HDMI

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.850 
really recommend to get away from HDMI
we've<00:02:51.330> done<00:02:51.540> some<00:02:51.750> testing<00:02:52.080> with<00:02:52.140> um<00:02:52.470> with

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
we've done some testing with um with

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.840 
we've done some testing with um with
some<00:02:53.519> SDI<00:02:54.090> cameras<00:02:54.600> and<00:02:54.840> it's<00:02:54.989> perfect<00:02:55.530> so<00:02:55.890> I'd

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
some SDI cameras and it's perfect so I'd

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.300 
some SDI cameras and it's perfect so I'd
use<00:02:57.120> SDI<00:02:57.540> cameras<00:02:58.110> or<00:02:58.290> even<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:58.950> very<00:02:59.130> least

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
use SDI cameras or even the very least

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.990 
use SDI cameras or even the very least
try<00:03:00.650> component<00:03:01.650> cameras<00:03:02.340> components

probably<00:03:03.239> more<00:03:03.390> solid<00:03:03.840> connector<00:03:04.320> but<00:03:04.920> HDMI<00:03:05.489> I

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
probably more solid connector but HDMI I

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.670 
probably more solid connector but HDMI I
find<00:03:05.970> in<00:03:06.150> this<00:03:06.269> particular<00:03:06.420> ride<00:03:06.900> it's<00:03:07.350> just

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
find in this particular ride it's just

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.470 
find in this particular ride it's just
not<00:03:07.830> working<00:03:07.980> for<00:03:08.310> them<00:03:08.459> so<00:03:08.730> we've<00:03:09.180> got<00:03:09.299> to<00:03:09.360> get

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
not working for them so we've got to get

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.350 
not working for them so we've got to get
away<00:03:09.540> from<00:03:09.660> that<00:03:10.190> but<00:03:11.190> that's<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.580> setup<00:03:12.090> at

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
away from that but that's the setup at

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.570 
away from that but that's the setup at
the<00:03:12.630> stratosphere<00:03:12.959> in<00:03:13.440> vegas<00:03:13.890> for<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.250> sky
