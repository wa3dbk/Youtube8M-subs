00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.620
 do not 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.280
 ah 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.449
 hello youtube friends in the video 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.820
 Today what I want to show you how 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.190
 turn your mac has not happened to us 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.020
 once that your Mac as it has 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.180
 remained in the manzanita I said to 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.640
 not turn on and there it has stayed and God 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.100
 mine now what do we do has happened to me 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.960
 so I also tell you that 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.510
 I had a bad time in his day and that's why I want to 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.839
 make a video to help you in case 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.600
 you find in this problem to see in the 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:55.730
 problem is based on that you are 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.789
 working with your brand and suddenly 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.699
 He is thinking it freezes and does 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:04.489
 nothing or we go tremendously slow and not 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.200
 you know what happens as happened to me was 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.619
 surfing the internet and well then 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.880
 I was like clogged it did not work and 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.380
 After a while I got tired and 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.300
 I decided to turn it off and on again 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.920
 how good this is, in fact, ever 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.350
 with other computers if there has not been 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.390
 no problem the case is that he put 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.119
 in motion the computer appeared the 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.009
 manzanita on the gray white screen and 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.649
 from there he did not move he did nothing but 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.750
 think he stayed there he thought he stayed 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.340
 there but the manzanita did not happen 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.670
 Well then there freaked me 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.110
 little then the first thing that is 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.690
 happens to one is to turn off the computer 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.460
 let it rest a while disconnect it 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.120
 of the current and in a while go back to 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.430
 try 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.890
 this may work but in my 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.350
 case it was not like that either is not worth it so 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.710
 I had to resort to the plan to plan b 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.380
 so my plan b was the following 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:57.110
 I turned on my mac voucher and press the 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.260
 combination of keys command + option 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.640
 plus the p key plus the r key all this 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.310
 before the gray screen appears 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.770
 when the max starts up before 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.479
 white display screen will show a 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.340
 sound the typical start sound that 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.840
 has the abac right at that time is 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.450
 when you have to press all these 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.260
 keys I repeat command more option p or be 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.270
 command more option more p more r vale 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.340
 you must leave the keys pressed the 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.320
 you must hold down until the 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.060
 computer restart and listen to 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.010
 new the boot sound then in 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.930
 this case you do not hear twice one in 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.610
 the moment it lights up you just have to 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.709
 press the keys you keep them 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.940
 pressed and listen is again the 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.310
 starter sound 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.050
 Now you can release the keys and wait and 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.080
 to cross fingers 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.090
 this should be an option for 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.740
 it will work but it may be that 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.870
 work in this case what we do is 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.510
 start the safe mode it is worth 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.220
 when the sea then launches a series of 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.870
 repair functions that eliminate 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.210
 files that are corrupt contribute 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.750
 solutions and utilities then this 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:02.690
 it could mean help then if 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.370
 neither does it work third there was the plan 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.100
 that in this case what we will do 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.960
 shutting down the computer is then worth what 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.570
 we will do it will be restart 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.310
 It is worth immediately at the moment that 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.260
 we have it on at the moment 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.490
 we already give the start button 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.040
 we press the shift key which is the 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:21.170
 capitals and let's keep it 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.320
 pressed until the 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.600
 screen of the manzanita is worth then 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.310
 in these options you may see 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.530
 under the mantazen of the apple 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.060
 especially in the second case a bar 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.100
 of typical state like when we do 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.810
 updates that are filling up are going 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.730
 loading and once it's finished 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.950
 fill in all the system is restarted 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.290
 and it gets put into operation no 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.330
 because it will be something similar is theoretically 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.370
 when that status bar is filled 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.680
 it has to start up and go on 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.410
 it is possible that maybe you appear not 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.700
 you start it directly disappear 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.709
 that you put your username and 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.510
 good password the user already leaves os 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.550
 gives the option to light with your 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.069
 user or with a visiting user 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:02.989
 and put our password now can 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.269
 ask me for example is the second 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.190
 I asked for it but it did not happen 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.900
 he went again to the manzanita and in the 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.989
 third option that was on the button's 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.239
 if the capital letters in this case I 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.400
 I was lucky and it went on 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.040
 me with these three options I in the 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.739
 third I was lucky it worked for me to try it 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.840
 but the option that is the last one is 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.580
 that you take and you take the computer to 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.009
 your brand 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.439
 Apple's technical service what 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:32.930
 try to repair vale but good is a 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:34.490
 own experience I was lucky in the 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.409
 third attempt in the third in the 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.629
 third way the third way to try 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:40.909
 fix it and it's but I want 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:42.590
 transmit it to you because I 

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:44.300
 I went wrong at the time because I believed that 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.969
 she had explained to the computer 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.669
 that I had the world and I was lucky 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:51.409
 then as I know how bad it is 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:52.789
 Well, I wanted to make this video 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:54.219
 to help those who may have 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:56.689
 problems to find a solution 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:58.250
 if they find it here perfect I would 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:59.479
 I rejoice a lot for them that they do not 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.340
 you know that there is always the service 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:02.539
 technical but good before turning to 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.009
 So, if we have any option 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:05.360
 some I'm going to do it ourselves 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:06.949
 cost free and we do not have much 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.080
 inconvenience of having to be with the 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.699
 computer to here for there that if I 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.500
 reveals the name fixes me handle it 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:14.479
