00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:07.810
 hi youtuber or if youtube heras today 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:09.849
 I present the canary seed milk how we go 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.670
 to know if the birdseed but will be the ratatouille 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:14.490
 to consummate remind us has been in 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:19.660
 Soak all night approximately 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:22.090
 between 12 to 14 hours and it is the ingredient 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.970
 special and unique special of this milk 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:28.689
 if it is real canary seed milk together 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.189
 with water and nothing else like it if not 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.230
 he likes you can add a little bit of 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:35.050
 stevia to make milk sweeter 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:39.250
 therefore take the best but not 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:41.620
 it has bad taste we need also what 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.420
 first naturally a blender with 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.600
 enough power or if you have a 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.940
 tÃºrmix or 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.460
 blender 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.500
 we need the containers and we're not going to 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.660
 do the shake of the seeds and 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.710
 we are going to cast the cast of 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.320
 the same 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:05.210
 ok and we need water approximately 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.860
 half of the water bottle a 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.070
 little bit more depending on the amount 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.590
 of milk that we are going to make the birdseed 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.150
 here there are about 5 tablespoons more or less 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.080
 is the envelope of natural soria that 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:21.710
 I taught and if not it's a very very strainer 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.960
 very thin or well in a cloth sieve 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.970
 this vessel that you see here where 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.920
 subtract is super super wash and is in 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.200
 which we are going to leave the rest of the 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.830
 dress well crushed and well crushed 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.440
 that will serve us as a mask 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.690
 exfoliant thanks to the remains of the 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.539
 seeds of canary seed and also nutritious 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.330
 for when we fight recover the ph 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.950
 of our good skin these are all 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.440
 the ingredients naturally 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.590
 we need the light to make us work 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.590
 all right 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.570
 but it is to deposit all the liquid of the 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:02.940
 canary on one side separating 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.940
 seeds in another then for it 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.459
 normal diversity that's why 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.459
 we miss 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:21.910
 in the seeds 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:26.950
 here you see that they are many of the same 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:29.560
 how many times but I would be you so 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.930
 disconnected I have removed what is the 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.730
 birdseed liquid was Christian 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.920
 He was thus aged but the granites 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.060
 separated here we have the water of the 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.080
 alpiste that we are going to use 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.480
 naturally to be able to do the 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:47.130
 milk emulsion and here we are going to 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.130
 proceed to beat all 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.760
 and now a power 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.830
 because we do it little by little 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.290
 because there we have the other container 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.630
 white container and more birdseed but 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.150
 we have to strain and to prevent 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.740
 let's lose let's stop using here 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.740
 moments the turn only yes no 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.740
 and what we are going to do is go a little bit 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.120
 bit 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:26.940
 throwing the birdseed into it 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.940
 those that fall 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:33.099
 and now when the Chinese has released us 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.989
 all the liquid you already know that you have to go 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.549
 progressively pressing a little 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.310
 a little bit a little bit even though I 'm not 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.460
 pressing because that I'm going to go back to 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.770
 put 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.750
 radical 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.710
 with your hand 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.710
 little by little 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:57.200
 and if you're a little thick now 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.950
 Well, let's add a little more 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:06.610
 water so that the birdseed can 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.610
 perfectly functional and the rest 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.230
 special 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.230
 let's go squeezing 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.489
 the remains of the birdseed we're going to 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.660
 put back to shred with water until 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.660
 complete the case 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.310
 that we can use to wash 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:44.100
 with seeds of birdseed is missing 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.630
 add a little shea butter and 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.479
 stir the good back here we have the 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.500
 birdseed principle not relieve you add 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:55.830
 you release tve tree of disinfectant 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.569
 to avoid fungus filling and 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.779
 we are going to 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:02.249
 it's a mix with shea butter and 

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:04.919
 this cream to use it as 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:07.050
 natural exfoliant of the room the birdseed 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:09.119
 which is also very nutritional and it's going to 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.179
 help preserve the skin and here 

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:13.439
 we have the cremita we have added a 

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:14.909
 little shea butter 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:17.789
 approximately with one or two 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:20.279
 teaspoons of minced butter we are going to 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:23.389
 stir with a stick is a cream 

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:23.389
 quite dense and 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.440
 if it's going to hit us pretty well 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.440
 body 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:35.430
 Shea butter and its weight 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:38.210
 the consumption began 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.210
 danger 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.950
 we just go throwing a 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:47.030
 puÃ±adito and with him we crashed 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.030
 all the wells 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.490
 and now we are going to use this 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.930
 ingredient that is 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:59.919
 Edge oil between this is used 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:02.960
 with small droplets as a disinfectant 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:05.860
 healing then it will help us 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.860
 that the 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:16.260
 outside that we are worth to pillay the 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:19.060
 scalp as for the body inde 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.530
 with her we can wash ourselves we can 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.199
 scratch thanks to the action of the 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:25.750
 granite seeds of the birdseed 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:28.240
 a little while and he's going to make us go 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:31.389
 sit wonderfully well is a 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:34.389
 totally natural cream because all the 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:36.430
 essence of tea tree in butter 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:38.880
 Shea butter and canary seed are all products 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.880
 natural 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.840
 and this shea butter forgiveness 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:51.270
 and ready

 we have our shea butter 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:55.280
 num 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:58.000
 on recipe basis 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.000
 that
