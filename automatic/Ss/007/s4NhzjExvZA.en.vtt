00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.219
 actually happened here today 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.770
 So first of all I'm the bianca where 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.230
 I manage the best recipe rum in the handle 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:20.890

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.529
 Examination to the base pass to the badges 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:27.039
 and to the western rider sign 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.390
 took place and first we have in 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.609
 the preparatory courses the 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.980
 tested for it just when 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.750
 basic price, it is important basic 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.170
 things about horse health 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.640
 horse husbandry also about the physique 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.080
 the horse what diseases 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.300
 can occur and how to do this 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.820
 can treat these and determine 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.830
 that you simply associate the participants 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.560
 a basic knowledge 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.300
 We also examine these 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:56.050
 and then it just has that 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.000
 longier badge took place as well 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.690
 is checked by the fn with 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.900
 that's what it's all about 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.610
 to dose the horse correctly also to know 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:11.020
 what it takes to be like a horse 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:13.480
 one trained long and the third was 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.660
 just the best sign 4 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.820
 there it is, then it is already more 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.170
 detail what riding is concerned and 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.050
 really the western riding 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.520
 there is demand for the one and the horse 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.679
 in a 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.009
 group exams to show that the 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:32.140
 so horse can commute if it is in 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.210
 the group is presented a single 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.990
 lok and a group gallop are in demand 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:41.159
 book figures per way to ride 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:45.009
 Further, it will be a horsemanship 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.810
 Testing from the participants requires that 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.979
 means it is one can say so 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.630
 a little test of the western riding it 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.420
 is particularly important on seat and action 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.250
 of the rider and that the that of 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.579
 rider knows with craft help her 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.869
 selbstwert correct I such a test 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.869
 can steer and guide 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.539
 and then the third exam is a 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.539
 Trail asked here is especially important 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:14.660
 that the horses also independently over 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:17.630
 obstacle bars exceeded by a 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.270
 through a quadrilateral can through mature 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.120
 you have to do this one every time 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.460
 correctness testing and that all 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.260
 in the correct gear in a short 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.850
 basic seat and also in a nice 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.930
 Manner presented for example is too 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.420
 the doing 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.280
 a component of the exam 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.990
 actually from the way of working 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.210
 Yesterday it gets far through that one 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.890
 Do not let winder through if you can 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.350
 this opens and closes and that has 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.270
 all his special requirements 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.600
 tournament aspects and so will this 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.960
 Examinations on assessed and participation 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.700
 then get a grade for her 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.780
 for Berlin 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.120
 and of course there will be theory too 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.590
 queried and in the riding badge it goes 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.750
 then really more detail 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.910
 So the rite teaching really does matter 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.650
 with what help on my horse 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.060
 and how can that be a harmonious one? 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.060
 Total picture revealed 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.209
 and i can say that i am me 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:40.060
