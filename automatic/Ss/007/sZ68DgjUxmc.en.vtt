00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.970
 Hello to her, I am not Matveyev and this 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.250
 pit stop workshop today we'll talk 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.420
 about why many scooters are bad 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.009
 start up on the cold 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.230
 in my hands now 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.390
 electrovalve it is put practically on 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.420
 all modern carburetors and this 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.949
 modern substitute for such a suction 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.960
 kind of electrovalve and put on 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.000
 almost the entire range 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.060
 Scooter honda on all popular 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.890
 Chinese scooters from 50 to 150 cubes and 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.780
 also very similar solenoid valves 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.000
 installed on the suzuki lineup 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.070
 starting with suzuki lets 1 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.840
 and later modifications this 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.730
 keihin carburetor for the model range 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.260
 suzuki such as in c1 c2 and vt2 new 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.660
 Let's consider on his example the reason for 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.660
 which the engine does not start well on 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.960
 the cold thing is that the solenoid valve 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.059
 there is a special carburetor in any 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.730
 channel 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:04.399
 how here also everything looks exactly on 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.399
 carburetor for honda dio and honda tact 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.729
 this input is output to fuel for 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.990
 air / fuel mixture 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.689
 so here 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.030
 the whole reason is that your 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.189
 electric valve if you have such 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.979
 the problem does not fully open this 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.189
 the channel when the motor is completely cool also 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.439
 I also want to note that many explain 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:30.630
 your interlocutor is not quite right 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.030
 The principle of the solenoid is not 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.789
 solenoid valve this is exactly 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.039
 electrovalve and it is set in motion 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:38.759
 thanks to the heat sensitive element 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:40.560
 internal 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.360
 it looks like this 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.209
 the sensing element is practically in 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.549
 all electric valves and it differs from 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:49.830
 models to the model are quite insignificant 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.759
 the fact is that during bad 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.520
 cold start 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.770
 solenoid valve incorrectly adjusted 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.750
 many believe it is wrong that he does not 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.929
 governed the matter is that it is not 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.940
 he just just sealed the plant 

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:05.610
 glue and it consists of two parts 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.380
 external and internal here is 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.450
 threaded connection threaded 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.519
 the compound is sealed with special glue 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.989
 look like a regular super glue so here 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.250
 the only task you need 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.290
 perform in order to adjust 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.630
 your carburetor for a normal cold 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.190
 start it to rip this thread from the dead 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.440
 points and then produce 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.489
 solenoid valve adjustment to 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.470
 to rip off the ground 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.489
 electric valve you will need a normal 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.980
 metal clamp 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.660
 before that you will need to do 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.000
 solenoid valve remove sealing 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.250
 cuff so as not to damage it at the moment 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.260
 procedures tighten the clamp on the electro 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.180
 the valve is preferably strong enough and 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.040
 it is better to resort to a nickname if possible 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.560
 screwdriver to the key of the corresponding 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.799
 size usually sizes here beach from from 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.640
 6 to 8 millimeters 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:52.040
 further need a vice 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.230
 and a similar key or if there is a good one 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.290
 pliers 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.630
 the next stage is clamping 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.290
 solenoid valve in a vice and incomplete 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.120
 clamping 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.610
 you need not to damage the body 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.760
 solenoid valve and only partially to 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.730
 fix it and preferably hold down 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.510
 this way so that you can 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.800
 hear 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.630
 glue trust which is on the thread 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.810
 if you fail to do this 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.140
 terrible perhaps you can do without 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.060
 and without it after you clamped 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.190
 solenoid valve in the grip you need 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.959
 grab the yoke and jerk on 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.560
 unscrewing break the thread if 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.390
 will succeed 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.100
 usually this procedure is very good 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.910
 it is possible in Japanese 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.970
 electrovalve 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:41.090
 and often almost with probability 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.950
 fifty fifty doesn't pass with 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.400
 Chinese electro valves since 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.380
 they are fresh and their bodies are very big 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.570
 likely to break if you succeeded 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.730
 rip thread on your electro club they 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.310
 don't damage his body you get in 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.130
 hands already adjustable element carburetor 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.290
 after which relatively existing 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.360
 the settings that were in it before that 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.120
 there is that moment where it was twisted 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.920
 you do the next one you 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.840
 need to unscrew a maximum of one 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.579
 turnover on the electro valve and then 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.310
 put it in the carburetor and check 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:15.440
 cold start quality if 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.200
 after you unscrew one turn 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.419
 the effect will be insufficient unscrew still 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.120
 one turn and continue the procedure until 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.160
 until you get normal 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.560
 adequate cold start but 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.860
 you still need to consider one moment which 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.169
 described here in this video if you have everything in 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.850
 ok regarding this video how 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.919
 since these settings can be correctly 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.630
 produce if not then you need 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:40.580
 eliminate this damage first 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.200
 during warming up the body the solenoid valve may 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.860
 protrude to about five 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.870
 millimeters 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.430
 if your solenoid when warming up 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.230
 moves a maximum of two to three millimeters 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.020
 then most likely you will fail 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:54.080
 reach the golden mean and he's already 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.850
 needs replacing again check 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.470
 operability of the solenoid can 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.510
 elementary not respecting the polarity 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.220
 connect it to your battery and 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.020
 after about 5 minutes he 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.030
 will advance to the maximum possible 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.130
 the distance I had everything with you was evgeny 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.020
