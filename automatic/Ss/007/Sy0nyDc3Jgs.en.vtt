00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:07.859
 hello I am alexandre manager and 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.330
 trainers in the ricol boat I want 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.460
 show you how to do different me 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.900
 because obviously no boat 100 me I 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.549
 showed you the technique of 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.630
 call the tournament and I like who 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.590
 is the basic knot to know who is 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.580
 very easy to memorize 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.830
 so we surround our bar once and 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.980
 twice gives you a dead turn that 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.820
 allows to dampen the voltage then 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.239
 we pass this as this is in the 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.399
 same meaning as these one pulls one 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.149
 little and here we go it will move 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.410
 not so there I will introduce you a 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.000
 second of what is called the de 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.920
 capstan which serve in particular to 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.480
 attach the fenders to the boat 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.969
 by massage on the protection that one 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.710
 will put to prevent the boat from 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.980
 shatters the hull of Sabine's boat on 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.570
 the pier so I go through here 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.739
 I crossed them then to do this I 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:05.369
 here I'm going to hold back the pond I'm going through 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:09.479
 there and I do not resume here and it gives me 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.450
 it's still a game called the number 2 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.740
 cleat that serves to moor the boat so 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.210
 here is attacking it's a piece 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.009
 found on a boat is against but 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.159
 also on the pontoons so the node of 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.259
 tak and i will show you 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:27.270
 so I turn my cleat still in 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:31.369
 doing a dead turn I'm doing this gevry 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:36.000
 to then finish like this 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:38.130
 the boat is docked here in conclusion 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.930
 there are really basic notes to 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.310
 know to simplify life 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.390
 obviously there are thousands 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.439
 we are interested in what are 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.439
 really the basic knots
