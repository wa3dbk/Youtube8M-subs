suspended in a lotion I read up on a few
reviews<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.240> kind<00:01:45.390> of<00:01:45.479> had<00:01:45.630> mixed

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
reviews of this and it kind of had mixed

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.840 
reviews of this and it kind of had mixed
reviews<00:01:46.079> but<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.530> think<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.100> know<00:01:47.250> just

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.760 
reviews but I think it you know just
give<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.149> go<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.540> wasn't<00:01:48.869> very<00:01:49.020> expensive<00:01:49.619> so

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
give it a go it wasn't very expensive so

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.310

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
and I quite like it I've only tried it

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.599 
and I quite like it I've only tried it
out<00:03:31.720> for<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:31.989> first<00:03:32.230> time<00:03:32.500> today<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:33.010> I<00:03:33.400> can

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
out for the first time today and I can

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:36.660 
out for the first time today and I can
say<00:03:33.819> that<00:03:34.030> it<00:03:34.239> is<00:03:34.389> a<00:03:34.420> slightly<00:03:34.989> greyish<00:03:35.980> baby

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670

cream<00:03:37.090> so<00:03:37.420> when<00:03:37.599> I<00:03:37.630> do<00:03:37.750> put<00:03:38.079> it<00:03:38.170> on<00:03:38.319> it<00:03:38.560> did<00:03:38.769> have

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
cream so when I do put it on it did have

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.129 
cream so when I do put it on it did have
a<00:03:38.980> kind<00:03:39.340> of<00:03:39.459> a<00:03:39.549> grate<00:03:39.819> in<00:03:40.090> but<00:03:40.480> when<00:03:40.630> I<00:03:40.660> read<00:03:40.930> up

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
a kind of a grate in but when I read up

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:43.379 
a kind of a grate in but when I read up
on<00:03:41.260> it<00:03:41.380> I<00:03:41.530> heard<00:03:41.769> that<00:03:41.950> it<00:03:42.310> kind<00:03:42.549> of<00:03:42.639> um<00:03:42.940> does

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
on it I heard that it kind of um does

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.780 
on it I heard that it kind of um does
adjust<00:03:43.840> to<00:03:44.109> your<00:03:44.230> skin<00:03:44.290> type<00:03:44.799> and<00:03:45.040> I've<00:03:45.549> only

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
adjust to your skin type and I've only

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.270 
adjust to your skin type and I've only
pretty<00:03:46.269> much<00:03:46.480> put<00:03:46.750> it<00:03:46.870> on<00:03:47.019> like<00:03:47.590> half<00:03:47.950> an<00:03:48.069> hour

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
pretty much put it on like half an hour

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.420 
pretty much put it on like half an hour
ago<00:03:48.639> so<00:03:48.849> it<00:03:48.970> hasn't<00:03:49.440> totally<00:03:50.440> adjusted<00:03:51.160> to<00:03:51.310> my

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
ago so it hasn't totally adjusted to my

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.479 
ago so it hasn't totally adjusted to my
skin<00:03:51.760> just<00:03:51.970> yet<00:03:52.299> but<00:03:52.750> I<00:03:52.989> feel<00:03:53.019> that<00:03:53.349> it<00:03:54.099> is<00:03:54.250> very

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
skin just yet but I feel that it is very

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.030 
skin just yet but I feel that it is very
nice<00:03:54.790> on<00:03:55.030> my<00:03:55.150> skin<00:03:55.480> and<00:03:55.720> I<00:03:55.989> think<00:03:56.290> I<00:03:56.410> used<00:03:56.680> a<00:03:56.859> bit

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
nice on my skin and I think I used a bit

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.830 
nice on my skin and I think I used a bit
too<00:03:57.250> much<00:03:57.489> you<00:03:57.549> really<00:03:58.000> only<00:03:58.329> need<00:03:58.480> a<00:03:58.660> little

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
too much you really only need a little

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.020 
too much you really only need a little
bit<00:03:58.989> because<00:03:59.169> it<00:03:59.470> blends<00:03:59.769> very<00:04:00.010> well<00:04:00.549> just

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
bit because it blends very well just

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.210 
bit because it blends very well just
from<00:04:01.269> the<00:04:01.419> texture<00:04:01.870> of<00:04:01.900> it<00:04:02.260> it<00:04:02.410> is<00:04:02.560> quite<00:04:02.919> like

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
from the texture of it it is quite like

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.449 
from the texture of it it is quite like
a<00:04:03.459> watery<00:04:04.329> not<00:04:05.139> necessarily<00:04:05.769> watery<00:04:06.130> it's

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
a watery not necessarily watery it's

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.339 
a watery not necessarily watery it's
more<00:04:06.669> of<00:04:06.760> a<00:04:06.819> lotion<00:04:07.060> as<00:04:07.450> opposed<00:04:07.780> to<00:04:07.930> a<00:04:07.989> cream

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:08.349 
more of a lotion as opposed to a cream

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.379 
more of a lotion as opposed to a cream
in<00:04:08.620> terms<00:04:08.829> of<00:04:09.010> texture<00:04:09.609> I<00:04:09.730> found<00:04:09.970> the<00:04:10.030> coverage

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389 
in terms of texture I found the coverage

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:11.970 
in terms of texture I found the coverage
of<00:04:10.569> it<00:04:10.720> was<00:04:10.840> quite<00:04:11.049> good<00:04:11.230> as<00:04:11.380> well<00:04:11.410> as<00:04:11.739> using

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
of it was quite good as well as using

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.350 
of it was quite good as well as using
less<00:04:12.250> concealer<00:04:12.609> than<00:04:12.940> a<00:04:12.970> No

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
less concealer than a No

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.630 
less concealer than a No
