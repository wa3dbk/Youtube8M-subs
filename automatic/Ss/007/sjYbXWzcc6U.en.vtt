like<00:00:22.390> a<00:00:22.419> de<00:00:22.599> by<00:00:22.720> our<00:00:22.919> office<00:00:23.919> and<00:00:25.320> there<00:00:26.320> was

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
like a de by our office and there was

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:27.749 
like a de by our office and there was
our<00:00:26.589> thought<00:00:26.829> process<00:00:27.159> before<00:00:27.310> we<00:00:27.550> made<00:00:27.730> the

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:27.759 
our thought process before we made the

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.390 
our thought process before we made the
change<00:00:28.060> we<00:00:28.269> suffer<00:00:28.570> the<00:00:28.659> goal<00:00:28.869> so<00:00:29.679> you<00:00:30.249> know<00:00:30.369> I

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
change we suffer the goal so you know I

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.739 
change we suffer the goal so you know I
think<00:00:30.550> the<00:00:30.789> nature<00:00:31.029> of<00:00:31.060> the<00:00:31.239> game<00:00:31.269> changes

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:31.749 
think the nature of the game changes

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:33.960 
think the nature of the game changes
also<00:00:31.960> I'm<00:00:32.290> if<00:00:32.710> we<00:00:32.950> manage<00:00:33.280> to<00:00:33.430> bring<00:00:33.640> him<00:00:33.790> on<00:00:33.940> a

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
also I'm if we manage to bring him on a

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.090 
also I'm if we manage to bring him on a
little<00:00:34.270> bit<00:00:34.390> off<00:00:34.989> we<00:00:35.350> don't<00:00:35.530> suffer<00:00:35.860> the<00:00:35.950> call

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
little bit off we don't suffer the call

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.970 
little bit off we don't suffer the call
in<00:00:36.220> that<00:00:36.340> moment<00:00:36.809> etnia<00:00:37.809> nilma<00:00:38.320> I<00:00:38.500> think<00:00:38.770> the

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
in that moment etnia nilma I think the

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.610 
in that moment etnia nilma I think the
impact<00:00:39.250> could<00:00:39.579> have<00:00:39.640> been<00:00:40.149> better<00:00:40.570> you<00:00:41.530> know

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
impact could have been better you know

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.920 
impact could have been better you know
then<00:00:41.890> after<00:00:42.160> you<00:00:42.250> play<00:00:42.489> as<00:00:43.059> I<00:00:43.210> said<00:00:43.390> more<00:00:43.750> with

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
then after you play as I said more with

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.750 
then after you play as I said more with
with<00:00:44.410> the<00:00:44.500> heart<00:00:44.710> and<00:00:45.039> then<00:00:45.460> with<00:00:45.579> that<00:00:47.760> I'm

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
with the heart and then with that I'm

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.709 
with the heart and then with that I'm
not<00:00:49.030> sure<00:00:49.179> if<00:00:49.329> it's<00:00:49.449> you<00:00:50.260> know<00:00:50.350> if<00:00:50.469> it's

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
not sure if it's you know if it's

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.779 
not sure if it's you know if it's
addressable<00:00:52.769> the<00:00:53.769> reset<00:00:54.100> certain<00:00:54.550> things

00:00:54.779 --> 00:00:54.789 
addressable the reset certain things

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:00.240 
addressable the reset certain things
that<00:00:54.899> are<00:00:56.070> are<00:00:57.070> related<00:00:57.699> to<00:00:57.730> to<00:00:58.539> emotion<00:00:59.050> to<00:00:59.260> to

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
that are are related to to emotion to to

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.470 
that are are related to to emotion to to
you<00:01:01.120> know<00:01:01.239> to<00:01:01.300> anxiety<00:01:02.109> to<00:01:02.739> concentration<00:01:03.480> I

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:04.480 
you know to anxiety to concentration I

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.429 
you know to anxiety to concentration I
think<00:01:05.550> you<00:01:06.550> know<00:01:06.670> maybe<00:01:06.910> we<00:01:07.840> are<00:01:08.020> at<00:01:08.320> the

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
think you know maybe we are at the

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.740 
think you know maybe we are at the
moment<00:01:08.530> being<00:01:08.829> more<00:01:09.040> reactive<00:01:09.610> rather<00:01:10.570> than

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
moment being more reactive rather than

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.080 
moment being more reactive rather than
anticipating<00:01:11.650> things<00:01:11.860> because<00:01:12.670> we<00:01:12.759> don't<00:01:12.939> get

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
anticipating things because we don't get

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.499 
anticipating things because we don't get
that<00:01:13.119> call<00:01:13.450> first<00:01:13.750> for<00:01:13.930> example<00:01:14.290> could<00:01:14.470> be<00:01:15.509> we

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
that call first for example could be we

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.590 
that call first for example could be we
managed<00:01:16.869> for<00:01:17.020> example<00:01:17.380> to<00:01:17.470> to<00:01:17.979> score<00:01:18.210> first<00:01:19.210> in

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
managed for example to to score first in

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.819 
managed for example to to score first in
the<00:01:19.750> game<00:01:19.869> against<00:01:20.140> West<00:01:20.320> Ramallah<00:01:20.680> game

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829 
the game against West Ramallah game

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:22.590 
the game against West Ramallah game
against<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.280> knowledge<00:01:21.759> but<00:01:22.119> then<00:01:22.240> Colonel

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
against the knowledge but then Colonel

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.969 
against the knowledge but then Colonel
Don<00:01:22.780> to<00:01:22.990> do<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:23.500> lid<00:01:23.649> so<00:01:24.640> it<00:01:24.670> could<00:01:25.270> be<00:01:25.979> various
