click<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.029> rendering<00:00:30.359> test<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:30.810> way

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
click the rendering test so that way

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.659 
click the rendering test so that way
it'll<00:00:31.140> say<00:00:31.349> so<00:00:31.410> point<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.189> actually<00:00:32.340> is

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
it'll say so point it actually is

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.580 
it'll say so point it actually is
running<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:33.120> three-point<00:00:33.510> oh<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:34.050> just<00:00:34.110> it

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
running in three-point oh it just it

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.680 
running in three-point oh it just it
goes<00:00:35.070> back<00:00:35.280> down<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.640> 1.1<00:00:36.120> when<00:00:36.360> it's<00:00:36.450> not<00:00:36.540> goes

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
goes back down to 1.1 when it's not goes

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.720 
goes back down to 1.1 when it's not goes
down<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.079> 2d<00:00:37.380> clocks<00:00:37.649> are<00:00:37.829> safe<00:00:37.950> power<00:00:38.190> yeah

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
down the 2d clocks are safe power yeah

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.569 
down the 2d clocks are safe power yeah
Oh<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.059> go<00:00:39.239> back<00:00:39.390> down<00:00:39.420> one<00:00:39.899> by<00:00:40.079> one<00:00:40.260> but<00:00:40.950> anyway

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
Oh to go back down one by one but anyway

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.139 
Oh to go back down one by one but anyway
and<00:00:42.149> we<00:00:42.390> also<00:00:42.510> have<00:00:42.690> msi<00:00:43.559> afterburner

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
and we also have msi afterburner

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.250 
and we also have msi afterburner
hardware<00:00:45.149> monitor<00:00:45.270> right<00:00:45.660> here<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:46.110> way

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
hardware monitor right here that way

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.900 
hardware monitor right here that way
because<00:00:46.440> kind<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.860> monitors<00:00:47.250> from<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.520> GP

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
because kind of monitors from the GP

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.670 
because kind of monitors from the GP
usage<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.539> see<00:00:48.750> what's<00:00:48.899> going<00:00:49.079> on<00:00:49.289> during<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
usage and see what's going on during the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.610 
usage and see what's going on during the
test<00:00:49.920> let's<00:00:50.430> get<00:00:50.579> after<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.059> test<00:00:51.350> so<00:00:52.350> let's

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
test let's get after the test so let's

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.740 
test let's get after the test so let's
go<00:00:52.739> ahead<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.920> run<00:00:53.190> this

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.200 

turn<00:00:56.320> the<00:00:56.440> light<00:00:56.590> off

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.500 

makes<00:00:59.870> like<00:01:00.110> no<00:01:00.140> difference<00:01:00.770> yeah<00:01:01.640> so<00:01:02.270> good

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
makes like no difference yeah so good

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.419 
makes like no difference yeah so good
this<00:01:02.629> cameras

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
like on the camera has a hard drive

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:17.090 
like on the camera has a hard drive
activity<00:01:09.990> light<00:01:13.310> alright<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:16.100> another

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
activity light alright so another

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.609 
activity light alright so another
positive<00:01:17.399> ID<00:01:17.880> say<00:01:18.240> about<00:01:18.600> doing<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.229> reviews

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
positive ID say about doing the reviews

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.699 
positive ID say about doing the reviews
in<00:01:19.829> this<00:01:19.979> test<00:01:20.159> format<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.530> get<00:01:22.649> to

00:01:22.699 --> 00:01:22.709 
in this test format is that you get to

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:25.669 
in this test format is that you get to
hear<00:01:22.890> accommodations<00:01:23.640> during<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.679> benchmark

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
hear accommodations during the benchmark

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:28.010 
hear accommodations during the benchmark

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
sort of experience what we do not quite

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.440 
sort of experience what we do not quite
as<00:01:39.810> much<00:01:39.959> but<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.399> 18th<00:01:41.849> time<00:01:42.209> you've

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
as much but on the 18th time you've

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.469 
as much but on the 18th time you've

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
story show and you can watch all the

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.800 
story show and you can watch all the
outtakes<00:01:47.670> ha<00:01:48.360> good<00:01:49.229> stuff<00:01:49.560> maybe<00:01:49.950> not<00:01:50.099> all<00:01:50.280> but

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
outtakes ha good stuff maybe not all but

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.339 
outtakes ha good stuff maybe not all but
um<00:01:52.099> so<00:01:53.099> yeah<00:01:53.250> 3dmark<00:01:54.149> 11<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.659> benchmark<00:01:55.110> I

00:01:55.339 --> 00:01:55.349 
um so yeah 3dmark 11 the benchmark I

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:57.289 
um so yeah 3dmark 11 the benchmark I
feel<00:01:55.709> it's<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:55.890> very<00:01:56.189> great<00:01:56.429> benchmark<00:01:56.879> because

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
feel it's a very great benchmark because

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.899 
feel it's a very great benchmark because
it's<00:01:57.899> only<00:01:58.319> the<00:01:58.439> best<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:59.399> probably<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.759> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
it's only the best it probably is the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.729 
it's only the best it probably is the
best<00:02:00.060> for<00:02:00.599> graphics<00:02:00.929> charge<00:02:01.140> because<00:02:01.439> it's<00:02:01.649> a

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:01.739 
best for graphics charge because it's a

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:04.550 
best for graphics charge because it's a
really<00:02:01.950> good<00:02:02.359> middle<00:02:03.359> ground<00:02:03.390> for<00:02:04.020> testing

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
really good middle ground for testing

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.789 
really good middle ground for testing
AMD<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.219> nvidia<00:02:05.549> cards<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.209> just<00:02:06.719> them<00:02:06.959> it

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
AMD and nvidia cards it just them it

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.289 
AMD and nvidia cards it just them it
doesn't<00:02:07.979> really<00:02:08.190> have<00:02:08.429> too<00:02:08.579> much<00:02:08.670> favoritism

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:09.299 
doesn't really have too much favoritism

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.530 
doesn't really have too much favoritism
like<00:02:09.479> say<00:02:09.869> heaven<00:02:10.859> might<00:02:11.310> have<00:02:11.579> with<00:02:11.940> physics

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
like say heaven might have with physics

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.940 
like say heaven might have with physics
and<00:02:12.720> all<00:02:12.780> that<00:02:12.989> stuff<00:02:13.170> or<00:02:13.530> like<00:02:13.560> an<00:02:13.799> actual

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
and all that stuff or like an actual

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.120 
and all that stuff or like an actual
game<00:02:14.310> like<00:02:14.549> borderlands<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.209> physics<00:02:15.630> enter

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
game like borderlands is physics enter

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.700 
game like borderlands is physics enter
so<00:02:18.130> it<00:02:18.640> is<00:02:18.790> not<00:02:18.970> too<00:02:19.270> it's<00:02:20.080> good<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.500> get<00:02:20.650> a

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
so it is not too it's good to get a

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.670 
so it is not too it's good to get a
pretty<00:02:21.510> straightforward<00:02:22.620> benchmark<00:02:23.620> that

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
pretty straightforward benchmark that

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.220 
pretty straightforward benchmark that
it's<00:02:24.430> going<00:02:24.790> to<00:02:24.880> show<00:02:25.060> actual<00:02:25.510> differences

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
it's going to show actual differences

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:35.780 
it's going to show actual differences
between<00:02:26.440> two<00:02:26.770> cards<00:02:27.190> or<00:02:27.400> ambien<00:02:28.240> video

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.920 

although<00:02:36.629> AMD<00:02:37.469> does<00:02:37.709> have<00:02:37.980> a<00:02:38.540> boat<00:02:39.540> ace<00:02:39.719> up

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
although AMD does have a boat ace up

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.770 
although AMD does have a boat ace up
their<00:02:40.079> sleeve<00:02:40.109> with<00:02:40.859> in<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:42.090> driver<00:02:42.329> version

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
their sleeve with in the driver version

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.339 
their sleeve with in the driver version
you<00:02:42.870> can<00:02:43.019> turn<00:02:43.230> off<00:02:44.060> directx<00:02:45.060> 11<00:02:45.719> tessellation

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
you can turn off directx 11 tessellation

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.030 
you can turn off directx 11 tessellation
so<00:02:47.099> it<00:02:47.849> greatly<00:02:48.510> increases<00:02:48.719> the<00:02:49.200> scores<00:02:49.680> of

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
so it greatly increases the scores of

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.960 
so it greatly increases the scores of
the<00:02:50.909> benchmark<00:02:51.359> and<00:02:52.250> but<00:02:53.250> it<00:02:53.370> does<00:02:53.549> make<00:02:53.790> it

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
the benchmark and but it does make it

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.910 
the benchmark and but it does make it
invalid<00:02:54.390> because<00:02:54.480> three<00:02:54.840> mark<00:02:55.140> can<00:02:55.409> detect

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
invalid because three mark can detect

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.339 
invalid because three mark can detect
that<00:02:56.099> so<00:02:56.790> if<00:02:57.000> someone<00:02:57.209> just<00:02:57.329> has<00:02:57.689> outrageous

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
that so if someone just has outrageous

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.490 
that so if someone just has outrageous
scores<00:02:58.739> that<00:02:59.129> the<00:02:59.430> other<00:02:59.609> stand<00:02:59.939> there<00:03:00.150> like

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
scores that the other stand there like

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:07.250 
scores that the other stand there like
their<00:03:01.500> 77<00:03:02.099> 70s<00:03:02.549> beaten<00:03:02.970> your<00:03:03.260> 650<00:03:04.400> Ti<00:03:05.400> then<00:03:06.260> you

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
their 77 70s beaten your 650 Ti then you

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.140 
their 77 70s beaten your 650 Ti then you
know<00:03:07.379> just<00:03:07.769> ask<00:03:07.889> for<00:03:08.069> 3dmark11<00:03:08.430> link<00:03:08.879> and<00:03:09.090> then

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
know just ask for 3dmark11 link and then

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.720 
know just ask for 3dmark11 link and then
you<00:03:09.299> can<00:03:09.450> see<00:03:09.659> that<00:03:10.049> they<00:03:10.920> really<00:03:10.950> cheating<00:03:11.579> or

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
you can see that they really cheating or

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.670 
you can see that they really cheating or
their<00:03:12.239> card<00:03:12.450> may<00:03:12.569> actually<00:03:13.049> be<00:03:13.319> better<00:03:13.500> than

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
their card may actually be better than

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.129 
their card may actually be better than
yours<00:03:15.349> as<00:03:16.349> far<00:03:16.590> as<00:03:16.620> lightning<00:03:17.069> go<00:03:17.250> sit<00:03:17.700> um<00:03:18.139> the

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
yours as far as lightning go sit um the

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:22.220 
yours as far as lightning go sit um the
auto<00:03:19.319> fan<00:03:19.709> I<00:03:20.269> don't<00:03:21.269> know<00:03:21.359> if<00:03:21.419> Ron<00:03:21.569> auto<00:03:21.810> fan<00:03:22.079> or

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
auto fan I don't know if Ron auto fan or

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.429 
auto fan I don't know if Ron auto fan or
not<00:03:22.260> but<00:03:22.590> fan<00:03:23.220> does<00:03:23.639> get<00:03:24.389> a<00:03:24.540> little<00:03:24.689> bit<00:03:24.900> noisy

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:25.439 
not but fan does get a little bit noisy

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:27.920 
not but fan does get a little bit noisy
and<00:03:25.530> it<00:03:25.650> does<00:03:25.859> a<00:03:25.889> very<00:03:26.400> a<00:03:26.489> lot<00:03:26.549> I<00:03:27.060> keep<00:03:27.689> saying

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
and it does a very a lot I keep saying

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.270 
and it does a very a lot I keep saying
um<00:03:28.200> for<00:03:28.829> some<00:03:28.980> reason<00:03:29.250> I<00:03:29.310> don't<00:03:29.370> know<00:03:29.519> why<00:03:29.810> but

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
um for some reason I don't know why but

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.009 
um for some reason I don't know why but
the<00:03:32.280> card<00:03:32.519> itself<00:03:32.669> it's<00:03:33.120> been<00:03:33.480> pretty<00:03:33.810> good

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
the card itself it's been pretty good

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.860 
the card itself it's been pretty good
i've<00:03:34.200> played<00:03:34.470> with<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:34.739> a<00:03:34.799> little<00:03:34.919> bit<00:03:35.010> on

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
i've played with it a little bit on

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.020 
i've played with it a little bit on
goers<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:37.139> handle<00:03:37.859> it<00:03:38.010> no<00:03:38.159> problem<00:03:38.519> didn't<00:03:38.909> get

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
goers to handle it no problem didn't get

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.360 
goers to handle it no problem didn't get
hot<00:03:39.299> at<00:03:39.419> all<00:03:39.510> into<00:03:39.930> max<00:03:40.139> temp<00:03:40.409> like<00:03:40.590> 53<00:03:41.220> or

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
hot at all into max temp like 53 or

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.430 
hot at all into max temp like 53 or
something<00:03:41.669> I've<00:03:41.790> got<00:03:41.970> it's<00:03:42.900> a<00:03:43.019> pretty<00:03:43.199> cool

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
something I've got it's a pretty cool

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.619 
something I've got it's a pretty cool
card<00:03:43.680> I'm<00:03:43.859> not<00:03:43.979> gonna<00:03:44.099> lie<00:03:44.310> after<00:03:45.239> seeing<00:03:45.419> you

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
card I'm not gonna lie after seeing you

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.869 
card I'm not gonna lie after seeing you
use<00:03:45.810> it<00:03:45.959> for<00:03:46.139> a<00:03:46.199> bit<00:03:46.349> I<00:03:46.620> was<00:03:47.549> pretty<00:03:47.699> impressed

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
use it for a bit I was pretty impressed

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.879 
use it for a bit I was pretty impressed
at<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.180> tempest<00:03:48.540> of<00:03:48.629> the<00:03:48.720> twin<00:03:48.900> frozr<00:03:49.169> for

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
at the tempest of the twin frozr for

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.900 
at the tempest of the twin frozr for
design

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
design

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.680 
design
yeah<00:03:52.510> and<00:03:53.230> I<00:03:53.710> mean<00:03:54.580> this<00:03:54.730> is<00:03:54.790> CP<00:03:55.210> abortions

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
yeah and I mean this is CP abortions

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.120 
yeah and I mean this is CP abortions
it's<00:03:55.990> nothing<00:03:56.350> to<00:03:56.440> do<00:03:56.560> with<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.770> Lightning

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
it's nothing to do with the Lightning

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.650 
it's nothing to do with the Lightning
but<00:03:59.070> some<00:04:00.070> of<00:04:00.160> the<00:04:00.250> FPS<00:04:01.210> numbers<00:04:01.540> were

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
but some of the FPS numbers were

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.170 
but some of the FPS numbers were
happening<00:04:02.200> before<00:04:02.320> we're<00:04:02.740> going<00:04:03.090> pretty<00:04:04.090> well

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
happening before we're going pretty well

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.720 
happening before we're going pretty well
yeah<00:04:04.900> I<00:04:05.170> mean<00:04:05.380> this<00:04:05.710> is<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:06.010> final<00:04:06.310> test<00:04:06.460> here

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
yeah I mean this is the final test here

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.460 
yeah I mean this is the final test here
and<00:04:06.970> it<00:04:07.210> always<00:04:07.330> positive<00:04:07.600> out<00:04:07.960> here<00:04:08.170> to<00:04:08.260> warm

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
and it always positive out here to warm

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.120 
and it always positive out here to warm
up<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:09.060> CPU<00:04:10.290> because<00:04:11.290> they<00:04:11.440> call<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:11.710> physics

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
up the CPU because they call the physics

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.130 
up the CPU because they call the physics
CPU<00:04:12.610> even<00:04:12.910> though<00:04:13.000> it's<00:04:13.120> not<00:04:13.180> nvidia<00:04:13.690> physics

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
CPU even though it's not nvidia physics

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.380 
CPU even though it's not nvidia physics
so<00:04:14.290> don't<00:04:14.710> get<00:04:14.830> confused<00:04:14.950> not<00:04:15.580> physics<00:04:16.090> is

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
so don't get confused not physics is

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.860 
so don't get confused not physics is
physics<00:04:16.600> yeah<00:04:17.260> will<00:04:17.709> differ<00:04:17.920> yeah

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.540 

here<00:04:21.680> we<00:04:21.799> go<00:04:23.260> this<00:04:24.260> is<00:04:24.440> a<00:04:24.470> pretty<00:04:25.160> good<00:04:25.340> test

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
here we go this is a pretty good test

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.430 
here we go this is a pretty good test
because<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:26.419> CPU<00:04:26.870> will<00:04:26.960> definitely<00:04:27.350> hold

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
because the CPU will definitely hold

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.890 
because the CPU will definitely hold
back<00:04:27.650> graphics<00:04:28.280> and<00:04:28.550> this<00:04:28.790> one<00:04:28.970> it's

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
back graphics and this one it's

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.180 
back graphics and this one it's
definitely<00:04:30.860> using<00:04:31.310> both<00:04:31.520> things<00:04:31.970> and<00:04:33.190> it's

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 
definitely using both things and it's

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.250 
definitely using both things and it's
pretty<00:04:34.370> good<00:04:34.580> for<00:04:34.639> one<00:04:34.940> card<00:04:35.210> we<00:04:35.960> got<00:04:36.139> like

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
pretty good for one card we got like

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.180 
pretty good for one card we got like
thirty<00:04:36.500> three<00:04:36.710> frames<00:04:37.010> at<00:04:37.220> the<00:04:37.340> end<00:04:39.190> yeah

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
thirty three frames at the end yeah

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.700 
thirty three frames at the end yeah
looking<00:04:40.550> good<00:04:40.630> alright<00:04:41.630> let's<00:04:41.960> see<00:04:42.169> yeah<00:04:42.380> see

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
looking good alright let's see yeah see

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.409 
looking good alright let's see yeah see
the<00:04:43.490> skull<00:04:44.560> alright<00:04:45.560> so<00:04:45.919> our<00:04:46.130> total<00:04:46.580> scores<00:04:47.120> of

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
the skull alright so our total scores of

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.450 
the skull alright so our total scores of
thousand<00:04:48.139> one<00:04:48.320> hundred<00:04:48.350> ten<00:04:48.860> ten<00:04:49.100> thousand

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
thousand one hundred ten ten thousand

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.000 
thousand one hundred ten ten thousand
one<00:04:49.550> hundred<00:04:49.580> ninety<00:04:50.090> with<00:04:50.960> the<00:04:51.110> GPU<00:04:51.590> score

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
one hundred ninety with the GPU score

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.240 
one hundred ninety with the GPU score
being<00:04:52.750> 10,300<00:04:53.750> one<00:04:53.930> and<00:04:54.169> the<00:04:54.260> fit<00:04:54.500> cpu<00:04:54.979> score

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
being 10,300 one and the fit cpu score

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.250 
being 10,300 one and the fit cpu score
being<00:04:55.430> eleven<00:04:55.789> thousand<00:04:56.210> i<00:04:56.330> don't<00:04:56.840> know<00:04:57.050> how

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
being eleven thousand i don't know how

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.760 
being eleven thousand i don't know how
with<00:04:57.440> both<00:04:57.620> those<00:04:57.919> add<00:04:58.220> up<00:04:58.250> to<00:04:58.490> cream<00:04:58.699> under

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
with both those add up to cream under

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.520 
with both those add up to cream under
there<00:05:00.770> you<00:05:00.830> marry<00:05:00.979> mark<00:05:01.370> uh<00:05:01.970> so<00:05:02.960> yeah<00:05:03.110> that<00:05:03.410> was

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
there you marry mark uh so yeah that was

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.290 
there you marry mark uh so yeah that was
pretty<00:05:03.740> much<00:05:03.919> the<00:05:03.979> remark<00:05:04.460> yeah<00:05:04.639> as<00:05:05.060> you<00:05:05.210> can

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
pretty much the remark yeah as you can

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.890 
pretty much the remark yeah as you can
see<00:05:05.570> we<00:05:05.810> have<00:05:05.990> some<00:05:06.550> particularly<00:05:07.550> odd<00:05:08.240> usage

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
see we have some particularly odd usage

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.409 
see we have some particularly odd usage
actually<00:05:09.440> and<00:05:10.100> the<00:05:10.340> physics<00:05:10.669> course<00:05:10.880> so<00:05:11.090> high

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419 
actually and the physics course so high

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:14.050 
actually and the physics course so high
I<00:05:12.050> learned<00:05:12.710> about<00:05:12.800> the<00:05:13.039> GPU<00:05:13.400> score<00:05:13.699> down<00:05:13.850> here

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
I learned about the GPU score down here

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.029 
I learned about the GPU score down here
and<00:05:14.180> after<00:05:14.270> birth<00:05:14.539> okay<00:05:15.199> yeah<00:05:15.440> I'm<00:05:15.710> on<00:05:15.860> it<00:05:15.889> I

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 
and after birth okay yeah I'm on it I

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.879 
and after birth okay yeah I'm on it I
know<00:05:16.190> don't<00:05:16.550> know<00:05:16.669> why<00:05:16.820> its<00:05:17.560> varying<00:05:18.560> so<00:05:18.740> much

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 
know don't know why its varying so much

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:20.050 
know don't know why its varying so much
I<00:05:19.039> thought<00:05:19.190> I'm<00:05:19.340> not<00:05:19.460> sure<00:05:19.699> if<00:05:19.820> that<00:05:19.850> has

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
I thought I'm not sure if that has

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.879 
I thought I'm not sure if that has
something<00:05:20.090> to<00:05:20.449> do<00:05:20.570> with<00:05:20.750> GPU<00:05:21.169> boost<00:05:21.470> or<00:05:21.710> not

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:21.889 
something to do with GPU boost or not

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:24.460 
something to do with GPU boost or not
i'm<00:05:22.160> pretty<00:05:22.520> sure<00:05:22.789> but<00:05:23.060> with<00:05:23.270> an<00:05:23.419> older<00:05:23.750> like<00:05:24.440> a

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
i'm pretty sure but with an older like a

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:25.990 
i'm pretty sure but with an older like a
fairy<00:05:24.770> me<00:05:24.919> or<00:05:25.039> something<00:05:25.370> it'll<00:05:25.520> just<00:05:25.820> be<00:05:25.940> at

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
fairy me or something it'll just be at

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.029 
fairy me or something it'll just be at
99<00:05:26.479> like<00:05:26.690> this<00:05:28.479> haven't<00:05:29.479> really<00:05:29.539> taken<00:05:30.039> really

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 
99 like this haven't really taken really

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.270 
99 like this haven't really taken really
monitored<00:05:31.580> all<00:05:31.820> the<00:05:32.470> GPU<00:05:33.470> boost<00:05:33.680> work<00:05:33.950> so<00:05:34.250> i

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
monitored all the GPU boost work so i

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.430 
monitored all the GPU boost work so i
don't<00:05:34.460> know<00:05:34.550> if<00:05:34.669> that<00:05:34.700> that's<00:05:35.630> normal<00:05:36.050> or<00:05:36.229> i

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
don't know if that that's normal or i

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.659 
don't know if that that's normal or i
don't<00:05:36.530> know<00:05:36.650> if<00:05:36.710> this<00:05:37.070> car<00:05:37.340> just<00:05:37.370> had<00:05:37.639> a

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
don't know if this car just had a

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:39.310 
don't know if this car just had a
problem<00:05:37.910> right<00:05:38.210> now<00:05:38.240> or<00:05:38.599> if<00:05:38.690> this<00:05:38.840> available

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
problem right now or if this available

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.230 
problem right now or if this available
so<00:05:39.740> I'm<00:05:39.979> gonna<00:05:40.099> go<00:05:40.250> with<00:05:40.310> normal<00:05:40.700> we're<00:05:40.970> just

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
so I'm gonna go with normal we're just

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.240 
so I'm gonna go with normal we're just
gonna<00:05:41.360> have<00:05:41.539> to<00:05:41.660> wait<00:05:41.690> what<00:05:42.620> time<00:05:42.830> tell<00:05:43.070> about

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
gonna have to wait what time tell about

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.670 
gonna have to wait what time tell about
that<00:05:43.520> right<00:05:43.760> so<00:05:44.479> I<00:05:44.510> think<00:05:44.599> pretty<00:05:45.169> much<00:05:45.260> it<00:05:45.620> for

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
that right so I think pretty much it for

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.540 
that right so I think pretty much it for
the<00:05:46.039> 50<00:05:46.280> mark<00:05:46.400> 11<00:05:46.639> go<00:05:47.389> ahead<00:05:47.599> and<00:05:48.070> sit<00:05:49.070> here<00:05:49.370> and

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
the 50 mark 11 go ahead and sit here and

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.700 
the 50 mark 11 go ahead and sit here and
now<00:05:49.729> sit<00:05:50.000> next<00:05:50.210> then<00:05:50.570> wait<00:05:50.780> playlist<00:05:51.530> for

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
now sit next then wait playlist for

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.190 
now sit next then wait playlist for
advantage
