00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
 Halli hello and welcome to the 14th episode 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.300
 of the packet loris and yes we want today 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.480
 Let's see if he does not 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.710
 maybe from free-clean and 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.210
 Surprises fact sees itself already 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.070
 a bit older than the recordings 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.010
 again these two for free now 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.449
 Get them from trading sets 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.369
 and we will on this account 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.070
 you go last week or so that was 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.230
 like last or penultimate and hers 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.090
 first ten 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.160
 but our best player in the set is 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.380
 In addition , there you go again 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.770
 two beautiful league fail me 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.510
 pleased that games and the 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.000
 could definitely if you do not 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:47.969
 directly in fits loose fluffy than 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.610
 thick players come in as bank 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.949
 As a joker player we could get up 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.320
 I'm on my way anyhow 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.940
 any case of opinion and we hope 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:03.480
 therefore, the first was not even like that 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.949
 bad go right into 21 2012 and 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.470
 in the second we draw as best 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:13.020
 berbatov or old but he expects too 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.909
 he is not necessarily me now 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.990
 I thought maybe I but I sell 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.490
 have two requests so far so yes 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.580
 unfortunately repel just like that 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.430
 manunited coat of arms or minute jersey with 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.530
 jersey I think but good now 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.360
 everything not given so bad for him 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.130
 So you can live with it 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.369
 our new jerseys are now everton 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.680
 and this swansea jersey is not like that 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.810
 bad come I think women's jerseys 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.189
 actually pass on relatively new 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.470
 In any case, it does not look 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.939
 I have to play that looks pretty good 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.630
 that is why it is not so bad that we 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.700
 we have that look again from 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.439
 the transfer market and see that I am the 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.430
 one agent the other because argentina 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.640
 addition will have sold and - and 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.190
 we have already taken action 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.410
 the approach of a bundesliga team 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.900
 perfect with natural king slider 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.490
 in the front but otherwise it looks 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.289
 not bad we might come from 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.310
 soon my full national league team 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.830
 muster 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.780
 but of course we have nothing partie 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.330
 go play with our 4 2 2 2 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.520
 with hired and should hello front in there and 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.220
 come in the first game against this 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.300
 4-2-3-1 league of the lot with in form 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.300
 Jonas in the front 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.350
 the opponent had tan us only 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.060
 alexander cisco and so right and so 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.840
 he is also defensive against with waran 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.820
 well staffed and not so slow 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.830
 and humor like if you only with priol 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.459
 and so I do not know though 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.380
 no matter 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.390
 then the soko was nice dribbling 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.250
 Off to the flank is not so bad 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.530
 However, only becomes dangerous as 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.720
 Joe cole you come to the ball and at 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.130
 centimeters past the post sat down 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.540
 already as were clearly superior in 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.870
 the beginning of the next opportunity 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.890
 again kohl ball is cleared for 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:06.650
 first awning then for ambrosini 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.880
 deflected and again just over then 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.209
 but probably the next 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.299
 occurs from 17,000 at the first pass on 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:18.110
 second past the third one over then 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:20.870
 the edge-the Nietzschean and there is the 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.930
 1 0 a miracle wonderful door 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:28.130
 class since consumption of youtube before 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.650
 of course a wonderful child of cisco 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:34.720
 the no2 pose is it has so you have to 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:38.269
 the tire got added but 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.220
 every goal and that deserved 1 0 afterwards 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.110
 the long tee of keeper nico 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.870
 comes to the ball and plays the ball 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.860
 Continue on Joe Cole who moves into the 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:51.260
 middle shoots 2 0 and thus had the 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.930
 Opponent then enough and then will 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.519
 here right now quince so far 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.360
 i remember i hope i say 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.700
 now nothing wrong 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.590
 but alone 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.540
 the arena offers our opponent at the same time 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.019
 a theme by joe kohlen tor 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.180
 he has had enough although a top in 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.680
 form voice of grammar could become 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.069
 do not afford to try again 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.180
 to come back to us in the lot 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.800
 I do not care we get it 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.600
 still few coins how to get the 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.310
 victory and we get the title above all else 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.310
 again much closer we see the same 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:25.450
 be and against that had no chance 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:28.210
 so maybe you can go somewhere 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.740
 understand that Mr. Wilson you see 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.229
 Welcome the titles closer than ever 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.900
 we turned him over so that's it 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:37.810
 very early it will be 4000 coins in 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.790
 the bank and with it we come to a grave 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.300
 a gold chain again and again 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.490
 closer 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.050
 as next or after next episode 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.630
 should be able to get one again 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.550
 buy ex partie again league bbva with 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.740
 ramos and pepe this time in the back with 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.330
 takers and when they are behind you 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.550
 I want to personally and 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.550
 The cost exchange position but 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.020
 well just that his grieÃŸmann from and di 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.880
 Maria had also on the outside 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.669
 So really good team our first 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:07.389
 chance ambrosini on awnings and 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:09.250
 There are already 100 opponents 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:12.100
 Bit of our surprise 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.750
 attack football and therefore one to zero 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.370
 but he also went down then the first 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:20.139
 chance in the twentieth minute 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:21.970
 but if she was well no, I wanted to 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.889
 insert the first chance because the 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.930
 our opponent did not really have one 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:28.690
 good show his next action should be there 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.389
 in addition class by against ramos and 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:35.139
 at the far post lurks meacham and 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:37.240
 dusted off to 2 0 so here too it looked 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.800
 again very good if soldado 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.880
 By the way, there is nothing else 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:45.099
 also meters and therefore good in the end 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.830
 The ball does not give you the opportunity 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:49.750
 ambrosini from the distance directly minute 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.210
 but later casillas with a great 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.160
 reflex the following corner is not 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.430
 now suitable for this purpose but no 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.840
 kind of an account from nama and that was 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.289
 not really well done by ours 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.770
 opponent 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:02.789
 I was a bit 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.440
 I was a little scared that I was like that 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:06.569
 bad the keeper got out but 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.879
 He had no use therefore 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:11.370
 in the end everything went well next 

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:13.710
 opportunity bensel measure head at will 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.419
 dangerous but empty is not possible 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.909
 so it stayed at the 20th 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:21.569
 then the opponent allowed himself today 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:22.800
 mistake kieran gibbs but again casillas 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:25.710
 on the post 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.080
 So I have to say that I do not seem to be 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:30.360
 to be a bad keeper though he is not so 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.220
 the biggest is quite honest against 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.370
 I usually keep everything you like 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.169
 can hold at all and therefore so 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.599
 bad can not be andrÃ© dias then 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:42.360
 also the 13 0 after a corner there is a 

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:44.099
 a bit in the middle of nothing 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.840
 directly the next attack after the 

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:48.060
 connection with show goes past the first 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.620
 double pass attempt with soldado 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.470
 blocked because he is lying down or 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:55.159
 should be fouled by that and the four 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:58.409
 to zero, and of course that 

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:59.729
 knockout in the 70 minute the no 

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:01.139
 chance more of the opponents yet 

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:04.319
 so come back so yes 

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:05.729
 play a fourth sovereign and pick up jo 

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:08.969
 so again the first three 

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:11.909
 points in the new league as we said 

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:13.770
 have now characterized the 4000 coins form 

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:15.780
 title last season right now 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:18.029
 also completed for your one 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:21.719
 a little money and then want next 

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:23.340
 game exists so nothing episode try 

00:07:21.719 --> 00:07:25.680
 that we get back to the 7,500 people 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:28.919
 come the new set and let's see what we do 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:31.680
 it's what's good when you do it 

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:33.270
 always good but yes there we come 

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.529
 someday to speak so if 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.029
 I had a rescue from them 

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:37.529
 you are happy and of course we have too 

00:07:36.029 --> 00:07:40.190
 not at the next video as I want 

00:07:37.529 --> 00:07:40.190
 show by then German
