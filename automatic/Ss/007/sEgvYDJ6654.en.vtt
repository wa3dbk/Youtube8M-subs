pins<00:01:49.369> more<00:01:50.369> cables<00:01:51.500> more<00:01:52.500> molex<00:01:52.920> adapters<00:01:53.430> and

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
pins more cables more molex adapters and

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.310 
pins more cables more molex adapters and
once<00:01:55.380> again<00:01:56.030> get<00:01:57.030> some<00:01:57.240> more<00:01:57.329> cables<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:58.140> has

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
once again get some more cables so has

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.810 
once again get some more cables so has
plenty<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.649> cables<00:01:59.070> included<00:01:59.159> with<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.610> fan

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
plenty of cables included with the fan

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.889 
plenty of cables included with the fan
controller<00:02:00.180> for<00:02:00.420> all<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.630> fan

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
controller for all the fan

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.459 
controller for all the fan
configurations<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.979> may<00:02:02.159> need<00:02:02.399> and

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:03.469 
configurations that you may need and

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:06.080 
configurations that you may need and
here's<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.649> main<00:02:04.860> attraction<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.790> fat

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
here's the main attraction the fat

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.210 
here's the main attraction the fat
controller<00:02:06.420> itself<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:07.170> it's<00:02:07.979> very

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
controller itself I it's very

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.619 
controller itself I it's very
necessarily<00:02:08.610> have<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.759> piece<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.119> protective

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
necessarily have a piece of protective

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.390 
necessarily have a piece of protective
foam<00:02:09.780> on<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:09.989> bottom<00:02:10.080> we<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.530> protect<00:02:11.039> all<00:02:11.250> the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
foam on the bottom we to protect all the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.200 
foam on the bottom we to protect all the
circuitry<00:02:11.910> for<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.540> fan<00:02:12.720> controller

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
circuitry for the fan controller

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.860 
circuitry for the fan controller
I<00:02:13.800> will<00:02:14.800> note<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.070> this<00:02:15.490> is<00:02:15.550> a<00:02:16.060> very<00:02:16.480> very

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
I will note that this is a very very

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.750 
I will note that this is a very very
nice<00:02:17.200> touch<00:02:17.530> here<00:02:17.800> you<00:02:18.130> can<00:02:18.220> see<00:02:18.400> that<00:02:18.580> the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
nice touch here you can see that the

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.790 
nice touch here you can see that the
aluminum<00:02:19.720> is<00:02:19.840> actually<00:02:20.230> brushed<00:02:20.590> metal

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
aluminum is actually brushed metal

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.100 
aluminum is actually brushed metal
painted<00:02:21.370> black<00:02:21.640> most<00:02:22.510> fat<00:02:22.690> controllers

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
painted black most fat controllers

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.660 
painted black most fat controllers
actually<00:02:23.470> keep<00:02:23.680> this<00:02:23.830> in<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.130> gray<00:02:24.400> color

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
actually keep this in the gray color

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.400 
actually keep this in the gray color
which<00:02:24.910> I<00:02:25.030> think<00:02:25.270> looks<00:02:25.300> horrible<00:02:25.900> this

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
which I think looks horrible this

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.380 
which I think looks horrible this
actually<00:02:26.620> looks<00:02:26.860> very<00:02:27.220> very<00:02:27.310> nice<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:27.940> the

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
actually looks very very nice and the

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.030 
actually looks very very nice and the
front<00:02:28.630> of<00:02:28.720> course<00:02:28.960> does<00:02:29.290> have<00:02:29.500> some<00:02:29.740> metal

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
front of course does have some metal

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.400 
front of course does have some metal
mesh<00:02:30.250> which<00:02:30.970> looks<00:02:31.300> great<00:02:31.570> and<00:02:31.750> would<00:02:32.230> go

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
mesh which looks great and would go

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.080 
mesh which looks great and would go
along<00:02:32.500> with<00:02:32.890> certain<00:02:33.160> cases<00:02:33.340> such<00:02:33.730> as<00:02:33.760> the

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
along with certain cases such as the

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.940 
along with certain cases such as the
cooler<00:02:34.480> master<00:02:34.870> cases<00:02:35.230> that<00:02:35.380> have<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.680> mesh

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
cooler master cases that have the mesh

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.610 
cooler master cases that have the mesh
the<00:02:36.850> buns<00:02:37.120> are<00:02:37.300> also<00:02:37.450> brushed<00:02:37.960> metal<00:02:38.140> look

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
the buns are also brushed metal look

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.370 
the buns are also brushed metal look
fantastic<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:40.540> can<00:02:40.660> see<00:02:40.750> we<00:02:40.840> have<00:02:40.870> some<00:02:41.050> LEDs

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
fantastic you can see we have some LEDs

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.930 
fantastic you can see we have some LEDs
on<00:02:41.560> top<00:02:41.770> and<00:02:41.950> some<00:02:42.100> switches<00:02:42.430> on<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.640> bottom

I'm<00:02:43.090> pretty<00:02:43.690> sure<00:02:43.810> that<00:02:43.900> this<00:02:43.990> controls<00:02:44.350> the

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
I'm pretty sure that this controls the

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.130 
I'm pretty sure that this controls the
PWM<00:02:45.100> or<00:02:45.340> manual<00:02:45.820> control<00:02:46.120> function<00:02:46.570> and<00:02:46.780> of
