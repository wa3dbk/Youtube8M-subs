fives the compounds a little harder but
the<00:02:15.280> sidewalls<00:02:15.670> a<00:02:15.730> little<00:02:15.970> softer<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:17.320> they

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
the sidewalls a little softer and they

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.370 
the sidewalls a little softer and they
actually<00:02:17.740> feel<00:02:17.890> really<00:02:17.920> good<00:02:18.250> so<00:02:18.640> we<00:02:19.210> were

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
actually feel really good so we were

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.200 
actually feel really good so we were
setting<00:02:20.380> up<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.650> car<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:21.460> run<00:02:21.610> on<00:02:21.760> those<00:02:21.880> tires

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.680 

overall<00:03:29.740> I<00:03:29.770> mean<00:03:29.980> it<00:03:30.940> was<00:03:31.150> a<00:03:31.180> big<00:03:31.450> challenge

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
overall I mean it was a big challenge

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.390 
overall I mean it was a big challenge
and<00:03:32.050> we<00:03:32.500> were<00:03:32.560> looking<00:03:32.680> forward<00:03:33.100> to<00:03:33.220> making

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
and we were looking forward to making

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.180 
and we were looking forward to making
more<00:03:33.550> improvements<00:03:34.390> to<00:03:34.960> come<00:03:35.620> out<00:03:35.740> stronger

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
more improvements to come out stronger

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:51.400 
more improvements to come out stronger
for<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.400> finale<00:03:36.670> at<00:03:36.910> Irwindale<00:03:37.120> Speedway
