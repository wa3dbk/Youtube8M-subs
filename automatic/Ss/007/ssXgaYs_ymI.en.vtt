00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:31.859

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
so he's supposed to have two there and

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.110 
so he's supposed to have two there and
he<00:02:33.930> has<00:02:34.019> two<00:02:34.230> on<00:02:34.379> this<00:02:34.560> side<00:02:34.799> and<00:02:35.340> two<00:02:35.670> on<00:02:35.849> this

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
he has two on this side and two on this

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.690 
he has two on this side and two on this
side<00:02:36.180> these<00:02:37.079> are<00:02:37.139> actually<00:02:37.590> slit<00:02:38.129> open<00:02:38.489> and

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
side these are actually slit open and

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.569 
side these are actually slit open and
actually<00:02:39.540> patched<00:02:39.750> up<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.260> is<00:02:40.379> nice<00:02:40.680> I

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
think I made it a little bit too short

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.179 
think I made it a little bit too short
but<00:02:44.670> aside<00:02:45.599> from<00:02:45.659> that<00:02:45.989> I<00:02:46.230> am<00:02:46.560> quite<00:02:46.829> happy

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:47.189 
but aside from that I am quite happy

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:49.000
