00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
At the beginning it was a bit traumatic for me, 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
because not only do I come from a small town, 
but also from a Catholic family,

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.700
and the Catholic Church is pretty sceptical
towards non-heterosexual people. 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.750
At the beginning I thought I was bisexual, 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.550
I thought it was better, 
that I still had a chance to be with a boy. 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.100
My family wouldn't be so ashamed.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:47.250
But after some time I started to realize
that I simply wasn't interested in boys. 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.800
It was then when I realized that I prefer girls.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:59.950
I was in middle school and I started to think
about my sexuality and I was wondering 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
that everyone had their other halves
and I was by myself and I was thinking about it 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:11.550
and I realized that girls just don't appeal to me, 
and I thought that I might be gay,

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.000
but I didn't want to accept it, 
I thought it might pass or something...

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:24.000
But later I accepted it and I realized 
it was normal and I could live with it.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.000
At first I didn't want to admit that I liked girls,

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.900
because of how others would react.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.000
I only accepted the thought I was bisexual. 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.000
Someone once asked me: 
„Are you a faggot?”

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.750
And I said: 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.300
„No, I'm not a faggot. I'm gay. 
A faggot is a dish.”

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.600
This was the end of the conversation,
that person accepted my answer. 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.000
It was in middle school...

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I realized that I definitely find girls attractive. 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.300
Then I only had to check if I liked boys as well. 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.000
I've heard different opinions...

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.300
I've heard people say that God rejects me, 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.000
that God despises me,
that I'm damned forever.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.000
But I've also heard that 
God accepts me for who I am. 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.400
I dream about owning a restaurant. 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:35.100
I love to cook 
so it'd be the coolest thing ever. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:47.800
I dream that everyone leads the life they want 
and no one is afraid. 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.700
That things change
and the society is open for other things, 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:01.350
not only typically 'normal' things, 
but it's open to diversity.
