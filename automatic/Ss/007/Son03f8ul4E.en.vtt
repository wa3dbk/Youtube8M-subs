markets two types of switches a clicky
switch<00:00:10.349> and<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.830> dampened<00:00:11.400> tactile<00:00:12.059> switch

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
switch and a dampened tactile switch

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.629 
switch and a dampened tactile switch
which<00:00:12.750> they<00:00:12.929> refer<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.290> as<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.740> quiet<00:00:14.160> click

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
which they refer to as a quiet click

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.129 
which they refer to as a quiet click
switch<00:00:14.820> but<00:00:15.330> that's<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.630> bit<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:15.929> misnomer

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
switch but that's a bit of a misnomer

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.060 
switch but that's a bit of a misnomer
because<00:00:16.680> it's<00:00:17.039> not<00:00:17.220> clicky<00:00:17.670> it's<00:00:17.850> tactile<00:00:18.420> and

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
because it's not clicky it's tactile and

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.519 
because it's not clicky it's tactile and
to<00:00:20.070> me<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.520> two<00:00:20.699> switches<00:00:21.289> immediately<00:00:22.289> beg

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
to me the two switches immediately beg

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.679 
to me the two switches immediately beg
the<00:00:22.680> question<00:00:22.859> what<00:00:23.760> happens<00:00:24.210> when<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.480> take

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
the question what happens when you take

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.439 
the question what happens when you take
a<00:00:24.720> clicky<00:00:25.289> switch<00:00:25.590> but<00:00:26.189> substitute<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:27.060> a

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
a clicky switch but substitute in a

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.839 
a clicky switch but substitute in a
tactile<00:00:27.990> leaf<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.619> what<00:00:29.160> happens<00:00:29.580> when<00:00:29.730> you

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
tactile leaf and what happens when you

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.139 
tactile leaf and what happens when you
take<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.119> dampened<00:00:30.779> tactile<00:00:31.320> switch<00:00:31.679> and

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
take a dampened tactile switch and

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:34.819 
take a dampened tactile switch and
substitute<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.510> clicky<00:00:33.780> leaf<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.649> that's

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
substitute in a clicky leaf and that's

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.430 
substitute in a clicky leaf and that's
exactly<00:00:35.070> what<00:00:35.370> I've<00:00:35.489> done<00:00:35.520> here<00:00:35.989> so<00:00:36.989> on<00:00:37.410> the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
exactly what I've done here so on the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.860 
exactly what I've done here so on the
Left<00:00:38.040> I've<00:00:38.370> got<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.940> commercially<00:00:39.780> available

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
Left I've got a commercially available

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.920 
Left I've got a commercially available
mattias<00:00:40.710> click<00:00:41.100> switch<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.670> on<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.390> right<00:00:42.600> is

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
mattias click switch and on the right is

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.270 
mattias click switch and on the right is
a<00:00:42.989> commercially<00:00:43.739> available

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
a commercially available

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.660 
a commercially available
mattias<00:00:45.090> dampened<00:00:45.899> tactile<00:00:46.440> switch<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.129> then

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
mattias dampened tactile switch and then

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.639 
mattias dampened tactile switch and then
here<00:00:47.940> I've<00:00:48.120> taken<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.600> dampened<00:00:49.110> tactile

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
here I've taken a dampened tactile

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.830 
here I've taken a dampened tactile
switch<00:00:49.950> but<00:00:50.309> substituted<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.210> clicky<00:00:51.539> leaf

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
switch but substituted in a clicky leaf

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.279 
switch but substituted in a clicky leaf
and<00:00:52.140> here<00:00:52.949> I've<00:00:53.219> taken<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.879> clicky<00:00:54.420> switch<00:00:54.809> but

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
and here I've taken a clicky switch but

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.680 
and here I've taken a clicky switch but
substituted<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.219> tactile<00:00:56.640> leaf<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.510> that

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
substituted in the tactile leaf so that

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.299 
substituted in the tactile leaf so that
to<00:00:57.809> give<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.199> respectively

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
to give you respectively

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.360 
to give you respectively
quiet<00:01:00.149> click<00:01:00.539> switch<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.109> tactile<00:01:02.010> switch

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
quiet click switch and tactile switch

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.660 
quiet click switch and tactile switch
and<00:01:03.680> first<00:01:04.680> we'll<00:01:04.890> start<00:01:05.010> with<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> simple

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
and first we'll start with a simple

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:46.569 
and first we'll start with a simple
sound<00:01:06.119> comparison<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.170> four

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.550 

so<00:01:47.579> what<00:01:47.880> have<00:01:47.969> we<00:01:48.090> learned<00:01:48.270> from<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.659> well

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
so what have we learned from this well

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.130 
so what have we learned from this well
it<00:01:50.009> should<00:01:50.219> be<00:01:50.369> pretty<00:01:50.640> easy<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:51.299> notice<00:01:51.689> not

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
it should be pretty easy to notice not

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.889 
it should be pretty easy to notice not
the<00:01:52.409> non<00:01:52.709> damped<00:01:53.219> switches<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.479> clicky

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
the non damped switches so the clicky

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.830 
the non damped switches so the clicky
switch<00:01:55.229> in<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.560> tactile<00:01:55.950> switch<00:01:56.509> sound<00:01:57.509> very

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
switch in the tactile switch sound very

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.580 
switch in the tactile switch sound very
ratalie<00:02:02.450> whereas<00:02:03.450> their<00:02:03.630> dampen<00:02:04.079> switches

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
ratalie whereas their dampen switches

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.919 
ratalie whereas their dampen switches
and<00:02:04.890> sound<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:05.789> little<00:02:06.030> bit<00:02:06.149> more<00:02:06.299> elegant<00:02:06.629> in

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:06.929 
and sound a little bit more elegant in

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.690 
and sound a little bit more elegant in
that<00:02:07.079> regard<00:02:09.890> you<00:02:10.890> can't<00:02:11.160> really<00:02:11.370> hear<00:02:11.549> the

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
that regard you can't really hear the

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.930 
that regard you can't really hear the
plastic<00:02:12.180> all<00:02:12.329> that<00:02:12.510> well

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
plastic all that well

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.390 
plastic all that well
the<00:02:14.940> quiet<00:02:15.810> clicks<00:02:16.290> which<00:02:16.650> is<00:02:16.980> also

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
the quiet clicks which is also

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.460 
the quiet clicks which is also
substantially<00:02:18.209> more<00:02:18.420> silent<00:02:19.049> than<00:02:19.140> the

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
substantially more silent than the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.100 
substantially more silent than the
tactile<00:02:19.950> switch<00:02:20.329> presumably<00:02:21.329> as<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.569> result<00:02:21.959> of

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
tactile switch presumably as a result of

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.780 
tactile switch presumably as a result of
that<00:02:24.920> it's<00:02:25.920> just<00:02:26.129> the<00:02:26.250> rattling<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.760> the

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
that it's just the rattling of the

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.309 
that it's just the rattling of the
switch<00:02:27.120> really<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.599> makes<00:02:27.840> all<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.109> noise

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
switch really that makes all the noise

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.979 
switch really that makes all the noise
the<00:02:29.040> quiet<00:02:29.340> clicks<00:02:29.760> which<00:02:30.090> is<00:02:30.540> interesting

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
the quiet clicks which is interesting

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.319 
the quiet clicks which is interesting
because<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:32.160> clicking<00:02:32.549> noise<00:02:32.579> is<00:02:32.970> not<00:02:33.090> all

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
because the clicking noise is not all

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.520 
because the clicking noise is not all
that<00:02:33.359> loud<00:02:34.579> so<00:02:35.579> if<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:35.970> want<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.480> keyboard<00:02:37.470> that

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
that loud so if you want a keyboard that

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.370 
that loud so if you want a keyboard that
still<00:02:38.010> gives<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.400> all<00:02:38.670> all<00:02:38.880> feedback<00:02:39.349> but<00:02:40.349> you

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
still gives you all all feedback but you

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.170 
still gives you all all feedback but you
don't<00:02:40.769> want<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.099> really<00:02:41.280> loud<00:02:41.549> one<00:02:41.849> like<00:02:42.060> the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
don't want the really loud one like the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.479 
don't want the really loud one like the
actual<00:02:42.590> clicky<00:02:43.590> switch<00:02:43.920> which<00:02:44.160> can<00:02:44.340> make<00:02:44.430> a

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
actual clicky switch which can make a

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.699 
actual clicky switch which can make a
lot<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:44.760> noise<00:02:45.000> then<00:02:45.720> maybe<00:02:46.200> that's<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.560> good

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
lot of noise then maybe that's a good

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.370 
lot of noise then maybe that's a good
compromise<00:02:47.060> say<00:02:48.060> for<00:02:48.299> instance<00:02:48.630> for<00:02:48.840> an

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
compromise say for instance for an

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.839 
compromise say for instance for an
OpenOffice<00:02:49.980> or<00:02:50.340> something

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
OpenOffice or something

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.970 
OpenOffice or something
and<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.690> key<00:02:51.840> feels<00:02:52.109> also<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.560> little<00:02:52.799> bit

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
and the key feels also a little bit

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.599 
and the key feels also a little bit
different<00:02:53.609> the<00:02:54.090> quiet<00:02:54.810> switch<00:02:55.230> is<00:02:55.470> because<00:02:56.459> of

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
different the quiet switch is because of

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.970 
different the quiet switch is because of
the<00:02:56.730> dampening<00:02:57.209> effect<00:02:57.329> and<00:02:58.109> feel<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.769> little

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
the dampening effect and feel a little

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.890 
the dampening effect and feel a little
bit<00:02:59.130> closer<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.609> rubber<00:02:59.849> domes<00:03:00.150> or<00:03:00.569> at<00:03:00.720> least

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
bit closer to rubber domes or at least

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.170 
bit closer to rubber domes or at least
they<00:03:01.290> don't<00:03:01.590> bottom<00:03:02.069> out<00:03:02.190> as<00:03:02.370> harshly<00:03:02.819> as<00:03:02.910> the

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
they don't bottom out as harshly as the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.270 
they don't bottom out as harshly as the
others<00:03:03.419> do<00:03:03.599> and<00:03:03.840> in<00:03:04.290> a<00:03:04.410> way<00:03:04.560> that<00:03:04.590> makes<00:03:05.069> them

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
others do and in a way that makes them

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.220 
others do and in a way that makes them
feel<00:03:05.340> a<00:03:05.910> little<00:03:05.970> bit<00:03:06.299> more<00:03:06.359> elegant

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
feel a little bit more elegant

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.960 
feel a little bit more elegant
so<00:03:08.160> what<00:03:08.310> quite<00:03:08.549> like<00:03:08.790> that<00:03:09.889> then<00:03:10.889> if<00:03:11.370> we<00:03:11.940> look

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
so what quite like that then if we look

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.300 
so what quite like that then if we look
at<00:03:12.329> the<00:03:12.750> leaves<00:03:13.079> which<00:03:13.799> you<00:03:13.889> should<00:03:14.099> be<00:03:14.190> able

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
at the leaves which you should be able

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.030 
at the leaves which you should be able
to<00:03:14.579> see<00:03:14.790> through<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.209> switch<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:16.530> left<00:03:16.739> two

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
to see through the switch the left two

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.520 
to see through the switch the left two
leaves<00:03:17.340> I've<00:03:17.849> got<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.120> clicky<00:03:18.450> switch<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:19.109> the

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
leaves I've got a clicky switch and the

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.120 
leaves I've got a clicky switch and the
right<00:03:19.709> two<00:03:20.190> leaves<00:03:20.489> are<00:03:21.209> tactile<00:03:22.169> and<00:03:22.889> leaves

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
right two leaves are tactile and leaves

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.979 
right two leaves are tactile and leaves
and<00:03:24.620> that<00:03:25.620> kind<00:03:26.040> of<00:03:26.190> impacts<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.450> key<00:03:27.720> feel<00:03:27.959> a

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
and that kind of impacts the key feel a

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.220 
and that kind of impacts the key feel a
little<00:03:28.380> bit<00:03:28.530> because<00:03:29.569> the<00:03:30.569> way<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:30.989> the

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
little bit because the way that the

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.009 
little bit because the way that the
tactility<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.069> click<00:03:32.310> enos<00:03:32.549> works<00:03:33.019> means

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
tactility and the click enos works means

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.400 
tactility and the click enos works means
that<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.889> tactile<00:03:35.849> switches<00:03:36.359> these<00:03:36.660> two<00:03:36.930> are

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
that the tactile switches these two are

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.069 
that the tactile switches these two are
not<00:03:37.739> as<00:03:37.919> tactile<00:03:38.669> as<00:03:38.879> the<00:03:39.329> clicky<00:03:39.569> switches

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
not as tactile as the clicky switches

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.129 
not as tactile as the clicky switches
are<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:40.530> this<00:03:40.889> is<00:03:40.950> because<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.730> clicky<00:03:42.419> Leafs

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
are and this is because the clicky Leafs

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.920 
are and this is because the clicky Leafs
are<00:03:43.590> permitted<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:44.489> travel<00:03:45.090> more<00:03:45.359> than

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
are permitted to travel more than

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.690 
are permitted to travel more than
the<00:03:46.079> tactile<00:03:46.500> leaves<00:03:46.769> are<00:03:47.069> the<00:03:47.340> tactile

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
the tactile leaves are the tactile

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.369 
the tactile leaves are the tactile
leaves<00:03:47.909> are<00:03:48.209> not<00:03:48.450> clicky<00:03:48.840> because<00:03:49.200> they're

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
leaves are not clicky because they're

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.110 
leaves are not clicky because they're
retained<00:03:49.709> in<00:03:49.859> place<00:03:50.129> whereas<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:50.790> clicky

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
retained in place whereas the clicky

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.720 
retained in place whereas the clicky
ones<00:03:51.390> are<00:03:51.599> pulled<00:03:51.900> down<00:03:52.049> further<00:03:52.560> and<00:03:52.920> that

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
ones are pulled down further and that

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.640 
ones are pulled down further and that
makes<00:03:54.000> these<00:03:54.180> to<00:03:54.450> much<00:03:54.659> more<00:03:54.810> tactile<00:03:55.319> than

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
makes these to much more tactile than

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.250 
makes these to much more tactile than
these<00:03:55.920> two<00:03:56.189> so<00:03:56.939> this<00:03:57.510> one's<00:03:57.780> really<00:03:57.989> quite

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
these two so this one's really quite

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.209 
these two so this one's really quite
tactile<00:03:58.739> and<00:03:59.810> this<00:04:00.810> one's<00:04:01.049> a<00:04:01.319> bit<00:04:01.560> more<00:04:01.590> spongy

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:02.219 
tactile and this one's a bit more spongy

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:03.949 
tactile and this one's a bit more spongy
this<00:04:02.489> one<00:04:02.700> feels<00:04:02.969> a<00:04:03.150> little<00:04:03.389> bit<00:04:03.480> more<00:04:03.659> like<00:04:03.930> a

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
this one feels a little bit more like a

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.720 
this one feels a little bit more like a
cherry<00:04:04.650> switch<00:04:05.099> in<00:04:05.400> fact<00:04:05.730> I'd<00:04:06.000> say<00:04:06.239> maybe

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
cherry switch in fact I'd say maybe

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.809 
cherry switch in fact I'd say maybe
maybe<00:04:08.730> a<00:04:08.849> bit<00:04:09.090> more<00:04:09.269> like<00:04:09.510> a<00:04:09.930> cherry<00:04:10.530> MX<00:04:10.819> clear

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
maybe a bit more like a cherry MX clear

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.910 
maybe a bit more like a cherry MX clear
switch<00:04:12.209> or<00:04:12.510> something

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
switch or something

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.589 
switch or something
whereas<00:04:14.790> this<00:04:14.969> feels<00:04:15.269> quite<00:04:15.510> different<00:04:17.599> so

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
whereas this feels quite different so

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:19.729 
whereas this feels quite different so
that's<00:04:19.049> some<00:04:19.229> general<00:04:19.590> observations

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
that's some general observations

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.730 
that's some general observations
regarding<00:04:20.430> modern<00:04:21.090> mattias<00:04:21.479> switches<00:04:22.019> as<00:04:22.500> far

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
regarding modern mattias switches as far

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.310 
regarding modern mattias switches as far
as<00:04:22.889> which<00:04:23.099> ones<00:04:23.340> are<00:04:23.550> like<00:04:23.759> best<00:04:24.120> it's<00:04:24.990> a<00:04:25.080> hard

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
as which ones are like best it's a hard

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.800 
as which ones are like best it's a hard
choice<00:04:25.410> and<00:04:26.009> if<00:04:26.759> you<00:04:27.030> like<00:04:27.210> really<00:04:27.539> tactile

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
choice and if you like really tactile

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.450 
choice and if you like really tactile
switches<00:04:28.440> then<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.800> clicky<00:04:29.039> switch<00:04:29.340> is

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
switches then the clicky switch is

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.040 
switches then the clicky switch is
probably<00:04:29.789> the<00:04:30.000> best<00:04:30.210> because<00:04:30.570> that<00:04:30.810> simply

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
probably the best because that simply

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.290 
probably the best because that simply
has<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:31.500> most<00:04:31.650> tactility<00:04:32.130> the<00:04:32.910> tactile

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
has the most tactility the tactile

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.909 
has the most tactility the tactile
switch<00:04:33.570> is<00:04:33.690> not<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:33.990> greatest<00:04:34.199> combination<00:04:34.860> I

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
switch is not the greatest combination I

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.390 
switch is not the greatest combination I
found<00:04:35.220> it's<00:04:35.759> still<00:04:36.060> very<00:04:36.800> rattling<00:04:37.800> Hallowed

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
found it's still very rattling Hallowed

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.969 
found it's still very rattling Hallowed
the<00:04:38.820> sound<00:04:39.030> is<00:04:39.150> not<00:04:39.300> that<00:04:39.479> great<00:04:39.720> and<00:04:40.050> the

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
the sound is not that great and the

the sound is not that great and the
tactile<00:04:41.460> feeling<00:04:41.970> is<00:04:42.120> not<00:04:42.300> that<00:04:42.509> strong

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
tactile feeling is not that strong

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.510 
tactile feeling is not that strong
because<00:04:43.169> it's<00:04:43.349> got<00:04:43.500> a<00:04:43.530> tactile<00:04:43.800> leaf<00:04:44.190> in<00:04:44.400> it

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
because it's got a tactile leaf in it

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.300 
because it's got a tactile leaf in it
rather<00:04:44.699> than<00:04:44.940> a<00:04:45.030> clicky<00:04:45.300> leaf<00:04:45.979> the<00:04:46.979> quiet

rather than a clicky leaf the quiet
tactile<00:04:47.849> switch<00:04:48.620> feels<00:04:49.620> nice

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
tactile switch feels nice

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.760 
tactile switch feels nice
it<00:04:50.669> doesn't<00:04:51.030> bottom<00:04:51.180> out<00:04:51.389> very<00:04:51.720> hard<00:04:51.840> and<00:04:52.199> the

it doesn't bottom out very hard and the

it doesn't bottom out very hard and the
sound<00:04:53.010> is<00:04:53.190> somewhat<00:04:53.520> Pleasant<00:04:53.760> and<00:04:54.330> it's<00:04:54.780> soft

sound is somewhat Pleasant and it's soft

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.050 
sound is somewhat Pleasant and it's soft
so<00:04:55.289> you<00:04:55.380> can<00:04:55.440> use<00:04:55.830> it<00:04:55.860> in<00:04:56.099> an<00:04:56.220> open<00:04:56.340> offer<00:04:56.669> some

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
so you can use it in an open offer some

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.300 
so you can use it in an open offer some
short<00:04:57.330> people<00:04:57.599> wouldn't<00:04:58.020> mind<00:04:58.229> too<00:04:58.440> much<00:04:58.470> so

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
short people wouldn't mind too much so

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.710 
short people wouldn't mind too much so
that's<00:04:59.760> kind<00:04:59.970> of<00:05:00.000> a<00:05:00.090> nice<00:05:00.270> one

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
that's kind of a nice one

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.310 
that's kind of a nice one
the<00:05:01.530> quiet<00:05:01.919> clicks<00:05:02.340> which<00:05:02.580> is<00:05:02.880> I<00:05:03.360> don't<00:05:04.080> know

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
the quiet clicks which is I don't know

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.450 
the quiet clicks which is I don't know
it<00:05:04.500> might<00:05:04.800> be<00:05:04.830> my<00:05:05.099> favorite<00:05:05.340> it's<00:05:06.210> got<00:05:07.460> nice

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
it might be my favorite it's got nice

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.790 
it might be my favorite it's got nice
sound<00:05:08.880> but<00:05:09.389> not<00:05:09.570> too<00:05:09.810> loud<00:05:10.080> so<00:05:10.500> your

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
sound but not too loud so your

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.680 
sound but not too loud so your
colleagues<00:05:11.220> might<00:05:11.880> be<00:05:12.000> ok<00:05:12.300> with<00:05:12.510> that

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
colleagues might be ok with that

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.570 
colleagues might be ok with that
and<00:05:14.090> it's<00:05:15.090> still<00:05:15.949> tactile<00:05:16.949> because<00:05:17.370> of<00:05:17.490> the

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
and it's still tactile because of the

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.850 
and it's still tactile because of the
click<00:05:17.849> leaf<00:05:18.090> but<00:05:18.840> it<00:05:18.990> doesn't<00:05:19.289> bottom<00:05:19.560> out

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
click leaf but it doesn't bottom out

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.860 
click leaf but it doesn't bottom out
quite<00:05:20.220> as<00:05:20.370> hard<00:05:20.610> as<00:05:20.820> the<00:05:21.000> other<00:05:21.030> switches<00:05:21.659> do

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
quite as hard as the other switches do

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.860 
quite as hard as the other switches do
so<00:05:22.440> the<00:05:22.949> the<00:05:23.370> damping<00:05:23.789> effect<00:05:23.940> is<00:05:24.330> quite<00:05:24.630> nice

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
so the the damping effect is quite nice

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.490 
so the the damping effect is quite nice
on<00:05:25.110> this<00:05:25.229> one<00:05:26.449> I'd<00:05:27.449> say<00:05:27.570> try<00:05:28.080> some<00:05:28.320> of<00:05:28.409> these

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
on this one I'd say try some of these

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.080 
on this one I'd say try some of these
out<00:05:28.650> for<00:05:28.830> yourself<00:05:29.220> there<00:05:29.580> are<00:05:29.639> interesting

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:35.159 
started marketing a linear switch as

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:37.999 
started marketing a linear switch as
well<00:05:35.340> which<00:05:36.150> should<00:05:36.360> be<00:05:36.509> interesting<00:05:36.960> to<00:05:37.169> who

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:38.009 
well which should be interesting to who

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:41.230
