00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.230
 presented by matt forecast and us 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.540

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.529
 Tuesday as always we are we have 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:20.490
 He was used to it and got used to it 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:23.970
 progress away from his ideas 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:28.380
 Now we look forward to marketing klotz 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.699
 and system a bit and analyze 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.369
 they are also rehired has 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.820
 weekend in the football Bundesliga 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:38.850
 it starts well on friday evening 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.600
 20:30 commerzbank arena yes that 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.640
 clash of two 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.489
 Traditional clubs that are currently 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.610
 Relatively rare in the Bundesliga in time 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.989
 again werkself and so on yes we are 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.590
 A harmony also helps a lot 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.480
 frankfurt and borussia in the table 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.329
 in other words , the fourth is against 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:03.690
 the tenth but only seven points from 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:06.019
 only fans teams no that is allowed 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.019
 me there 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.900
 Yes, what should I say 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:20.870
 what gladbach against dortmund actually 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:28.040
 pretty good second half was played 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:31.720
 anni and even injured arango I have 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.720
 seen in a year than so be 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:40.130
 more otherwise stop news good sets on 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.960
 However, Tor made offside 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.890
 Well, but otherwise rather passive 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.390
 and then the boy does not actually have 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.300
 press the young has gone the 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.490
 means actively stains from both tractors 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:56.860
 not counted because you realize that though 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:00.020
 the second goal of bayern cancel however 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:09.140
 frankfurt frankfurt are amedick and 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:10.550
 lakic had lakic had whatever else 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.450
 so strong is that he is now 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.560
 can not play 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:20.440
 Of course I like that and he has 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:25.130
 upcoming games to the last game 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:28.519
 ended up sorry for 2 the office for the time being 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:34.060
 Friendship is not alone 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:38.769
 more meaningful yes I think so 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.769
 do not know whether one was injured 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:54.310
 I mean we had claus is only 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:58.360
 logical for me in life statistics tool 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:01.060
 therefore no idea 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.430
 he lives at a blunt bristle far then 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.380
 really no one more or less here 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.080
 not that is clear 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:13.880
 after that was again only really should 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:17.720
 Play and both teams are not that great 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:23.360
 as out services frankfurt 43 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:25.340
 percent in performance and 36 in 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.220
 In terms of numbers, that means working out 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.470
 waiting for six games to win 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.300
 three defeats and three 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.700
 undecided police dortmund das 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.959
 draw 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.980
 frankfurt has been waiting for three games 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.030
 a victory 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.510
 last 0 0 at the sc freiburg under 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.610
 contract 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.840
 dortmund lost 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:49.760
 before drum 0 against nÃ¼rnberg gladbach 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.860
 Can one mention that here from the 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:57.080
 euroleague are flown out through the 2nd 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:04:00.980
 0 at lazio and in only four games 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:04.490
 it's just a game of the two end 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.080
 20 in borussia park maybe too 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:08.240
 to mention if you look at the last 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.160
 duelle looks then one sees 80 for the 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.850
 Eintracht three draw eleven victories 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.260
 for the borussia from gladbach 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.390
 successful scorers because he 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.300
 harmony of course alexander maier and 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.760
 stefan aigner with 12 and seven goals respectively 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.750
 with every gladbachern is the 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.720
 most successful scorer in the 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.940
 You can pack Bundesliga with six 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:34.910
 followed by arango with 5 and he was too 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:40.930
 against or was late I have again 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:43.880
 there in the form table of the last five 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.860
 six the last six games sees this 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.590
 so that the harmony on place nine 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.180
 is and laptop 14 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.340
 then let 's take a look 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:56.540
 worth on the season progressed far 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:59.720
 further team because we just see that 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:08.420
 harmony throughout the season always in 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:11.540
 the top 5 was without exception after 25 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:14.600
 are now four, however, takes 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:17.840
 Platz especially my old gladbach 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.580
 however, was actually up to two 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.970
 Exceptions that are better than the seven 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:26.330
 only 15 so there is still a bit 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.560
 catching up to the europe league 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.470
 still wants to reach then you have to 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.600
 a bit looking for us to put on 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:35.270
 So now for conclusion what are 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:39.140
 your tips june us humans you fall 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:41.180
 not even the chips 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:46.090
 down and then immediately sick and makes 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.090
 though 20 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:06:02.849
 february as 181 main plays in last 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:06.199
 time extremely weak play both 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:11.340
 actually quite often undecided 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:12.539
 I generally did not have to 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.439
 make a tie together 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:20.270
 I say frankfurt will win and 

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:22.830
 with 2 1 because I believe the 6 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:27.389
 the home should travel to 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:28.500
 For example, I am here now 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:30.259
 he will be the club after one 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:35.360
 maybe pour one or the other 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:35.360
 my tip 2 1 for harmony
