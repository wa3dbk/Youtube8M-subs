00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.799
 today we talk about the smartphone from 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.290
 Alcatel companies 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:09.599
 Vantach model is an average 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.759
 according to product characteristics in the line 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.340
 smartphone comes nicely 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.090
 decorated light box on which 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.410
 The phone itself is depicted directly 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:25.949
 the box is made of quality 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:29.240
 cardboard on its back side coated 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:33.120
 some characteristics of the device 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.719
 but inside is of course myself 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.430
 smartphone 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:41.270
 but let's first see what's here 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.270
 there is besides him 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.930
 as always this is a short tutorial 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.930
 user 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:15.619
 charging with usb headset connector with 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:17.660
 vacuum type headphones and of course and 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:27.649
 usb cable to connect to charge and 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:30.440
 The computer is equipped with a 4-inch smartphone 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:33.229
 screen so it is relatively 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.920
 a small hand falls easily 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:40.040
 By the size reminds iphone by the way 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.930
 and the design is also distinguished by its broad 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.360
 bottom panel and 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.610
 wide enough top slot for 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.430
 dynamics about the same as the iPhone 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.580
 but of course there is no home button 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.680
 physical though by themselves buttons 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.720
 present but they are sensory and in this 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.729
 the moment is not highlighted because not visible 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.100
 besides that on the front side 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:06.020
 there is a light sensor and 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:09.229
 proximity and front camera myself 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.600
 passion a smartphone has no indicator on 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.440
 design unlike the same athos he 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.440
 completely plastic 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.549
 the thickness of the smartphone is only 9 and 7 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.170
 millimeters 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:26.209
 not very little but for the middle class 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.640
 phones more than he normally weighs 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:33.350
 120 grams therefore for its size 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:36.650
 Enough weighty build quality 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:41.049
 done very well though on the other 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:44.870
 sides right here on the left bottom corner 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:46.579
 there is some backlash the same 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.600
 can be said about the right where is 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:54.380
 eyelet for removing the cover but otherwise 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.120
 there is nothing like that on the side ends 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.329
 particular on the left is the rocker 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.450
 volume control she is not very 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:04.669
 seriously stands on the butt plastic 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.630
 so the touch is not so fast 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:08.360
 to her it would be necessary 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.640
 get used to the right nothing at all 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.950
 power button against the ordinary 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.750
 embodiment is here top 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.200
 there is a headset jack 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:23.570
 located below the microphone and micro connector 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:25.390
 usb logo is on the back 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:29.930
 the manufacturer itself 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:33.590
 Vantach model and speaker 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.510
 LED flash and camera eye and and 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.310
 resolution is 5 megapixels on 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:42.050
 what does the corresponding inscription say 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.200
 Cover the touch is not soft touch 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:47.000
 smooth plastic is used here 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.820
 dark gray with light blue 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.120
 the lid is removed very easily 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:56.290
 enough 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.290
 bottom pry her fingernail 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:08.340
 The main thing is to carefully remove and not to 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.340
 break latches 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:16.829
 inside we see the card slot 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.829
 micro sd 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:24.120
 the battery gets easy enough 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:28.990
 for this there is a special dimple 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:30.850
 battery capacity is 1500 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.520
 milliamps per hour is quite small 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:39.430
 modern standards simcard inserted 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.110
 right here right behind the battery so 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.199
 it will always need to be removed in order to 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.270
 insert sim card note that 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:57.190
 smartphone supports work only with 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:05:00.720
 micro sim insert it just here it is 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:03.009
 snaps into place and the retainer holds it 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.880
 somehow the memory is made up too 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:05.880
 easy enough 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.720
 just glad to push her inside 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:24.170
 iron retainer after this 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:28.550
 just enough to wear 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:33.920
 battery cover closes too 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:37.880
 quite simply the main thing to convince and to 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:42.170
 all latches have become in their grooves and after 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:46.720
 This smartphone can be turned on immediately. 

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:49.190
 The model name appears; note that 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.850
 smartphone is equipped with dual-core 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:55.160
 future processor at 1 GHz and 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.660
 512 megabytes of memory so for the rates you 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.160
 here we betray because we have 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:01.760
 somewhat branded version 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:08.360
 smartphone but it still works and 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:11.060
 in other operators, too, now we will wait 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.680
 while it is loading note that 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.350
 the smartphone also has four gigabytes 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:18.350
 internal memory and it has its own 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:23.680
 pretty cute shell which 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:27.760
 allows you to call from the lock screen 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:30.640
 some particular applications this 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:33.350
 camera application 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.340
 send messages and applications for 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.000
 making calls 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:40.390
 or you can simply unlock the screen 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.080
 smartphone pretty pretty peel 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:48.860
 branded shell lx hotel in general 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:50.950
 looks good though nothing special 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.600
 she is not 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:56.960
 buttons are highlighted but when they 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:59.090
 their magnitudes are completely invisible on although 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.730
 approximately aim at them without 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.680
 backlight will not work 

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:05.140

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.570
 by 480 

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.740
 for thinking about the final is enough 

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:32.180
