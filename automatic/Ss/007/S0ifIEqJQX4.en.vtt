00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.490
 Zdarova people, what am I kindly 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:09.590
 provided an account with Santa Claus 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.849
 Santa Claus here on the Chinese server 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.570
 it looks like this i so 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.750
 I understand such attacks owner is equated to 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.920
 so good of the spirit in the amount of life 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.500
 flavored to lives 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.340
 poured words that is not so strong and would 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.439
 im on hero yes how were the two previous 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.449
 bulldozer and Vlad Dracula such 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.929
 mediocre maybe yes well maybe i 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.239
 am wrong 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.380
 most likely sharpened by the waves because 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.690
 what he hits with two missiles before inflicts 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.000
 damage along the radius of these two rockets 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:47.910
 that is, as I understood actually something 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.980
 similar to draculaâ€™s skill only 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.079
 distance but acts accordingly 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.719
 instead of 1 year it 's a bloody banquet 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.809
 in my opinion yes it turns out 2 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:02.030
 bloody banquets so well what we try 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:07.880
 first test it probably 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:10.260
 some even among sol so to speak 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.939
 although there is probably not here 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.150
 try to be effective somewhere 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:20.070
 a large number of troops find you a base 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:22.049
 and on it to demonstrate here 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.640
 no not very good army but in 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.420
 principle for him to die once tax 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.829
 state of the pancake well, well, respectively 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.090
 I plant 1 frost 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.650
 distance from Akiva is not very high 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.509
 so as you see he shoots from the bazooka 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:41.040
 fireworks and cool enough 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:43.310
 done as for me to skill it has 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.310
 seven second cooldown 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.610
 You see, he shot a certain 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.689
 place yes it turns out 2 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:56.040
 released two of his two fireworks apparently 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:57.840
 releases not only in units on their 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.960
 building and around buildings respectively 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.150
 too, until these fireworks exploded yet 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.979
 there was this effect 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.570
 he was applied along the radius can he 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.170
 shot the hero up accordingly 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.140
 half the life of them demolished they are equal with him 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.200
 on the level you can say so 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:20.580
 In principle , I have 2 of 9 but in principle 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.940
 good damage you can probably for at once 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.459
 he could kill his heroes hero 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.830
 his level if he had 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.680
 able to pump that is 7 out of 7 out of 9 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:36.330
 it is likely that he would destroy these 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:40.260
 characters in one shot here, bearing in mind 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.060
 that new waves will look like yes to 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.680
 previous the only thing that will be there 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.160
 two waves immediately emerge from two different 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:52.080
 on the one hand and 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:53.730
 the boss will not be a dragon as before but how 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.420
 guild boss ny i mean he won't 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.519
 he shall be subject to stanna 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.090
 participants and his life will be the same 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:05.549
 more i just saw naki already saw 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:09.299
 cool enough but the awards are the same 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:11.670
 that is the most experience and a little 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.560
 more yes it turns out the crystal is nothing 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.360
 new then there are these blue ones 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.980
 crystals or red crystals have not 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.549
 run which falls out but in the world i don't 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.739
 noticed 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:24.060
 maybe they will be but new underground well 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:31.200
 here is such a hero now 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:34.680
 I will try to show on the wave 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.739
 Is it really such a imbovy of 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:41.630
 fingers is it also good with waves like 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.630
 and the failure of dracula 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.049
 So 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.989
 something else want to say and forgot here by 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.250
 about the account guys do not ask it not 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.290
 my account from in advance 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.840
 just saying that I can not give because 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:01.040
 what not to remove only 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.720
 in order to show santa claus but 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.970
 first wave correct in principle 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.730
 not bad i more so to say i don't 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.069
 noticed his ability to self-destruct 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.959
 5 out of 5 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.950
 to be honest, bruno came in now 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.359
 I 'll show you 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.829
 possible with some increase in level 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.019
 of himself 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.389
 Santa Claus increases drinking 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:29.510
 skill itself is a distortion but here in one 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:31.910
 a shot think he wave I merged everything 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:35.270
 maybe wrong but on all screens 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.889
 on which I saw Santa Claus 2 more precisely 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.790
 his first talent is 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.900
 self-destruction but for some reason 1 out of 5 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.520
 accordingly can be with increasing 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.530
 damage or from something there or with 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.650
 by increasing the amount of experience that measure with 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:51.520
 transition from the first to the second 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.810
 a star can be cured and his skill 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.460
 talent is somehow not very clearly done 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:05:00.470
 maybe some kind of bug and naturally 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:03.169
 You can compare it in advance with Dracula 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.910
 if you can say that he of course 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.340
 weaker than dracula because the dragon 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:11.630
 still samootkhil is yes he shoots 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:15.229
 a little further in my radius and at least 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:18.020
 his skills are still limited to that. Where 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:20.360
 he is but in any case like 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.940
 supplement as second as grit 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.840
 assistant for Dracula is on the waves and 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:30.919
 this grandfather frost is very good 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:36.280
 so well what's probably kill him on a4 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:36.280
 most likely although it is possible he will pass 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:46.530
 how can the experience gave us don't know me 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.480
 it seems he is not much worth a hero for 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.720
 how is it worth buying 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:54.960
 gems eliminate catch him in any 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:58.230
 case it can be replaced by someone so 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.060
 here no less effective so we 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:03.150
 let's see what he does not know for 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.160
 what are they developers so moving 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:08.639
 At first, weak heroes are more accurate at first. 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:11.220
 a strong hero, then the usual standard 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:13.590
 that is, if punk if you raise 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:16.919
 dates you understand there let's say a dragon then 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:19.070
 dracula sweat org than higher than 

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:21.330
 the heroes go further the higher they have 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:24.150
 at least the amount of life is far 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.400
 the number of such is not clear with this santa 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:30.630
 claus here but in principle here is 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:33.330
 hero about hands as you see here 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.610
 everything is closed maybe possibility 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.370
 opening ore if i open twenty 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.410
 first level runes may appear 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.060
 talent in him as you passive date 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:45.750
 today will be the first level there i 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:47.610
 I open a bird what is there level 41 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.830
 Enlightenment he will have a second 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.660
 run level 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:54.419
 all quite real honestly not yet 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:56.360
 I know, but come in here, oh, no, I was wrong, yes 

00:06:54.419 --> 00:07:00.930
 most likely as I said will be but 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:03.510
 again not sure about this and throw 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:06.780
 its on the second let's see what we have here on 

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:09.330
 250 to 260 attacks obtained by two 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:12.750
 thousands of his lives increases with each 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:15.030
 with every star but the average in 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:17.240
 principle all all with acting all 

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.240
 until
