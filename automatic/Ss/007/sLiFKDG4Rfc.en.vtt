to fighting games first and foremost the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.120 
to fighting games first and foremost the
controller<00:01:12.900> seems<00:01:13.229> much<00:01:13.500> lighter<00:01:13.830> than<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
controller seems much lighter than the

the<00:01:24.390> X<00:01:24.570> 360<00:01:25.170> controller<00:01:25.530> on<00:01:25.680> fighting<00:01:26.040> games

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
the X 360 controller on fighting games

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.399 
the X 360 controller on fighting games
which<00:01:26.340> blows<00:01:26.700> my<00:01:26.729> mind<00:01:27.330> but<00:01:28.020> for<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.229> most

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
which blows my mind but for the most

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.319 
which blows my mind but for the most
part<00:01:28.619> we<00:01:28.740> know<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.159> d-pad<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.670> bad<00:01:29.850> we<00:01:30.030> know

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
part we know that d-pad is bad we know

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.910 
part we know that d-pad is bad we know
that<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:30.659> doesn't<00:01:30.810> work<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.170> many<00:01:31.290> situations

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
that it doesn't work in many situations

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.950 
that it doesn't work in many situations
and<00:01:32.130> stuff<00:01:32.369> like<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.720> one

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
and stuff like that and that is the one

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.300 
and stuff like that and that is the one
thing<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.229> has<00:01:34.439> been<00:01:34.590> fixed<00:01:34.770> for<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.950> Xbox

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
thing that has been fixed for the Xbox

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.460 
thing that has been fixed for the Xbox
one<00:01:35.520> controller<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:36.450> d-pad<00:01:36.780> on<00:01:36.960> Xbox<00:01:37.380> one

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
one controller the d-pad on Xbox one

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.160 
one controller the d-pad on Xbox one
reminds<00:01:38.369> me<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.640> slightly<00:01:39.119> bigger<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.960> more

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
reminds me of a slightly bigger and more

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.030 
reminds me of a slightly bigger and more
thin<00:01:40.799> version<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.579> an<00:01:42.210> SNES<00:01:42.840> d-pad<00:01:43.380> hopefully

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
thin version of an SNES d-pad hopefully

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.590 
thin version of an SNES d-pad hopefully
that<00:01:44.159> makes<00:01:44.340> sense<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.820> it's<00:01:45.299> not<00:01:45.420> as

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
that makes sense to you it's not as

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.690 
that makes sense to you it's not as
elevated<00:01:46.079> as<00:01:46.320> an<00:01:46.409> SNES<00:01:46.799> d-pad<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.490> doesn't

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
elevated as an SNES d-pad and it doesn't

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.219 
elevated as an SNES d-pad and it doesn't
have<00:01:47.790> as<00:01:47.909> rounded<00:01:48.360> edges<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.750> stuff<00:01:48.960> like

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
have as rounded edges and stuff like

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.929 
have as rounded edges and stuff like
that<00:01:49.409> but<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.770> does<00:01:49.950> feel<00:01:50.189> really<00:01:50.430> good<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.850> it

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
that but it does feel really good and it

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.420 
that but it does feel really good and it
has<00:01:51.090> very<00:01:51.450> distinct<00:01:52.049> clicks<00:01:52.560> when<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.250> hit<00:01:53.399> a

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
has very distinct clicks when you hit a

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.310 
has very distinct clicks when you hit a
direction<00:01:53.970> these<00:01:54.420> clicks<00:01:54.689> really<00:01:54.930> remind<00:01:55.200> me

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
direction these clicks really remind me

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.959 
direction these clicks really remind me
of<00:01:55.350> an<00:01:55.470> arcade<00:01:55.770> joystick<00:01:55.979> how<00:01:56.520> like<00:01:56.729> when<00:01:56.850> you

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
of an arcade joystick how like when you

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.490 
of an arcade joystick how like when you
go<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.270> one<00:01:57.420> direction<00:01:57.630> up<00:01:57.990> down<00:01:58.170> left<00:01:58.350> and

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
go to one direction up down left and

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.380 
go to one direction up down left and
right<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.799> registers<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.310> click<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.820> this<00:02:00.270> is

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
right it registers a click and this is

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.149 
right it registers a click and this is
actually<00:02:00.750> really<00:02:00.990> similar<00:02:01.500> with<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.799> Xbox

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
actually really similar with the Xbox

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:02.899 
actually really similar with the Xbox
one<00:02:02.430> pad

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
one pad

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.490 
one pad
it'll<00:02:03.329> be<00:02:03.420> really<00:02:03.630> weird<00:02:03.990> at<00:02:04.140> first<00:02:04.170> it

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
it'll be really weird at first it

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.380 
it'll be really weird at first it
doesn't<00:02:04.590> feel<00:02:04.979> like<00:02:05.159> any<00:02:05.399> other<00:02:05.640> d-pad<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.299> I

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
doesn't feel like any other d-pad that I

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.119 
doesn't feel like any other d-pad that I
that<00:02:06.689> I've<00:02:06.810> used<00:02:07.079> before<00:02:07.229> but<00:02:07.710> now<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:08.009> you

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
that I've used before but now that you

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.859 
that I've used before but now that you
have<00:02:08.160> like<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.729> different<00:02:09.330> amount<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.629> weight

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
have like a different amount of weight

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.110 
have like a different amount of weight
for<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.679> entire<00:02:10.800> thing<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.970> the

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
for the the entire thing and that the

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.250 
for the the entire thing and that the
d-pad<00:02:12.480> is

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
d-pad is

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.899 
d-pad is
dramatically<00:02:14.040> different<00:02:14.220> than<00:02:14.430> almost<00:02:14.640> any

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
dramatically different than almost any

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.660 
dramatically different than almost any
controller<00:02:15.269> I've<00:02:15.480> used<00:02:15.689> so<00:02:15.870> far<00:02:16.110> it<00:02:16.379> feels<00:02:16.709> not

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
controller I've used so far it feels not

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.300 
controller I've used so far it feels not
like<00:02:17.970> any<00:02:18.239> any<00:02:18.629> any<00:02:19.230> freaking<00:02:19.950> controller

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
like any any any freaking controller

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.740 
like any any any freaking controller
I've<00:02:20.489> ever<00:02:20.670> used<00:02:20.970> on<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.150> video<00:02:21.360> game<00:02:21.569> system

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
I've ever used on a video game system

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.500 
I've ever used on a video game system
it's<00:02:22.140> mostly<00:02:22.739> similar<00:02:23.099> to<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.430> Xbox<00:02:23.640> 360<00:02:24.329> of

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
it's mostly similar to the Xbox 360 of

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.300 
it's mostly similar to the Xbox 360 of
course<00:02:24.810> but<00:02:25.439> it<00:02:25.530> has<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.650> lot<00:02:25.980> of<00:02:26.010> other

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
course but it has a lot of other

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.530 
course but it has a lot of other
differences<00:02:26.879> and<00:02:26.970> I'll<00:02:27.060> talk<00:02:27.209> about<00:02:27.239> the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
differences and I'll talk about the

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.940 
differences and I'll talk about the
stuff<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.840> like<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.140> then<00:02:28.379> I'll<00:02:28.470> talk<00:02:28.680> in<00:02:28.860> the

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
stuff I like and then I'll talk in the

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.350 
stuff I like and then I'll talk in the
end<00:02:29.129> about<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.340> stuff<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.760> don't<00:02:29.819> like

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
end about the stuff I don't like

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.240 
end about the stuff I don't like
but<00:02:30.900> yeah<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.319> d-pad<00:02:31.590> is<00:02:31.739> one<00:02:31.890> of<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.040> better

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
but yeah the d-pad is one of the better

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.789 
but yeah the d-pad is one of the better
ones<00:02:32.459> um<00:02:32.790> over<00:02:33.329> the<00:02:33.450> span<00:02:33.720> of<00:02:33.750> about<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.560> first

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
ones um over the span of about the first

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.410 
ones um over the span of about the first
five<00:02:35.099> games<00:02:35.370> I<00:02:35.579> played<00:02:35.790> killer<00:02:36.000> instinct<00:02:36.360> I

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
five games I played killer instinct I

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.729 
five games I played killer instinct I
was<00:02:36.540> like<00:02:36.659> I<00:02:36.780> don't<00:02:36.930> know<00:02:36.989> if<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.230> like<00:02:37.500> this

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
was like I don't know if I like this

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.530 
was like I don't know if I like this
this<00:02:38.040> is<00:02:38.159> actually<00:02:38.310> kind<00:02:38.790> of<00:02:38.879> freaking<00:02:39.299> weird

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
this is actually kind of freaking weird

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.970 
this is actually kind of freaking weird
and<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:40.200> do<00:02:40.290> have<00:02:40.379> to<00:02:40.470> kind<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.739> think

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
and you do have to kind of think

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.380 
and you do have to kind of think
differently<00:02:41.430> when<00:02:41.640> you're<00:02:41.790> using<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.239> because

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
differently when you're using it because

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.119 
differently when you're using it because
it's<00:02:42.750> just<00:02:42.930> registering<00:02:43.379> different<00:02:43.739> motions

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
it's just registering different motions

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.670 
it's just registering different motions
that<00:02:44.280> you're<00:02:44.489> used<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.790> but<00:02:45.569> after<00:02:45.780> five<00:02:46.379> games

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
that you're used to but after five games

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.199 
that you're used to but after five games
and<00:02:46.829> until<00:02:47.129> about<00:02:47.280> like<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.579> tenth<00:02:47.819> game<00:02:48.000> I

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
and until about like the tenth game I

moving along the Xbox one pad does other

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:34.159 
moving along the Xbox one pad does other
things<00:03:32.970> that<00:03:33.090> are<00:03:33.209> pretty<00:03:33.419> different<00:03:33.660> the

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
things that are pretty different the

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:36.050 
things that are pretty different the
thumb<00:03:34.410> sticks<00:03:34.709> aren't<00:03:35.069> too<00:03:35.220> much<00:03:35.459> aren't<00:03:35.790> they

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
don't feel too different from the

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:38.780 
don't feel too different from the
original<00:03:37.709> Xbox<00:03:38.040> 360<00:03:38.519> they're<00:03:38.669> definitely

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
original Xbox 360 they're definitely

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.670 
original Xbox 360 they're definitely
more<00:03:39.150> stiff<00:03:39.510> and<00:03:39.690> they<00:03:40.049> do<00:03:40.169> have<00:03:40.319> a<00:03:40.379> little<00:03:40.500> bit

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
more stiff and they do have a little bit

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.229 
more stiff and they do have a little bit
more<00:03:40.799> resistance<00:03:41.340> so<00:03:41.489> there<00:03:41.609> are<00:03:41.730> some<00:03:42.030> people

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
more resistance so there are some people

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.640 
more resistance so there are some people
that<00:03:42.510> really<00:03:42.660> like<00:03:42.900> playing<00:03:43.049> fighting<00:03:43.470> games

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
with the analog stick and this will

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:46.580 
with the analog stick and this will
actually<00:03:45.480> benefit<00:03:45.959> that<00:03:46.109> a<00:03:46.139> lot<00:03:46.440> because

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
actually benefit that a lot because

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.740 
actually benefit that a lot because
really<00:03:46.919> loose<00:03:47.220> analog<00:03:47.699> sticks<00:03:48.000> you<00:03:48.419> get<00:03:48.540> a<00:03:48.569> lot

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
really loose analog sticks you get a lot

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.449 
really loose analog sticks you get a lot
of<00:03:48.840> other<00:03:49.019> inputs<00:03:49.620> and<00:03:49.799> motions<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:50.280> stuff

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:51.949 
of other inputs and motions and stuff
like<00:03:50.579> that<00:03:50.730> they're<00:03:50.879> mostly<00:03:51.060> designed<00:03:51.419> for<00:03:51.540> 3d

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
like that they're mostly designed for 3d

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.110 
like that they're mostly designed for 3d
games<00:03:52.230> and<00:03:52.500> in<00:03:52.889> 2d<00:03:53.220> fighting<00:03:53.459> games<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:53.970> get

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
games and in 2d fighting games you get

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.000 
games and in 2d fighting games you get
screwed<00:03:54.569> up<00:03:54.720> using<00:03:55.019> that<00:03:55.230> stuff<00:03:55.410> especially

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
screwed up using that stuff especially

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.979 
screwed up using that stuff especially
myself<00:03:56.190> but<00:03:56.970> sometimes<00:03:57.480> if<00:03:57.629> it<00:03:57.750> was<00:03:57.840> like<00:03:57.959> a

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
myself but sometimes if it was like a

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.689

complicated<00:03:58.500> motion<00:03:58.980> or<00:03:59.099> something<00:03:59.250> along

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
complicated motion or something along

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:00.830 
complicated motion or something along
those<00:03:59.849> lines<00:03:59.970> I<00:04:00.299> would<00:04:00.359> just<00:04:00.569> go<00:04:00.659> to<00:04:00.690> the

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
those lines I would just go to the

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.089 
those lines I would just go to the
thumbstick<00:04:01.199> really<00:04:01.409> quick<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.680> try<00:04:01.859> it<00:04:01.919> knows

I usually hate using thumb sticks on 2d
games<00:04:07.859> so<00:04:08.519> that<00:04:08.549> that's<00:04:08.819> a<00:04:08.940> good<00:04:09.090> thing<00:04:09.150> the

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
games so that that's a good thing the

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.140 
games so that that's a good thing the
only<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.530> only<00:04:10.560> downside<00:04:11.310> besides<00:04:11.849> the<00:04:11.970> fact

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
only the only downside besides the fact

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.080 
only the only downside besides the fact
that<00:04:12.269> yes<00:04:12.659> the<00:04:13.019> d-pad<00:04:13.349> is<00:04:13.620> insanely<00:04:14.459> better<00:04:14.819> it

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
that yes the d-pad is insanely better it

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.430 
that yes the d-pad is insanely better it
takes<00:04:15.329> a<00:04:15.419> little<00:04:15.569> while<00:04:15.720> to<00:04:15.900> get<00:04:15.959> used<00:04:16.109> to<00:04:16.260> one

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
takes a little while to get used to one

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.170 
takes a little while to get used to one
seat<00:04:16.590> used<00:04:16.769> to<00:04:16.859> it<00:04:16.979> it's<00:04:17.099> really<00:04:17.159> good<00:04:17.639> the

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
seat used to it it's really good the

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.819 
seat used to it it's really good the
thumb<00:04:18.389> sticks<00:04:18.659> are<00:04:18.780> way<00:04:18.930> tighter<00:04:19.199> move<00:04:19.590> well

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
thumb sticks are way tighter move well

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.800 
thumb sticks are way tighter move well
the<00:04:20.130> face<00:04:20.400> of<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:20.699> controller<00:04:21.030> like<00:04:21.239> the<00:04:21.389> the

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
the face of the controller like the the

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:22.909 
the face of the controller like the the
buttons<00:04:22.139> don't<00:04:22.320> even<00:04:22.530> worry<00:04:22.710> about<00:04:22.770> that

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
buttons don't even worry about that

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.170 
buttons don't even worry about that
because<00:04:23.190> it's<00:04:23.310> pretty<00:04:23.340> much<00:04:23.550> similar<00:04:24.030> to

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
because it's pretty much similar to

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.940 
because it's pretty much similar to
everything<00:04:24.419> else<00:04:24.719> you<00:04:24.780> played<00:04:25.110> the

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
everything else you played the

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.710 
everything else you played the
she<00:04:26.070> comes<00:04:26.340> with<00:04:26.520> the<00:04:26.640> bumpers<00:04:27.060> now<00:04:27.660> the

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
she comes with the bumpers now the

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.300 
she comes with the bumpers now the
bumpers<00:04:28.140> you<00:04:28.170> need<00:04:28.470> in<00:04:28.620> fighting<00:04:28.950> games<00:04:28.980> from

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
bumpers you need in fighting games from

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.040 
bumpers you need in fighting games from
ia<00:04:29.490> in<00:04:29.730> my<00:04:29.880> opinion<00:04:30.360> because<00:04:30.510> the<00:04:30.750> bumpers

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
ia in my opinion because the bumpers

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.930 
ia in my opinion because the bumpers
represent<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:31.890> first<00:04:32.130> button<00:04:32.400> and<00:04:32.640> then<00:04:32.850> the

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
represent the first button and then the

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.610 
represent the first button and then the
back<00:04:33.150> button<00:04:33.480> is<00:04:33.600> the<00:04:33.720> trigger<00:04:33.960> triggers<00:04:34.500> are

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
back button is the trigger triggers are

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.020 
back button is the trigger triggers are
fine<00:04:34.800> there's<00:04:35.040> no<00:04:35.130> issues<00:04:35.490> with<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:35.730> triggers

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
fine there's no issues with the triggers

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.440 
fine there's no issues with the triggers
at<00:04:36.150> all

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
at all

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.000 
at all
but<00:04:36.780> the<00:04:36.900> bumper<00:04:37.230> usually<00:04:37.560> for<00:04:37.740> me<00:04:37.860> represents

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
but the bumper usually for me represents

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.040 
but the bumper usually for me represents
on<00:04:38.400> the<00:04:38.490> right<00:04:38.670> side<00:04:38.940> heavy<00:04:39.270> punch<00:04:39.660> and<00:04:39.930> then

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
on the right side heavy punch and then

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.780 
on the right side heavy punch and then
the<00:04:40.230> trigger<00:04:40.500> on<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:40.800> back<00:04:40.980> is<00:04:41.220> heavy<00:04:41.460> kick

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
the trigger on the back is heavy kick

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.460 
the trigger on the back is heavy kick
now<00:04:42.090> the<00:04:42.150> challenge<00:04:42.660> with<00:04:42.780> the<00:04:42.900> trigger<00:04:43.200> is

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
now the challenge with the trigger is

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.740 
now the challenge with the trigger is
that<00:04:43.500> not<00:04:43.980> the<00:04:44.160> entire<00:04:44.700> trigger<00:04:45.180> is<00:04:45.480> the

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
that not the entire trigger is the

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.950 
that not the entire trigger is the
active<00:04:46.440> zone<00:04:46.470> and<00:04:47.220> by<00:04:47.340> active<00:04:47.790> zone<00:04:48.060> I'm<00:04:48.360> it's

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
active zone and by active zone I'm it's

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.780 
active zone and by active zone I'm it's
hard<00:04:49.230> to<00:04:49.350> describe<00:04:49.590> but<00:04:50.040> it<00:04:50.370> means<00:04:50.490> that<00:04:50.610> you

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
hard to describe but it means that you

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.400 
hard to describe but it means that you
can't<00:04:51.030> press<00:04:51.240> the<00:04:51.300> entire<00:04:51.750> trigger<00:04:52.050> for<00:04:52.260> it<00:04:52.320> to

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
can't press the entire trigger for it to

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.470 
can't press the entire trigger for it to
register<00:04:52.560> a<00:04:52.830> button<00:04:53.250> click<00:04:53.490> if<00:04:53.850> you<00:04:54.000> register

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
inside of the controller you kind of

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:00.650 
inside of the controller you kind of
don't<00:04:58.110> get<00:04:58.470> a<00:04:58.710> button<00:04:58.980> press<00:04:59.220> at<00:04:59.610> all<00:04:59.970> but<00:05:00.570> if

was saying over the span of 10 matches I

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:30.860 
was saying over the span of 10 matches I
wasn't<00:05:29.880> having<00:05:29.970> to<00:05:30.090> think<00:05:30.300> about<00:05:30.420> it<00:05:30.630> as<00:05:30.720> much

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
wasn't having to think about it as much

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.960 
wasn't having to think about it as much
anymore<00:05:31.170> and<00:05:31.530> I<00:05:31.950> did<00:05:32.220> get<00:05:32.400> used<00:05:32.670> to<00:05:32.850> it

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
anymore and I did get used to it

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.940 
anymore and I did get used to it
although<00:05:33.210> it's<00:05:34.020> not<00:05:34.200> like<00:05:34.350> I<00:05:34.440> got<00:05:34.590> used<00:05:34.800> to<00:05:34.890> it

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
although it's not like I got used to it

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.590 
although it's not like I got used to it
like<00:05:35.100> the<00:05:35.220> d-pad<00:05:35.580> it's<00:05:35.820> still<00:05:36.060> like<00:05:36.270> kind<00:05:36.300> of

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
like the d-pad it's still like kind of

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.420 
like the d-pad it's still like kind of
cumbersome<00:05:37.200> the<00:05:37.380> fact<00:05:37.590> that<00:05:37.740> this<00:05:37.860> is<00:05:38.040> this

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
cumbersome the fact that this is this

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.250 
cumbersome the fact that this is this
way<00:05:38.670> which<00:05:39.180> doesn't<00:05:39.480> make<00:05:39.540> much<00:05:39.750> sense<00:05:39.780> to<00:05:40.080> me

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
way which doesn't make much sense to me

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.930 
way which doesn't make much sense to me
because<00:05:40.500> the<00:05:40.620> bumpers<00:05:40.950> on<00:05:41.100> the<00:05:41.130> xbox360

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
because the bumpers on the xbox360

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.460 
because the bumpers on the xbox360
controller<00:05:42.000> are<00:05:42.540> totally<00:05:42.930> fine<00:05:43.170> and<00:05:43.380> they

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
controller are totally fine and they

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.410 
controller are totally fine and they
work<00:05:43.650> really<00:05:44.070> freakin<00:05:44.430> good<00:05:44.580> and<00:05:44.850> it's<00:05:45.300> the

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:45.420 
work really freakin good and it's the

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.060 
work really freakin good and it's the
same<00:05:45.600> thing<00:05:45.630> for<00:05:45.810> the<00:05:45.960> PlayStation<00:05:46.440> 3<00:05:46.470> stuff

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
same thing for the PlayStation 3 stuff

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.460 
same thing for the PlayStation 3 stuff
so<00:05:47.340> it's<00:05:48.030> the<00:05:48.180> only<00:05:48.480> big<00:05:48.720> issue<00:05:48.930> I've<00:05:49.200> had<00:05:49.350> with

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
so it's the only big issue I've had with

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.080 
so it's the only big issue I've had with
the<00:05:49.560> Xbox<00:05:49.890> one<00:05:50.070> controller<00:05:50.100> other<00:05:50.730> than<00:05:50.940> that

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
the Xbox one controller other than that

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.880 
the Xbox one controller other than that
it<00:05:51.270> might<00:05:51.480> actually<00:05:51.510> be<00:05:51.990> an<00:05:52.080> extremely<00:05:52.620> good

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
it might actually be an extremely good

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.380 
it might actually be an extremely good
fighting<00:05:53.280> game<00:05:53.460> controller<00:05:53.820> you<00:05:54.000> might<00:05:54.180> not

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
fighting game controller you might not

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.330 
fighting game controller you might not
have<00:05:54.660> to<00:05:54.840> go<00:05:54.990> into<00:05:55.140> looking<00:05:55.350> into<00:05:55.560> like<00:05:55.830> buying

Xbox one pad it works it works better

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.370 
Xbox one pad it works it works better
than<00:06:17.730> I<00:06:17.790> actually<00:06:17.970> thought<00:06:18.210> it<00:06:18.480> would<00:06:18.780> and<00:06:18.960> I

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
than I actually thought it would and I

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.080 
than I actually thought it would and I
got<00:06:19.620> way<00:06:19.920> too<00:06:19.980> comfortable<00:06:20.490> with<00:06:20.700> it<00:06:20.880> way<00:06:21.030> too

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
got way too comfortable with it way too

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.000 
got way too comfortable with it way too
fast<00:06:21.570> so<00:06:21.810> in<00:06:21.930> a<00:06:21.990> situation<00:06:22.530> where<00:06:22.680> you<00:06:22.770> have<00:06:22.890> to

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 
fast so in a situation where you have to

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.920 
fast so in a situation where you have to
go<00:06:23.100> to<00:06:23.160> like<00:06:23.400> maybe<00:06:23.940> a<00:06:24.060> weird<00:06:24.360> tournament<00:06:24.840> and

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
go to like maybe a weird tournament and

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.510 
go to like maybe a weird tournament and
they<00:06:24.990> don't<00:06:25.170> have<00:06:25.260> arcade<00:06:25.560> sticks<00:06:25.830> I'm<00:06:26.190> pretty

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 
they don't have arcade sticks I'm pretty

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.730 
they don't have arcade sticks I'm pretty
confident<00:06:27.000> that<00:06:27.090> I<00:06:27.180> could<00:06:27.390> do<00:06:27.510> almost<00:06:27.840> as<00:06:28.410> just

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 
confident that I could do almost as just

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.470 
confident that I could do almost as just
as<00:06:28.950> good<00:06:29.130> as<00:06:29.280> I<00:06:29.370> possibly<00:06:29.400> can<00:06:30.030> if<00:06:30.180> not<00:06:30.210> like<00:06:30.450> a

as good as I possibly can if not like a
little<00:06:30.630> bit<00:06:30.870> worse<00:06:31.050> using<00:06:31.920> a<00:06:32.040> controller

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
little bit worse using a controller

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.490

the<00:06:33.240> bigger<00:06:33.420> issue<00:06:33.600> comes<00:06:33.900> with<00:06:34.020> like<00:06:34.140> precise

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 
the bigger issue comes with like precise

the bigger issue comes with like precise
movements<00:06:34.950> like<00:06:35.040> dashes<00:06:35.460> and<00:06:35.550> stuff<00:06:35.730> like

00:06:58.159 --> 00:06:58.169 
mystically came out on xbox one I would

00:06:58.169 --> 00:06:59.330 
mystically came out on xbox one I would
probably<00:06:58.440> use<00:06:58.530> the<00:06:58.680> controller<00:06:59.040> for<00:06:59.250> that

00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340 
probably use the controller for that

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.190 
probably use the controller for that
because<00:06:59.520> I'm<00:06:59.669> just<00:06:59.700> used<00:07:00.060> to<00:07:00.180> it<00:07:00.240> but<00:07:00.960> if

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:01.200 
because I'm just used to it but if

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.080

you're looking for like a reason to
either<00:07:03.270> spend<00:07:03.690> $200<00:07:04.350> or<00:07:04.560> just<00:07:04.740> stick<00:07:04.919> with<00:07:05.010> the

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.130 
either spend $200 or just stick with the

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:06.770 
either spend $200 or just stick with the
controller<00:07:05.460> or<00:07:05.700> you<00:07:05.820> really<00:07:06.060> like<00:07:06.210> arcade<00:07:06.510> 6

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:06.780 
controller or you really like arcade 6

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.180 
controller or you really like arcade 6
or<00:07:06.900> you<00:07:06.990> really<00:07:07.169> like<00:07:07.290> d-pads<00:07:07.919> and

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:08.190 
or you really like d-pads and

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.220 
or you really like d-pads and
controllers<00:07:08.669> good<00:07:09.330> news<00:07:09.510> is<00:07:09.660> that<00:07:09.780> the<00:07:09.930> d-pad

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:10.230 
controllers good news is that the d-pad

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:11.840 
controllers good news is that the d-pad
and<00:07:10.290> this<00:07:10.500> stuff<00:07:10.680> works<00:07:10.889> well<00:07:11.130> on<00:07:11.340> Xbox<00:07:11.730> one

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:11.850 
and this stuff works well on Xbox one

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:13.670 
and this stuff works well on Xbox one
and<00:07:12.180> if<00:07:12.479> you<00:07:12.570> like<00:07:12.720> arcade<00:07:13.050> sticks<00:07:13.320> I<00:07:13.440> think

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 
and if you like arcade sticks I think

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.200 
and if you like arcade sticks I think
you<00:07:13.770> should<00:07:13.950> probably<00:07:14.100> still<00:07:14.669> go<00:07:14.940> with<00:07:14.970> the

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.210 
you should probably still go with the

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:16.670 
you should probably still go with the
arcade<00:07:15.540> stick<00:07:15.720> but<00:07:15.870> if<00:07:15.960> you're<00:07:16.080> breaking<00:07:16.380> the

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 
arcade stick but if you're breaking the

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.680 
arcade stick but if you're breaking the
bank<00:07:16.889> then<00:07:17.310> you<00:07:17.400> absolutely<00:07:18.000> can't<00:07:18.330> afford<00:07:18.570> an

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:18.690 
bank then you absolutely can't afford an

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:19.879 
bank then you absolutely can't afford an
arcade<00:07:18.960> stick<00:07:19.169> right<00:07:19.350> now<00:07:19.470> you<00:07:19.530> have<00:07:19.710> to<00:07:19.770> wait

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:19.889 
arcade stick right now you have to wait

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:21.950
