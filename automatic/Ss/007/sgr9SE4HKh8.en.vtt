00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 an idea of all the long and complex that 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.180
 a ph scale is time to make a 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.950
 experiment for that let's do the 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.870
 indicator of abode and we will try 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.540
 to make it more acidic and more alkaline 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.639
 to see the color changes at first 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.250
 place how do you see our indicator is of 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.520
 blue color that indicates a neutral ph 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.710
 it's not mine but neither alkaline ph 7 like 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.230
 well you explained well let's go now to 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.029
 put a few drops of bleach 30 drops to 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.890
 it becomes more alkaline to go 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.679
 from her side we put the presidents 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.679
 of protection and we take 30 drops 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:51.219
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 25 27 28 29 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.880
 and as you can see he has put on a 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.470
 greenish color not yet completely 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.690
 yellow because he has not left until the 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.790
 another extreme alkaline now we are going to 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.430
 bring it back we will do that 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.080
 trip to the side of the acids and to 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.430
 that we are going to add a piece of ice 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.830
 dry I'm going to replace my 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.280
 lenses and the milestone also within the 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.280
 test tube 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.250
 the dry ice as you can see generates a 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.690
 Immediate color change is dioxide 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.450
 carbon that when mixed with water 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.190
 form carbonic acid and it starts to go 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.410
 towards the acid side of the scala 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.680
 of the ph but has not yet gone to the 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:37.140
 another side is in a ph 4 a ph 3 go 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.140
 to send it to 1 using 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:44.710
 muriatic acid let's put a little bit 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.399
 and let's see how it goes to the side 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.970
 of the acids and it turns bright red 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.970
 how can it be 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.450
 now I want to go to the side of the 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.060
 angelinos and let's put the rest of 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.619
 Bleach pays a lot of attention because this 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.299
 Change of color will show us that 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.780
 we have gone to the side of the 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.780
 alkaline 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.900
 That means completely yellow 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.580
 that we are on the side there 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.110
 completely on the alkaline side 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.030
 and now that we have learned about 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.100
 all this range of color that the 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.330
 indicators and the scale of the ph is 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.280
 time to continue doing experiments 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.960
 but always remember that all these 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.760
 substances are very dangerous this 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.590
 red traffic light experiment and it does not 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.180
 can do even with the help of a 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.360
 adult do not miss the next 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.360
 experiment
