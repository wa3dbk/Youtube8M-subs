00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
the place so I recommend getting an

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.150 
the place so I recommend getting an
adoring<00:02:35.180> or<00:02:35.360> elastic<00:02:35.810> band<00:02:36.050> wrapping<00:02:37.040> around

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
I think as you can see my boxing video

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.979 
I think as you can see my boxing video
it's<00:02:50.560> actually<00:02:50.739> really<00:02:51.430> loose

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
it's actually really loose

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.610 
it's actually really loose
it's<00:02:52.989> actually<00:02:53.409> really<00:02:54.250> stiff<00:02:55.439> it's<00:02:56.439> all

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
it's actually really stiff it's all

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.040 
it's actually really stiff it's all
consistent

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050
