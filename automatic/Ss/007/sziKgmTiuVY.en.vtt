walk up and start shooting it from that

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.050 
walk up and start shooting it from that
angle<00:02:19.349> so<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.099> do<00:02:20.280> his<00:02:20.400> thing<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:20.849> gotta

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
angle so I to do his thing so you gotta

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.030
