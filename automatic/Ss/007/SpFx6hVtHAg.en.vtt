I'm going to go show you mine and I've

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.840 
I'm going to go show you mine and I've
also<00:00:53.879> got<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.180> couple<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.570> others<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.930> show

which I found interesting so you can i'm
not<00:00:59.820> sure<00:00:59.910> what<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.239> dimensions<00:01:00.420> are<00:01:00.809> but

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
not sure what the dimensions are but

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.920 
not sure what the dimensions are but
it's<00:01:01.500> roughly<00:01:01.949> like<00:01:02.190> this<00:01:02.399> big<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.629> start

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
it's roughly like this big and you start

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.350 
it's roughly like this big and you start
off<00:01:04.049> let<00:01:04.320> me<00:01:04.409> find<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.700> it's<00:01:05.850> basically<00:01:06.060> a

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
off let me find it so it's basically a

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.710 
off let me find it so it's basically a
Steve<00:01:06.930> skin<00:01:07.260> like<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.570> you<00:01:09.570> just

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
Steve skin like this and you just

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.719 
Steve skin like this and you just
customize<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.650> my<00:01:10.890> neighbor<00:01:11.100> he's<00:01:11.460> blown

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
customize it so my neighbor he's blown

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.730 
customize it so my neighbor he's blown
his<00:01:11.760> up<00:01:12.150> what<00:01:12.570> an<00:01:12.659> idiot<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:13.170> know<00:01:13.260> why<00:01:13.590> I've

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
his up what an idiot I know why I've

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.530 
his up what an idiot I know why I've
done<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.850> other<00:01:15.000> dude<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.420> just

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
done that and this other dude is just

done that and this other dude is just
like<00:01:15.720> knocked<00:01:15.990> out<00:01:16.140> submit<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:16.799> some<00:01:17.070> people

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
like knocked out submit so some people

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.800 
like knocked out submit so some people
are<00:01:17.549> stupid<00:01:17.820> about<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.210> some<00:01:18.570> people<00:01:18.659> actually

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
are stupid about it some people actually

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.700 
are stupid about it some people actually
do<00:01:19.200> serious<00:01:19.530> stuff<00:01:19.759> but<00:01:20.759> anyway<00:01:21.060> here<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.420> mine

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
do serious stuff but anyway here is mine

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.679 
do serious stuff but anyway here is mine
this<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.920> my<00:01:23.159> skin<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.759> it's<00:01:24.030> got<00:01:24.210> handcuffs

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
this is my skin and it's got handcuffs

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.830 
this is my skin and it's got handcuffs
on<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.170> water<00:01:26.130> drops<00:01:26.430> coming<00:01:26.610> down<00:01:26.880> also

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
on it and water drops coming down also

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.359 
on it and water drops coming down also
the<00:01:27.990> physics<00:01:28.409> for<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.680> lava<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.159> water

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
the physics for the lava in the water

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.030 
the physics for the lava in the water
are<00:01:29.610> still<00:01:30.030> blocks<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:31.229> can't<00:01:31.470> get<00:01:31.680> water

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
are still blocks so you can't get water

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.980 
are still blocks so you can't get water
pouring<00:01:32.340> everywhere<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.720> means<00:01:33.869> you

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
pouring everywhere and that means you

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.359 
pouring everywhere and that means you
can<00:01:34.110> do<00:01:34.200> some<00:01:34.409> really<00:01:34.439> cool<00:01:34.680> things<00:01:34.860> with<00:01:35.220> it

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
can do some really cool things with it

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.940 
can do some really cool things with it
I'm<00:01:35.520> not<00:01:35.729> sure<00:01:35.970> if<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.240> saw<00:01:36.540> but<00:01:36.770> when<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.799> was

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
I'm not sure if you saw but when I was

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.010 
I'm not sure if you saw but when I was
that<00:01:38.070> spawn<00:01:38.430> someone<00:01:38.909> had<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> full<00:01:39.540> skin<00:01:39.840> made

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
that spawn someone had a full skin made

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.410 
that spawn someone had a full skin made
out<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.229> lava<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.700> doesn't<00:01:41.970> spread<00:01:42.240> so

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
out of lava and that doesn't spread so

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.600 
out of lava and that doesn't spread so
