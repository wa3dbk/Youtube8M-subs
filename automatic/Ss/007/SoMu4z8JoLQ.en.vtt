them generally you want to take those
out<00:00:44.229> particularly<00:00:44.979> on<00:00:45.280> hard<00:00:45.909> level<00:00:46.390> because

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
out particularly on hard level because

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.270 
out particularly on hard level because
usually<00:00:47.140> they're<00:00:47.530> going<00:00:47.799> for<00:00:47.979> a<00:00:48.010> head<00:00:48.250> shot

so just keep moving along then we get to

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.090 
so just keep moving along then we get to

handgun or assault rifle and you can

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.720 
handgun or assault rifle and you can
take<00:01:08.500> a<00:01:08.530> few<00:01:08.620> more<00:01:08.890> hits<00:01:09.130> from<00:01:09.280> there<00:01:09.430> so<00:01:09.580> take

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:09.730 
take a few more hits from there so take

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.850 
take a few more hits from there so take
out<00:01:09.880> that<00:01:10.060> dude<00:01:10.270> first<00:01:10.570> anyway<00:01:11.380> once<00:01:11.590> you<00:01:11.710> get

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
out that dude first anyway once you get

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.260 
out that dude first anyway once you get
in<00:01:11.980> here<00:01:12.010> you're<00:01:12.370> basically<00:01:12.790> going<00:01:13.060> to<00:01:13.150> be

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
in here you're basically going to be

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.590 
in here you're basically going to be
making<00:01:13.570> your<00:01:13.870> way<00:01:14.050> up<00:01:14.230> to<00:01:14.500> the<00:01:14.950> top<00:01:15.100> where<00:01:15.790> will

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
making your way up to the top where will

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.900 
making your way up to the top where will
the<00:01:16.690> first<00:01:16.930> portion<00:01:17.710> anyway<00:01:18.130> is<00:01:18.190> a<00:01:18.280> top<00:01:18.580> area

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
the first portion anyway is a top area

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.030 
the first portion anyway is a top area
where<00:01:19.090> an<00:01:19.180> RPG<00:01:19.690> is<00:01:19.840> and<00:01:20.350> I<00:01:20.410> believe<00:01:20.710> it<00:01:20.830> takes

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
where an RPG is and I believe it takes

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.820 
where an RPG is and I believe it takes
about<00:01:21.280> four<00:01:21.970> shots<00:01:22.420> three<00:01:23.260> or<00:01:23.350> four<00:01:23.560> shots

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
about four shots three or four shots

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.760 
about four shots three or four shots
anyway<00:01:24.100> blow<00:01:24.490> it<00:01:24.640> up<00:01:24.760> so<00:01:25.590> you're<00:01:26.590> basically

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
anyway blow it up so you're basically

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.580 
anyway blow it up so you're basically
just<00:01:27.160> following<00:01:27.850> where<00:01:28.000> he<00:01:28.180> goes<00:01:28.420> you<00:01:29.230> really

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
just following where he goes you really

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.290 
just following where he goes you really
can't<00:01:29.860> get<00:01:30.010> lost<00:01:30.280> here<00:01:30.760> obviously<00:01:31.000> you're

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
can't get lost here obviously you're

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.180 
can't get lost here obviously you're
just<00:01:31.600> going<00:01:31.750> to<00:01:31.840> be<00:01:31.930> pressing<00:01:32.710> and<00:01:32.770> holding<00:01:32.860> a

going to be actually firing before you

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.010

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
you're going to be actually using your

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
gun to sort of go down a cable but

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.390 
gun to sort of go down a cable but
before<00:03:36.330> you<00:03:36.750> do<00:03:36.930> that<00:03:36.959> make<00:03:37.500> sure<00:03:37.530> that<00:03:38.190> you

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
before you do that make sure that you

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.150 
before you do that make sure that you
take<00:03:38.730> out<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.420> RPG<00:03:39.989> or<00:03:40.020> in<00:03:40.230> any<00:03:40.410> opposition<00:03:40.620> on

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
take out the RPG or in any opposition on

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.430 
take out the RPG or in any opposition on
the<00:03:41.190> ground<00:03:41.310> floor<00:03:41.820> because<00:03:42.720> if<00:03:42.840> you<00:03:42.959> don't<00:03:43.170> do

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
the ground floor because if you don't do

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.750 
the ground floor because if you don't do
that<00:03:43.470> you're<00:03:44.040> going<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.250> be<00:03:44.400> in<00:03:44.430> a<00:03:44.550> lot<00:03:44.730> of

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
that you're going to be in a lot of

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.220 
that you're going to be in a lot of
trouble<00:03:45.209> and<00:03:45.360> you're<00:03:45.540> going<00:03:45.690> to<00:03:45.750> end<00:03:45.870> up<00:03:45.959> with

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
trouble and you're going to end up with

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.540 
trouble and you're going to end up with
a<00:03:46.260> huge<00:03:46.560> fight<00:03:46.830> of<00:03:47.070> the<00:03:47.190> tank<00:03:47.459> blasting

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
a huge fight of the tank blasting

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.880 
a huge fight of the tank blasting
cells<00:03:48.730> that<00:03:48.880> you<00:03:49.060> at<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:49.660> same<00:03:49.870> time<00:03:50.140> so<00:03:50.770> just

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
cells that you at the same time so just

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.860 
cells that you at the same time so just
be<00:03:51.100> aware<00:03:51.130> of<00:03:51.460> that<00:03:51.700> and<00:03:52.300> I<00:03:52.390> believe<00:03:52.630> this<00:03:52.810> is

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
be aware of that and I believe this is

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.650 
be aware of that and I believe this is
the<00:03:52.990> area<00:03:53.230> here<00:03:53.710> so<00:03:54.700> you<00:03:54.820> can<00:03:55.060> see<00:03:55.090> those<00:03:55.450> guys

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
the area here so you can see those guys

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.860 
the area here so you can see those guys
with<00:03:55.930> laser<00:03:56.170> sight<00:03:56.590> take<00:03:57.220> those<00:03:57.430> guys<00:03:57.610> out

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
with laser sight take those guys out

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.030 
with laser sight take those guys out
because<00:03:58.870> you're<00:03:59.230> you're<00:03:59.590> only<00:03:59.740> going<00:03:59.890> to<00:03:59.980> get

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
because you're you're only going to get

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.610 
because you're you're only going to get
one<00:04:00.310> more<00:04:00.370> RPG<00:04:01.330> shot<00:04:01.600> from<00:04:01.840> this<00:04:02.050> side<00:04:02.290> here

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
one more RPG shot from this side here

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.530 
one more RPG shot from this side here
and<00:04:02.800> then<00:04:03.520> the<00:04:03.670> rest<00:04:03.880> are<00:04:04.090> on<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.300> other<00:04:04.420> side

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
and then the rest are on the other side

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.210 
and then the rest are on the other side
you<00:04:05.110> should<00:04:05.140> have<00:04:05.500> more<00:04:05.710> than<00:04:05.830> enough<00:04:05.890> I

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
you should have more than enough I

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:07.950 
you should have more than enough I
believe<00:04:06.460> there's<00:04:06.670> like<00:04:07.090> three<00:04:07.510> or<00:04:07.660> something

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:07.960 
believe there's like three or something

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.050 
believe there's like three or something
like<00:04:08.200> that<00:04:08.260> down<00:04:08.620> on<00:04:08.740> that<00:04:08.890> side<00:04:09.160> so<00:04:09.880> there's

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
like that down on that side so there's

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.790 
like that down on that side so there's
one<00:04:10.390> and<00:04:10.630> then<00:04:10.840> in<00:04:11.050> the<00:04:11.170> corner<00:04:11.560> to<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:11.710> left

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
one and then in the corner to the left

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.740 
one and then in the corner to the left
you're<00:04:12.610> going<00:04:12.730> to<00:04:12.790> hit<00:04:12.880> triangle<00:04:13.390> to<00:04:13.480> slide

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
you're going to hit triangle to slide

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.240 
you're going to hit triangle to slide
across<00:04:13.870> but<00:04:14.230> like<00:04:14.380> I<00:04:14.470> said<00:04:14.530> don't<00:04:14.860> do<00:04:15.220> that

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
across but like I said don't do that

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.770 
across but like I said don't do that
until<00:04:15.850> you<00:04:15.970> take<00:04:16.180> out<00:04:16.330> most<00:04:16.540> of<00:04:16.720> the

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
until you take out most of the

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.020 
until you take out most of the
opposition<00:04:17.350> on<00:04:17.470> that<00:04:17.620> side<00:04:17.890> maybe<00:04:18.580> not<00:04:18.760> all<00:04:19.000> of

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
opposition on that side maybe not all of

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.900 
opposition on that side maybe not all of
them<00:04:19.330> and<00:04:19.840> then<00:04:19.959> one<00:04:20.170> more<00:04:20.380> blast<00:04:20.650> nuts<00:04:21.070> it<00:04:21.340> for

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
them and then one more blast nuts it for

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.460
