00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.660 
okay yeah
and<00:02:04.650> actually<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.189> uses<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.490> different

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
and actually it uses a different

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.999 
and actually it uses a different
principle<00:02:06.330> these<00:02:06.420> are<00:02:06.600> enzymatic<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.680> so

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
principle these are enzymatic and so

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.410 
principle these are enzymatic and so
that<00:02:08.160> means<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.700> just<00:02:08.729> apply<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.240> let

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
that means that you just apply and let

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.940 
that means that you just apply and let
them<00:02:09.660> do<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.899> work<00:02:09.929> whereas<00:02:10.410> we<00:02:10.530> use<00:02:10.679> more<00:02:10.890> of

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
them do the work whereas we use more of

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.340 
them do the work whereas we use more of
a<00:02:11.069> mechanical<00:02:11.300> abrasive<00:02:12.300> did<00:02:12.690> Rufus<00:02:13.020> for<00:02:13.050> our

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
a mechanical abrasive did Rufus for our

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.020 
a mechanical abrasive did Rufus for our
teeth<00:02:13.620> okay<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.280> we're<00:02:14.400> gonna<00:02:14.489> demonstrate
