you see going up the trees and growing
in<00:00:21.539> old<00:00:21.779> houses<00:00:22.130> that's<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.490> culprit<00:00:23.789> of

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
in old houses that's the culprit of

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.890 
in old houses that's the culprit of
invasiveness<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.740> reason<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.490> not<00:00:27.359> only<00:00:27.660> does

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
invasiveness the reason is not only does

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.800 
invasiveness the reason is not only does
it<00:00:28.109> grow<00:00:28.380> fairly<00:00:28.800> rampantly<00:00:29.640> like<00:00:30.000> most<00:00:30.330> Ivy's

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
it grow fairly rampantly like most Ivy's

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.920 
it grow fairly rampantly like most Ivy's
do<00:00:31.050> but<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:32.099> straight<00:00:32.430> species<00:00:33.180> produces

do but the the straight species produces

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.479 
do but the the straight species produces
red<00:00:34.350> berries<00:00:34.950> which<00:00:35.489> in<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:36.239> birds<00:00:36.540> eat<00:00:36.809> and

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
red berries which in the birds eat and

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.030 
red berries which in the birds eat and
scatter<00:00:38.540> everywhere<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:40.079> not<00:00:40.290> only<00:00:40.469> does<00:00:40.829> that

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
scatter everywhere so not only does that

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.389 
scatter everywhere so not only does that
ivy<00:00:41.489> go<00:00:41.640> up<00:00:41.760> your<00:00:42.000> tree<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.570> all<00:00:42.660> over<00:00:42.870> your

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
ivy go up your tree and all over your

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.670 
ivy go up your tree and all over your
foundation<00:00:44.399> but<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:44.989> English<00:00:45.989> ivy<00:00:46.469> plant

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
foundation but that English ivy plant

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.670 
foundation but that English ivy plant
can<00:00:47.219> be<00:00:47.309> spread<00:00:47.640> for<00:00:47.940> miles<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:49.050> that's<00:00:49.289> why<00:00:49.530> we

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
can be spread for miles so that's why we

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.380 
can be spread for miles so that's why we
have<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.070> problem<00:00:50.579> with<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.850> invasiveness

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
have the problem with the invasiveness

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.189 
have the problem with the invasiveness
if<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.710> want<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.010> plant<00:00:53.340> English<00:00:53.879> ivy<00:00:54.329> make

ivy is the fully to fall off but the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.960 
ivy is the fully to fall off but the
root<00:01:27.180> will<00:01:27.570> remain<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.290> it's<00:01:29.070> very<00:01:29.430> deep<00:01:29.790> and

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
root will remain and it's very deep and

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.510 
root will remain and it's very deep and
it's<00:01:30.270> very<00:01:30.570> hard<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.990> kill<00:01:31.280> chances<00:01:32.280> are

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
it's very hard to kill chances are

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.340 
it's very hard to kill chances are
you're<00:01:33.000> going<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.180> spray<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.600> spray<00:01:33.840> for

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
you're going to spray it spray for

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.580 
you're going to spray it spray for
nothing<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.030> really<00:01:36.030> there<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.509> only<00:01:36.840> one<00:01:37.320> way

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
nothing so really there is only one way

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.380 
nothing so really there is only one way
and<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.159> how<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.430> yank<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.820> out<00:01:39.030> you've

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
and that is how you yank it out you've

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.690 
and that is how you yank it out you've
got<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.869> pull<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.259> down<00:01:40.619> if<00:01:40.920> it's<00:01:41.100> going<00:01:41.400> up<00:01:41.549> a

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
got to pull it down if it's going up a

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.630 
got to pull it down if it's going up a
tree<00:01:41.990> you<00:01:42.990> can<00:01:43.170> always<00:01:43.470> cut<00:01:43.829> dig<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.610> roots

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
tree you can always cut dig the roots

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.850 
tree you can always cut dig the roots
and<00:01:45.180> then<00:01:45.329> just<00:01:45.540> cut<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.960> vine<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.470> then<00:01:46.560> what

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
and then just cut the vine and then what

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.340 
and then just cut the vine and then what
the<00:01:47.070> rest<00:01:47.310> up<00:01:47.549> in<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.790> tree<00:01:48.030> will<00:01:48.299> die<00:01:48.600> but<00:01:49.200> you

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
the rest up in the tree will die but you

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.130 
the rest up in the tree will die but you
have<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.740> get<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.070> root<00:01:50.310> by<00:01:50.579> hand<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.299> the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
have to get the root by hand and the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.330 
have to get the root by hand and the
best<00:01:52.380> way<00:01:52.680> is<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.070> yank<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.700> out<00:01:55.640> you<00:01:56.640> can<00:01:56.850> see

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
best way is to yank it out you can see

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.130 
best way is to yank it out you can see
it's<00:01:59.340> way<00:01:59.909> down<00:02:00.210> in<00:02:00.479> here<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.350> not<00:02:01.560> easy

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
it's way down in here and it is not easy

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.660 
it's way down in here and it is not easy
so<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.170> might<00:02:04.439> have<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.829> take<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.040> shovel<00:02:05.399> and

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
so you might have to take a shovel and

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.320 
so you might have to take a shovel and
dig<00:02:05.820> around<00:02:06.000> under<00:02:06.540> there<00:02:07.129> but<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:09.090> want<00:02:09.270> to

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
dig around under there but you want to

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.089 
dig around under there but you want to
make<00:02:09.509> sure<00:02:09.539> that<00:02:09.959> what<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.319> pull<00:02:10.560> out<00:02:10.590> has

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
make sure that what you pull out has

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.000 
make sure that what you pull out has
these<00:02:11.430> final<00:02:12.030> hairy<00:02:12.390> roots

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
these final hairy roots

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.559 
these final hairy roots
if<00:02:14.129> you've<00:02:14.310> got<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.610> lot<00:02:14.939> of<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.299> you're

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
if you've got a lot of it you're

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.000 
if you've got a lot of it you're
probably<00:02:15.810> going<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.290> have<00:02:16.439> to<00:02:16.590> go<00:02:16.739> back<00:02:16.980> for

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
probably going to have to go back for

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.220 
probably going to have to go back for
two<00:02:17.489> or<00:02:17.640> three<00:02:17.879> years<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.480> you'll<00:02:18.689> find<00:02:19.019> new

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
two or three years and you'll find new

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.809 
two or three years and you'll find new
starts<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.040> just<00:02:20.400> have<00:02:20.579> to<00:02:20.730> be

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
starts and you just have to be

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.759 
starts and you just have to be
persistent<00:02:21.209> and<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.629> have<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:22.019> keep<00:02:22.170> doing<00:02:22.230> it

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
persistent and you have to keep doing it

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.930 
persistent and you have to keep doing it
and<00:02:22.829> eventually<00:02:23.549> you'll<00:02:23.790> eradicate<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.569> ivy
