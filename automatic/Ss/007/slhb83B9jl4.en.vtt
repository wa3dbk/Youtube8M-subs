about<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.560> four-wheeler<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.159> don't<00:01:32.640> think<00:01:32.850> I

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
about the four-wheeler I don't think I

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.850 
about the four-wheeler I don't think I
have<00:01:33.090> tried<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.600> but<00:01:33.840> just<00:01:34.470> know<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.680> you

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
have tried it but just know that you

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.370 
have tried it but just know that you
pretty<00:01:35.070> much<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.460> have<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:36.390> car<00:01:36.960> with<00:01:37.200> some

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
pretty much have to have a car with some

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.530 
pretty much have to have a car with some
decent<00:01:37.770> speed<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.610> be<00:01:38.759> able<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.060> get<00:01:39.210> up<00:01:39.360> there

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
decent speed to be able to get up there

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.810 
decent speed to be able to get up there
but<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.500> should<00:01:40.770> work<00:01:40.799> about<00:01:41.189> every<00:01:41.460> time<00:01:41.640> you

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
but it should work about every time you

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.219 
but it should work about every time you
see<00:01:41.970> me<00:01:42.060> here<00:01:42.240> calling<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.570> taxi<00:01:42.720> it's<00:01:43.110> as

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
see me here calling a taxi it's as

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:43.819 
see me here calling a taxi it's as
simple<00:01:43.350> as<00:01:43.590> that

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
simple as that

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.819 
simple as that
wait<00:01:44.729> till<00:01:44.880> they<00:01:44.970> come<00:01:45.180> up<00:01:45.360> shoot<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.470> taxi

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
wait till they come up shoot the taxi

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.219 
wait till they come up shoot the taxi
cab<00:01:47.009> driver<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.820> face<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.509> then<00:01:49.049> you've

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
cab driver in the face and then you've

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.770 
cab driver in the face and then you've
got<00:01:49.470> your<00:01:49.649> vehicle<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:51.360> makes<00:01:51.570> for<00:01:51.720> a

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
got your vehicle and this makes for a

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.249 
got your vehicle and this makes for a
very<00:01:52.079> easy<00:01:52.890> way<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.880> get<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.360> base<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:55.170> I'm

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
very easy way to get in the base so I'm

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.170 
very easy way to get in the base so I'm
going<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.470> go<00:01:55.530> ahead<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.979> skip<00:01:56.219> ahead<00:01:56.310> alright

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
going to go ahead and skip ahead alright

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.910 
going to go ahead and skip ahead alright
so<00:01:57.360> as<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.540> can<00:01:57.689> see<00:01:57.750> now<00:01:58.110> go<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.590> but<00:01:58.799> go

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
so as you can see now go that but go

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.530 
so as you can see now go that but go
back<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.340> end<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.640> road<00:01:59.820> here<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.180> get

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
back to the end of the road here and get

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.950 
back to the end of the road here and get
a<00:02:00.570> nice<00:02:00.750> good<00:02:01.079> head<00:02:01.409> start<00:02:01.939> and<00:02:02.939> just<00:02:03.479> watch

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
want out of the base but then the cool

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.400 
want out of the base but then the cool
thing<00:02:25.580> about<00:02:25.610> this<00:02:25.970> is<00:02:26.180> that<00:02:26.240> that<00:02:26.600> spot<00:02:27.050> is<00:02:27.230> so

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
thing about this is that that spot is so

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.260 
thing about this is that that spot is so
close<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:27.980> highway<00:02:28.100> that<00:02:28.550> when<00:02:28.670> you<00:02:28.790> like

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
close to the highway that when you like

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.730 
close to the highway that when you like
you<00:02:29.630> know<00:02:29.720> a<00:02:29.750> lot<00:02:29.960> of<00:02:29.990> times<00:02:30.230> when<00:02:30.410> you<00:02:30.500> get<00:02:30.620> in

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
you know a lot of times when you get in

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.200 
you know a lot of times when you get in
the<00:02:30.830> space<00:02:31.040> you<00:02:31.190> just<00:02:31.220> get<00:02:31.520> killed<00:02:31.700> by<00:02:31.880> a<00:02:31.910> tank

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
the space you just get killed by a tank

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.360 
the space you just get killed by a tank
or<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:33.200> military<00:02:33.380> people<00:02:33.890> shoot<00:02:34.100> you<00:02:34.250> or

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
or the military people shoot you or

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.550 
or the military people shoot you or
whatever<00:02:34.640> if<00:02:35.120> that<00:02:35.330> happens<00:02:35.720> pretty<00:02:36.410> much

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
whatever if that happens pretty much

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.880 
whatever if that happens pretty much
wherever<00:02:36.860> you<00:02:37.130> spawn<00:02:37.600> call<00:02:38.600> a<00:02:38.630> taxi<00:02:38.900> off<00:02:39.500> your

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
wherever you spawn call a taxi off your

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:40.540 
wherever you spawn call a taxi off your
cell<00:02:40.100> phone

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
cell phone

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.550 
cell phone
I<00:02:40.580> think<00:02:41.210> cost<00:02:41.420> a<00:02:41.600> hundred<00:02:41.870> bucks<00:02:42.020> every<00:02:42.380> time

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
I think cost a hundred bucks every time

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.580 
I think cost a hundred bucks every time
but<00:02:43.430> it<00:02:43.580> isn't<00:02:44.030> too<00:02:44.150> bad<00:02:44.360> taxi<00:02:44.960> come<00:02:45.110> shoot<00:02:45.470> the

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
but it isn't too bad taxi come shoot the

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.800 
but it isn't too bad taxi come shoot the
cab<00:02:45.740> driver<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:46.340> then<00:02:46.790> just<00:02:47.120> drive<00:02:47.600> through

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
cab driver and then just drive through

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.420 
cab driver and then just drive through
the<00:02:47.960> tunnel<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:48.500> go<00:02:48.620> back<00:02:48.800> to<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.040> spot<00:02:49.250> that

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
the tunnel and go back to the spot that

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.300 
the tunnel and go back to the spot that
I<00:02:49.490> just<00:02:49.670> showed<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:50.150> do<00:02:50.720> it<00:02:50.840> again<00:02:51.050> and<00:02:51.310> it's

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
I just showed and do it again and it's

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.090 
I just showed and do it again and it's
pretty<00:02:52.730> damn<00:02:53.240> simple<00:02:53.750> so<00:02:53.990> this<00:02:54.770> is<00:02:54.980> the

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
pretty damn simple so this is the

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.190 
pretty damn simple so this is the
easiest<00:02:55.430> way<00:02:55.670> that<00:02:55.700> I<00:02:55.910> found<00:02:56.030> as<00:02:56.570> of<00:02:56.870> right<00:02:57.050> now

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
easiest way that I found as of right now

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.660 
easiest way that I found as of right now
to<00:02:57.290> get<00:02:57.440> into<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.710> military<00:02:57.830> base<00:02:58.190> if<00:02:58.340> I<00:02:58.430> find

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
to get into the military base if I find

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.520 
to get into the military base if I find
any<00:02:58.850> easier<00:02:59.210> ways<00:02:59.420> I'll<00:02:59.810> make<00:03:00.140> another<00:03:00.350> video

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
any easier ways I'll make another video

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.710 
any easier ways I'll make another video
but<00:03:01.010> I<00:03:01.250> hope<00:03:01.580> you<00:03:01.700> guys<00:03:01.850> enjoy<00:03:02.240> and<00:03:02.270> have<00:03:02.690> fun
