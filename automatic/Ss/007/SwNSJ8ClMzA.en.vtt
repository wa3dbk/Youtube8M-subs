surgeon how to do this technique and he
said<00:00:15.480> Greer<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:16.260> only<00:00:16.619> makes<00:00:17.160> sense<00:00:17.449> the

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
said Greer it only makes sense the

said Greer it only makes sense the
facial<00:00:18.990> muscles<00:00:19.380> are<00:00:19.529> just<00:00:19.859> like<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.189> muscles

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
facial muscles are just like the muscles

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
them they will respond - he said that

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
most people start to get sag right in

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.130 
most people start to get sag right in
here<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.310> then<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.060> works<00:00:30.300> under<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.869> eyes

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
here and then it works under the eyes

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.069 
here and then it works under the eyes
and<00:00:31.560> then<00:00:31.740> all<00:00:31.980> over<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:33.210> what<00:00:33.450> we're<00:00:33.660> going<00:00:33.930> to

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
and then all over so what we're going to

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.530 
and then all over so what we're going to
do<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.500> we're<00:00:34.739> going<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:35.070> stretch<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.329> face

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
do is we're going to stretch the face

do is we're going to stretch the face
we're<00:00:37.469> going<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.739> exercise<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.550> muscles<00:00:38.940> and

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
we're going to exercise the muscles and

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.540 
we're going to exercise the muscles and
we're<00:00:39.570> going<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.750> lift<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.469> smooth<00:00:41.070> out<00:00:41.309> the

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
we're going to lift and smooth out the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.760 
we're going to lift and smooth out the
skin<00:00:41.730> when<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.719> bring<00:00:42.930> blood<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.620> skin

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
skin when you bring blood to the skin

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.100 
skin when you bring blood to the skin
you<00:00:44.190> create<00:00:44.850> more<00:00:45.059> elasticity<00:00:45.629> in<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.079> skin

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
you create more elasticity in the skin

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.340 
you create more elasticity in the skin
which<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.829> course<00:00:46.860> gives<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> younger<00:00:47.940> look

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
which of course gives you a younger look
