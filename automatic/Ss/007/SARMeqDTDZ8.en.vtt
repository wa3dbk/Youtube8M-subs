missed<00:01:59.690> out<00:01:59.870> missions<00:02:00.230> I'm<00:02:00.410> not<00:02:00.860> sure<00:02:00.979> if<00:02:01.070> they

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
missed out missions I'm not sure if they

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.410 
missed out missions I'm not sure if they
miss<00:02:01.310> at<00:02:01.430> the<00:02:01.550> end<00:02:01.700> because<00:02:02.000> that's<00:02:02.240> why<00:02:02.360> the

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
miss at the end because that's why the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.640 
miss at the end because that's why the
ending<00:02:02.780> so<00:02:03.580> sudden<00:02:04.580> or<00:02:05.119> if<00:02:05.840> it's<00:02:06.020> an<00:02:06.260> extra

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
ending so sudden or if it's an extra

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.320 
ending so sudden or if it's an extra
missions<00:02:06.770> I'm<00:02:06.979> not<00:02:07.100> actually<00:02:07.220> sure<00:02:07.400> but<00:02:08.209> if

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
missions I'm not actually sure but if

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.669 
missions I'm not actually sure but if
you<00:02:08.660> know<00:02:08.780> if<00:02:08.869> they<00:02:08.990> put<00:02:09.170> their<00:02:09.200> missions<00:02:09.560> in

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
you know if they put their missions in

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.699 
you know if they put their missions in
that'd<00:02:09.800> be<00:02:09.890> fantastic<00:02:10.130> but<00:02:10.940> uh<00:02:11.110> again<00:02:12.110> I<00:02:12.320> don't

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
that'd be fantastic but uh again I don't

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:13.960 
that'd be fantastic but uh again I don't
hold<00:02:12.890> out<00:02:13.040> much<00:02:13.100> hope<00:02:13.370> with<00:02:13.730> that<00:02:13.760> would<00:02:13.910> be

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
hold out much hope with that would be

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.030 
hold out much hope with that would be
awesome<00:02:14.090> but<00:02:14.780> doesn't<00:02:15.380> actually<00:02:15.470> you<00:02:15.770> have<00:02:15.920> to
