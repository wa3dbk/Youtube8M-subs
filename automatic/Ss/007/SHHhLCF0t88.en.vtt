the for the system what does she plan to
do<00:03:37.810> I<00:03:37.840> know<00:03:38.049> she's<00:03:38.319> doing<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.769> listening<00:03:38.980> boat

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
do I know she's doing the listening boat

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.050 
do I know she's doing the listening boat
but<00:03:40.180> what<00:03:40.540> are<00:03:40.750> her<00:03:41.079> priorities<00:03:41.829> I<00:03:42.099> didn't<00:03:42.879> get

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
but what are her priorities I didn't get

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.190 
but what are her priorities I didn't get
a<00:03:43.090> sense<00:03:43.450> of<00:03:43.750> what<00:03:44.650> she<00:03:44.680> has<00:03:45.069> in<00:03:45.670> her<00:03:45.849> mind<00:03:46.200> that

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
a sense of what she has in her mind that

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.960 
a sense of what she has in her mind that
would<00:03:47.319> have<00:03:47.409> been<00:03:47.500> nice<00:03:47.650> if<00:03:47.680> she<00:03:47.889> did<00:03:48.129> I<00:03:48.370> think

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
would have been nice if she did I think

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.879 
would have been nice if she did I think
that<00:03:49.359> she's<00:03:49.569> trying<00:03:50.290> to<00:03:50.410> make<00:03:50.590> clear<00:03:50.799> to

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
that she's trying to make clear to

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:51.960 
that she's trying to make clear to
everybody<00:03:51.069> that<00:03:51.340> she<00:03:51.459> cares<00:03:51.699> about<00:03:51.849> education

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
everybody that she cares about education

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.220 
everybody that she cares about education
it<00:03:52.569> cares<00:03:52.780> about<00:03:52.870> shortly

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
it cares about shortly

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.190 
it cares about shortly
and<00:03:55.349> that<00:03:56.040> lots<00:03:56.610> of<00:03:56.849> places<00:03:57.120> in<00:03:57.360> New<00:03:57.690> York<00:03:57.750> City

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
and that lots of places in New York City

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.229 
and that lots of places in New York City
had<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.590> same<00:03:58.800> problem<00:03:59.220> where<00:03:59.819> not<00:04:00.030> enough

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
had the same problem where not enough

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.449 
had the same problem where not enough
schools<00:04:00.510> have<00:04:00.690> been<00:04:00.810> built<00:04:01.099> and<00:04:02.099> I<00:04:02.190> think<00:04:02.400> the

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
schools have been built and I think the

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.670 
schools have been built and I think the
big<00:04:02.610> question<00:04:02.760> is<00:04:03.660> whether<00:04:03.989> she's<00:04:04.319> willing<00:04:04.620> to

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
big question is whether she's willing to

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.400 
big question is whether she's willing to
go<00:04:04.860> to<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.010> mayor<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:05.629> explain<00:04:06.629> how<00:04:06.989> urgent

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
go to the mayor and explain how urgent

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.119 
go to the mayor and explain how urgent
the<00:04:07.500> situation<00:04:07.530> is<00:04:08.250> that<00:04:09.440> for<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.530> past<00:04:10.769> eight

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
the situation is that for the past eight

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:13.220 
the situation is that for the past eight
years<00:04:11.190> not<00:04:11.880> enough<00:04:12.150> schools<00:04:12.360> were<00:04:12.569> built<00:04:12.810> and

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
years not enough schools were built and

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.060 
years not enough schools were built and
that<00:04:15.019> this<00:04:16.019> city<00:04:16.200> needs<00:04:16.500> to<00:04:16.560> do<00:04:16.739> something

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
that this city needs to do something

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:25.860 
that this city needs to do something
about<00:04:17.160> that

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.930
