00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.060 
comes down to the nitty-gritty what
you're<00:02:05.090> going<00:02:05.270> to<00:02:05.330> have<00:02:05.510> is<00:02:05.840> a<00:02:06.620> pile<00:02:07.040> of

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
you're going to have is a pile of

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.800 
you're going to have is a pile of
instruments<00:02:07.700> in<00:02:07.760> the<00:02:07.820> corner<00:02:08.149> that<00:02:08.479> you<00:02:08.690> have

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
instruments in the corner that you have

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.590 
instruments in the corner that you have
no<00:02:08.989> idea<00:02:09.170> how<00:02:09.590> to<00:02:09.649> use

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
no idea how to use

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.850 
no idea how to use
then<00:02:10.690> you're<00:02:10.840> going<00:02:10.990> to<00:02:11.080> use<00:02:11.290> them<00:02:11.470> why<00:02:11.800> you

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
then you're going to use them why you

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.470 
then you're going to use them why you
should<00:02:12.340> use<00:02:12.370> them<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:12.880> what<00:02:13.060> you<00:02:13.180> should<00:02:13.210> use

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
should use them and what you should use

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.640 
should use them and what you should use
and<00:02:13.660> for<00:02:14.430> so<00:02:15.430> I<00:02:15.730> would<00:02:15.910> encourage<00:02:16.000> you<00:02:16.650> when

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
and for so I would encourage you when

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.400 
and for so I would encourage you when
you<00:02:17.950> are<00:02:18.160> evaluating<00:02:18.970> your<00:02:19.690> your<00:02:20.110> prep<00:02:20.380> work

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
you are evaluating your your prep work

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.110 
you are evaluating your your prep work
and<00:02:20.650> when<00:02:20.890> you're<00:02:21.010> evaluating<00:02:21.400> your<00:02:21.730> supplies

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
and when you're evaluating your supplies

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.780 
and when you're evaluating your supplies
to<00:02:22.660> take<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:22.870> real<00:02:23.110> honest<00:02:23.500> assessment<00:02:24.130> of<00:02:24.160> what

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
to take a real honest assessment of what

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.570 
to take a real honest assessment of what
is<00:02:24.970> a<00:02:25.000> realistic<00:02:25.540> scenario<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.380> prep<00:02:27.130> for<00:02:27.160> an

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
is a realistic scenario to prep for an

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.380 
is a realistic scenario to prep for an

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
that you anticipate this is part of what

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.050 
that you anticipate this is part of what
we<00:02:31.540> discuss<00:02:32.050> in<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:32.650> medical<00:02:32.980> prep<00:02:33.160> 101<00:02:33.730> class

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
we discuss in the medical prep 101 class

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.420 
we discuss in the medical prep 101 class
part<00:02:34.960> of<00:02:35.170> the<00:02:35.500> curriculum<00:02:35.680> that<00:02:36.130> I<00:02:36.250> developed

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
part of the curriculum that I developed

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.530 
part of the curriculum that I developed
is<00:02:36.910> pulling<00:02:37.540> apart<00:02:37.690> all<00:02:38.230> of<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.740> clutter<00:02:39.100> and

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
is pulling apart all of the clutter and

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.000 
is pulling apart all of the clutter and
medical<00:02:40.540> prep<00:02:40.780> world<00:02:41.050> and<00:02:41.290> distilling<00:02:41.710> down

medical prep world and distilling down
for<00:02:42.340> you<00:02:42.550> what<00:02:43.390> are<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.660> realistic<00:02:44.320> things<00:02:44.590> to

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
for you what are the realistic things to

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.860 
for you what are the realistic things to
prep<00:02:45.010> for<00:02:45.040> and<00:02:45.610> what<00:02:46.120> you<00:02:46.270> can<00:02:46.450> really<00:02:46.600> do

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
prep for and what you can really do

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.520 
prep for and what you can really do
about<00:02:46.900> it<00:02:48.120> unfortunately<00:02:49.120> like<00:02:49.900> as<00:02:50.110> mentioned

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
about it unfortunately like as mentioned

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.410 
about it unfortunately like as mentioned
earlier<00:02:50.620> we<00:02:51.190> are<00:02:51.340> operating<00:02:51.700> in<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.180> dream

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
earlier we are operating in a dream

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.190 
earlier we are operating in a dream
world<00:02:52.450> I<00:02:53.670> guess<00:02:54.670> it's<00:02:54.850> because<00:02:55.000> we<00:02:55.810> are<00:02:55.930> used

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
world I guess it's because we are used

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.580 
world I guess it's because we are used
to<00:02:56.380> seeing<00:02:56.860> physicians<00:02:57.820> &amp;<00:02:58.030> and<00:02:58.960> health<00:02:59.530> care

of our families so realistically what we
