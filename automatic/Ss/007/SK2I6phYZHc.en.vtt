on it's it's basically what the what the
gun<00:00:31.920> game<00:00:32.189> way<00:00:32.610> too<00:00:32.669> much<00:00:32.910> was<00:00:33.210> based<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.660> where

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
gun game way too much was based on where

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.600 
gun game way too much was based on where
the<00:00:34.230> idea<00:00:34.500> for<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.680> came<00:00:34.950> from<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.309> came<00:00:35.430> from

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
the idea for that came from it came from

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.400 
the idea for that came from it came from
the<00:00:35.730> community<00:00:35.880> it's<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.930> game<00:00:37.079> that's<00:00:37.290> played

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
the community it's a game that's played

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.970 
the community it's a game that's played
as<00:00:37.770> as<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.520> core<00:00:38.700> duty<00:00:39.000> games<00:00:39.180> get<00:00:39.420> into<00:00:39.629> the

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
as as the core duty games get into the

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.979 
as as the core duty games get into the
later<00:00:40.980> stages<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.579> their<00:00:41.820> life's<00:00:42.090> life<00:00:42.540> cycle

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
later stages of their life's life cycle

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.660 
later stages of their life's life cycle
like<00:00:43.200> with<00:00:43.530> modern<00:00:43.770> warfare<00:00:43.950> 2<00:00:44.100> we<00:00:44.370> saw<00:00:44.550> quite

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
like with modern warfare 2 we saw quite

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.279 
like with modern warfare 2 we saw quite
a<00:00:44.789> lot<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.000> people<00:00:45.270> go<00:00:45.360> for<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.629> litterbug<00:00:45.899> nukes

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
a lot of people go for a litterbug nukes

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.180 
a lot of people go for a litterbug nukes
and<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.879> think<00:00:48.180> it's<00:00:48.300> gonna<00:00:48.390> be<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:49.530> game<00:00:49.890> that

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
and I think it's gonna be a game that

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.580 
and I think it's gonna be a game that
will<00:00:50.789> help<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.149> have<00:00:51.300> fun<00:00:51.329> in<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.379> later

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
will help you have fun in the later

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.400 
will help you have fun in the later
months<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.640> black<00:00:53.850> ops<00:00:54.030> it's<00:00:54.329> all<00:00:54.449> warfare<00:00:55.110> 3

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
months of black ops it's all warfare 3

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.920 
months of black ops it's all warfare 3
comes<00:00:55.590> out<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:56.640> where<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.180> class<00:00:57.510> is

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
comes out so where this class is

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.080 
comes out so where this class is
optimized<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:59.039> help<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.460> achieve<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.940> best

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
optimized to help you achieve the best

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.290 
optimized to help you achieve the best
results<00:01:00.920> playing<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.129> game<00:01:02.370> by<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.670> general

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
results playing this game by the general

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.840 
results playing this game by the general
rules<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:04.280> essentially<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.369> basic<00:01:05.640> rule<00:01:05.820> is

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
rules so essentially the basic rule is

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.520 
rules so essentially the basic rule is
kill<00:01:06.150> someone<00:01:06.479> gonna<00:01:06.689> pick<00:01:07.080> up<00:01:07.200> their<00:01:07.350> gun

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
kill someone gonna pick up their gun

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
had a couple of couple of ideas for this

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.520 
had a couple of couple of ideas for this
one<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.299> one<00:01:27.420> I've<00:01:27.509> gone<00:01:27.659> gone<00:01:27.960> for<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.380> the

one the one I've gone gone for is the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.260 
one the one I've gone gone for is the
mp5k<00:01:29.570> simply<00:01:30.570> because<00:01:30.900> it's<00:01:31.579> it's<00:01:32.579> it's<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
mp5k simply because it's it's it's the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.840 
mp5k simply because it's it's it's the
weapon<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:34.200> start<00:01:34.470> off<00:01:34.650> with<00:01:34.950> the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
the default classes one of the first

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.149 
the default classes one of the first
weapons<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.479> get<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.659> play<00:01:39.810> with<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.710> when

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.190 
weapons you get to play with so when
another<00:01:41.610> idea<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.000> add<00:01:42.180> was<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.630> was<00:01:42.780> maybe<00:01:42.990> to

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
another idea I add was it was maybe to

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.510 
another idea I add was it was maybe to
start<00:01:43.259> off<00:01:43.590> with<00:01:43.829> there's<00:01:44.130> something<00:01:44.399> like

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
start off with there's something like

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.450 
start off with there's something like
crazily<00:01:45.060> hard<00:01:45.899> weapon<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.470> use<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.950> make<00:01:47.100> kit

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
crazily hard weapon to use to make kit

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.249 
crazily hard weapon to use to make kit
to<00:01:47.790> make<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.030> worthwhile<00:01:48.210> killing<00:01:48.960> someone

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
to make it worthwhile killing someone

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.469 
to make it worthwhile killing someone
and<00:01:49.290> getting<00:01:49.530> their<00:01:49.740> weapon<00:01:50.070> but<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.850> thought

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
and getting their weapon but I thought

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.260 
and getting their weapon but I thought
we'll<00:01:51.930> stick<00:01:52.140> with<00:01:52.170> mp5k<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:53.009> kinda<00:01:53.280> goes<00:01:53.460> hand

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
we'll stick with mp5k it kinda goes hand

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.240 
we'll stick with mp5k it kinda goes hand
in<00:01:54.360> hand<00:01:54.420> with<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.810> kind<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.170> working<00:01:55.890> up<00:01:56.009> and

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
in hand with the kind of working up and

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.090 
in hand with the kind of working up and
changing<00:01:56.820> weapons<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.479> mp5k<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.920> best

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
changing weapons so mp5k and the best

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.770 
changing weapons so mp5k and the best
attachment<00:01:59.640> just<00:01:59.759> an<00:01:59.939> all-around<00:02:00.119> attachment

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
attachment just an all-around attachment

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.240 
attachment just an all-around attachment
is<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.200> extended<00:02:01.649> mags

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
is the extended mags

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.609 
is the extended mags
now<00:02:03.240> secondary<00:02:03.780> wise<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.259> doesn't<00:02:04.500> really

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
now secondary wise it doesn't really

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.499 
now secondary wise it doesn't really
matter<00:02:04.799> gonna<00:02:05.189> add<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.369> couple<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.759> ideas<00:02:05.880> I've

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
matter gonna add a couple of ideas I've

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.789 
matter gonna add a couple of ideas I've
gone<00:02:06.689> with<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.960> ballistic<00:02:07.350> knife<00:02:07.380> simply

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
gone with the ballistic knife simply

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.320 
gone with the ballistic knife simply
because<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.340> might<00:02:08.489> want<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.729> start<00:02:08.970> off<00:02:09.090> with

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
because you might want to start off with

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.360 
because you might want to start off with
the<00:02:09.479> knife<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:10.530> then<00:02:10.739> kind<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.039> work<00:02:11.190> your<00:02:11.250> way

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
the knife and then kind of work your way

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.860 
the knife and then kind of work your way
up<00:02:11.520> from<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.879> so

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
up from that so

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.449 
up from that so
up<00:02:12.959> someone<00:02:13.319> then<00:02:13.500> you<00:02:13.620> move<00:02:13.769> on<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:14.190> and

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
up someone then you move on to it and

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.380 
up someone then you move on to it and
some<00:02:15.420> sort<00:02:15.599> of<00:02:15.659> weapon<00:02:16.560> with<00:02:16.890> firepower<00:02:17.390> but

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
some sort of weapon with firepower but

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.490 
some sort of weapon with firepower but
the<00:02:18.510> wise<00:02:18.629> you<00:02:18.780> might<00:02:18.930> want<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.170> would

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
the wise you might want to would

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.289 
the wise you might want to would
replicate<00:02:19.709> what<00:02:20.129> happens<00:02:20.159> in<00:02:20.670> gun<00:02:20.849> game<00:02:21.090> and

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
replicate what happens in gun game and

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.690 
replicate what happens in gun game and
equip<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.599> Python<00:02:22.049> but<00:02:22.230> we<00:02:23.069> was<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.280> Python<00:02:23.670> in

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
equip the Python but we was a Python in

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.259 
equip the Python but we was a Python in
in<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.180> couple<00:02:24.450> of<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.629> recent<00:02:25.019> the<00:02:25.890> recent

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
in a couple of the recent the recent

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.809 
in a couple of the recent the recent
episodes<00:02:27.269> of<00:02:27.390> these<00:02:27.569> classes<00:02:28.019> subside

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
episodes of these classes subside

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.800 
episodes of these classes subside
dropping<00:02:29.819> the<00:02:29.909> ballistic<00:02:30.239> knife<00:02:30.269> again<00:02:30.659> just

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
dropping the ballistic knife again just

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.229 
dropping the ballistic knife again just
to<00:02:30.989> add<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.470> bit<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:31.739> variety<00:02:32.239> so

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
to add a bit of variety so

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.509 
to add a bit of variety so
equipment-wise<00:02:33.920> fraggin<00:02:34.920> semtex<00:02:35.159> we

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
equipment-wise fraggin semtex we

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.789 
equipment-wise fraggin semtex we
probably<00:02:35.730> want<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.060> semtex<00:02:36.500> simply<00:02:37.500> because

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
probably want the semtex simply because

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.069 
probably want the semtex simply because
they<00:02:38.610> don't<00:02:38.790> go<00:02:39.060> quite<00:02:39.239> as<00:02:39.450> far

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
they don't go quite as far

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.860 
they don't go quite as far
semtex<00:02:40.620> is<00:02:40.890> got<00:02:41.069> at<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.459> time<00:02:41.940> or<00:02:42.120> so<00:02:42.299> it

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
semtex is got at that time or so it

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.069 
semtex is got at that time or so it
tends<00:02:43.049> to<00:02:43.140> explode<00:02:43.620> at<00:02:44.480> kind<00:02:45.480> of<00:02:45.569> medium<00:02:45.870> range

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
tends to explode at kind of medium range

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.140 
tends to explode at kind of medium range
you<00:02:46.260> can't<00:02:46.500> kill<00:02:46.769> kind<00:02:47.190> of<00:02:47.310> like<00:02:47.459> throw<00:02:47.700> it<00:02:47.849> for

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
you can't kill kind of like throw it for

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.030 
you can't kill kind of like throw it for
miles<00:02:48.359> and<00:02:48.690> then<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:49.140> roll<00:02:49.379> a<00:02:49.410> bit<00:02:49.650> further<00:02:49.859> and

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
miles and then it roll a bit further and

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.580 
miles and then it roll a bit further and
obviously<00:02:50.519> want<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.760> keep<00:02:50.870> combat<00:02:51.870> in<00:02:52.230> the

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
obviously want to keep combat in the

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.199 
obviously want to keep combat in the
inks<00:02:52.920> quite<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.340> kind<00:02:53.459> of<00:02:53.579> close<00:02:53.790> range<00:02:54.090> you

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
inks quite the kind of close range you

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.900 
inks quite the kind of close range you
can<00:02:54.629> actually<00:02:55.530> get<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.129> the<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:56.609> weapon

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
can actually get to the to the weapon

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.940 
can actually get to the to the weapon
that<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.150> need<00:02:57.299> to<00:02:57.510> pick<00:02:58.470> up

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
that you need to pick up

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.220 
that you need to pick up
so<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.790> semtex<00:02:59.940> is<00:03:00.299> just<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.599> handy<00:03:00.959> one<00:03:01.049> just

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
so the semtex is just a handy one just

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.800 
so the semtex is just a handy one just
to<00:03:01.319> keep<00:03:01.440> in<00:03:01.620> your<00:03:01.680> loadout<00:03:02.159> just<00:03:02.400> in<00:03:02.519> case

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
to keep in your loadout just in case

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.330 
to keep in your loadout just in case
second<00:03:03.810> about<00:03:04.049> the<00:03:04.290> tactical<00:03:04.950> grenades<00:03:05.220> you

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
second about the tactical grenades you

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.699 
second about the tactical grenades you
want<00:03:05.519> to<00:03:05.640> choose<00:03:05.849> the<00:03:06.030> concussions<00:03:06.599> now<00:03:07.379> where

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
want to choose the concussions now where

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.710 
want to choose the concussions now where
the<00:03:07.859> reason<00:03:08.430> for<00:03:08.609> this<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:08.879> because<00:03:09.000> the

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
the reason for this is because the

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.599 
the reason for this is because the
concussion<00:03:10.440> grenades<00:03:10.769> will<00:03:10.950> slow<00:03:11.220> down<00:03:11.250> the

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
concussion grenades will slow down the

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:12.979 
concussion grenades will slow down the
enemy<00:03:11.640> players<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.269> like<00:03:12.359> flash<00:03:12.629> grenades

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
enemy players and like flash grenades

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.509 
enemy players and like flash grenades
which<00:03:13.170> allow<00:03:13.379> them<00:03:13.590> just<00:03:13.799> to<00:03:13.890> keep<00:03:14.010> moving<00:03:14.159> at

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
which allow them just to keep moving at

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.140 
which allow them just to keep moving at
the<00:03:14.780> their<00:03:15.780> full<00:03:15.989> speed<00:03:16.319> and<00:03:16.790> also<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.880> reason

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
the their full speed and also the reason

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.670 
the their full speed and also the reason
for<00:03:18.269> this<00:03:18.359> is<00:03:18.540> he<00:03:18.720> if<00:03:19.139> you<00:03:19.290> see<00:03:19.440> someone

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
for this is he if you see someone

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.620 
for this is he if you see someone
bringing<00:03:20.130> away<00:03:20.370> from<00:03:20.639> you<00:03:20.790> you<00:03:21.389> throw<00:03:21.569> a

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
bringing away from you you throw a

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.089 
bringing away from you you throw a
concussion<00:03:21.989> grenade<00:03:22.349> it<00:03:22.530> stops<00:03:22.769> doing<00:03:22.980> the

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
concussion grenade it stops doing the

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:24.860 
concussion grenade it stops doing the
tracks<00:03:23.340> you<00:03:23.549> can<00:03:23.609> then<00:03:23.849> take<00:03:24.329> them<00:03:24.450> out<00:03:24.569> and

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
tracks you can then take them out and

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.159 
tracks you can then take them out and
then<00:03:25.049> the<00:03:25.620> weapon<00:03:25.769> is<00:03:26.040> is<00:03:26.340> quite<00:03:26.700> close<00:03:27.030> to

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:27.169 
then the weapon is is quite close to

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:30.259 
then the weapon is is quite close to
pick<00:03:28.169> up<00:03:28.349> whereas<00:03:28.769> otherwise<00:03:29.129> if<00:03:29.910> you<00:03:30.060> shoot

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
pick up whereas otherwise if you shoot

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.270 
pick up whereas otherwise if you shoot
them<00:03:30.450> exactly<00:03:30.720> yeah<00:03:31.260> a<00:03:31.590> little<00:03:31.980> bit<00:03:32.040> further

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
them exactly yeah a little bit further

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.460 
them exactly yeah a little bit further
away<00:03:32.459> got<00:03:32.879> that<00:03:33.030> slightly<00:03:33.810> slightly<00:03:34.169> more

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
away got that slightly slightly more

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.379 
away got that slightly slightly more
distance<00:03:35.129> to<00:03:35.340> travel<00:03:35.519> to<00:03:35.849> get<00:03:35.970> their<00:03:36.120> weapon

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
distance to travel to get their weapon

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.509 
distance to travel to get their weapon
intended<00:03:37.290> for<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.590> equipment<00:03:37.919> Trace<00:03:38.310> we've

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
intended for the equipment Trace we've

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.699 
intended for the equipment Trace we've
got<00:03:38.669> the<00:03:38.790> motion<00:03:38.940> sensor<00:03:39.569> reason<00:03:40.290> for<00:03:40.410> this<00:03:40.500> if

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
got the motion sensor reason for this if

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.729 
got the motion sensor reason for this if
you<00:03:41.280> pick<00:03:41.489> up<00:03:41.669> some<00:03:42.440> absolutely<00:03:43.440> terrible

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
you pick up some absolutely terrible

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.449 
you pick up some absolutely terrible
weapon<00:03:44.190> like<00:03:45.180> let's<00:03:45.720> say<00:03:45.870> Draganov<00:03:46.410> you<00:03:47.280> might

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
weapon like let's say Draganov you might

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.250 
weapon like let's say Draganov you might
want<00:03:47.609> to<00:03:47.699> wear<00:03:48.090> a<00:03:48.329> quick<00:03:48.510> motion<00:03:48.750> sensor<00:03:49.230> so

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
want to wear a quick motion sensor so

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.830 
want to wear a quick motion sensor so
you<00:03:49.560> can<00:03:49.739> kind<00:03:50.040> of<00:03:50.099> camp<00:03:50.370> for<00:03:50.639> a<00:03:51.000> couple<00:03:51.780> of

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
you can kind of camp for a couple of

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.240 
you can kind of camp for a couple of
minutes<00:03:52.109> to<00:03:52.199> drop<00:03:52.319> down<00:03:52.500> the<00:03:52.560> motion<00:03:52.739> sensor

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
minutes to drop down the motion sensor

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.400 
minutes to drop down the motion sensor
whips<00:03:53.519> have<00:03:53.639> someone<00:03:54.030> to<00:03:54.540> come<00:03:54.989> by<00:03:55.139> and<00:03:55.199> then

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
whips have someone to come by and then

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.400 
whips have someone to come by and then
take<00:03:55.620> them<00:03:55.739> by<00:03:55.889> surprise<00:03:55.919> you<00:03:56.519> jump<00:03:56.760> out<00:03:56.940> and

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
take them by surprise you jump out and

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.330 
take them by surprise you jump out and
shoot<00:03:58.410> them<00:03:58.560> in<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.739> head<00:03:58.829> with<00:03:59.160> which

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
shoot them in the head with which

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.069 
shoot them in the head with which
whatever<00:03:59.730> weapon<00:04:00.060> it<00:04:00.150> is<00:04:00.239> so<00:04:00.599> the<00:04:00.930> motion

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
whatever weapon it is so the motion

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.199 
whatever weapon it is so the motion
sensor<00:04:01.620> just<00:04:02.459> still<00:04:02.579> quit<00:04:02.819> but<00:04:02.940> just<00:04:03.090> in<00:04:03.180> case

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
sensor just still quit but just in case

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.869 
sensor just still quit but just in case
you<00:04:03.510> need<00:04:03.660> to<00:04:03.780> be<00:04:03.900> a<00:04:03.930> pesky<00:04:04.319> camper<00:04:04.709> so<00:04:04.949> let's

you need to be a pesky camper so let's

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.009 
you need to be a pesky camper so let's
take<00:04:06.030> a<00:04:06.060> look<00:04:06.209> at<00:04:06.299> killstreaks<00:04:06.720> for<00:04:06.900> this

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
take a look at killstreaks for this

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.750 
take a look at killstreaks for this
let's<00:04:07.290> do<00:04:07.379> book<00:04:07.500> class<00:04:07.769> now<00:04:08.099> so<00:04:08.340> you<00:04:08.400> want<00:04:08.579> to

let's do book class now so you want to

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.309 
let's do book class now so you want to
select<00:04:09.209> kill<00:04:09.510> streaks<00:04:09.810> that<00:04:09.930> are<00:04:10.019> gonna<00:04:10.139> help

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
select kill streaks that are gonna help

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.210 
select kill streaks that are gonna help
us<00:04:10.760> achieve<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:12.239> achieve<00:04:12.930> the<00:04:13.139> aims<00:04:13.889> of<00:04:14.160> the

game and help us stay alive between

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.920 
game and help us stay alive between
those<00:04:17.130> kind<00:04:17.489> of<00:04:17.549> levels<00:04:17.910> picking<00:04:18.299> up<00:04:18.419> weapons

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
those kind of levels picking up weapons

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.990 
those kind of levels picking up weapons
so<00:04:19.440> first<00:04:19.979> up<00:04:20.130> we've<00:04:20.250> got<00:04:20.280> lightweight<00:04:20.549> now

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
so first up we've got lightweight now

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.719 
so first up we've got lightweight now
the<00:04:21.060> main<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:22.079> main<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:22.740> main<00:04:22.770> risky<00:04:23.550> part

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
the main the main the main risky part

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.190 
the main the main the main risky part
we've<00:04:23.940> got<00:04:24.150> is<00:04:24.330> is<00:04:24.570> obviously<00:04:24.870> one<00:04:25.050> we've

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
we've got is is obviously one we've

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.660 
we've got is is obviously one we've
killed<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:25.590> person<00:04:25.770> we

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
killed the person we

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.120 
killed the person we
need<00:04:26.940> to<00:04:27.120> travel<00:04:27.630> across<00:04:27.870> and<00:04:28.260> depakote<00:04:28.950> their

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
need to travel across and depakote their

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.430 
need to travel across and depakote their
weapon<00:04:29.460> and<00:04:29.640> because<00:04:30.240> we've<00:04:30.900> opened<00:04:31.230> fire

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
weapon and because we've opened fire

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.800 
weapon and because we've opened fire
will<00:04:31.800> appear<00:04:32.100> on<00:04:32.130> it<00:04:32.340> on<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:32.760> radar<00:04:33.120> as<00:04:33.750> a

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
will appear on it on the radar as a

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.390 
will appear on it on the radar as a
little<00:04:34.050> red<00:04:34.170> dot<00:04:34.380> for<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.590> players<00:04:34.950> so<00:04:35.280> we're

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
little red dot for the players so we're

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.480 
little red dot for the players so we're
gonna<00:04:35.490> be<00:04:35.670> hunted<00:04:35.970> out<00:04:36.120> and<00:04:36.360> and<00:04:37.350> we're<00:04:37.620> kind

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
gonna be hunted out and and we're kind

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.890 
gonna be hunted out and and we're kind
of<00:04:38.580> only<00:04:38.730> focusing<00:04:39.330> on<00:04:39.390> picking<00:04:39.720> up<00:04:39.810> that

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
of only focusing on picking up that

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.170 
of only focusing on picking up that
weapon<00:04:40.080> not<00:04:40.470> kind<00:04:40.920> of<00:04:41.010> defending<00:04:41.430> itself<00:04:41.760> so

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
weapon not kind of defending itself so

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.630 
weapon not kind of defending itself so
the<00:04:42.840> lightweight<00:04:43.140> Pirkle<00:04:43.590> just<00:04:43.770> to<00:04:44.010> cut<00:04:44.550> down

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
the lightweight Pirkle just to cut down

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.950 
the lightweight Pirkle just to cut down
the<00:04:44.820> time<00:04:44.970> it<00:04:45.150> takes<00:04:45.330> for<00:04:45.450> you<00:04:45.540> to<00:04:45.570> travel

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
the time it takes for you to travel

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.410 
the time it takes for you to travel
across<00:04:46.170> and<00:04:46.530> pick<00:04:46.920> up<00:04:47.010> the<00:04:47.130> weapon<00:04:47.430> second<00:04:48.300> up

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
across and pick up the weapon second up

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.910 
across and pick up the weapon second up
now<00:04:48.600> we<00:04:48.660> don't<00:04:48.810> really<00:04:49.080> want<00:04:49.260> something<00:04:49.710> like

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:49.920 
now we don't really want something like

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.060 
now we don't really want something like
sleight<00:04:50.610> of<00:04:50.640> hand<00:04:50.970> because<00:04:51.770> we're<00:04:52.770> not<00:04:52.830> really

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
sleight of hand because we're not really

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.440 
sleight of hand because we're not really
going<00:04:53.160> to<00:04:53.220> be<00:04:53.280> reloading<00:04:53.820> once<00:04:54.000> who<00:04:54.090> once

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
going to be reloading once who once

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.090 
going to be reloading once who once
we've<00:04:54.630> exhausted<00:04:54.930> the<00:04:55.110> magazine<00:04:55.590> and<00:04:55.800> killed

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
we've exhausted the magazine and killed

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.140 
we've exhausted the magazine and killed
someone<00:04:56.400> because<00:04:56.610> then<00:04:56.730> we're<00:04:56.850> going<00:04:56.970> to<00:04:57.030> pick

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150
