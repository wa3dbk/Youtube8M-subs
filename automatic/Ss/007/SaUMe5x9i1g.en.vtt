00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
I don't really need that time stretch

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.020 
either so I'm gonna hold off on this

generator<00:00:38.330> servant<00:00:39.430> it's<00:00:40.430> not<00:00:40.550> going<00:00:40.670> to<00:00:40.760> be

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
generator servant it's not going to be

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.060 
generator servant it's not going to be
useful<00:00:40.940> for<00:00:41.120> two<00:00:41.480> more<00:00:41.690> turns<00:00:41.900> and<00:00:42.320> if<00:00:42.920> this

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
useful for two more turns and if this

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.740 
useful for two more turns and if this
was<00:00:43.280> like<00:00:43.430> a<00:00:43.460> real<00:00:43.670> game<00:00:43.940> I<00:00:43.970> play<00:00:44.330> it<00:00:44.450> on<00:00:44.540> turn

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
was like a real game I play it on turn

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.010 
was like a real game I play it on turn
three<00:00:45.520> so<00:00:46.520> that<00:00:46.670> I<00:00:46.700> could<00:00:46.790> have<00:00:47.120> it<00:00:47.270> act<00:00:47.570> it<00:00:47.750> so

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
three so that I could have it act it so

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.510 
three so that I could have it act it so
that<00:00:48.200> just<00:00:48.530> to<00:00:48.590> minimize<00:00:48.950> the<00:00:49.220> amount<00:00:49.400> of

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
that just to minimize the amount of

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.829 
that just to minimize the amount of
turns<00:00:49.730> where<00:00:49.940> it's<00:00:50.059> vulnerable<00:00:50.210> to<00:00:50.629> spot

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:50.839 
turns where it's vulnerable to spot

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:53.619 
turns where it's vulnerable to spot
removal<00:00:51.199> but<00:00:52.100> this<00:00:52.430> is<00:00:52.550> a<00:00:52.580> cold<00:00:53.180> fish<00:00:53.330> doesn't

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
removal but this is a cold fish doesn't

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.299 
removal but this is a cold fish doesn't
matter<00:00:55.120> okay<00:00:56.120> that's<00:00:56.750> like<00:00:57.050> stealing<00:00:57.800> song<00:00:58.129> is

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
matter okay that's like stealing song is

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.479 
matter okay that's like stealing song is
fine<00:00:58.580> but<00:00:58.879> I<00:00:58.909> really<00:00:58.970> need<00:00:59.210> to<00:00:59.480> hit<00:00:59.629> white<00:00:59.930> mana

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
fine but I really need to hit white mana

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.990 
fine but I really need to hit white mana
so<00:01:01.489> let's<00:01:02.360> see<00:01:02.629> if<00:01:02.720> I<00:01:02.809> get<00:01:02.989> lucky

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
so let's see if I get lucky

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.500 
so let's see if I get lucky
let's<00:01:05.630> turn

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
let's turn

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.380 
let's turn
I<00:01:07.600> doesn't<00:01:08.260> know<00:01:08.350> all<00:01:08.590> right

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
I doesn't know all right

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.649 
I doesn't know all right
probably<00:01:11.140> okay<00:01:11.350> this<00:01:11.620> is<00:01:11.800> not<00:01:11.950> a<00:01:12.310> great<00:01:12.659> super

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
probably okay this is not a great super

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.760 
probably okay this is not a great super
representative<00:01:14.500> game<00:01:14.710> because<00:01:15.430> I<00:01:16.770> just

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
representative game because I just

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.080 
representative game because I just
bricked<00:01:18.220> on<00:01:18.370> lands<00:01:18.820> but

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
bricked on lands but

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.349 
bricked on lands but
we'll<00:01:21.659> see<00:01:21.810> what<00:01:21.929> happens<00:01:22.850> ok<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.030> can<00:01:24.270> do

infinite and and then like if you saw

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.320 
infinite and and then like if you saw
the<00:05:17.190> last<00:05:17.310> video<00:05:17.640> it's<00:05:17.910> just<00:05:18.120> going<00:05:18.240> to<00:05:18.270> be

makes it so that every time I connect

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.230 
makes it so that every time I connect
with<00:06:00.300> a<00:06:00.420> creature

can deal with them damage and then

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.610 
can deal with them damage and then
you're<00:06:17.419> probably<00:06:17.509> asking<00:06:17.810> like<00:06:18.169> where<00:06:18.470> do<00:06:18.560> I

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:18.620 
you're probably asking like where do I

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.650 
you're probably asking like where do I
get<00:06:18.680> the<00:06:18.860> mana<00:06:19.039> to<00:06:19.190> cast<00:06:19.220> these<00:06:19.610> things<00:06:19.910> well

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:20.660 
get the mana to cast these things well

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.839 
get the mana to cast these things well
once<00:06:20.960> I<00:06:21.020> get<00:06:21.169> any<00:06:21.289> infinite<00:06:21.650> my<00:06:22.099> library<00:06:22.610> is

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:22.849 
once I get any infinite my library is

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:24.999 
once I get any infinite my library is
just<00:06:23.120> full<00:06:23.419> to<00:06:23.720> the<00:06:23.750> brim<00:06:23.870> with<00:06:24.110> things<00:06:24.860> like

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:25.009 
just full to the brim with things like

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:28.860 
just full to the brim with things like
seating<00:06:25.460> song<00:06:25.819> or<00:06:26.090> simian<00:06:26.449> spirit<00:06:26.810> guide<00:06:26.990> or

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
seating song or simian spirit guide or

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:34.540 
seating song or simian spirit guide or
FLOTUS<00:06:29.870> pedal<00:06:30.289> manorville<00:06:31.280> and<00:06:33.220> I'm<00:06:34.220> going<00:06:34.490> to

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.550 
FLOTUS pedal manorville and I'm going to

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:40.080 
FLOTUS pedal manorville and I'm going to
eventually<00:06:34.819> cast<00:06:36.490> cognitions

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.090 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.300 

uh<00:06:40.150> well<00:06:41.110> this<00:06:41.410> is<00:06:41.500> after<00:06:41.590> I've<00:06:41.830> drawn<00:06:42.010> my<00:06:42.040> deck

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:42.310 
uh well this is after I've drawn my deck

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.920 
uh well this is after I've drawn my deck
with<00:06:42.520> Emma<00:06:42.910> the<00:06:43.000> infinite<00:06:43.300> I'll<00:06:43.600> cast

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:43.930 
with Emma the infinite I'll cast

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.420 
with Emma the infinite I'll cast
omniscience<00:06:44.410> and<00:06:44.620> then<00:06:44.830> I'll<00:06:44.919> can<00:06:45.340> do

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.430 
omniscience and then I'll can do

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.810 
omniscience and then I'll can do
whatever<00:06:45.669> I<00:06:45.730> want<00:06:45.900> so<00:06:46.900> that<00:06:47.199> is<00:06:47.380> a<00:06:47.560> I<00:06:48.100> know<00:06:48.610> it

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:48.820 
whatever I want so that is a I know it

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.610 
whatever I want so that is a I know it
says<00:06:49.060> turn<00:06:49.330> seven<00:06:49.720> but<00:06:49.900> this<00:06:50.020> is<00:06:50.110> after<00:06:50.320> we

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:50.620 
says turn seven but this is after we

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.760 
says turn seven but this is after we
took<00:06:50.830> several<00:06:51.610> turns<00:06:51.970> in<00:06:52.180> a<00:06:52.240> row<00:06:52.440> so<00:06:53.440> this<00:06:53.590> was

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:53.770 
took several turns in a row so this was

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.210 
took several turns in a row so this was
I<00:06:53.800> think<00:06:53.949> eight<00:06:54.430> earned<00:06:54.760> five<00:06:55.180> win<00:06:56.220> without

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:57.220 
I think eight earned five win without

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.570 
I think eight earned five win without
any<00:06:57.639> like<00:06:57.910> special<00:06:58.479> draws<00:06:59.250> like<00:07:00.250> my<00:07:00.400> hand

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:00.580 
any like special draws like my hand

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.040 
any like special draws like my hand
wasn't<00:07:00.820> that<00:07:01.150> insane<00:07:01.630> I<00:07:02.020> just<00:07:03.010> like<00:07:03.220> had<00:07:04.050> lands

wasn't that insane I just like had lands
oh<00:07:05.229> this<00:07:05.500> is<00:07:05.560> after<00:07:05.710> bricking<00:07:06.250> yeah<00:07:06.880> this<00:07:07.150> is
