couple of reference shots 2.8 and 2.9

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.190 
couple of reference shots 2.8 and 2.9
now<00:01:21.509> for<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.470> power<00:01:22.830> mantle<00:01:23.840> will<00:01:24.840> add<00:01:25.020> the

now for the power mantle will add the

now for the power mantle will add the

because<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.909> his<00:01:54.390> power<00:01:54.600> block<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.350> one<00:01:55.439> he

because of it his power block the one he

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.789 
because of it his power block the one he
comes<00:01:55.920> with<00:01:56.219> has<00:01:56.969> thick<00:01:57.840> parts<00:01:58.259> on<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.649> inside

comes with has thick parts on the inside

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.880 
comes with has thick parts on the inside
thicker<00:01:59.460> than<00:01:59.729> usual<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.710> obviously<00:02:01.710> these

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
thicker than usual so obviously these

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.920 
thicker than usual so obviously these
ones<00:02:02.219> are<00:02:02.520> just<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.969> bit<00:02:03.119> thicker<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.719> that's

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
ones are just a bit thicker and that's

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.210 
ones are just a bit thicker and that's
pretty<00:02:04.170> cool<00:02:04.850> next<00:02:05.850> we'll<00:02:06.149> attach<00:02:07.220> the

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
pretty cool next we'll attach the

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:20.050 
pretty cool next we'll attach the
trigger<00:02:08.520> pad

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:28.970 

two<00:02:21.060> point<00:02:21.480> seven<00:02:22.260> seven<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:27.200> two<00:02:28.200> point<00:02:28.620> nine

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
two point seven seven and two point nine

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.780 
two point seven seven and two point nine
five<00:02:31.819> this<00:02:32.840> doesn't<00:02:33.840> do<00:02:34.170> much<00:02:34.620> of<00:02:34.980> anything<00:02:35.310> in

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
five this doesn't do much of anything in

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.619 
five this doesn't do much of anything in
fact<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:37.109> does<00:02:37.409> exactly<00:02:37.889> opposite<00:02:38.730> of<00:02:38.879> what<00:02:38.970> I

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
fact it does exactly opposite of what I

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.330 
fact it does exactly opposite of what I
expected<00:02:40.349> it<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:41.430> actually<00:02:41.609> takes<00:02:42.540> away

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
expected it to it actually takes away

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.690 
expected it to it actually takes away
power<00:02:44.340> from<00:02:44.609> the<00:02:45.209> betta<00:02:45.420> mod<00:02:45.629> which<00:02:46.379> is<00:02:46.739> very

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
power from the betta mod which is very

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.559 
power from the betta mod which is very
counter<00:02:48.420> intuitive<00:02:49.489> it's<00:02:50.489> because<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.329> sort

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
counter intuitive it's because it sort

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.259 
counter intuitive it's because it sort
of<00:02:51.659> distributes<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.919> force<00:02:53.280> you<00:02:53.639> applied<00:02:54.000> to

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
of distributes the force you applied to

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.740 
of distributes the force you applied to
the<00:02:54.389> trigger<00:02:54.659> over<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.500> wider<00:02:56.069> space<00:02:56.609> so<00:02:57.090> most

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
the trigger over a wider space so most

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.819 
the trigger over a wider space so most
of<00:02:57.930> your<00:02:58.079> effort<00:02:58.500> goes<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.879> waste

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
of your effort goes to waste

if<00:03:01.829> I<00:03:02.280> were<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:02.609> I<00:03:02.639> just<00:03:03.239> wouldn't<00:03:03.689> use<00:03:03.810> this

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
if I were you I just wouldn't use this

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.809 
if I were you I just wouldn't use this
at<00:03:04.560> all<00:03:06.769> next<00:03:07.769> we're<00:03:07.919> going<00:03:08.040> to<00:03:08.159> attach<00:03:08.370> it<00:03:08.790> to

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
at all next we're going to attach it to

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.449 
at all next we're going to attach it to
metal<00:03:09.419> force<00:03:09.780> dragwon<00:03:10.560> so<00:03:10.950> I'm<00:03:11.310> actually

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
metal force dragwon so I'm actually

metal force dragwon so I'm actually
going<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.909> pull<00:03:12.239> off<00:03:12.389> his<00:03:12.599> horn<00:03:12.959> because

going to pull off his horn because

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.559 
going to pull off his horn because
otherwise<00:03:13.590> he<00:03:13.950> won't<00:03:14.069> be<00:03:14.250> close<00:03:14.519> enough<00:03:14.730> to

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
otherwise he won't be close enough to

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:26.710 
otherwise he won't be close enough to
the<00:03:16.190> tester<00:03:17.190> here<00:03:19.220> three<00:03:20.220> point<00:03:20.579> one<00:03:20.849> six<00:03:21.299> and

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.099 

two<00:03:27.720> point<00:03:28.169> seven<00:03:28.769> six

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
two point seven six

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.170 
two point seven six
pull<00:03:31.109> this<00:03:31.290> off<00:03:31.560> and<00:03:31.949> attach<00:03:32.609> the<00:03:32.909> power

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
pull this off and attach the power

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:44.210 
pull this off and attach the power
mantle<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:34.639> we<00:03:35.639> get<00:03:38.090> three<00:03:39.090> point<00:03:39.419> six<00:03:43.220> and

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
mantle and we get three point six and

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.170 
mantle and we get three point six and
three<00:03:45.060> point<00:03:45.359> three<00:03:45.510> eight<00:03:46.310> this<00:03:47.310> was<00:03:47.849> a

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
three point three eight this was a

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.099 
three point three eight this was a
combination<00:03:48.709> used<00:03:49.709> at<00:03:50.099> the<00:03:50.340> Asia

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
combination used at the Asia

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:54.020 
combination used at the Asia
Championships<00:03:52.109> a<00:03:52.409> little<00:03:52.650> while<00:03:52.859> ago<00:03:53.099> the

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
Championships a little while ago the

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.869 
Championships a little while ago the
metal<00:03:54.479> force<00:03:54.840> core<00:03:55.229> and<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:56.099> power<00:03:56.370> mantle

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
metal force core and the power mantle

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.479 
metal force core and the power mantle
and<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.239> can<00:03:57.419> see<00:03:57.750> why<00:03:57.989> it's<00:03:58.349> a<00:03:58.530> very<00:03:58.829> solid

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
and I can see why it's a very solid

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.729 
and I can see why it's a very solid
combo<00:03:59.970> really<00:04:00.389> accurate<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:01.049> has<00:04:01.379> a<00:04:01.409> lot<00:04:01.709> of

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
combo really accurate and has a lot of

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:06.259 
combo really accurate and has a lot of
power<00:04:02.010> behind<00:04:02.250> it<00:04:04.549> finally<00:04:05.549> we'll<00:04:05.729> test<00:04:06.060> it

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
power behind it finally we'll test it

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:14.330 
power behind it finally we'll test it
with<00:04:06.479> bursts<00:04:06.840> bison<00:04:09.829> so<00:04:10.829> for<00:04:11.280> reference<00:04:13.340> three

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
with bursts bison so for reference three

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:21.930 
with bursts bison so for reference three
point<00:04:14.639> oh<00:04:14.790> one<00:04:18.139> and<00:04:19.139> two<00:04:19.950> point<00:04:20.219> eight<00:04:20.459> six

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
point oh one and two point eight six

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:45.230 
point oh one and two point eight six
now<00:04:22.630> for<00:04:23.170> the<00:04:23.410> power<00:04:23.740> mantle<00:04:33.900> 3.34<00:04:40.080> and<00:04:42.510> 3.26

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
now for the power mantle 3.34 and 3.26

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:52.740 
now for the power mantle 3.34 and 3.26
now<00:04:46.240> for<00:04:46.780> a<00:04:47.050> little<00:04:47.950> bit<00:04:48.130> more<00:04:48.400> force<00:04:51.750> three

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
now for a little bit more force three

00:04:52.750 --> 00:05:01.740 
now for a little bit more force three
point<00:04:53.050> three<00:04:53.140> eight<00:04:59.130> and<00:05:00.130> three<00:05:01.030> point<00:05:01.330> four

point three eight and three point four

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.660 
point three eight and three point four
three<00:05:02.110> so<00:05:03.100> a<00:05:03.490> little<00:05:04.330> bit<00:05:04.630> better<00:05:04.900> but<00:05:05.530> I<00:05:05.830> still

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.670 
three so a little bit better but I still

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.840 
three so a little bit better but I still
can't<00:05:07.420> seem<00:05:07.840> to<00:05:07.870> hit<00:05:08.530> those<00:05:08.800> numbers<00:05:09.070> that<00:05:09.640> all

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
can't seem to hit those numbers that all

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.140 
can't seem to hit those numbers that all
of<00:05:10.120> you<00:05:10.330> guys<00:05:10.630> say<00:05:11.560> that<00:05:12.130> this<00:05:12.370> guy<00:05:12.640> can<00:05:12.700> get

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
of you guys say that this guy can get

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.340 
of you guys say that this guy can get
and<00:05:14.250> yes<00:05:15.250> it<00:05:15.610> also<00:05:15.850> doubles<00:05:16.480> as<00:05:16.660> a<00:05:16.750> fairly

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
and yes it also doubles as a fairly

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:28.860 
and yes it also doubles as a fairly
decent<00:05:17.830> stabilizer<00:05:27.450> there<00:05:28.450> you<00:05:28.510> go

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
decent stabilizer there you go

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.850 
decent stabilizer there you go
not<00:05:29.260> bad<00:05:29.580> and<00:05:30.690> that's<00:05:31.690> it<00:05:32.050> there's<00:05:32.590> not<00:05:32.800> a

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
not bad and that's it there's not a

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.590 
not bad and that's it there's not a
whole<00:05:33.070> lot<00:05:33.250> of<00:05:33.280> surprises<00:05:33.940> here<00:05:34.210> it<00:05:34.360> does

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
whole lot of surprises here it does

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.100 
whole lot of surprises here it does
exactly<00:05:35.230> what<00:05:35.800> you'd<00:05:36.010> expect<00:05:36.130> it<00:05:36.610> to<00:05:37.110> outside

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
exactly what you'd expect it to outside

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.380 
exactly what you'd expect it to outside
of<00:05:38.140> the<00:05:38.620> piece<00:05:38.830> that<00:05:39.160> does<00:05:39.430> exactly<00:05:39.910> the

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
of the piece that does exactly the

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.770 
of the piece that does exactly the
opposite<00:05:40.930> of<00:05:41.200> what<00:05:41.770> you'd<00:05:41.980> expect<00:05:42.100> it<00:05:42.520> to<00:05:42.780> but

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
opposite of what you'd expect it to but

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.870 
opposite of what you'd expect it to but
the<00:05:43.930> power<00:05:44.169> mantle<00:05:44.620> itself<00:05:44.800> is<00:05:45.370> a<00:05:45.400> pretty

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
the power mantle itself is a pretty

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.750 
the power mantle itself is a pretty
decent<00:05:46.270> tune<00:05:46.810> up<00:05:46.960> here<00:05:47.230> if<00:05:47.440> not<00:05:47.650> very<00:05:48.130> simple

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
decent tune up here if not very simple

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.350 
decent tune up here if not very simple
do<00:05:49.390> note<00:05:49.600> however<00:05:49.870> it<00:05:50.410> does<00:05:50.800> not<00:05:51.190> work<00:05:51.820> with

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
which might make it a little less worth

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.380 
which might make it a little less worth
it<00:06:02.169> seeing<00:06:02.890> as<00:06:03.100> there's<00:06:03.520> such<00:06:03.790> powerful

charge<00:06:07.950> but<00:06:08.950> that's<00:06:09.430> beside<00:06:10.000> the<00:06:10.030> point<00:06:10.270> if

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
charge but that's beside the point if

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.350 
charge but that's beside the point if
you<00:06:10.960> have<00:06:11.140> a<00:06:11.169> combo<00:06:11.680> in<00:06:11.950> mind<00:06:12.370> that'll<00:06:12.850> use

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
you have a combo in mind that'll use

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.960 
you have a combo in mind that'll use
this<00:06:13.660> it's<00:06:14.110> definitely<00:06:14.650> worth<00:06:15.250> getting<00:06:15.520> and

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:15.970 
this it's definitely worth getting and

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.409 
this it's definitely worth getting and
does<00:06:16.570> a<00:06:16.600> lot<00:06:17.140> more<00:06:17.500> than<00:06:17.740> I<00:06:17.860> expected<00:06:18.010> it<00:06:18.580> to<00:06:18.610> so

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:19.419 
does a lot more than I expected it to so

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:21.900 
does a lot more than I expected it to so
