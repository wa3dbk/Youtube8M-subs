 this result but if you want to know the 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.739
 explanation or the reasons for this delay 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.590
 you can see my fight number 44 video 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:40.140
 tv there I do a full explanation 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.980
 on this occasion or for this contest 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.100
 April, 17 people participated but 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.410
 finally there were 15 pictures I had 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.930
 to eliminate 21 because it was totally 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.970
 off topic and the other because never 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.190
 arrived the picture arrived the email with 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.580
 all the data of the photo but there was no 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.710
 photos unfortunately that was lost 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:04.739
 so good were 15 photographs and 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.340
 here they have the winning photograph that 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.110
 belongs to ricardo vázquez ruiz 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.940
 happiness of Ricardo precious you 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.920
 you control trias 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.410
 talking about the technical details of 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.870
 this photograph of ricardo commented 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.310
 that the place is a city of arts and 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.270
 the sciences in valencia spain the 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.530
 photography was taken with a camera 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:33.240
 canon eos 1000d that here in america is 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.550
 the rebel xs as a goal I use a tan 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.870
 rum 1750 millimeters 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:42.450
 does not specify the focal length but 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:45.480
 by the perspective I assume and the most logical 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.630
 it would be that it is made in the position of 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.960
 17 millimeters use or work with a 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.500
 diaphragm 5.6 one eighth of a second of 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.450
 speed and did feels not to use flash and 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.630
 use tripod 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.969
 then congratulations ricardo has been the 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.679
 April winner of the April contest 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:09.810
 of 2013 you call as a prize a session 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:12.209
 guided from the two that I have so far 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.360
 I have to update it and do more but 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.600
 well I hope you like them 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:22.300
 there are other good pictures worth 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.300
 mention here I show you to see 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.260
 This first photograph of Roberto 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.020
 Sanchez I really love 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.890
 even consider it as also for 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:38.310
 make winning photo but despite 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:41.990
 be beautiful is not as novel as 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:45.470
 this other picture of Ricardo that 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:48.240
 has the reflection of this is great 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.980
 building in a water that does not have 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.540
 waves that is lawful then in 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.490
 reality does not seem a reflection but 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.970
 it seems the bottom part of a large 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.280
 structure looks like a spaceship 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.730
 floating in the air is really a 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.710
 unusual and so spectacular photo 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.380
 I gave him the first prize but very very 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.060
 nearby was this other photograph of 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.990
 roberto sanchez who is really 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.450
 precious other pictures that is worth the 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:19.319
 worth mentioning are 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:22.260
 from juniors jr he did not send me his last name 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:26.160
 he only wrote juniors jr and good 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:29.519
 It is beautiful but it is also good 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:33.750
 exposed but I would have liked to see 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:36.300
 this part of the darkest walls 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.550
 because although it is technically 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.959
 well exposed visually the 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:46.110
 walls are overexposed ok 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:49.170
 then that is a constructive criticism 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:52.410
 that's why I liked it, that's why it's 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.459
 here but it can really be improved if 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.140
 that part of the walls darkens 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:03.000
 this is another picture that I loved 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:07.470
 by alejandro antonio cortez farías and the 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.200
 last picture that is worth it 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:14.820
 and a mention is this of hugo pedro 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:17.970
 meneses velázquez of a man sentadito 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:19.350
 leaning on a post with a reflection 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.600
 in a puddle on the street 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.840
 really very nice all the 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:28.260
 photographs but this one is definitely 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.930
 the best if you want to see all the 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:34.500

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.000
