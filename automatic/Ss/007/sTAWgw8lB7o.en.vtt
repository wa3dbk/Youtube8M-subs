we have all the routes that we have
boarded<00:01:07.210> by<00:01:07.479> kind<00:01:08.140> of<00:01:08.259> switching<00:01:09.039> in<00:01:09.340> and<00:01:09.670> out

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:09.789 
boarded by kind of switching in and out

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:11.700

be able to memorize that this particular
live<00:01:14.859> route<00:01:15.130> because<00:01:15.640> they're<00:01:15.850> different

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
live route because they're different

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:18.120 
live route because they're different
secretive<00:01:16.539> corners<00:01:16.960> might<00:01:17.439> well<00:01:17.619> come<00:01:17.859> around

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
secretive corners might well come around

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.270

every time you approach it it kind of

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.620 
every time you approach it it kind of

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
come over the crest of a bridge you're

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.489 
come over the crest of a bridge you're
never<00:01:34.389> quite<00:01:34.569> sure<00:01:34.659> whether<00:01:35.049> it's<00:01:35.229> gonna<00:01:35.319> be<00:01:35.439> a

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:35.499 
never quite sure whether it's gonna be a

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:37.410 
never quite sure whether it's gonna be a
left<00:01:35.709> or<00:01:35.859> right<00:01:36.100> turn<00:01:36.429> at<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:36.789> at<00:01:37.119> the<00:01:37.149> bottom

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
left or right turn at the at the bottom

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:51.880 
left or right turn at the at the bottom
of<00:01:37.539> the<00:01:37.630> hill

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.670 

and<00:01:52.550> so<00:01:52.940> you<00:01:53.030> see<00:01:53.090> a<00:01:53.210> lot<00:01:53.390> of<00:01:53.420> people<00:01:53.840> switching

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
and so you see a lot of people switching

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.130 
and so you see a lot of people switching
their<00:01:55.400> line<00:01:55.640> on<00:01:55.909> the<00:01:56.000> track<00:01:56.240> in<00:01:56.450> preparation

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
their line on the track in preparation

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.140 
their line on the track in preparation
for<00:01:57.380> that<00:01:57.409> and<00:01:57.890> there's<00:01:58.610> a<00:01:58.670> few<00:01:58.880> sections

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
for that and there's a few sections

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.090 
for that and there's a few sections
where<00:01:59.450> you<00:01:59.540> might<00:01:59.690> expect<00:01:59.990> a<00:02:00.170> sweeping<00:02:00.830> bend

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
where you might expect a sweeping bend

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.830 
where you might expect a sweeping bend
but<00:02:01.580> all<00:02:01.940> of<00:02:02.030> a<00:02:02.090> sudden<00:02:02.300> you've<00:02:02.390> got<00:02:02.420> to<00:02:02.630> deal

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
but all of a sudden you've got to deal

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.020 
but all of a sudden you've got to deal
with<00:02:02.869> a<00:02:03.110> hairpin<00:02:03.560> and<00:02:03.800> it's<00:02:04.130> it's<00:02:04.640> picking

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
with a hairpin and it's it's picking

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.850 
with a hairpin and it's it's picking
your<00:02:05.119> line<00:02:05.390> as<00:02:05.720> it<00:02:05.780> occurs<00:02:06.260> to<00:02:06.409> you<00:02:06.590> that's

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
your line as it occurs to you that's

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.380 
your line as it occurs to you that's
really<00:02:07.250> the<00:02:07.460> key<00:02:07.610> to<00:02:07.790> winning<00:02:07.940> live<00:02:08.149> root

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
really the key to winning live root

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.830 
really the key to winning live root
races
