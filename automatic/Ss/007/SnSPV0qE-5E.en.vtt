00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
hey this is Paula center news reports

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.769 
hey this is Paula center news reports
near<00:00:02.429> Morro<00:00:02.730> Bay<00:00:02.790> California<00:00:03.170> this<00:00:04.170> is<00:00:04.380> a<00:00:04.410> 6-1

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:05.779 
near Morro Bay California this is a 6-1

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.370 
near Morro Bay California this is a 6-1
asymmetric<00:00:06.779> that<00:00:07.230> I<00:00:07.740> just<00:00:08.220> did<00:00:08.400> recently

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:09.380 
asymmetric that I just did recently

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.830 
asymmetric that I just did recently
basically<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.679> idea<00:00:11.040> behind<00:00:11.300> this<00:00:12.300> this

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
basically the idea behind this this

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.980 
basically the idea behind this this
board<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:13.469> this<00:00:13.559> design<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.610> bring<00:00:15.299> the

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
board and this design is to bring the

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.710 
board and this design is to bring the
rail<00:00:16.230> line<00:00:16.470> out<00:00:16.800> on<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.369> toe<00:00:17.609> side<00:00:17.660> I'm<00:00:18.660> a

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
rail line out on the toe side I'm a

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.410 
rail line out on the toe side I'm a
goofy<00:00:19.109> foot<00:00:19.289> surfer<00:00:19.710> so<00:00:19.980> this<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:20.789> my<00:00:20.910> toe<00:00:21.119> side

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
goofy foot surfer so this is my toe side

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.390 
goofy foot surfer so this is my toe side
I<00:00:21.720> want<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.199> bring<00:00:22.350> this<00:00:22.529> out<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:22.920> make<00:00:23.220> it

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
I want to bring this out and make it

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.560 
I want to bring this out and make it
really<00:00:23.640> straight<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.330> hip<00:00:25.230> this<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.800> so

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
really straight and hip this in so

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.929 
really straight and hip this in so
basically<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.779> wide<00:00:27.960> point<00:00:28.380> on<00:00:28.529> my<00:00:29.369> toe<00:00:29.429> sides

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
basically the wide point on my toe sides

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.459 
basically the wide point on my toe sides
pushed<00:00:30.750> out<00:00:31.460> forward<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.550> Center<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.469> this

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
pushed out forward a Center and this

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.100 
pushed out forward a Center and this
creates<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.010> lot<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.219> Drive<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.000> speed<00:00:36.420> going

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
creates a lot of Drive and speed going

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.200 
creates a lot of Drive and speed going
down<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.440> line<00:00:37.649> with<00:00:37.890> toe<00:00:38.160> side<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:39.030> then

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
down the line with toe side and then

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.979 
down the line with toe side and then
heel<00:00:39.570> side<00:00:40.129> basically<00:00:41.210> taking<00:00:42.210> more<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.899> a

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
heel side basically taking more of a

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.520 
heel side basically taking more of a
short<00:00:43.290> board<00:00:43.559> nose<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:45.350> straightening<00:00:46.350> out

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
short board nose and straightening out

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.770 
short board nose and straightening out
the<00:00:46.680> rail<00:00:46.860> line<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.370> pushing<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.210> wide<00:00:48.390> point

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
the rail line and pushing the wide point

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.279 
the rail line and pushing the wide point
back<00:00:49.020> four<00:00:49.500> inches<00:00:49.950> puts<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:51.149> pivot<00:00:51.750> point<00:00:52.050> in

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
back four inches puts a pivot point in

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.160 
back four inches puts a pivot point in
between<00:00:52.579> where<00:00:53.579> my<00:00:53.760> feet<00:00:54.090> are<00:00:54.270> when<00:00:55.020> I'm

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
between where my feet are when I'm

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.990 
between where my feet are when I'm
standing<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.840> creates<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:58.289> good<00:00:58.739> turning<00:00:59.640> area

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
standing and creates a good turning area

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.509 
standing and creates a good turning area
on<00:01:00.629> my<00:01:01.079> heel<00:01:01.469> side<00:01:01.770> rail<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:03.979> this<00:01:04.979> board<00:01:05.309> is

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
on my heel side rail so this board is

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.090 
on my heel side rail so this board is
set<00:01:05.790> up<00:01:05.939> as<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.270> single<00:01:06.810> pin<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:08.210> basically<00:01:10.100> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
set up as a single pin and basically the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.969 
set up as a single pin and basically the
reason<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.580> did<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.090> because<00:01:13.020> I've<00:01:13.860> been

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
reason I did that is because I've been

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.490 
reason I did that is because I've been
doing<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.310> lot<00:01:14.490> with<00:01:14.729> thrusters<00:01:15.630> and

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
doing a lot with thrusters and

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.640 
doing a lot with thrusters and
twinsies<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.220> twins<00:01:17.580> but<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.600> wanted<00:01:19.590> to

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
twinsies and twins but I wanted to

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.290 
twinsies and twins but I wanted to
create<00:01:20.100> one<00:01:20.400> one<00:01:21.360> pivot<00:01:21.810> point<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:23.240> try<00:01:24.240> to

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
create one one pivot point and try to

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.440 
create one one pivot point and try to
simplify<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.170> back<00:01:25.530> here<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.220> really<00:01:26.640> learn

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
simplify it back here and really learn

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.870 
simplify it back here and really learn
more<00:01:27.870> about<00:01:28.050> the<00:01:28.800> feel<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.490> different

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
more about the feel of the different

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.440 
more about the feel of the different
rail<00:01:30.570> lines<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.410> the<00:01:32.160> bottom<00:01:32.580> contours<00:01:33.060> so

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
rail lines and the bottom contours so

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.680 
rail lines and the bottom contours so
the<00:01:34.260> and<00:01:35.190> the<00:01:35.369> bottom<00:01:35.670> contours<00:01:35.880> basically

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
the and the bottom contours basically

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.359 
the and the bottom contours basically
this<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:38.010> rolled<00:01:39.020> entry<00:01:40.020> here<00:01:40.470> on<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.190> toe

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
this is a rolled entry here on the toe

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.420 
this is a rolled entry here on the toe
side<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.910> a<00:01:41.940> flat<00:01:42.390> entry<00:01:42.930> here<00:01:43.260> and<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:44.250> goes

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
side is a flat entry here and it goes

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.540 
side is a flat entry here and it goes
into<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.760> single<00:01:45.300> the<00:01:45.630> roll<00:01:45.900> is<00:01:46.410> so<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.890> when

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
into a single the roll is so that when

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.260 
into a single the roll is so that when
you're<00:01:47.820> surfing<00:01:48.810> front<00:01:49.290> side<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:50.240> because<00:01:51.240> of

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
you're surfing front side and because of

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.400 
you're surfing front side and because of
the<00:01:51.720> width<00:01:52.350> up<00:01:52.680> here<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.100> nose<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:54.259> kind<00:01:55.259> of

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
the width up here in the nose to kind of

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.219 
the width up here in the nose to kind of
alleviate<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:56.190> lot<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.820> drag<00:01:57.479> going<00:01:58.110> up

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
alleviate a lot of that drag going up

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.380 
alleviate a lot of that drag going up
the<00:01:58.380> face<00:01:58.790> the<00:01:59.790> roll

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
the face the roll

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.600 
the face the roll
really<00:02:00.720> helps<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.320> transition<00:02:01.950> well<00:02:02.220> on<00:02:02.550> a

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
really helps that transition well on a

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.070 
really helps that transition well on a
more<00:02:02.880> vertical<00:02:03.119> wave<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:05.060> and<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.780> flat

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
more vertical wave so and this is flat

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.109 
more vertical wave so and this is flat
because<00:02:07.289> you<00:02:07.470> don't<00:02:07.619> need<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.920> roll<00:02:08.130> on<00:02:08.459> that

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
because you don't need the roll on that

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.710 
because you don't need the roll on that
narrow<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.600> a<00:02:09.660> nose<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:10.520> on<00:02:11.520> this<00:02:11.760> side<00:02:12.060> this

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
narrow of a nose so on this side this

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.680 
narrow of a nose so on this side this
goes<00:02:13.080> into<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:13.709> single<00:02:14.010> concave<00:02:14.390> for<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.480> good

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
goes into a single concave for the good

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.229 
goes into a single concave for the good
planing<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.470> just<00:02:16.910> when<00:02:17.910> you're<00:02:18.060> going

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
planing and just when you're going

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.220 
planing and just when you're going
straight<00:02:18.570> it<00:02:19.350> gives<00:02:19.560> you<00:02:19.739> a<00:02:20.250> nice<00:02:20.840> area<00:02:21.840> that

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
straight it gives you a nice area that

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.479 
straight it gives you a nice area that
you<00:02:22.590> can<00:02:22.769> work<00:02:23.010> off<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.989> then<00:02:25.220> going<00:02:26.220> into

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
you can work off of and then going into

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.780 
you can work off of and then going into
the<00:02:26.610> back<00:02:26.790> third<00:02:27.120> of<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.360> board<00:02:27.600> is<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.489> half<00:02:29.489> of

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
the back third of the board is a half of

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.850 
the back third of the board is a half of
a<00:02:29.970> double<00:02:30.900> concave

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
a double concave

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.340 
a double concave
it's<00:02:32.040> pretty<00:02:32.250> accentuated<00:02:33.210> the<00:02:33.840> rail<00:02:34.050> line

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
it's pretty accentuated the rail line

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.020 
it's pretty accentuated the rail line
and<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.890> string<00:02:35.190> in<00:02:35.340> line<00:02:35.520> are<00:02:36.360> are<00:02:37.110> even<00:02:38.070> then

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
and the string in line are are even then

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.830 
and the string in line are are even then
on<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.780> heelside<00:02:40.490> it<00:02:41.490> goes<00:02:41.760> into<00:02:41.940> kind<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.750> a

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
on the heelside it goes into kind of a

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.760 
on the heelside it goes into kind of a
roll<00:02:43.080> v<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:43.880> it's<00:02:44.880> pretty<00:02:45.180> accentuated<00:02:46.110> to

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
roll v and it's pretty accentuated to

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.580 
roll v and it's pretty accentuated to
pick<00:02:47.400> up<00:02:47.580> a<00:02:47.820> lot<00:02:48.420> of<00:02:48.450> rocker<00:02:49.140> on<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:50.610> heel<00:02:50.970> side

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
pick up a lot of rocker on the heel side

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.460 
pick up a lot of rocker on the heel side
creates<00:02:52.590> good<00:02:52.860> turning<00:02:53.310> but<00:02:54.030> uh<00:02:54.090> with<00:02:55.020> good

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
creates good turning but uh with good

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.610 
creates good turning but uh with good
lift<00:02:55.830> off<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.430> this<00:02:56.610> concave<00:02:57.270> really<00:02:58.170> helps

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
lift off of this concave really helps

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.470 
lift off of this concave really helps

the pivoting the the tail and the actual
end<00:03:03.810> length<00:03:04.080> or<00:03:04.680> are<00:03:05.810> symmetrical<00:03:06.810> so<00:03:07.230> it's

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
end length or are symmetrical so it's

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.460 
end length or are symmetrical so it's
not<00:03:08.220> one<00:03:08.550> size<00:03:08.850> longer<00:03:09.450> or<00:03:09.990> shorter

not one size longer or shorter

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.390 
not one size longer or shorter
it's<00:03:11.450> basically<00:03:12.450> dealing<00:03:13.410> with<00:03:13.740> more

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
it's basically dealing with more

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.220 
it's basically dealing with more

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
abstract rail lines to get that

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.580 
abstract rail lines to get that
asymmetrical<00:03:19.230> feeling<00:03:20.070> that<00:03:20.250> you<00:03:20.370> want<00:03:20.550> plus

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
asymmetrical feeling that you want plus

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.170 
asymmetrical feeling that you want plus
the<00:03:22.590> fact<00:03:22.890> that<00:03:24.020> the<00:03:25.020> more<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.440> more<00:03:25.590> I<00:03:25.620> do<00:03:26.180> the

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
the fact that the more and more I do the

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.560 
the fact that the more and more I do the
more<00:03:27.209> I<00:03:27.680> have<00:03:28.680> found<00:03:28.950> that<00:03:29.220> having<00:03:29.880> a<00:03:30.209> really

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
more I have found that having a really

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
more I have found that having a really
drastic<00:03:32.510> asymmetry<00:03:33.510> back<00:03:33.750> here<00:03:34.140> as<00:03:34.320> far<00:03:34.530> as

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
drastic asymmetry back here as far as

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.229 
drastic asymmetry back here as far as
difference<00:03:35.190> in<00:03:35.370> length<00:03:35.780> creates<00:03:36.780> a<00:03:37.110> lot<00:03:37.410> of

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
difference in length creates a lot of

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.370 
difference in length creates a lot of
unpredictable<00:03:39.239> feelings<00:03:39.810> when<00:03:40.230> you're

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
unpredictable feelings when you're

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.870 
unpredictable feelings when you're
turning<00:03:41.450> off<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.750> top<00:03:42.989> so<00:03:43.440> with<00:03:44.280> having<00:03:44.550> a

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
turning off the top so with having a

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.140 
turning off the top so with having a
symmetrical<00:03:45.540> length<00:03:46.350> back<00:03:46.709> here<00:03:47.100> I<00:03:47.280> think<00:03:48.030> you

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
symmetrical length back here I think you

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.050 
symmetrical length back here I think you
get<00:03:48.360> a<00:03:48.390> little<00:03:49.050> bit<00:03:49.170> more<00:03:49.410> predictability

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
get a little bit more predictability

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.140 
get a little bit more predictability
with<00:03:51.530> the<00:03:52.530> feel<00:03:52.830> when<00:03:53.310> you're<00:03:53.459> turning<00:03:53.700> so

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
with the feel when you're turning so

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.500 
with the feel when you're turning so
this<00:03:54.959> board<00:03:55.290> is<00:03:55.440> still<00:03:56.130> definitely<00:03:57.860> a<00:03:59.510> puzzle

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
this board is still definitely a puzzle

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.910 
this board is still definitely a puzzle
and<00:04:00.750> it's<00:04:01.200> a<00:04:01.380> work<00:04:01.620> in<00:04:01.650> progress<00:04:01.800> but<00:04:02.519> I<00:04:02.820> think

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
and it's a work in progress but I think

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.180 
and it's a work in progress but I think
this<00:04:04.920> is<00:04:05.220> this<00:04:05.730> is<00:04:05.940> getting<00:04:06.390> really<00:04:06.630> close<00:04:06.989> to

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
this is this is getting really close to

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.400 
this is this is getting really close to
the<00:04:08.190> feeling<00:04:08.730> of<00:04:08.940> the<00:04:09.330> asymmetrical<00:04:10.019> designs

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
the feeling of the asymmetrical designs

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.760 
the feeling of the asymmetrical designs
that<00:04:10.769> I'm

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
that I'm

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.260 
that I'm
after<00:04:12.070> and<00:04:12.340> plus<00:04:12.970> it<00:04:13.240> with<00:04:13.390> the<00:04:13.540> single<00:04:14.410> pin

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
after and plus it with the single pin

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.240 
after and plus it with the single pin
really<00:04:16.270> fun<00:04:16.600> just<00:04:17.350> single<00:04:17.709> from<00:04:17.860> the<00:04:17.950> feeling

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
really fun just single from the feeling

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.570 
really fun just single from the feeling
-<00:04:18.450> thank<00:04:19.450> you
