sometimes the numbering system gets a
bit<00:00:31.619> skew<00:00:32.160> but<00:00:33.090> if<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:34.170> look<00:00:34.380> at<00:00:34.559> this<00:00:34.980> here

were<00:00:40.710> one<00:00:40.980> six<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.760> at<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.420> same<00:00:42.629> time<00:00:42.960> period

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
were one six and at the same time period

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.950 
were one six and at the same time period
it<00:00:43.620> was<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.739> one<00:00:44.040> six<00:00:44.399> zero<00:00:44.640> one<00:00:45.180> three<00:00:45.210> that

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
it was a one six zero one three that

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.350 
it was a one six zero one three that
would<00:00:46.079> have<00:00:46.230> been<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.559> two-tone<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.399> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
would have been the two-tone and the

would have been the two-tone and the
oyster<00:00:48.750> quartz<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.410> one<00:00:49.649> seven<00:00:50.039> oh<00:00:50.190> one<00:00:50.219> three

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
oyster quartz is one seven oh one three

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.750 
oyster quartz is one seven oh one three
to<00:00:51.120> town<00:00:51.420> oyster<00:00:51.840> quartz<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:53.489> there<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.730> a

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
to town oyster quartz and so there is a

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.930 
to town oyster quartz and so there is a
bit<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.480> know<00:00:54.510> method<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.289> madness<00:00:55.940> as

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
bit of you know method to the madness as

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.090 
bit of you know method to the madness as
other<00:00:57.690> times<00:00:58.020> then<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.440> number<00:00:58.739> system

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
other times then the number system

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.910 
other times then the number system
doesn't<00:00:59.370> mean<00:00:59.789> anything<00:01:00.329> like<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.780> but<00:01:01.109> yeah

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
doesn't mean anything like that but yeah

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.619 
doesn't mean anything like that but yeah
it's<00:01:02.160> quite<00:01:02.399> an<00:01:02.520> interesting<00:01:02.760> model<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.600> the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
it's quite an interesting model the the

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.609 
it's quite an interesting model the the
oyster<00:01:04.260> quartz<00:01:04.589> itself<00:01:05.010> it's<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.960> huge<00:01:06.960> popular

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
time goes on there they were made in

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.760 
time goes on there they were made in
limited<00:04:34.370> numbers<00:04:34.400> and<00:04:35.169> I<00:04:36.169> think<00:04:36.469> the<00:04:36.560> two

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
limited numbers and I think the two

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.640 
limited numbers and I think the two
tones<00:04:37.120> they<00:04:38.120> ran<00:04:38.449> until<00:04:38.870> about<00:04:39.250> 2000<00:04:40.360> 2001

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
tones they ran until about 2000 2001

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.999 
tones they ran until about 2000 2001
2002<00:04:42.650> so<00:04:43.370> they're<00:04:43.580> they're<00:04:43.789> quite<00:04:44.090> a<00:04:44.860> they<00:04:45.860> had

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
2002 so they're they're quite a they had

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:48.399 
2002 so they're they're quite a they had
a<00:04:46.039> reasonable<00:04:46.550> production<00:04:47.270> run<00:04:47.479> but<00:04:47.750> they

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:48.409 
a reasonable production run but they

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:50.020 
a reasonable production run but they
certainly<00:04:48.680> haven't<00:04:49.039> been<00:04:49.219> on<00:04:49.460> the<00:04:49.580> market<00:04:50.000> for

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
certainly haven't been on the market for

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.170 
certainly haven't been on the market for
at<00:04:50.270> least<00:04:50.419> 10<00:04:50.810> years<00:04:50.840> so<00:04:51.560> I<00:04:51.830> think

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
at least 10 years so I think

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.159 
at least 10 years so I think
collectability<00:04:53.180> wise<00:04:53.449> they've<00:04:53.750> got<00:04:53.930> some

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
collectability wise they've got some

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:55.839 
collectability wise they've got some
some<00:04:54.590> scope<00:04:54.919> there<00:04:55.219> if<00:04:55.280> you<00:04:55.370> like<00:04:55.580> them

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:55.849 
some scope there if you like them

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:57.700 
some scope there if you like them
they're<00:04:56.449> an<00:04:56.599> interesting<00:04:57.139> piece<00:04:57.409> they're

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
they're an interesting piece they're

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.450 
they're an interesting piece they're
interesting<00:04:58.310> variation<00:04:59.030> to<00:04:59.240> have<00:04:59.479> there<00:04:59.810> and

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
interesting variation to have there and

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.369 
interesting variation to have there and
III<00:05:01.460> think<00:05:01.639> that's<00:05:02.000> a<00:05:02.120> great<00:05:02.270> thing<00:05:02.389> okay

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:03.379 
III think that's a great thing okay

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:05.050 
III think that's a great thing okay
