00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
California there's a drought going on

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.450 
California there's a drought going on
right<00:01:03.600> now<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:03.960> what<00:01:04.110> do<00:01:04.170> we<00:01:04.229> do<00:01:04.470> we<00:01:04.830> save<00:01:05.129> our

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
right now so what do we do we save our

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.370 
right now so what do we do we save our
water<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:06.119> thought<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.659> would<00:01:06.750> be<00:01:06.869> perfect<00:01:06.900> to

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
water I thought it would be perfect to

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.289 
water I thought it would be perfect to
bring<00:01:07.530> out<00:01:07.740> this<00:01:07.860> DNA<00:01:08.280> bomb<00:01:08.490> for<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.790> guys<00:01:08.970> I

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
bring out this DNA bomb for you guys I

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.719 
bring out this DNA bomb for you guys I
think<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.780> DNA<00:01:10.439> bomb<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.799> almost<00:01:11.130> like<00:01:11.430> maybe

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
think this DNA bomb is almost like maybe

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.700 
think this DNA bomb is almost like maybe
two<00:01:12.000> months<00:01:12.240> old<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.960> know<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.530> actually

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
two months old you know and I actually

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.340 
two months old you know and I actually
still<00:01:14.159> have<00:01:14.400> two<00:01:14.670> more<00:01:14.970> DNA<00:01:15.450> bombs<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.290> I

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
still have two more DNA bombs that I

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.230 
still have two more DNA bombs that I
have<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.740> my<00:01:16.890> reserve<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.670> I'm<00:01:17.820> probably<00:01:17.970> gonna

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
have in my reserve so I'm probably gonna

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.810 
have in my reserve so I'm probably gonna
be<00:01:18.479> spreading<00:01:19.439> those<00:01:19.560> out<00:01:19.799> evenly<00:01:20.250> over<00:01:20.580> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
be spreading those out evenly over the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.760 
be spreading those out evenly over the
course<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.420> next<00:01:21.600> few<00:01:21.840> months<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.350> last<00:01:22.590> me

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
course of the next few months to last me

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.410 
course of the next few months to last me
a<00:01:22.799> while<00:01:23.009> because<00:01:23.220> right<00:01:23.490> now<00:01:23.520> I'm<00:01:23.970> working

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
a while because right now I'm working

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.210 
a while because right now I'm working
full<00:01:24.840> time<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.439> don't<00:01:25.680> really<00:01:25.830> have<00:01:25.950> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
full time so I don't really have the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.830 
full time so I don't really have the
time<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.729> grind<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.119> game<00:01:27.330> get<00:01:27.659> some

you<00:02:46.540> see<00:02:46.750> me<00:02:46.900> patrolling<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.470> same<00:02:47.710> exact

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
you see me patrolling the same exact

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.980 
you see me patrolling the same exact
side<00:02:48.370> of<00:02:48.520> the<00:02:48.580> map<00:02:48.790> doing<00:02:49.120> what<00:02:49.300> i<00:02:49.330> do<00:02:49.450> and<00:02:49.900> i

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
side of the map doing what i do and i

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.050
