00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.910
 hi everyone so today you're in the company of alexander for 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.910
 a video on the water line the evaluation version 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:16.079
 so a year as a man except mother told me she was not bad I 

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.329
 wanted to test it and it's true that it's rather 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:22.709
 it's pretty good so I want you to go and enjoy it 

00:00:22.709 --> 00:00:24.369
 a little bit 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.230
 so that's the proof before we start talking a little bit sorry for 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.669
 cent and pass a message 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:33.070
 to thank them for all the subscribers all the people who sent 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.500
 screaming messages that commented who made the videos that makes me super 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.390
 pleasure and thank you from the entire diesel team 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.330
 here and a little accustomed to follow us and% 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.670
 I hope you will not disappoint 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.130
 now start a little bit to talk about the game so the game on 110 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.460
 thouars of a little boy lost in the forest 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.160
 at the arena varces the daeu it would be forest not apparently 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.949
 and for that he will meet a lot of obstacles 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.370
 especially traps and a little hidden everywhere in the decor 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.810
 and I think it's super well done because in this broken handle 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.410
 before falling into the trap in the majority of cases looks not happy 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.050
 it's a trap at that time 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.880
 and so it is true that it was surprising had jumped less staff 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.820
 thanks to the aff wrote a certain moment 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.430
 so here I think it's not bad game 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.830
 percent more it's well its course cc it's a fact that in the form of shadows 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.590
 So here is 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.310
 why I played and I gave a very good shot on the appetites night this 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.899
 that I find that the path 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:35.890
 here is the beauty of games like that at the same time as men 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.490
 a bag estimated ap he really has a head to this team but look 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.880
 so here I am stopped trapping papermaker after the first 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.340
 day 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.210
 I fell directly into the trap to see you not even that 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.010
 build a crevasse and inside there are tic 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.010
 allah I'm going to jump normally 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.300
 In this study 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.050
 where she loses the air champion playing 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.130
 by the voice there are small 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.130
 and for that it will brew the prince of Sweden 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.320
 without being there press that I add that to say the game tight atmosphere has me 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.209
 recalled 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.629
 not much but when I was little this called to her is invited the 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.119
 line probably 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:20.539
 and percent the generic storm she had presented herself as that under 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:22.159
 shape of shadows and its access 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.309
 and it struck me because this team 

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:25.219
 for obama 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:28.199
 for peace located summer is not a little bit 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:31.609
 and for that it marks the generics as holiness 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:32.989
 it is striking 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.679
 and for me I like well I like 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:37.969
 the person is different and I run 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:40.959
 which all came out recently and% 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.959
 there is little difference to vary a little bit 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:48.049
 so in the gt the tournament versus the game I think 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:50.599
 the plant 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.039
 for 100 m alonso but also specified 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:55.679
 percent in this game 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:03:00.589
 for those I would call a music game because yes for me it's not 

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:01.809
 use his music 

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:06.540
 there are situations we go there by what is a little brain% 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.009
 get off% and complicated situations 

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:13.989
 alain plas soon there after the boat he arrived in the past percent 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:14.739
 Alas 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.409
 in e1 rock 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:21.200
 and in the lead this Bavarian past these destinies is stupid but for the passes 

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:22.819
 no case currently in mind 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.480
 Is it not by his perception that she also loved 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.480
 no actually it will have to use the stick to be able to 

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:31.689
 the eurotunnel group 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:36.029
 but here I ended up with him if I finally play among the options 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:38.709
 watching his students 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.279
 before going further 

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:42.559
 to what it was 

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:44.059
 I read recently 

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:47.199
 a girl who liked the video but who thought it promised 

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:50.549
 prejudice the 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.369
 audi and mercedes to have created a chain 

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:56.369
 to apologize and physically female 

00:03:56.369 --> 00:04:00.239
 so for me I do not think I do not think I'm on the contrary I think 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:01.359
 only that 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:04.359
 departmental road and that's a little bit of mentalities 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.859
 in some people compared to guinness 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:10.689
 and I find it really sad that 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:14.790
 that the majority of girls have to hide in the play a flash game 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.109
 still be 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.519
 guys 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.449
 rather than the May 6 walk around being able to play quietly 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.960
 and meet people in europe 1 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.599
 right now act from home dreaming 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:31.330
 I never angry the ferry was at the net is true that the flight met 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.220
 a lot of super nice guys with the stadium 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.820
 was overflowing and it's a shame that some who misses out on that 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.080
 do not hide it you have to assume what you are 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.699
 ben ali that's almost 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:47.369
 it's a shame it's a pity we miss 2 28 points 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:52.360
 so percent and by the way his is not done 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.800
 % 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.760
 % to convince 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.710
 to display 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.580
 not at all did not see it sucks 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.699
 it was to share with you their common passion if video games 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.500
 and I think it's true that it's not me if I was with that 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.570
 it also allows me to have to wait for its release from the girls 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.479
 al-assad how are you 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:14.650
 and all that 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.240
 that I think it's interesting it's parra 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.240
 not necessarily it's a fact 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:26.110
 and financial but I also want to talk to you about the facebook page that the 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.129
 his 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:28.900
 because you know that 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.419
 hamon thinking about the year 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.639
 and for that's a shame because they just had this flaw 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:38.669
 false first who with you to pursue his neighbors see to 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:39.639
 critics 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:43.060
 and your advice your knowledge and advice is no problem 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.139
 already-seen air 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:46.620
 % offer gameplay 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.879
 commented 

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:51.800
 apam ask if the paddock% and if you want us to start a game 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.449

 you want that rolls that I asked you what game and we will make a 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:00.099
 pleasure to answer your 

00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:04.969
 people on board we have little for example commented on a lot of people 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:06.659
 German me 

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:08.330
 but oliech 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.439
 % 

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:11.430
 would I have three young people this 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.569
 you should not do that 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:14.830
 and very safe 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.110
 03 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.389
 I have 100% of his 103 years 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:20.400
 shot 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.529
 I was there to tie morning to the parade 

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:28.599
 and why not a dots a abbas at the same time operated if you have a 

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:29.409
 request 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:33.059
 by the way no problem you leave your message and in iraq to go over 

00:06:33.059 --> 00:06:35.159
 quickly possible 

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:38.159
 so here I think I've done all I wanted to tell you 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:42.400
 ea aytré and I want to thank again because frankly me it made me 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.099
 great fun especially the comments which ensures 

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:46.279
 the video 

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:51.150
 for which is why I pose and to avoid a test that federal body 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.139
 on the one hand I love his voice yale a wave 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:59.810
 the theme of this woman finally here thank you very much know that it is I 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:02.560
 well liked it is always fun and especially more 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.460
 on the live 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.469
 point 

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:08.580
 when I spoke about my loved ones it was rather remarks of this help the 

00:07:08.579 --> 00:07:10.639
 Kurdish majority country 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:13.360
 this cerebral attack 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.569
 and so it's nice when I hear that 

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:17.689
 some umpteenth 1-5 m 

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:19.069
 tomorrow 

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:22.769
 So now I think that all credits live 

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.610
 but nothing is done 

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:27.289
 and offered a goal to besides already she had forgotten because I had 

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:30.680
 promised a year yet the future of their family 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.699
 six subscribers 

00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:33.729
 we're going to heaven 

00:07:33.729 --> 00:07:37.120
 this is a weirdly mercenary work born somewhere that you have 

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.380
 passed then and stays true to lyon 

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.960
 in case of medical opinion the channel for the match the video 

00:07:44.179 --> 00:07:45.269
 why the decades
