00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
around I wanted to see if I actually had

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.810 
around I wanted to see if I actually had
enough<00:01:14.880> quinoa<00:01:15.869> flour<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.409> there<00:01:16.590> I'm<00:01:17.100> adding

let<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.240> cool<00:01:27.509> for<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.840> bit<00:01:27.869> before<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.500> added

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
let that cool for a bit before I added

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.520 
let that cool for a bit before I added
my<00:01:28.950> egg<00:01:29.420> and<00:01:30.420> I'm<00:01:30.600> just<00:01:30.869> kind<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.079> using<00:01:31.470> a

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
my egg and I'm just kind of using a

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.440 
my egg and I'm just kind of using a
spatula<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:32.189> fold<00:01:32.400> in<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.670> egg<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.119> didn't<00:01:33.329> want

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
spatula to fold in the egg I didn't want

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.789 
spatula to fold in the egg I didn't want
to<00:01:33.540> use<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.840> mixer<00:01:34.170> because<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.470> don't<00:01:34.619> want<00:01:34.740> to

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
to use the mixer because I don't want to

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.640 
to use the mixer because I don't want to
break<00:01:35.070> down<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.250> protein<00:01:35.759> in<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.060> egg<00:01:36.650> and

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
break down the protein in the egg and

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.170 
break down the protein in the egg and
this<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.920> what<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.100> look<00:01:38.700> like<00:01:38.729> when<00:01:39.060> your

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
this is what it look like when your

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.899 
this is what it look like when your
batter<00:01:39.360> is<00:01:39.570> done<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.280> at<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:41.430> point<00:01:41.759> just

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
batter is done and at this point just

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.730 
batter is done and at this point just
want<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.150> go<00:01:42.240> ahead<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.450> scoop<00:01:43.049> in<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.290> little

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
want to go ahead and scoop in a little

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.280 
want to go ahead and scoop in a little
bit<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:43.890> batter<00:01:44.100> onto<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:45.329> skillet<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:45.990> you

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
bit of batter onto a skillet that you

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.200 
bit of batter onto a skillet that you
sprayed<00:01:46.649> down<00:01:46.799> with<00:01:46.860> some<00:01:47.220> olive<00:01:47.549> oil<00:01:47.880> spray

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
and you'll know when to flip it when the

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.950 
and you'll know when to flip it when the
edges<00:01:53.490> start<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.939> get<00:01:54.060> kind<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.270> crispy<00:01:54.720> and

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
edges start to get kind of crispy and

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.160 
edges start to get kind of crispy and
brown

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
and this is what they look like when

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.490 
and this is what they look like when
they're<00:02:00.600> all<00:02:00.780> done<00:02:00.810> well<00:02:01.260> they<00:02:01.350> look

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
they're all done well they look

applesauce I have laid down I really

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.300 
applesauce I have laid down I really
like<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.380> way<00:02:43.470> these<00:02:43.590> came<00:02:43.830> out<00:02:43.950> let<00:02:44.130> me<00:02:44.190> try

like the way these came out let me try
it<00:02:44.340> with<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.550> yogurt<00:02:45.050> just<00:02:46.050> a<00:02:46.200> really<00:02:46.440> good

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
it with the yogurt just a really good

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.120 
it with the yogurt just a really good
amount

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
amount

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.830 
amount
I<00:02:47.160> think<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.670> spices<00:02:48.150> that<00:02:48.180> we<00:02:48.360> put<00:02:48.390> in<00:02:48.630> here

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
I think the spices that we put in here

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.440 
I think the spices that we put in here
is<00:02:49.769> the<00:02:49.830> perfect<00:02:50.220> amount<00:02:50.370> of<00:02:50.550> like<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:51.090> onion

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
is the perfect amount of like the onion

00:02:51.450 --> 00:03:00.800 
is the perfect amount of like the onion
the<00:02:51.780> garlic<00:02:51.810> powder<00:02:52.200> in<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:53.160> pepper<00:02:59.750> this<00:03:00.750> is

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
the garlic powder in the pepper this is

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.470 
the garlic powder in the pepper this is
really<00:03:01.110> good<00:03:01.760> and<00:03:02.760> then<00:03:03.000> this<00:03:03.060> is<00:03:03.180> actually<00:03:03.450> a

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
really good and then this is actually a

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.770 
really good and then this is actually a
really<00:03:03.630> good<00:03:04.880> substitute<00:03:05.880> for<00:03:05.910> potato

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
really good substitute for potato

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.090 
really good substitute for potato
pancakes<00:03:07.320> I<00:03:07.380> really<00:03:07.590> don't<00:03:07.680> really<00:03:07.950> notice

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
pancakes I really don't really notice

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.160 
pancakes I really don't really notice
the<00:03:08.310> difference<00:03:08.340> really<00:03:09.000> maybe<00:03:09.959> it's<00:03:10.049> because

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
the difference really maybe it's because

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.960 
the difference really maybe it's because
I<00:03:10.320> haven't<00:03:10.560> had<00:03:10.680> a<00:03:10.709> potato<00:03:11.220> and<00:03:11.610> like<00:03:11.700> you<00:03:11.880> know

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
years but from what I remember this is a

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.850 
years but from what I remember this is a
potato<00:03:15.299> stain<00:03:15.600> its<00:03:15.690> lucky<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:16.230> don't<00:03:16.739> know

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860

anything<00:03:17.250> well<00:03:18.120> I<00:03:18.150> think<00:03:18.299> it's<00:03:18.660> I<00:03:18.900> mean<00:03:19.340> it's

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
anything well I think it's I mean it's

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.080 
anything well I think it's I mean it's
an<00:03:20.459> excellent<00:03:20.760> substitute<00:03:21.150> isn't<00:03:21.840> ugly<00:03:23.090> it

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
an excellent substitute isn't ugly it

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.330 
an excellent substitute isn't ugly it
doesn't<00:03:24.150> taste<00:03:24.570> exactly<00:03:24.780> like<00:03:25.340> potato

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
things like that but it does have
