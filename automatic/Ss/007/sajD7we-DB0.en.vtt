00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.820
 you can not find a match that 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.020
 on paper it's so even 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.029
 athletic and barça faced the 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.190
 last weekend as co-leaders of 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.830
 the league and they showed that they are both 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.330
 best teams in the competition and how 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.580
 they are at such a similar level and they 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.950
 they respect so much the encounter could not 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.650
 end otherwise with a draw without 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.000
 goals but you do not always need 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.030
 goals to enjoy a match 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.280
 exciting and that is already before the start 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.680
 of the game you breathed that air of 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.180
 big meeting in the calderón of those 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.700
 days when nobody wants to lose 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.829
 not a single minute of game nor the most 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.960
 small there are even some that have 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.090
 time to send messages to the eternal 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.980
 rival Messi Neymar stayed in the 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.440
 but that did not take away any 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.989
 shine to the frantic dense encounter 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.930
 disputed but you could tell that everyone 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.790
 they were getting a lot of head was a 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.520
 great show where even the 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.100
 referee let everyone happy with the 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.790
 entry and I have to especially leave the 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.450
 soccer leaves for football is not not such 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.220
 to the folk touch and separates party and stops 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.390
 from this it's going to come out somewhere 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.390
 safe pits and to distribute 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.990
 undoubtedly the two biggest protagonists 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.909
 were the technicians since their 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.430
 approaches helped create a 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.899
 confrontation so even and if we 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.450
 we have to come up with a definition 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.430
 of the meeting we choose the clarity of the 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.380
 'tata' martino 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:42.659
 this could go right or wrong came ning 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.700
 we've already played three matches 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.979
 two teams this season counting league 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.409
 and supercopa and the three have finished in 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.390
 tie so to close a piece os 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.520
 we leave with a statement of simeone 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.110
 appreciating those encounters 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.569
 three matches against barcelona this 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.990
 season three draws and can not with 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:59.990
 you 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.710
 6 as I know sincerely not any other if 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.490
 it would not appear poor of them not 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.490
