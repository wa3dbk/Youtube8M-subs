00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 who always diligently on facebook 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.549
 over looks the wirt in front of some 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.830
 his pictures were there 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.269
 I am with the boys pornography and 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.830
 I asked what could it do with it 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.540
 I suppose the resolution is up to today 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.780
 valued up there in the title already seen 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.420
 and it's about how come out 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.100
 you want the patch to dance the whole thing 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.140
 will be around in june 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.300
 market come they have today in the unboxing 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.519
 video here so the say looks pure 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.359
 What are these beautiful oldtimer running 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.800
 what just in there in jubez over 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.600
 1840 as long as there is a construction 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.700
 In general, and we'll just watch it 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.950
 Let's get in there like this retro lens like that 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.829
 pretty much every packaging has become 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.219
 and up here is the same kind man of us 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.590
 on the other hand looks what is in it looks so 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.030
 a lot of explanation a few pictures 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.170
 maybe taken with the camera 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.239
 you may like to have a look if he has the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.510
 camera bought now first to the 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.379
 important things good that there is one more 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.670
 business cards no idea how one 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.170
 important stuff and a bit of cardboard 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.690
 and since we have then already the 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.840
 sweetheart I'll tell this crew here 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.640
 in there and packed the new balance 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.110
 in a pretty thick 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.070
 Plastic bag with it all is here 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.950
 I do not really know yet 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.000
 final or last 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.070
 pre-production model so it can be that 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.380
 this is not quite all right 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.000
 final after packaged so beautiful 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.259
 tape or can it be that 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.970
 someone ever short 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.640
 has tested with the boys of 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.560
 I do not know about the demography 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.420
 Here you can relax and chat 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.820
 still a bit because that's it 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.680
 lid is not that easy 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.680
 out there and there we have it already 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.270
 kitten if you want so you can 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.549
 can see such a brass color that 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.229
 whole inside but very modern 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.180
 you have to say 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.340
 in terms of weight but already quite common 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.290
 So a Grade 7 800 grams it is 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.390
 already go so well call 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.280
 we all the time so on the 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.890
 back side actually looks already 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.659
 quite chic from canon ef mount so synonymous 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.520
 suitable for full frame cameras after 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.250
 when you test the three with the five 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.770
 what we have here untendran is 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.719
 sonja manually focuses on him all this 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.579
 old construction do you come to say 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.640
 this petrol lens was really that 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.709
 first portrait lens on the world 1840 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.560
 and really groundbreaking at the time 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.020
 whole today just a bit 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.090
 adapted to current events because 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:21.340
 we watch the time but what there still so 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.900
 so here's something very funny when 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.170
 they should have mentioned it all 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.220
 By the way, Russia produced 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.150
 maybe interesting for the one 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.160
 or others so here's and 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.480
 hipster jute bag just one 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.650
 Tote bag for it feels like 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.300
 a bit weird at too artificial leather 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.670
 but here is a lot more paper 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.620
 with it in the first time not so in 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.269
 pakistan and here we find 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.500
 probably still part of it now 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.700
 a few quite on the things mentioned 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.160
 had ever read in addition to the 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:59.569
 microfiber cloth partner the whole here 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:03:00.920
 Just left out somewhere so 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.349
 really everything is glued here very nicely 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.940
 it's all in here, I got it 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.360
 already explain my shops a bit 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.760
 to let 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.980
 class exchangeable dazzle for him 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.780
 at that time clearly with the first objective that 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.950
 it even gave portraits there was 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.660
 not so integrated now 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.760
 electronic controllable aperture in it 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.769
 that was just 170 years ago 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.480
 asked if theater gave so much to him 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.459
 not at all that's just completely 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.630
 different chic art dazzle those 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.000
 from having seen with the 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.890
 different forms in there and there 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.239
 still quite normal level should be here 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.530
 probably it had in 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.040
 different diameters so here 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:37.040
 For example, we are here 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.130
 still farther 28 and so on and 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.389
 so fortunately we have here exactly blind 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.250
 4 of the trade was still playing 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:45.920
 some go on what was to third 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.620
 are in the aperture 56 811 and so on and 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:52.670
 so on, the smallest thing can not be inside 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.780
 so is aperture 16 exactly and so can 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.400
 I'll tell you the light intensity of 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.720
 set lenses manually like that 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.750
 whole works now here now 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.579
 first of all, this blind luck, too 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.010
 always out and now makes a blind 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:05.389
 your choice if now blind 28 that 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.430
 whole is actually sitting quite well 

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:09.470
 and thus put the light intensity 1 here 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.440
 sometimes just open iris if you can 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.760
 this is how daisy 22 wants to be 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.049
 actually relatively exactly the original 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.030
 Construction also for something 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.620
 succeeded medium format cameras at that time 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.470
 originally thought to be 100 millimeters 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.470
 Now you have here 85 mm with aperture 22 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.900
 formerly just 36 so pi times thumb 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.550
 Actually, they read in well 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.720
 you see, you see quite well 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.080
 this slightly bluish reflexes there 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.460
 in it 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.110
 that comes from relatively modern 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.520
 coating data so still one 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.620
 a bit more just put in it 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.540
 that you are curious about the new balance 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.750
 Thumbs up on the review and we 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.750
 see us
