need to throw a grenade an extra five or
ten<00:01:01.620> feet<00:01:01.829> like<00:01:02.010> that's<00:01:02.219> just<00:01:02.370> honestly

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
ten feet like that's just honestly

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.579 
ten feet like that's just honestly
ridiculous<00:01:02.940> now<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.480> other<00:01:03.719> two<00:01:03.960> benefits<00:01:04.470> of

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
ridiculous now the other two benefits of

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.469 
ridiculous now the other two benefits of
having<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:04.890> perk<00:01:05.129> actually<00:01:05.850> do<00:01:06.119> work<00:01:06.299> and

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
having this perk actually do work and

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.820 
having this perk actually do work and
they<00:01:06.540> could<00:01:06.750> benefit<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.200> sometimes<00:01:07.590> but<00:01:07.799> I

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
they could benefit you sometimes but I

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.350 
they could benefit you sometimes but I
honestly<00:01:08.159> don't<00:01:08.310> know<00:01:08.430> if<00:01:08.790> they're<00:01:09.150> truly

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
honestly don't know if they're truly

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.810 
honestly don't know if they're truly
worth<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.840> for<00:01:09.990> an<00:01:10.080> entire<00:01:10.350> perk<00:01:10.710> slot<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.250> one

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
worth it for an entire perk slot so one

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.370 
worth it for an entire perk slot so one
is<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.299> thing<00:01:12.450> allows<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.930> cook<00:01:13.080> frag

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
is this thing allows you to cook frag

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.870 
is this thing allows you to cook frag
grenades<00:01:13.710> faster<00:01:14.100> which<00:01:14.220> obviously<00:01:14.549> does

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
grenades faster which obviously does

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.399 
grenades faster which obviously does
work<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.180> know<00:01:15.299> sometimes<00:01:15.720> if<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.170> want<00:01:16.350> to

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
work you know sometimes if you want to

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.749 
work you know sometimes if you want to
cook<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.560> grenade<00:01:16.890> really<00:01:17.220> fast<00:01:17.430> that's<00:01:17.640> going

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
cook a grenade really fast that's going

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.520 
cook a grenade really fast that's going
to<00:01:17.820> help<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.060> out<00:01:18.210> but<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.630> don't<00:01:19.229> think<00:01:19.350> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
to help you out but I don't think the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.899 
to help you out but I don't think the
normal<00:01:19.920> cooking<00:01:20.220> time<00:01:20.430> takes<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.850> long

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
normal cooking time takes that long

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.179 
normal cooking time takes that long
anyway<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.570> then<00:01:21.869> finally<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.439> last<00:01:22.470> benefit

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
anyway and then finally the last benefit

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.800 
anyway and then finally the last benefit
of<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.400> perk<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.850> it's<00:01:24.330> really<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.659> most

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
of this perk is it's really the most

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.719 
of this perk is it's really the most
beneficial<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.619> what<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.100> does<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.280> allows

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
beneficial and what it does is allows

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.670 
beneficial and what it does is allows
you<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.970> reset<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.450> timers<00:01:27.869> on<00:01:28.020> frag<00:01:28.350> grenade

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
you to reset the timers on frag grenade

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.380 
you to reset the timers on frag grenade
so<00:01:28.860> if<00:01:28.950> an<00:01:29.040> enemy<00:01:29.159> throws<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.520> night<00:01:29.759> at<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.000> you

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
so if an enemy throws a night at you you

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.760 
so if an enemy throws a night at you you
can<00:01:30.540> pick<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.840> up<00:01:30.960> it's<00:01:31.140> going<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.320> reset<00:01:31.740> that

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
can pick it up it's going to reset that

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.859 
can pick it up it's going to reset that
timer<00:01:32.159> so<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.759> won't<00:01:32.970> blow<00:01:33.150> up<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.450> your<00:01:33.479> hands

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
timer so it won't blow up in your hands

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.840 
timer so it won't blow up in your hands
you<00:01:33.900> know<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.500> might<00:01:34.829> be<00:01:35.070> useful<00:01:35.340> if<00:01:35.700> you're

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
you know that might be useful if you're

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.520 
you know that might be useful if you're
running<00:01:36.000> like<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.360> strictly<00:01:36.869> objective

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
running like a strictly objective

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.319 
running like a strictly objective
domination<00:01:38.189> class<00:01:38.369> but<00:01:38.640> other<00:01:38.759> than<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.030> I

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
domination class but other than that I

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.539 
domination class but other than that I
really<00:01:39.390> don't<00:01:40.259> see<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.740> use<00:01:41.070> for<00:01:41.250> this<00:01:41.340> perk

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
really don't see a use for this perk

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.679 
really don't see a use for this perk
especially<00:01:42.090> because<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.299> can<00:01:42.420> pretty<00:01:42.600> much

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
especially because you can pretty much

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.929 
especially because you can pretty much
get<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.110> effects<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.680> just<00:01:44.189> by<00:01:44.369> jumping

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
get the effects of it just by jumping

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.280 
get the effects of it just by jumping
when<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.180> throw<00:01:45.420> your<00:01:45.570> name<00:01:45.689> this<00:01:45.899> little<00:01:46.049> tip

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
when you throw your name this little tip

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.420 
when you throw your name this little tip
you<00:01:46.500> guys<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.770> don't<00:01:46.920> know<00:01:46.979> if<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.130> guys<00:01:47.220> know

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
you guys I don't know if you guys know

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.889 
you guys I don't know if you guys know
about<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:47.820> but<00:01:48.180> check<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.360> out<00:01:48.509> right<00:01:48.630> here

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
about this but check it out right here

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.510 
about this but check it out right here
we're<00:01:49.320> just<00:01:49.380> going<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.619> throw<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:49.890> sim<00:01:50.250> text

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
we're just going to throw this sim text

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.830 
we're just going to throw this sim text
normally<00:01:50.970> we're<00:01:51.060> going<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.240> angle<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.600> up<00:01:51.720> a

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
normally we're going to angle it up a

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.700 
normally we're going to angle it up a
little<00:01:51.930> bit<00:01:52.110> we're<00:01:52.200> going<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.380> line<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.560> up

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
little bit we're going to line it up

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.929 
little bit we're going to line it up
with<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.890> side<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.189> this<00:01:53.310> palm<00:01:53.549> tree<00:01:53.820> the

with the side of this palm tree the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.370 
with the side of this palm tree the
little<00:01:54.119> leaf<00:01:54.270> there<00:01:54.570> we're<00:01:54.990> going<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.170> let<00:01:55.229> it

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
little leaf there we're going to let it

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.200 
little leaf there we're going to let it
go<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.770> that's<00:01:56.250> where<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.640> lands<00:01:56.850> now<00:01:57.060> if<00:01:57.119> we

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
go and that's where it lands now if we

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.639 
go and that's where it lands now if we
want<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.540> go<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.659> little<00:01:57.869> bit<00:01:58.079> farther<00:01:58.350> all

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
want it to go a little bit farther all

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.469 
want it to go a little bit farther all
we<00:01:58.799> have<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:58.979> do<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.280> jump<00:01:59.969> while<00:02:00.240> we're

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
we have to do is jump while we're

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.969 
we have to do is jump while we're
throwing<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:00.990> gives<00:02:01.320> us<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.560> little<00:02:01.710> bit<00:02:01.860> of

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
throwing it gives us a little bit of

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.350 
throwing it gives us a little bit of
extra<00:02:02.280> momentum<00:02:02.549> we're<00:02:02.850> going<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.030> line<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.210> up

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
extra momentum we're going to line it up

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.270 
extra momentum we're going to line it up
the<00:02:03.479> same<00:02:03.689> way<00:02:03.719> let<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.170> fly<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.649> look<00:02:05.130> at<00:02:05.250> that

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
the same way let it fly and look at that

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.180 
the same way let it fly and look at that
it<00:02:05.640> goes<00:02:06.000> just<00:02:06.030> slightly<00:02:06.840> farther<00:02:07.439> than<00:02:08.009> the

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
it goes just slightly farther than the

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.800 
it goes just slightly farther than the
first<00:02:08.429> one<00:02:08.670> did<00:02:08.879> so<00:02:09.119> that's<00:02:09.270> pretty<00:02:09.539> much<00:02:09.629> a

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
first one did so that's pretty much a

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.860 
first one did so that's pretty much a
built-in<00:02:10.590> strong<00:02:11.009> arm<00:02:11.280> perc<00:02:11.550> just<00:02:12.239> by<00:02:12.420> jumping

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
built-in strong arm perc just by jumping

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.640 
built-in strong arm perc just by jumping
so<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.260> mean

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
so I mean

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.280 
so I mean
really<00:02:13.860> guys<00:02:13.980> strong<00:02:14.370> arm<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.790> don't<00:02:15.540> see<00:02:15.930> any

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
really guys strong arm I don't see any

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.259 
really guys strong arm I don't see any
reason<00:02:16.409> to<00:02:16.769> use<00:02:17.040> this<00:02:17.280> thing<00:02:17.549> as<00:02:17.760> of<00:02:18.030> now<00:02:18.209> you

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
reason to use this thing as of now you

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:19.789 
reason to use this thing as of now you
know<00:02:18.450> maybe<00:02:18.629> it'll<00:02:18.840> be<00:02:18.959> buffed<00:02:19.170> I'm<00:02:19.409> not<00:02:19.620> sure

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
know maybe it'll be buffed I'm not sure

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:20.899 
know maybe it'll be buffed I'm not sure
what's<00:02:19.980> going<00:02:20.129> on<00:02:20.280> maybe<00:02:20.489> I'm<00:02:20.670> missing

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
what's going on maybe I'm missing

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.429 
what's going on maybe I'm missing
something<00:02:21.090> but<00:02:21.540> as<00:02:21.689> of<00:02:21.840> now<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:21.989> just<00:02:22.079> yeah<00:02:22.409> I

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:22.439 
something but as of now I just yeah I

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:23.780 
something but as of now I just yeah I
don't<00:02:22.769> think<00:02:23.099> this<00:02:23.220> thing<00:02:23.370> is<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.489> very<00:02:23.730> good

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
don't think this thing is a very good

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.880 
don't think this thing is a very good
perk<00:02:24.120> like<00:02:24.599> I<00:02:24.720> said<00:02:24.780> if<00:02:25.170> you're<00:02:25.739> running

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
perk like I said if you're running

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.649 
perk like I said if you're running
domination<00:02:26.640> only<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.209> you're<00:02:27.420> going<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.599> be

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
domination only and you're going to be

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.149 
domination only and you're going to be
playing<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.959> objective<00:02:28.049> maybe<00:02:28.680> it's<00:02:28.890> good

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
playing the objective maybe it's good

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.649 
playing the objective maybe it's good
for<00:02:29.459> throwing<00:02:29.670> back<00:02:29.909> frags<00:02:30.239> if<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.540> want

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
for throwing back frags if you want

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:32.390 
for throwing back frags if you want
include<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.019> with<00:02:31.140> like<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.500> blast<00:02:31.980> shield<00:02:32.250> or

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
include it with like a blast shield or

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.530 
include it with like a blast shield or
something<00:02:32.670> like<00:02:32.760> that<00:02:32.819> but<00:02:33.090> apart<00:02:33.390> from<00:02:33.420> that

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
something like that but apart from that

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.240 
something like that but apart from that
I<00:02:33.840> don't<00:02:34.379> think<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:34.620> guys<00:02:34.769> should<00:02:34.799> be<00:02:35.010> using
