00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
hey guys this carrabba's peeking and

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.329 
hey guys this carrabba's peeking and
today<00:00:03.480> we<00:00:03.780> are<00:00:03.959> going<00:00:04.200> to<00:00:04.380> take<00:00:04.529> a<00:00:04.589> new<00:00:05.040> look<00:00:05.069> at

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
today we are going to take a new look at

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.080 
today we are going to take a new look at
the<00:00:05.940> multiplayer<00:00:06.509> mode<00:00:06.870> we<00:00:07.529> have<00:00:07.710> now

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
the multiplayer mode we have now

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.530 
the multiplayer mode we have now
implemented<00:00:09.710> the<00:00:10.710> new<00:00:11.010> scenario<00:00:11.849> generation

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
implemented the new scenario generation

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.499 
implemented the new scenario generation
system<00:00:13.380> so<00:00:14.040> now<00:00:14.759> we<00:00:14.820> actually<00:00:15.299> have

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
system so now we actually have

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.290 
system so now we actually have
randomized<00:00:16.350> stuff<00:00:16.920> in<00:00:17.070> there<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.490> we<00:00:18.119> can

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
randomized stuff in there and we can

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.970 
randomized stuff in there and we can
choose<00:00:18.510> from<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.869> few<00:00:19.050> stats<00:00:19.350> as<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:19.680> can<00:00:19.830> see

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
choose from a few stats as you can see

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.109 
choose from a few stats as you can see
we<00:00:20.550> have<00:00:20.580> up<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.750> five<00:00:22.080> scored<00:00:22.740> stats<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.400> we

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
we have up to five scored stats and we

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.210 
we have up to five scored stats and we
can<00:00:24.300> choose<00:00:24.510> game<00:00:24.779> length<00:00:24.960> as<00:00:25.199> well<00:00:25.410> just<00:00:26.039> like

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
can choose game length as well just like

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.450 
can choose game length as well just like
before<00:00:26.400> but<00:00:27.210> now<00:00:27.920> things<00:00:28.920> are<00:00:29.160> bit<00:00:29.310> more

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
before but now things are bit more

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.849 
before but now things are bit more
balanced<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.090> should<00:00:30.300> work<00:00:30.539> out<00:00:30.630> nicely<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.349> I

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
balanced and should work out nicely so I

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.610 
balanced and should work out nicely so I
would<00:00:32.340> say<00:00:32.579> people<00:00:33.030> join<00:00:33.690> into<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.170> game<00:00:34.320> now

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
would say people join into the game now

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.780 
would say people join into the game now
and<00:00:36.079> we<00:00:37.079> try<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.380> out<00:00:37.640> so<00:00:38.640> are<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.180> guys<00:00:39.570> ready

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
go okay now that looks pretty

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.889 
go okay now that looks pretty
interesting<00:00:51.440> wait<00:00:52.440> MTBF<00:00:52.890> loudness<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.899> a

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
interesting wait MTBF loudness and a

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.299 
interesting wait MTBF loudness and a
fixed<00:00:55.170> parliament<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.180> modern<00:00:57.180> age<00:00:57.629> okay<00:00:58.590> so

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
fixed parliament and modern age okay so

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.900 
fixed parliament and modern age okay so
how<00:00:59.550> are<00:00:59.609> we<00:00:59.730> going<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.120> do<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.449> II<00:01:01.699> from<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
how are we going to do this II from the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.270 
how are we going to do this II from the
power<00:01:03.180> requirement<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.840> 1996<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:05.040> looks

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
power requirement of 1996 this looks

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.120 
power requirement of 1996 this looks
like<00:01:05.489> an<00:01:05.670> in-line<00:01:06.119> engine<00:01:06.619> so<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.650> think<00:01:07.770> I'll

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
like an in-line engine so I think I'll

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.789 
like an in-line engine so I think I'll
be<00:01:08.280> going<00:01:08.460> with<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.390> invisible<00:01:10.080> option<00:01:10.500> in

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
be going with the invisible option in

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.420 
be going with the invisible option in
line<00:01:11.189> 50

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
line 50

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.600 
line 50
inline<00:01:13.910> 6<00:01:14.410> let's<00:01:15.410> go<00:01:15.590> from<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:15.830> inline<00:01:16.130> 6<00:01:16.400> here

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
inline 6 let's go from the inline 6 here

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.320 
inline 6 let's go from the inline 6 here
and<00:01:18.370> so<00:01:19.370> that<00:01:19.520> you<00:01:19.550> at<00:01:19.850> least<00:01:19.880> can<00:01:20.180> see

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
and so that you at least can see

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.770 
and so that you at least can see
something<00:01:20.750> all<00:01:20.990> I'm<00:01:21.260> filming<00:01:21.980> alright<00:01:22.850> so<00:01:23.210> we

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
something all I'm filming alright so we

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.280 
something all I'm filming alright so we
do<00:01:24.080> have<00:01:24.110> weight<00:01:24.860> and<00:01:25.810> we<00:01:26.810> should<00:01:26.990> go<00:01:27.140> for

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
do have weight and we should go for

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.980 
do have weight and we should go for
aluminum<00:01:27.770> I<00:01:27.860> guess<00:01:28.479> power<00:01:29.479> requirement<00:01:29.930> is

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
aluminum I guess power requirement is

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.310 
aluminum I guess power requirement is
pretty<00:01:30.260> low<00:01:30.470> so<00:01:31.430> I<00:01:31.460> go<00:01:31.880> for<00:01:32.180> the<00:01:32.570> cheapest<00:01:32.990> cast

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
pretty low so I go for the cheapest cast

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.570 
pretty low so I go for the cheapest cast
components<00:01:34.930> but<00:01:35.930> on<00:01:36.440> the<00:01:36.619> other<00:01:36.710> hand<00:01:36.830> we

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
components but on the other hand we

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
components but on the other hand we
don't<00:01:37.940> have<00:01:38.330> a<00:01:38.600> price<00:01:39.080> limitation<00:01:39.800> and<00:01:40.600> only

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
don't have a price limitation and only

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.280 
don't have a price limitation and only
man<00:01:41.810> hours<00:01:42.380> so<00:01:45.970> it's<00:01:46.970> a<00:01:47.119> bit<00:01:47.270> tricky<00:01:47.540> now<00:01:48.020> let's

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
man hours so it's a bit tricky now let's

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.780 
man hours so it's a bit tricky now let's
go<00:01:48.410> for<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:48.619> cheap<00:01:48.800> components<00:01:49.250> first<00:01:49.399> Oh

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
go for the cheap components first Oh

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.850 
go for the cheap components first Oh
everyone<00:01:50.690> has<00:01:50.869> already<00:01:51.050> scores<00:01:51.530> and<00:01:51.770> I'm

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
everyone has already scores and I'm

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.620 
everyone has already scores and I'm
still<00:01:52.100> on<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.280> first<00:01:52.580> tab<00:01:53.000> no<00:01:53.330> that's

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
still on the first tab no that's

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.480 
still on the first tab no that's
brilliant<00:01:55.149> all<00:01:56.149> right<00:01:56.920> now<00:01:57.920> basically<00:01:58.250> the

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
brilliant all right now basically the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.340 
brilliant all right now basically the
only<00:01:58.580> really<00:01:59.030> big<00:01:59.509> difference<00:01:59.720> from<00:02:00.140> last

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
only really big difference from last

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.910 
only really big difference from last
time<00:02:00.710> is<00:02:00.920> that<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:02.570> scenarios<00:02:03.050> are<00:02:03.350> properly

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
time is that the scenarios are properly

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.639 
time is that the scenarios are properly
generated<00:02:04.670> now<00:02:04.850> we<00:02:05.720> still<00:02:05.990> are<00:02:06.140> fighting<00:02:06.530> with

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
generated now we still are fighting with

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.359 
generated now we still are fighting with
the<00:02:07.580> balance<00:02:07.910> of<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.690> generation<00:02:09.259> some<00:02:10.040> stats

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
the balance of the generation some stats

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.970 
the balance of the generation some stats
are<00:02:10.640> sometimes<00:02:11.540> overpowered<00:02:12.350> have<00:02:12.620> too<00:02:12.860> many

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
are sometimes overpowered have too many

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.210 
are sometimes overpowered have too many
percent<00:02:13.430> like<00:02:13.840> ninety-eight<00:02:14.840> percent

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
percent like ninety-eight percent

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.400 
percent like ninety-eight percent
loudness<00:02:16.220> or<00:02:16.550> something<00:02:17.060> so<00:02:17.780> everyone<00:02:18.380> just

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
loudness or something so everyone just

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.170 
loudness or something so everyone just
builds<00:02:19.010> a<00:02:19.250> engine<00:02:19.430> to<00:02:19.700> get<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:19.970> loans

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
builds a engine to get the loans

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.960 
builds a engine to get the loans
low<00:02:20.739> with<00:02:21.739> a<00:02:21.769> turbo<00:02:22.100> that<00:02:22.340> doesn't<00:02:22.670> work<00:02:22.820> or

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
low with a turbo that doesn't work or

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.810 
low with a turbo that doesn't work or
something<00:02:23.530> let's<00:02:24.530> see<00:02:24.799> we<00:02:25.010> don't<00:02:25.190> have<00:02:25.580> our

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
something let's see we don't have our

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.660 
something let's see we don't have our
manufacturing<00:02:26.540> courses<00:02:26.930> yes<00:02:27.140> so<00:02:27.590> maybe<00:02:28.489> go

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
manufacturing courses yes so maybe go

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.150 
manufacturing courses yes so maybe go
push<00:02:29.030> rods<00:02:29.299> instead<00:02:29.870> should<00:02:30.470> have<00:02:30.680> enough

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
push rods instead should have enough

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.820 
push rods instead should have enough
Headroom<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.299> do<00:02:32.420> so<00:02:32.660> yes<00:02:33.200> we<00:02:33.440> have<00:02:33.620> that

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
Headroom to do so yes we have that

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
Headroom to do so yes we have that
improved<00:02:34.190> scores<00:02:34.549> further<00:02:35.680> because<00:02:36.680> of<00:02:37.160> MTBF

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
improved scores further because of MTBF

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.949 
improved scores further because of MTBF
and<00:02:38.180> man<00:02:38.930> our<00:02:39.110> requirements<00:02:39.769> both<00:02:40.340> having

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
and man our requirements both having

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.190 
and man our requirements both having
quite<00:02:41.959> a<00:02:41.989> bit<00:02:42.170> of<00:02:42.230> weight<00:02:42.410> in<00:02:42.830> total<00:02:43.630> and<00:02:44.630> we're

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
quite a bit of weight in total and we're

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.530 
quite a bit of weight in total and we're
rather<00:02:45.709> lightweight<00:02:46.370> but<00:02:46.670> now<00:02:46.970> I<00:02:47.000> want<00:02:47.390> to

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
rather lightweight but now I want to

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.120 
rather lightweight but now I want to
reduce<00:02:49.299> power<00:02:50.299> even<00:02:50.690> more<00:02:51.049> to<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.500> limits<00:02:51.920> so

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
reduce power even more to the limits so

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.759 
reduce power even more to the limits so
that<00:02:52.160> i<00:02:52.340> can<00:02:52.630> get<00:02:53.630> down<00:02:53.989> in<00:02:54.519> in<00:02:55.570> weight<00:02:56.570> as<00:02:56.989> much

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
that i can get down in in weight as much

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.550 
that i can get down in in weight as much
as<00:02:57.950> possible<00:02:58.660> see<00:02:59.660> and<00:02:59.930> that<00:02:59.989> added<00:03:00.320> another

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
as possible see and that added another

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.930 
as possible see and that added another
50<00:03:01.010> points<00:03:01.430> not<00:03:01.610> too<00:03:01.730> bad<00:03:02.829> hmm<00:03:03.829> no<00:03:04.280> time<00:03:04.640> is<00:03:04.760> old

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
50 points not too bad hmm no time is old

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.100 
50 points not too bad hmm no time is old
and<00:03:05.090> I'm<00:03:05.720> I<00:03:06.019> suck<00:03:06.769> like<00:03:07.549> usual<00:03:07.910> fourth<00:03:08.810> place

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
and I'm I suck like usual fourth place

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.210 
and I'm I suck like usual fourth place
