00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:23.320
 It's good the evening people let 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:23.320
 focus here looks will be the raid pilot 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:34.320
 Good night guys is one more video of the 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.770
 channel 123 physics 1 people today I am 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:45.270
 making a video is to clarify is a 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:48.540
 problem that this camera she is sj 4 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:52.410
 thousand for a problem that is as follows 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:56.730
 she comes with cable alone the psb and she has 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:01.260
 a usb input here only the video is 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:05.720
 do not let go of hitting so much 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:09.840
 here is find out the following our friends 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:13.130
 manufacturers wire white boy in white 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.780
 usb path and video output 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.830
 theoretically black should be 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.090
 negative 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:25.800
 Only it's not color blind to kick it here. 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:28.400
 It is green because it has red 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.400
 White 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.150
 so stay in the green 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:40.860
 and this is the negative I already got 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:44.610
 quite a singer set up is not the control 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:48.150
 head is such a long time 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.200
 to make the one who lives have no 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:57.990
 camera 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:02:02.150
 for example imagine a mihic glasses is a 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.150
 5 ghz zircon transmitter 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:10.649
 It's time to call if it was you. 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.340
 this camera output video or you go 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.310
 have to connect black in green and white and 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.140
 transmitter yellow 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.010
 Come on, what do you have to do here? 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.629
 low camera 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:27.599
 you will call it sent the tip or will 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:29.879
 I do not know if it's going to focus but I'm going 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:34.859
 follow up will give you another touch 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:35.870
 in a mold plus a touch he 's in 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:41.209
 menu 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:43.849
 what else a touch there you will click 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:49.459
 here on the sides carry the cursor 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:56.690
 Zinho there, there's going to be an option TV 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:03:00.500
 outs tv today you click ok on useful tv 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:05.569
 there you go for the seventh and put on 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:07.370
 What's next, she's going to erase the erase. 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:12.440
 It's because she's leaving now. 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:15.349
 video out that mini usb of her that 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.940
 They'll do a test, and I'll play the video. 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:22.450
 she's on her way back here 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:24.799
 transmitter ok 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.400
 I do not know if you can see the valley. 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.400
 to the camera 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.510
 The gang is a tip that I'm going. 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.069
 for you guys because this camera here she 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.849
 comes 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:44.359
 It's with this movie and wrong liquor or 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:46.310
 perhaps the standards where they became 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:48.620
 different or maybe it's another option 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.220
 but it only works this way 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:55.609
 if you take the video output from it to 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.230
 seeing is white would be positive and the 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:00.769
 Blue whiting is the negative 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.480
 It's good, people , it's the next when 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:05.150
 You turn it off and on again. 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.030
 leave the option also the last then there 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:12.260
 You have to put the option again in the 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:15.379
 Time you fly to see you is the 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:20.560
 image that I'm going to hang up 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:20.560
 bug here but I do not know until out of breath 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:29.690
 so this camera is js sj 4 mil then 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.210
 she has this detail I picked up a little 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.800
 to discover aurÃ¡ 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.389
 It's easier for you, it's good there. 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.370
 and not as a contact of these 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:41.800

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.449
 there goes from the street above to see if that 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.290
 business I did there to see if it goes 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.720
 to function 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.990
 A hug to everyone who liked the 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:53.020
