 their perceptual ability to withdraw the object 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:26.859
 resumes in a new guise 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.129
 some aspects of the classic pigeon are fun 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:34.659
 before starting the game with core prepare the dividend box 

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:39.070
 bricks depending on the color and yet I am building core in Ligurian vado 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.350
 have 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.810
 the 7 special icons 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.750
 on the six faces of you 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.700
 after say the younger player starts the game by throwing limbo dice

 that at the end of the game gets the highest score 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.280
 to play believe in giving as well as in lego bricks and the dice 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.970
 special cards 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.880
 growth papers of only intra-category uniforms 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.880
 basic cards with a single question mark 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.270
 advanced cards with two question marks and expert cards 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.060
 with 3 question marks 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.450
 in each card 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.740
 are shown 4 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.270
 construction 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.380
 one that represents elements of nature 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.500
 one vehicle 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.320
 buildings and objects 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.030
 in giving us up 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.060
 buildings 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.690
 vehicles 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.700
 objects 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.770
 hey elements of nature 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.080
 then there are two special faces 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.290
 a joker face is a sparse face 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.380
 your turn to play the player throws dice 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.790
 and executes the construction 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.800
 present on the facade 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.090
 obtained if for example throwing the nut I get the red face with the buildings 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.790
 I draw a card 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.389
 and I have to proceed to build the building is depicted on the paper 

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:14.779
 if I keep my face to that question mark I can choose which one 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:17.149
 of the 4 categories creates 

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:21.269
 if instead I await the face with the symbol for two the doubling will be 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.099
 player to my left to ascend which of the categories I will have to create 

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:28.989
 in that case, however, the points obtained will be double 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.779
 who can give can be played in four modes 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:34.479
 in the first mode 

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:37.839
 the turn player builds and spins seven other players 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.009
 they will have to guess its construction 

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:45.439
 the first succeed in guessing being able to own. and in the same way the player I am 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:47.589
 building to be able to make a point 

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:51.739
 the game ends when all players have executed once 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:52.640
 construction 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.699
 the player with the most points will be the winner 

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:57.409
 in the second mode 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.799
 one player builds air up to 4 players guess the player of 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.229
 turn rolls the die and the category is determined 

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:06.689
 all players 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:10.150
 they will take a card and perform a construction of that 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.069
 category them the players of turn will have to try to guess in the time 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.629
 set the maximum number of buildings you guess will receive two 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:18.600
 points him 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.689
 and two points the player who is performing the construction 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:24.909
 the game ends when all the players have had the opportunity to 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:27.789
 guess wins the player with the most points 

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:32.939
 in the third mode a group game the players share a square 2 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:34.869
 to 4 players 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:39.919
 the player of turn to launch from all a player of each team takes one 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:44.399
 paper and proceeds to build the depicted category 

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:48.609
 from the given the other players of the team must try to guess the 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:52.379
 as quickly as possible, their companion is building 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.639
 the first team to guess wins the point 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:59.189
 the game ends when all players have had the chance to 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:03.079
 pull the given book once and will obviously win the team that 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.819
 reached the highest number of points 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.720
 in mode 4 called collaborative game all players play 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:10.269
 together trying 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.689
 in a fixed time to try to guess as many as possible 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:15.319
 of buildings 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:17.500
 the turn player rolls the die 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.799
 draw a card 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.410
 You need to build a model of the category indicated by the dice 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.270
 all other players must try to guess 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.600
 once the model is guessed, the next player passes the dice 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:31.900
 will launch and cost will build a model 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.169
 at the end of time you will look at how many points we managed to total 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.180
 krya dine like all the games of the line the holes themselves lends itself to 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.199
 numerous variants 3 are already proposed by regulation present in the box 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:49.210
 in the first variant from the name use your imagination the players will not be 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.150
 more limited than their creations to the models represented on the cards 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.029
 in fact when the result is the die 

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:00.949
 pantyhose question marks face with question mark the player 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:02.010
 can choose 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.450
 an object of your choice to build will write me on the sheet and proceed 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.029
 the creation 

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:12.699
 the second variant is called the construction challenge, it is necessary to replace the oi 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:16.270
 doubling brick with question mark brick with a brick 

00:05:16.269 --> 00:05:17.550
 smooth milano 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.460
 when the die is rolled, the black smooth brick is the player 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.580
 will have to perform his 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:23.699
 construction 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:28.199
 in a more difficult way, for example using only one hand or eyes 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:32.430
 closed going to catch the bricks without being able to look at them or can 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.490
 be limited in its construction by using bricks of one 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.039
 color I finally 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.639
 will have to choose 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.120
 one of the most difficult cards 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.860
 in the third variant 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.009
 game the game can become longer shorter and more difficult for example 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:52.449
 you can decide to finish the game after a shorter time 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:57.110
 or it is the goal to set a higher or lower final score ho 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.440
 finally you can decide to assert 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.550
 different scoring cards such as basic cards 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.430
 could be worth only one point 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.689
 advanced cards two points and expert cards three points 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:13.919
 create scenes is certainly among the games of the lego line prince to what 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:17.639
 best exploits the potential of the lego brick while approving the 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:20.490
 your imagination and your ability to build 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:21.689
 axillary cry 

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:26.269
 is a game for two 8 players starting at 7 and playing a tough game 

00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:27.639
