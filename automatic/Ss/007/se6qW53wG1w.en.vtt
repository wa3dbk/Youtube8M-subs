00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:10.290
 Hello everyone, I owe it time to slowly 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.830
 starts doing makeup and will be logical 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.920
 if i show you my daily 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:19.140
 at the moment makeup in terms of care i 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.630
 now I use few products therefore 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.680
 First of all I apply ordinary aloe gel 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.590
 faith from mickey formulas and then put on 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.070
 its be my at the moment anal he 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.030
 was for 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.250
 healthy mix shades 52 as you can 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.190
 notice up come in so little yellow 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.829
 on my skin therefore of course more 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.610
 suitable for tanned or for 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.039
 could by nature skin but honestly say 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.719
 I do not care that a little bit darkish us 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.360
 not like he doesn't like him very much 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.699
 perfectly shaded looks very 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.480
 does not naturally emphasize peeling 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.190
 but unfortunately it is not very resistant 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.730
 as a concealer, I will use 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.489
 for the benefit of fighting on the ground boots 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.130
 color he left me in the set i caught 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.860
 get t plus and i really liked it 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.080
 because it is under the eyes and looks to 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.810
 am it does not roll down enough 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.670
 pigmented and also looks good 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.670
 on some kind of imperfection 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.289
 I apply concealer as follows 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.479
 first with a finger distributing 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:30.270
 its completely under the eye because you 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.569
 as if in mitino dark circles on also 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.090
 I put it on the inner corner and on the outer 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:38.610
 corner where most people also 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.399
 there are some wigs and dullness 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.250
 from lack of sleep further with a little 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.770
 flat synthetic brush in this 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.350
 In case of this brush 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.869
 working through the area under the eyelashes and beyond 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.819
 turning the case vibro I highlight everything 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.950
 the remaining hollows of which I have 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:57.439
 little so go to the next 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.689
 step 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:03.360
 then I fix it with the help of powder on 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.829
 corporal hd which to me basically 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.379
 like she very finely ground 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.479
 mattes well 

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:12.329
 aligns tone but for the same money you can 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.250
 buy being a deduction which will 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:17.069
 a little cheaper and that in size 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.900
 much more almost twice here 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.110
 on kotsareva and 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.630
 about white residual marks from 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.510
 flashes i'm so behind this powder not 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.670
 noticed i want to sleep think how much 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.120
 and bring so she gave such here 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.190
 white traces of eyebrow code your eyebrows i 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.700
 always doing with a pencil 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.739
 vortex gray brown shades and 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.440
 begin drawing delicate boundaries 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:47.099
 which people have wider eyebrows because 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:50.910
 that the wider the eyebrows the younger you look 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:53.299
 our face and also I align my 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.209
 request for color 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:59.459
 fill the gap and move the accent on 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.919
 intensity on the rise is also a little bit 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.099
 feathering the brow inward so 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:07.049
 how terribly i dislike when brow 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.889
 it starts very clearly look like 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.889
 unnaturally 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:17.020
 Now I will take care of my eyes a little 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:20.360
 I will highlight under the eyebrow and the inner corner 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.750
 eye with the help of the frame will not 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.150
 dropsy case 26 decisions of creatures in general 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.310
 made the most ordinary highlight eyes and 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.270
 now i will draw arrows when 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.400
 shadow help 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:35.410

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:38.410
 black matte shadow archive chris palettes 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.410
 respect 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.080
 and with the help of such stroking 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.870
 killing movements near the ciliary edge 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.180
 I put this shadow on the main course 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.330
 the secret is this tassel it should be 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.130
 very flat and elastic that is not 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.470
 fluff this way you 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:04.090
 It turns out such two pens 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.920
 natural arrows yes and if you 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.739
 new to my channel first 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.530
 of course welcome to the second 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:16.200
 if you are interested in what kind of cyst and 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:19.780
 so is all the same vox in 2521 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.890
 I always use it to work for 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.600
 works in pencil technique and makeup artist 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:28.060
 Now is the time to make up the eyelashes. I will 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.419
 use mascara lancome hypnosis 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.990
 drama is a mascara perfectly lengthens the cilia 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:36.990
 but I note that my nature is not 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.880
 bad enough eyelashes therefore 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.970
 maybe it will not suit you by the way 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.310
 I record this video in the fall so 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.530
 some products have changed a bit 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.390

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.030
 Left all keep going to apply 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:55.660
 a pencil from and how perfect aiz was 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.930

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.729
 mother of pearl pencil and so with the eyes 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.979

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.510
 in the winter, I prefer carl x or 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:48.789
