00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.349
 hello today talk about how 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.300
 smoke and cold smoked products 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.460
 for this we will use 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.139
 pre-prepared products and 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.460
 smokehouse system 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.490
 good because it can be used 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.169
 anyone in your home can also 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.349
 answer that this is Russian 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:24.349
 development 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.210
 the system is easy to assemble 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.740
 unpretentious service now we 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.650
 let's see how and what can be on it 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.660
 probably cook one of the most 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.940
 important stages is salting and 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.980
 preparation of the product is precisely from this 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.970
 depends largely on the taste for the final product 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.260
 for this we settled the fish we chicken 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.989
 to speed up the smoking process 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.970
 Broth pre kupaty 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:59.949
 use cheese and bought in the store qi 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.100
 the products we have prepared now 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.830
 we will run the smokehouse system 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.170
 the system consists of a camera smoke generator 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.200
 for products with a thermometer and 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.350
 suspect camera middle smoke generator 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.350
 corrugated pipe second secret smoked 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:21.000
 is a cap we will be with you 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.000
 use alder chips for smoking 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.759
 the system rides have a bunker for chips one 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:30.009
 chipboard 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:33.009
 enough for a day of continuous smoking 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:35.640
 if you want to smoke the longer days 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.420
 used in addition evening bunker 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.729
 smoke yoga system 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.619
 has a powerful chip feeder you 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.600
 can use wood chips of any fraction and 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:47.380
 make sure your process isn't 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.319
 will have and will be constantly falling asleep 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.100
 prepared cheek 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:53.100
 smoke generator bunker 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.640
 the process of cold smoking is long 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.650
 the process therefore yoga smoke systems 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.390
 fully automated and does not require 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.970
 your ongoing monitoring 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:13.020
 you just need to put the product 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.490
 turn on the smoke generator and remove 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.120
 product after smoking 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.660
 we are ready for smoking therefore 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.580
 including her system 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.490
 the system is very quiet indication 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.360
 light lamp after 15 minutes system 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.360
 will enter the operating mode 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.200
 the first smoke came out the camera goes to 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.950
 working mode and we will prepare 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.970
 products to bookmark the camera 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.970
 lay out cheese grates 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.430
 next to spread or another part of the fish is 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.920
 the lattice we will place at the very top 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.810
 camera parts 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.560
 further laid on the middle lattice 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.560
 Kopatych 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.290
 fish is laid 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.030
 the fish we put the bottom 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.210
 cameras so that the jab with her does not drip on 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.990
 the remaining products and the last 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:32.420
 lattice putting chicken chamber with us 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:36.170
 went to work now we need 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.410
 set the required temperature for 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.830
 we use this heater 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:49.010
 set the value inside the camera 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:50.900
 range from 20 to 25 degrees so 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.270
 the temperature will be kept in the chamber in 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:57.950
 auto mode all over 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:04:00.160
 smoking and the current temperature 25 9 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.160
 degrees 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.390
 I am such 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.220
 smoking is a long process though 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.310
 the resulting products are different 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.150
 its exquisite taste that will appreciate 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.150
 real gourmet 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.870
 we put our products in the camera 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.060
 our temperature is optimal for 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.580
 cold smoked is about 20 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.100
 degrees products we leave in the chamber 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.550
 for a day we will see the result of smoking with 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.550
 by you tomorrow 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:56.520
 so after 24 hours we return to 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.530
 our smokehouse rides over night 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.480
 the temperature dropped to minus 15 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.240
 degrees on the street now we'll see 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.490
 how did the temperature in the chamber change 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:09.180
 how much chips are left and how many are called 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.280
 ash pits as you can see the halls in 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.360
 Zolnikov almost no any 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.360
 pass punishes completely 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.580
 open the bunker you can make sure 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.330
 that the chips in the bunker are still about 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.330
 per hour of work 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.850
 thanks to the heater, we see that 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.000
 the temperature in the chamber kept up all night 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.590
 on the levels we need 20 degrees what 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.160
 ensured us stable and cold 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.380
 smoking 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.280
 and here we come to the most responsible 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.230
 moment 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.070
 now we will open the camera and 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.070
 get food 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.040
 We get up our delicacy 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:38.340
 her smoking system is great 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:41.100
 coped with the task we twisted 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.230
 fish chicken kupaty cheese fillet 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.310
 fish 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:48.930
 it remains only to set the table and 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:50.340
 enjoy the exquisite taste of the dishes you 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:53.040
 you can see what we did 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:55.160
 the result of smoking looks very 

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.160
 appetizing
