a<00:01:32.250> little<00:01:32.460> bit<00:01:32.579> wider<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.030> we've<00:01:33.600> got<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.900> RZ

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
a little bit wider and we've got the RZ

we wanted to open up that flow more to

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.440 
we wanted to open up that flow more to
the<00:01:38.159> radiator<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:38.850> we're<00:01:39.000> getting<00:01:39.119> as<00:01:39.299> much

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
the radiator so we're getting as much

top<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.500> our<00:01:49.619> trail<00:01:49.890> grill<00:01:50.100> set<00:01:50.399> and

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
top this is our trail grill set and

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.800 
top this is our trail grill set and
you'll<00:01:50.729> notice<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.240> trail<00:01:51.420> grill<00:01:51.630> has<00:01:51.780> a

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
you'll notice that the trail grill has a

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.749 
you'll notice that the trail grill has a
smaller<00:01:52.170> pattern<00:01:52.590> on<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.799> top<00:01:52.979> we<00:01:53.430> do<00:01:53.579> have

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
smaller pattern on the top we do have

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.429 
smaller pattern on the top we do have
these<00:01:53.939> available<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.630> sand<00:01:54.869> as<00:01:55.020> well<00:01:55.170> so

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
these available in the sand as well so

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.139 
these available in the sand as well so
we<00:01:55.530> can<00:01:55.680> open<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:55.950> up<00:01:56.189> create<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.670> flow<00:01:56.909> so

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
we can open that up create the flow so

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.209 
we can open that up create the flow so
again<00:01:57.420> keeping<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.960> positive<00:01:58.770> airflow

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
again keeping that positive airflow

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.490 
again keeping that positive airflow
coming<00:01:59.430> in<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.030> through<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:01.049> top<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.290> the

coming in and through the top of the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.899 
coming in and through the top of the
machine<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:01.950> we're<00:02:02.070> not<00:02:02.130> building<00:02:02.399> and

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
machine so we're not building and

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.520 
machine so we're not building and
cavitating<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.570> heat<00:02:03.780> on<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.020> underside<00:02:04.500> of

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
cavitating that heat on the underside of

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.530 
cavitating that heat on the underside of
the<00:02:04.680> hood<00:02:04.799> itself<00:02:05.189> also<00:02:05.670> Blake<00:02:06.119> what<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.390> can

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
the hood itself also Blake what you can

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.180 
the hood itself also Blake what you can
see<00:02:06.719> right<00:02:06.899> above<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.469> trail<00:02:07.680> grill<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.069> our

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
see right above the trail grill is our

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.010 
see right above the trail grill is our
windshield<00:02:08.580> stiffener<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.239> we<00:02:09.390> run<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.720> pure

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
windshield stiffener and we run the pure

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.900 
windshield stiffener and we run the pure
polaris<00:02:10.200> half<00:02:10.619> windshield<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.610> what<00:02:11.790> this

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
polaris half windshield and what this

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.430 
polaris half windshield and what this
allows<00:02:11.970> us<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.629> do<00:02:12.810> is<00:02:12.840> actually

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
allows us to do is actually

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.920 
allows us to do is actually
raised<00:02:13.770> this<00:02:14.280> windshield<00:02:14.580> up<00:02:14.940> or<00:02:15.330> lower<00:02:15.690> it

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
raised this windshield up or lower it

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.450 
raised this windshield up or lower it
down<00:02:15.960> keeping<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.680> windshield<00:02:17.100> free<00:02:17.340> of

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
down keeping the windshield free of

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.920 
down keeping the windshield free of
vibration<00:02:17.970> because<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.390> stiffness<00:02:18.810> of

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
vibration because of the stiffness of

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.630 
vibration because of the stiffness of
the<00:02:18.990> brakes<00:02:19.260> but<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:20.010> also<00:02:20.130> creates<00:02:20.550> a

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
the brakes but it also creates a

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.240 
the brakes but it also creates a
positive<00:02:20.850> flow<00:02:21.360> of<00:02:21.510> air<00:02:21.750> through<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.260> cab<00:02:22.680> so

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
positive flow of air through the cab so

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.770 
positive flow of air through the cab so
we're<00:02:23.400> not<00:02:23.490> seeing<00:02:23.760> that<00:02:23.940> sand<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.480> that<00:02:24.510> dust

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
we're not seeing that sand and that dust

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.870 
we're not seeing that sand and that dust
cavitate<00:02:25.380> inside<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:26.010> machine<00:02:26.310> itself<00:02:26.430> where

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
cavitate inside the machine itself where

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.880 
cavitate inside the machine itself where
we<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.270> riders<00:02:27.570> are<00:02:27.750> sucking<00:02:28.470> it<00:02:28.590> up<00:02:28.680> and

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
we the riders are sucking it up and

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.140 
we the riders are sucking it up and
eaten<00:02:29.070> it<00:02:29.160> up<00:02:29.250> in<00:02:29.370> our<00:02:29.490> mouths<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.850> our<00:02:29.940> noses

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
eaten it up in our mouths and our noses

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.910 
eaten it up in our mouths and our noses

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
climb on our net to arch so it gives us

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.310 
climb on our net to arch so it gives us
