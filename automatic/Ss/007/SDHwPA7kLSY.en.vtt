right but I did have skill train which
really<00:00:41.040> hurts<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.430> parry<00:00:41.640> samurais<00:00:42.030> because

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
really hurts to parry samurais because

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.940 
really hurts to parry samurais because
their<00:00:42.780> main<00:00:42.930> theme<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.710> they're<00:00:43.829> trying

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
their main theme is that they're trying

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.770 
their main theme is that they're trying
to<00:00:44.070> get<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.370> fence<00:00:44.550> mode<00:00:44.760> raise<00:00:45.570> their

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
to get to the fence mode raise their

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.240 
to get to the fence mode raise their
defense<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.379> they<00:00:46.680> can<00:00:46.860> attack<00:00:47.039> while

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
defense and they can attack while

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.290 
defense and they can attack while
they're<00:00:47.370> in<00:00:47.430> defense<00:00:47.670> mode<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.000> then<00:00:48.210> they

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
they're in defense mode so then they

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.000 
they're in defense mode so then they
just<00:00:48.480> run<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.870> over<00:00:48.899> like<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.289> freaking<00:00:49.680> train

the<00:01:30.930> back<00:01:31.079> road<00:01:31.290> cards<00:01:31.619> as<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.799> was<00:01:32.009> wondering

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
the back road cards as I was wondering

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.069 
the back road cards as I was wondering
what<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.090> could<00:01:33.240> be<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.630> it's<00:01:33.840> called<00:01:33.990> a

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
what it could be and it's called a

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.300 
what it could be and it's called a
hunted<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.890> guess<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.159> was<00:01:35.280> pretty

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
hunted on that so I guess I was pretty

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.280 
hunted on that so I guess I was pretty
good<00:01:35.520> be<00:01:35.939> able<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.600> get<00:01:36.720> rid<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.079> that

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
good be able to to get rid of that that

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.399 
good be able to to get rid of that that
could<00:01:37.409> be<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> problem<00:01:37.619> later<00:01:37.920> on<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:39.409> let's

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
could be a problem later on and let's

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.310 
could be a problem later on and let's
see<00:01:40.740> uh<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.909> go<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.540> ahead<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.780> finally<00:01:43.170> get<00:01:43.259> a

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
see uh I go on ahead I finally get a

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.170 
see uh I go on ahead I finally get a
monster<00:01:43.740> on<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:44.009> get<00:01:44.189> mask<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.759> million<00:01:44.970> some

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
monster on this get mask a million some

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.060 
monster on this get mask a million some
thinking<00:01:45.479> let's<00:01:45.689> go<00:01:45.810> ahead<00:01:46.110> stroy<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.649> fill<00:01:46.860> I

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
thinking let's go ahead stroy the fill I

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.770 
thinking let's go ahead stroy the fill I
can<00:01:47.220> actually<00:01:47.310> do<00:01:47.520> some<00:01:47.670> damage<00:01:47.880> even<00:01:48.689> though

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
can actually do some damage even though

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.300 
can actually do some damage even though
I<00:01:48.810> can't<00:01:49.020> activate<00:01:49.229> mess<00:01:49.409> chameleons<00:01:49.799> effect

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
I can't activate mess chameleons effect

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.639 
I can't activate mess chameleons effect
I<00:01:50.520> will<00:01:51.000> have<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.180> Tuner<00:01:51.420> monster<00:01:51.509> for<00:01:52.079> later<00:01:52.470> on

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
I will have a Tuner monster for later on

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.870 
I will have a Tuner monster for later on
in<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.950> duel<00:01:53.100> like<00:01:53.310> next<00:01:53.549> turn<00:01:53.700> or<00:01:53.850> something

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
in the duel like next turn or something

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.399 
in the duel like next turn or something
I<00:01:54.210> was<00:01:54.299> figuring<00:01:54.720> maybe<00:01:54.869> if<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.110> can<00:01:55.259> draw

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
I was figuring maybe if I can draw

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.410 
I was figuring maybe if I can draw
another<00:01:55.590> yang<00:01:56.070> seeing<00:01:56.369> or<00:01:56.790> something<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.270> can

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
another yang seeing or something I can

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.700 
another yang seeing or something I can
then<00:01:57.509> use<00:01:57.689> as<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.869> Tuner<00:01:58.170> monster<00:01:58.229> at<00:01:58.530> least

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
then use as a Tuner monster at least

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.899 
then use as a Tuner monster at least
even<00:01:59.009> though<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.100> can't<00:01:59.340> use<00:01:59.460> its<00:01:59.610> actual

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
even though I can't use its actual

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.890 
even though I can't use its actual
effect<00:02:00.420> as<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.780> skill<00:02:01.079> drain

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
effect as a skill drain

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.630 
effect as a skill drain
so<00:02:02.470> you<00:02:02.560> see<00:02:02.710> I<00:02:02.740> do<00:02:02.920> get<00:02:03.100> another<00:02:03.310> gang<00:02:03.490> xing

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
so you see I do get another gang xing

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.730 
so you see I do get another gang xing
card<00:02:03.910> but<00:02:04.150> still<00:02:04.690> not<00:02:05.170> really<00:02:05.320> sure<00:02:05.440> if<00:02:05.590> I

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
card but still not really sure if I

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.050 
card but still not really sure if I
should<00:02:05.770> go<00:02:05.980> for<00:02:06.190> that<00:02:06.220> or<00:02:06.580> wait<00:02:06.730> for<00:02:06.790> a<00:02:06.940> few

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
should go for that or wait for a few

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.300 
should go for that or wait for a few
more<00:02:07.180> monsters<00:02:07.330> and<00:02:07.750> try<00:02:07.840> to<00:02:07.900> go<00:02:08.050> for<00:02:08.320> a<00:02:08.530> bigger

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
more monsters and try to go for a bigger

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.360 
more monsters and try to go for a bigger
monster<00:02:09.580> on<00:02:09.910> that<00:02:10.119> so<00:02:10.930> as<00:02:10.990> you<00:02:11.050> can<00:02:11.290> see<00:02:11.650> he

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
monster on that so as you can see he

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.920 
monster on that so as you can see he
keeps<00:02:12.850> bringing<00:02:13.060> out<00:02:13.270> he's<00:02:13.420> trying<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:13.690> get<00:02:13.780> it

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
keeps bringing out he's trying to get it

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.740 
keeps bringing out he's trying to get it
basically<00:02:14.380> to<00:02:14.830> get<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.070> boss<00:02:15.750> super-heavy

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
basically to get the boss super-heavy

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.740 
basically to get the boss super-heavy
samurai<00:02:17.020> to<00:02:17.290> defense<00:02:18.250> mode<00:02:18.340> which<00:02:19.300> makes<00:02:19.660> a

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
samurai to defense mode which makes a

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.940 
samurai to defense mode which makes a
lot<00:02:19.900> harder<00:02:20.020> because<00:02:20.230> when<00:02:20.470> you<00:02:20.560> normal

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
lot harder because when you normal

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.500 
lot harder because when you normal
summon<00:02:21.250> it<00:02:21.340> it<00:02:21.490> goes<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:21.850> the<00:02:21.880> fence<00:02:22.150> but<00:02:22.420> the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
summon it it goes to the fence but the

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.830 
summon it it goes to the fence but the
skill<00:02:22.720> drain<00:02:22.930> not<00:02:23.350> so<00:02:23.530> much<00:02:24.270> anyway<00:02:25.270> it's<00:02:25.750> a

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
skill drain not so much anyway it's a

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.660 
skill drain not so much anyway it's a
bit<00:02:25.990> of<00:02:26.080> a<00:02:26.140> stomach<00:02:26.350> which<00:02:26.680> makes<00:02:27.100> this<00:02:27.280> replay

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
bit of a stomach which makes this replay

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.160 
bit of a stomach which makes this replay
out<00:02:27.820> a<00:02:27.850> little<00:02:28.120> bit<00:02:28.330> better<00:02:28.570> on<00:02:28.660> this<00:02:28.900> kind<00:02:29.050> of

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
out a little bit better on this kind of

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.440 
out a little bit better on this kind of
stuff<00:02:29.380> and<00:02:29.620> I<00:02:29.760> was<00:02:30.760> thinking<00:02:30.850> the<00:02:31.180> replay

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
stuff and I was thinking the replay

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.180 
stuff and I was thinking the replay
feature<00:02:31.630> might<00:02:31.840> be<00:02:31.900> a<00:02:31.960> good<00:02:32.140> way<00:02:32.560> to<00:02:32.710> test<00:02:33.010> it

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
feature might be a good way to test it

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.310 
feature might be a good way to test it
for<00:02:33.310> this<00:02:33.430> duel<00:02:33.670> again<00:02:34.660> of<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.840> eng<00:02:34.959> seng<00:02:35.200> I

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
for this duel again of the eng seng I

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.540 
for this duel again of the eng seng I
was<00:02:35.440> gonna<00:02:35.530> open<00:02:35.709> for<00:02:35.770> another<00:02:36.010> high<00:02:36.220> level

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
was gonna open for another high level

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.640 
was gonna open for another high level
once<00:02:36.730> I<00:02:36.850> go<00:02:37.030> for<00:02:37.300> a<00:02:37.510> bigger<00:02:37.990> monster<00:02:38.290> by<00:02:38.530> go

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
once I go for a bigger monster by go

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.949 
once I go for a bigger monster by go
ahead<00:02:38.770> and<00:02:38.860> go<00:02:38.920> for<00:02:39.070> Couture<00:02:39.310> because<00:02:39.910> I<00:02:40.150> was

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
ahead and go for Couture because I was

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.000 
ahead and go for Couture because I was
just<00:02:41.050> thinking<00:02:41.320> that<00:02:41.380> would<00:02:41.530> be<00:02:41.590> you<00:02:41.920> know

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
just thinking that would be you know

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.530 
just thinking that would be you know
something<00:02:42.340> with<00:02:42.459> damage<00:02:42.910> even<00:02:43.360> though<00:02:43.450> it

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
something with damage even though it

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.760 
something with damage even though it
doesn't<00:02:43.690> get<00:02:43.840> into<00:02:44.020> fact<00:02:44.290> it's<00:02:44.440> still<00:02:44.590> nice<00:02:44.740> to

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
doesn't get into fact it's still nice to

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.690 
doesn't get into fact it's still nice to
have<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.640> 2200<00:02:46.570> attack<00:02:46.660> for<00:02:47.650> that<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:48.610> I

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
have the the 2200 attack for that and I

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.250 
have the the 2200 attack for that and I
still<00:02:48.760> can't<00:02:49.030> get<00:02:49.180> past<00:02:49.420> read<00:02:49.630> off<00:02:49.750> sick<00:02:49.959> or<00:02:50.080> so

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
still can't get past read off sick or so

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.040 
still can't get past read off sick or so
so<00:02:50.440> that's<00:02:50.590> kind<00:02:51.100> of<00:02:51.190> a<00:02:51.310> problem<00:02:51.490> for<00:02:51.850> that

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
so that's kind of a problem for that

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.150 
so that's kind of a problem for that
also<00:02:53.050> it's<00:02:53.260> kind<00:02:53.440> of<00:02:53.470> double<00:02:53.680> edged<00:02:53.770> sword<00:02:53.800> to

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
also it's kind of double edged sword to

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.400 
also it's kind of double edged sword to
a<00:02:54.190> skill<00:02:54.459> drain<00:02:54.640> because<00:02:54.850> yeah<00:02:55.420> redox<00:02:55.959> with

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
a skill drain because yeah redox with

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.630 
a skill drain because yeah redox with
skilled<00:02:56.620> ring<00:02:56.770> on<00:02:56.890> it<00:02:57.040> means<00:02:57.220> it<00:02:57.370> doesn't<00:02:57.490> go

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
skilled ring on it means it doesn't go

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.100 
skilled ring on it means it doesn't go
back<00:02:57.790> to<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.000> hand<00:02:58.209> so<00:02:58.510> that's<00:02:58.690> actually

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
back to the hand so that's actually

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.230 
back to the hand so that's actually
really<00:02:59.350> annoying<00:02:59.680> I<00:02:59.950> finally<00:03:00.640> get<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:00.820> muster<00:03:01.209> I

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
really annoying I finally get a muster I

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.940 
really annoying I finally get a muster I
need<00:03:01.600> that<00:03:01.720> I<00:03:01.810> get<00:03:02.170> a<00:03:02.200> Tuner<00:03:02.530> monster<00:03:02.590> kneel

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
need that I get a Tuner monster kneel

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.949 
need that I get a Tuner monster kneel
for<00:03:03.160> a<00:03:03.190> bigger<00:03:03.400> synchro<00:03:03.760> monster<00:03:04.120> as<00:03:04.240> as<00:03:04.450> I<00:03:04.810> was

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
for a bigger synchro monster as as I was

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.710 
for a bigger synchro monster as as I was
trying<00:03:05.140> to<00:03:05.200> plan<00:03:05.410> to<00:03:05.530> do<00:03:05.680> ah<00:03:05.890> and<00:03:06.519> I<00:03:07.150> even<00:03:07.630> go

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
trying to plan to do ah and I even go

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.449 
trying to plan to do ah and I even go
for<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.110> facedown<00:03:08.260> card<00:03:08.410> just<00:03:09.160> to<00:03:09.250> make<00:03:09.430> sure

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
for the facedown card just to make sure

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.550 
for the facedown card just to make sure
it's<00:03:09.580> not<00:03:09.850> some<00:03:10.060> too<00:03:10.269> problematic<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:10.989> with

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
it's not some too problematic and with

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.560 
it's not some too problematic and with
Leo<00:03:11.800> it<00:03:12.130> is<00:03:12.280> strong<00:03:12.640> enough<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:12.940> go<00:03:13.060> for<00:03:13.269> redox

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
Leo it is strong enough to go for redox

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.250 
Leo it is strong enough to go for redox
so<00:03:13.900> I<00:03:13.930> was<00:03:14.140> happy<00:03:14.290> on<00:03:14.530> that<00:03:14.590> I<00:03:14.920> go<00:03:15.489> ahead<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.940> and

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
so I was happy on that I go ahead to and

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.540 
so I was happy on that I go ahead to and
set<00:03:17.260> bottom<00:03:17.500> us<00:03:17.560> because<00:03:17.830> I<00:03:17.860> knew<00:03:18.190> he<00:03:18.430> would

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
set bottom us because I knew he would

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.830 
set bottom us because I knew he would
end<00:03:18.700> up<00:03:18.820> Chris<00:03:19.030> bring<00:03:19.180> it<00:03:19.269> back<00:03:19.450> so<00:03:19.660> that's

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
end up Chris bring it back so that's

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.300 
end up Chris bring it back so that's
always<00:03:19.959> like<00:03:20.140> let's<00:03:20.380> just<00:03:20.590> get<00:03:20.680> rid<00:03:20.860> of<00:03:20.920> redox

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
always like let's just get rid of redox

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.520 
always like let's just get rid of redox
so<00:03:21.880> it<00:03:21.940> will<00:03:22.180> not<00:03:22.209> be<00:03:22.510> a<00:03:22.540> wall<00:03:22.870> for<00:03:23.140> him<00:03:23.320> anymore

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
so it will not be a wall for him anymore

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.920 
so it will not be a wall for him anymore
for<00:03:23.890> this<00:03:23.980> so<00:03:24.880> go<00:03:25.030> ahead<00:03:25.090> since<00:03:25.390> monster<00:03:25.780> back

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
for this so go ahead since monster back

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.150 
for this so go ahead since monster back
and<00:03:26.110> as<00:03:26.200> you<00:03:26.320> can<00:03:26.440> tell<00:03:26.470> I<00:03:26.590> have<00:03:26.769> more<00:03:26.950> than<00:03:27.130> a

and as you can tell I have more than a

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.640 
and as you can tell I have more than a
things<00:03:27.340> like<00:03:27.459> 100<00:03:27.850> /<00:03:28.120> enough<00:03:28.690> to<00:03:29.019> win<00:03:29.350> the<00:03:29.380> duel

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
things like 100 / enough to win the duel

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.020
