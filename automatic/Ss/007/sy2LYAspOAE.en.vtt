00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.730 
different than just painting to music or
drawing<00:02:01.360> to<00:02:01.630> music<00:02:01.990> but<00:02:02.110> if<00:02:02.259> someone<00:02:02.560> is<00:02:02.649> just

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
drawing to music but if someone is just

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.950 
drawing to music but if someone is just
like<00:02:03.009> painting<00:02:03.580> it<00:02:04.180> just<00:02:04.420> feels<00:02:04.630> like<00:02:04.750> they're

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.180 
like painting it just feels like they're
you<00:02:05.140> know<00:02:05.200> they're<00:02:05.410> on<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:05.560> side<00:02:05.920> they're

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
you know they're on the side they're

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.580 
you know they're on the side they're
just<00:02:06.369> like<00:02:06.550> paintings<00:02:07.090> but<00:02:07.240> vjing<00:02:07.750> it's<00:02:08.410> on

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
just like paintings but vjing it's on

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.229 
just like paintings but vjing it's on
the<00:02:08.679> screen<00:02:08.979> it's<00:02:09.160> on<00:02:09.250> a<00:02:09.280> TV<00:02:09.640> screen<00:02:09.910> and<00:02:10.119> when

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
the screen it's on a TV screen and when

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.180 
the screen it's on a TV screen and when
we<00:02:10.360> see<00:02:10.540> that<00:02:10.570> we<00:02:10.869> instantly<00:02:11.380> connect<00:02:11.950> any

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
we see that we instantly connect any

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.430 
we see that we instantly connect any
sound<00:02:12.580> or<00:02:12.790> noise<00:02:12.970> around<00:02:13.300> us<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:13.870> that<00:02:13.989> visual

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
sound or noise around us to that visual

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.410 
sound or noise around us to that visual
so<00:02:14.950> he<00:02:15.070> is<00:02:15.220> kind<00:02:15.430> of<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:15.880> know<00:02:15.970> it's<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.270> very

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
so he is kind of you know it's a very

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.960 
so he is kind of you know it's a very
strong<00:02:16.750> link<00:02:17.020> between<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:18.190> sound<00:02:18.610> and<00:02:18.850> the

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
strong link between the sound and the

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.630 
strong link between the sound and the
music<00:02:19.120> so<00:02:20.110> what<00:02:20.350> tools<00:02:20.620> do<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:20.950> use<00:02:21.100> to

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
music so what tools do you use to

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.520 
music so what tools do you use to
actually<00:02:21.820> get<00:02:22.300> your<00:02:22.450> work<00:02:22.750> projected<00:02:23.380> onto

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
actually get your work projected onto

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.979
