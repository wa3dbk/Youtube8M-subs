and clear up here and what happens is is

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.080 
and clear up here and what happens is is
as<00:02:14.019> you<00:02:14.200> tighten<00:02:14.410> this<00:02:14.709> up<00:02:14.769> on<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:15.550> bottle

as you tighten this up on to the bottle
everything<00:02:16.840> gets<00:02:17.349> scrunched<00:02:18.310> up<00:02:19.980> so<00:02:20.980> we<00:02:21.160> need

everything gets scrunched up so we need

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.970 
everything gets scrunched up so we need
to<00:02:21.400> start<00:02:21.640> as<00:02:21.879> far<00:02:22.120> down<00:02:22.390> as<00:02:22.739> we<00:02:23.739> want

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.059 
depending on where we want the wrap to
end<00:02:26.380> up<00:02:27.299> so<00:02:28.299> I<00:02:28.330> start<00:02:28.690> pretty<00:02:28.930> low<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.380> since

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
end up so I start pretty low and since

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.460 
end up so I start pretty low and since
mine<00:02:30.310> are<00:02:30.489> designed<00:02:31.019> now<00:02:32.019> we're<00:02:32.200> going<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.349> be

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
mine are designed now we're going to be

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:39.710 
mine are designed now we're going to be
gold<00:02:32.799> in<00:02:33.130> blue<00:02:33.579> on<00:02:33.940> this<00:02:34.420> black<00:02:34.690> bottle<00:02:35.110> today

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.289 

since<00:02:40.720> my<00:02:40.989> bottle<00:02:41.640> wraps<00:02:42.640> are<00:02:42.880> designed<00:02:43.180> to

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
since my bottle wraps are designed to

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.710 
since my bottle wraps are designed to
stay<00:02:43.630> on<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:45.430> just<00:02:45.849> take<00:02:46.030> a<00:02:46.060> little<00:02:46.420> bit<00:02:46.660> of

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
stay on I just take a little bit of

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.910 
stay on I just take a little bit of
electrical<00:02:47.410> tape<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:49.500> we're<00:02:50.500> going<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.650> put

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
electrical tape and we're going to put

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.410 
electrical tape and we're going to put
it<00:02:51.069> just<00:02:51.880> like<00:02:52.060> that<00:02:52.090> and<00:02:54.269> we're<00:02:55.269> going<00:02:55.390> to

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
it just like that and we're going to

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.110 
it just like that and we're going to
start<00:02:55.780> it<00:02:55.959> on<00:02:56.560> this<00:02:56.829> side<00:02:57.190> of<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.989> dowel<00:03:00.120> then

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
start it on this side of the dowel then

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.039 
start it on this side of the dowel then
we're<00:03:01.329> just<00:03:01.480> going<00:03:01.600> to<00:03:01.630> tape<00:03:01.900> it<00:03:02.019> up<00:03:02.139> like<00:03:02.319> that

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
we're just going to tape it up like that

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.559 
we're just going to tape it up like that
okay

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.280 

and<00:03:08.730> we're<00:03:09.730> going<00:03:09.849> to<00:03:09.939> begin<00:03:10.090> to<00:03:10.420> wrap<00:03:10.689> this

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
and we're going to begin to wrap this

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.630 
and we're going to begin to wrap this
now<00:03:11.829> watch<00:03:12.159> your<00:03:12.400> twist<00:03:12.819> on<00:03:13.030> your<00:03:13.120> cord<00:03:13.930> as

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
now watch your twist on your cord as

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.610 
now watch your twist on your cord as
you're<00:03:15.640> wrapping<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:16.090> bottle<00:03:19.200> okay<00:03:20.200> you<00:03:20.260> want

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
you're wrapping the bottle okay you want

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:49.430 
you're wrapping the bottle okay you want
this<00:03:21.329> to<00:03:22.329> be<00:03:22.450> flat

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.350 

okay<00:03:49.980> and<00:03:50.070> again<00:03:50.160> this<00:03:50.400> video<00:03:50.790> will<00:03:51.120> be<00:03:51.330> a

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
okay and again this video will be a

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.000 
okay and again this video will be a
little<00:03:51.480> bit<00:03:51.840> long<00:03:52.050> because<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:52.620> does<00:03:52.770> take<00:03:52.950> a

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
little bit long because it does take a

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:01.400 
little bit long because it does take a
while<00:03:53.130> to<00:03:53.340> do<00:03:53.730> these<00:03:58.700> and<00:03:59.720> I'm<00:04:00.720> starting<00:04:01.230> with

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
while to do these and I'm starting with

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.950 
while to do these and I'm starting with
about<00:04:01.740> 50<00:04:02.520> feet<00:04:03.320> 550<00:04:04.320> paracord<00:04:04.560> I<00:04:05.780> should<00:04:06.780> have

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:06.960 
about 50 feet 550 paracord I should have

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.770 
about 50 feet 550 paracord I should have
some<00:04:07.200> left<00:04:07.410> over<00:04:07.820> normally<00:04:08.820> it's<00:04:08.970> between<00:04:09.240> 40

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
some left over normally it's between 40

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.340 
some left over normally it's between 40
and<00:04:09.810> 45<00:04:10.050> feet<00:04:10.590> but<00:04:11.220> I<00:04:11.250> like<00:04:11.490> to<00:04:11.640> have<00:04:11.760> extra<00:04:12.350> in

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
and 45 feet but I like to have extra in

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.380 
and 45 feet but I like to have extra in
a<00:04:13.530> project<00:04:14.100> like<00:04:14.430> this<00:04:14.550> you<00:04:14.760> don't<00:04:15.060> want<00:04:15.150> to<00:04:15.300> be

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
a project like this you don't want to be

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:31.730 
a project like this you don't want to be
short

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.800 

and<00:04:32.280> then<00:04:32.400> what<00:04:32.580> we'll<00:04:32.760> do<00:04:32.940> with<00:04:33.120> the<00:04:33.240> gold<00:04:33.480> is

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
and then what we'll do with the gold is

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.680 
and then what we'll do with the gold is
we'll<00:04:34.740> wrap<00:04:35.280> it<00:04:35.310> around<00:04:35.550> like<00:04:37.790> this<00:04:38.790> one<00:04:39.060> where

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
we'll wrap it around like this one where

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:51.890 
we'll wrap it around like this one where
the<00:04:39.780> black<00:04:40.020> is

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:58.460 

okay

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.440 

so<00:04:59.040> like<00:04:59.220> I<00:04:59.310> said<00:04:59.370> this<00:04:59.670> video<00:05:00.000> will<00:05:00.240> be<00:05:00.420> a

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
so like I said this video will be a

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.990 
so like I said this video will be a
little<00:05:00.690> bit<00:05:01.020> longer<00:05:01.260> than<00:05:01.560> a<00:05:01.890> normal<00:05:01.980> video<00:05:02.550> I

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
little bit longer than a normal video I

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.720 
little bit longer than a normal video I
may<00:05:03.510> break<00:05:03.750> it<00:05:03.960> into<00:05:04.080> pieces<00:05:04.850> to<00:05:05.850> help<00:05:07.580> not<00:05:08.580> to

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:08.730 
may break it into pieces to help not to

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.390 
may break it into pieces to help not to
overwhelm<00:05:09.150> people<00:05:09.690> I<00:05:09.900> know<00:05:10.830> sometimes

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
overwhelm people I know sometimes

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.020 
overwhelm people I know sometimes
watching<00:05:11.670> long<00:05:12.450> videos<00:05:12.960> is<00:05:13.640> hard<00:05:14.640> it's<00:05:14.910> hard

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
watching long videos is hard it's hard

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.570 
watching long videos is hard it's hard
for<00:05:15.300> me<00:05:15.420> I<00:05:15.630> like<00:05:16.470> to<00:05:16.650> watch<00:05:16.800> them<00:05:17.040> in<00:05:17.100> series

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
for me I like to watch them in series

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.930 
for me I like to watch them in series
and<00:05:18.050> different<00:05:19.050> steps<00:05:19.470> so<00:05:20.430> that<00:05:20.610> I<00:05:20.640> don't<00:05:20.760> have

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
and different steps so that I don't have

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.540 
and different steps so that I don't have
to<00:05:21.150> keep<00:05:21.330> trying<00:05:22.290> to<00:05:22.380> find<00:05:22.770> out<00:05:22.980> where<00:05:23.310> the

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
to keep trying to find out where the

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.120 
to keep trying to find out where the
piece<00:05:23.910> is<00:05:24.180> in<00:05:24.510> the<00:05:24.540> video<00:05:24.930> I<00:05:25.260> can<00:05:25.560> just<00:05:25.950> go<00:05:26.100> to

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
piece is in the video I can just go to

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.420 
piece is in the video I can just go to
that<00:05:26.340> section<00:05:26.910> in<00:05:27.360> the<00:05:27.780> series<00:05:28.260> and<00:05:28.530> I<00:05:29.220> can

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
that section in the series and I can

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:46.230 
that section in the series and I can
start<00:05:29.730> doing<00:05:29.880> that

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:06:02.920 

getting<00:05:47.240> close<00:05:47.450> here

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.410 

all<00:06:03.530> right

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:05.420 
all right

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.170 
all right
and<00:06:05.750> try<00:06:06.710> to<00:06:06.770> keep<00:06:06.980> the<00:06:07.190> rubber<00:06:07.400> band<00:06:07.730> above

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
and try to keep the rubber band above

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.900 
and try to keep the rubber band above
the<00:06:09.170> cord<00:06:09.530> on<00:06:09.800> either<00:06:10.330> side<00:06:12.310> it'll<00:06:13.310> be<00:06:13.730> a<00:06:13.760> lot

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:13.910 
the cord on either side it'll be a lot

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.060 
the cord on either side it'll be a lot
easier<00:06:13.970> to<00:06:14.450> get<00:06:14.660> apart<00:06:14.990> when<00:06:15.740> you're<00:06:15.890> done

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
easier to get apart when you're done

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:23.260 
easier to get apart when you're done
okay<00:06:18.310> I<00:06:20.470> think<00:06:21.470> we're<00:06:21.920> probably<00:06:22.520> going<00:06:23.000> to<00:06:23.090> be

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
okay I think we're probably going to be

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:31.790 
okay I think we're probably going to be
where<00:06:23.720> if<00:06:23.930> we<00:06:24.080> want<00:06:24.320> to<00:06:24.410> be<00:06:28.660> all<00:06:29.660> right

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 
where if we want to be all right

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.070 
where if we want to be all right
now<00:06:32.800> let<00:06:33.129> me<00:06:33.189> go<00:06:33.309> ahead<00:06:33.369> and<00:06:33.520> get<00:06:33.699> this

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
now let me go ahead and get this

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.029 
now let me go ahead and get this
untangled<00:06:35.080> here<00:06:35.849> and<00:06:37.409> we<00:06:38.409> are<00:06:38.559> working<00:06:38.770> with<00:06:38.919> a

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:39.039 
untangled here and we are working with a

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:44.219
