00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
responded and he's out of the event so

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:30.270 
responded and he's out of the event so
it's<00:03:22.070> a<00:03:22.280> whole<00:03:22.490> new<00:03:22.670> ballgame

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
and he's got to be careful that he

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.170

doesn't<00:03:32.900> surrender<00:03:33.560> to<00:03:34.010> lead<00:03:34.190> because<00:03:34.700> Steven

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
Brooke said Kenny Wallace will try and

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.070

so<00:03:40.010> right<00:03:40.370> at<00:03:40.550> the<00:03:40.700> end<00:03:40.910> is<00:03:41.120> about<00:03:41.510> where<00:03:41.780> it

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
so right at the end is about where it

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.570 
so right at the end is about where it
looks<00:03:42.140> like<00:03:42.200> he's<00:03:42.530> going<00:03:42.770> to<00:03:42.830> be<00:03:42.950> mired<00:03:43.190> into

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 
looks like he's going to be mired into

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.520 
looks like he's going to be mired into
heavy<00:03:43.790> traffic<00:03:43.910> and<00:03:44.570> may<00:03:45.200> be<00:03:45.260> their<00:03:45.500> last

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
heavy traffic and may be their last

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:54.120

chance

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.260 

well<00:03:56.250> that<00:03:57.250> may<00:03:57.490> have<00:03:57.640> been<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:57.850> move<00:03:58.210> that

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
well that may have been the move that

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.420 
well that may have been the move that
cost<00:03:58.810> him<00:03:59.050> right<00:03:59.110> there<00:03:59.560> he<00:03:59.680> just<00:03:59.980> lost<00:04:00.220> a
