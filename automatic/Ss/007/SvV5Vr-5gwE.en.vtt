designing the knife not necessary making
it<00:04:17.760> because<00:04:18.090> obviously<00:04:18.269> i'm<00:04:18.510> not<00:04:18.540> using<00:04:19.140> like

the usual materials that normal knives
are<00:04:21.540> made<00:04:21.570> from<00:04:21.930> but<00:04:22.919> just<00:04:23.100> to<00:04:23.160> get<00:04:23.280> an<00:04:23.400> idea

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
are made from but just to get an idea

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.430 
are made from but just to get an idea
how<00:04:23.789> knives<00:04:24.180> are<00:04:24.390> designed<00:04:24.750> and<00:04:25.110> there's<00:04:25.350> a

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
how knives are designed and there's a

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.879 
how knives are designed and there's a
lot<00:04:25.560> of<00:04:25.590> challenges<00:04:25.890> involved<00:04:26.550> in

respect for you now because designing a

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.149 
respect for you now because designing a
knife<00:04:36.999> is<00:04:37.210> actually<00:04:37.509> truly<00:04:37.719> very<00:04:38.529> challenging

00:04:39.149 --> 00:04:39.159 
knife is actually truly very challenging

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:40.709 
knife is actually truly very challenging
at<00:04:39.370> least<00:04:39.490> for<00:04:39.759> me<00:04:39.909> it<00:04:40.120> doesn't<00:04:40.479> really<00:04:40.599> I

00:04:40.709 --> 00:04:40.719 
at least for me it doesn't really I

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:41.909 
at least for me it doesn't really I
guess<00:04:40.900> it<00:04:40.990> doesn't<00:04:41.169> really<00:04:41.199> come<00:04:41.469> naturally

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
guess it doesn't really come naturally

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.850 
guess it doesn't really come naturally
for<00:04:41.949> me<00:04:42.779> for<00:04:43.779> example<00:04:44.139> trying<00:04:44.319> to<00:04:44.409> try<00:04:44.620> to<00:04:44.680> make

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
for me for example trying to try to make

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.800 
for me for example trying to try to make
make<00:04:45.699> this<00:04:45.849> stop<00:04:46.060> him<00:04:46.300> put<00:04:46.479> it<00:04:46.569> in<00:04:46.659> position

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
make this stop him put it in position

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.540 
make this stop him put it in position
where<00:04:47.139> actually<00:04:47.409> stops<00:04:47.650> the<00:04:47.800> blade<00:04:47.979> in<00:04:48.490> the

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
where actually stops the blade in the

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.700 
where actually stops the blade in the
open<00:04:48.999> and<00:04:49.240> stop<00:04:49.960> the<00:04:50.110> blade<00:04:50.289> in<00:04:50.409> the<00:04:50.499> closed

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
open and stop the blade in the closed

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.200 
open and stop the blade in the closed
position<00:04:50.830> was<00:04:51.219> kind<00:04:51.400> of<00:04:51.430> challenge<00:04:51.759> for<00:04:51.879> me<00:04:51.999> I

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
position was kind of challenge for me I

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.239 
position was kind of challenge for me I
also<00:04:52.539> designing<00:04:52.960> a<00:04:53.110> handled<00:04:53.379> i<00:04:53.469> like<00:04:53.740> but<00:04:54.069> also

00:04:54.239 --> 00:04:54.249 
also designing a handled i like but also

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:57.179 
also designing a handled i like but also
encompasses<00:04:54.520> the<00:04:54.969> entire<00:04:55.319> blade<00:04:56.319> and<00:04:56.620> of

00:04:57.179 --> 00:04:57.189 
encompasses the entire blade and of

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:59.010 
encompasses the entire blade and of
course<00:04:57.400> trying<00:04:57.969> to<00:04:58.029> figure<00:04:58.120> out<00:04:58.210> where<00:04:58.479> the

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
course trying to figure out where the

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.559 
course trying to figure out where the
liner<00:04:59.259> lock<00:04:59.500> would<00:05:00.189> meet<00:05:00.610> up<00:05:00.729> with<00:05:00.909> the<00:05:01.090> tang

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:01.569 
liner lock would meet up with the tang

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:04.050 
liner lock would meet up with the tang
of<00:05:01.719> the<00:05:01.810> blade<00:05:02.099> so<00:05:03.099> all<00:05:03.250> that<00:05:03.430> stuff<00:05:03.580> was<00:05:03.849> kind

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
of the blade so all that stuff was kind

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.040 
of the blade so all that stuff was kind
of<00:05:04.150> challenge<00:05:04.449> for<00:05:04.599> me<00:05:04.689> and<00:05:04.930> of<00:05:05.020> course

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
of challenge for me and of course

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.100 
of challenge for me and of course
obviously<00:05:05.409> making<00:05:06.310> the<00:05:06.490> materials<00:05:06.909> to<00:05:07.810> do

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
obviously making the materials to do

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.260 
obviously making the materials to do
this<00:05:08.319> because<00:05:08.529> literally<00:05:09.430> if<00:05:09.939> you<00:05:10.060> talk<00:05:10.210> about

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
this because literally if you talk about

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.209 
this because literally if you talk about
a<00:05:10.389> handmade<00:05:10.779> knife<00:05:10.990> this<00:05:11.259> is<00:05:11.469> completely

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:12.219 
a handmade knife this is completely

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:13.800 
a handmade knife this is completely
handmade<00:05:12.699> this<00:05:13.060> is<00:05:13.180> not<00:05:13.330> very<00:05:13.539> functional

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
handmade this is not very functional

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.320 
handmade this is not very functional
that's<00:05:14.259> all<00:05:14.469> you<00:05:14.710> know<00:05:14.800> everything<00:05:15.340> both
