you a couple tips and where to look I

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.930 
you a couple tips and where to look I
would<00:00:48.019> say<00:00:48.230> a<00:00:48.260> great<00:00:48.680> first<00:00:49.129> place<00:00:49.430> to<00:00:49.670> start

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
would say a great first place to start

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.479 
would say a great first place to start
is<00:00:50.269> to<00:00:50.570> install<00:00:50.870> a<00:00:50.900> vacuum<00:00:51.199> gauge<00:00:51.500> on<00:00:52.040> the

cracks I like to apply a little bit of
pressure<00:02:01.909> with<00:02:02.060> a<00:02:02.920> pry<00:02:03.920> bar<00:02:03.950> and<00:02:04.759> see<00:02:05.719> if<00:02:05.840> they

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
pressure with a pry bar and see if they

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.080 
pressure with a pry bar and see if they
move<00:02:06.229> at<00:02:06.380> all<00:02:06.530> sometimes<00:02:07.039> a<00:02:07.280> crack<00:02:07.819> is<00:02:08.060> a

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
move at all sometimes a crack is a

move at all sometimes a crack is a
little<00:02:08.390> hard<00:02:08.539> to<00:02:08.690> identify<00:02:08.780> visually<00:02:09.740> so<00:02:10.369> take

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
little hard to identify visually so take

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.380 
little hard to identify visually so take
a<00:02:10.610> close<00:02:11.000> look

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
a close look

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.260
