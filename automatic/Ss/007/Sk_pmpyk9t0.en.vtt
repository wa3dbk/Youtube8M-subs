00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.470 

multiplying<00:00:01.230> whole<00:00:01.620> numbers<00:00:01.970> by<00:00:02.970> powers<00:00:03.449> of

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
multiplying whole numbers by powers of

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.550 
multiplying whole numbers by powers of
10<00:00:04.460> were<00:00:05.540> in<00:00:06.540> base<00:00:06.899> 10

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
10 were in base 10

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.820 
10 were in base 10
that's<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:08.040> large<00:00:08.309> number<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:10.110> power<00:00:10.410> is

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
that's the large number and the power is

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.120 
that's the large number and the power is
a<00:00:10.860> small<00:00:11.570> number<00:00:12.740> to<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.920> upper<00:00:14.280> right<00:00:14.549> of<00:00:14.849> 10

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.130 
a small number to the upper right of 10

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.640 
a small number to the upper right of 10
when<00:00:17.130> we<00:00:17.310> do<00:00:17.609> this<00:00:17.820> we<00:00:18.480> add<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.779> amount<00:00:19.439> of

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
when we do this we add the amount of

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.700 
when we do this we add the amount of
zeros<00:00:21.020> that<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.199> equal<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.740> what<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.760> power<00:00:24.000> is

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
zeros that is equal to what the power is

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.740 
zeros that is equal to what the power is
so<00:00:25.710> 10<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.430> 1st<00:00:26.699> times<00:00:27.090> 7<00:00:27.570> we<00:00:27.869> write<00:00:28.080> 7<00:00:28.800> and

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
so 10 to the 1st times 7 we write 7 and

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.700 
so 10 to the 1st times 7 we write 7 and
there<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:30.869> one<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:32.309> power<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:33.210> we<00:00:33.329> add<00:00:33.600> 1<00:00:34.079> 0

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.880 

10<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.950> second<00:00:38.489> times<00:00:38.820> 7<00:00:39.620> means<00:00:40.620> we're

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
10 to the second times 7 means we're

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.840 
10 to the second times 7 means we're
going<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.160> add<00:00:41.390> how<00:00:42.390> many<00:00:42.450> zeros<00:00:43.190> two<00:00:44.190> zeros<00:00:44.640> to

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
going to add how many zeros two zeros to

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.779 
going to add how many zeros two zeros to
7<00:00:47.000> 10<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.329> fourth<00:00:48.690> power<00:00:48.989> times<00:00:49.789> eight

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
7 10 to the fourth power times eight

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.990 
7 10 to the fourth power times eight
first<00:00:51.600> we<00:00:51.809> write<00:00:51.989> down<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.289> eight<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.010> then

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
first we write down the eight and then

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.459 
first we write down the eight and then
how<00:00:54.270> many<00:00:54.570> zeros<00:00:55.640> 4<00:00:56.640> 1<00:00:57.600> 2<00:00:58.199> 3<00:00:58.230> 4<00:01:00.260> 10<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.379> the

fourth<00:01:01.770> power<00:01:02.010> times<00:01:02.129> eight<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:03.049> 80,000<00:01:04.049> and

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
fourth power times eight is 80,000 and

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.429 
fourth power times eight is 80,000 and
what<00:01:05.189> about<00:01:05.369> 10<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.970> fifth<00:01:06.270> power<00:01:07.020> times

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
what about 10 to the fifth power times

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.320 
what about 10 to the fifth power times
nine<00:01:09.049> you<00:01:10.049> write<00:01:10.290> down<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.680> nine<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.340> add

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
nine you write down the nine and add

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.010

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.960 
pigs were domesticated 70 thousand BC
how<00:01:42.990> can<00:01:43.229> we<00:01:43.380> write<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.909> with<00:01:44.909> powers

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
how can we write that with powers

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:55.340 
how can we write that with powers
seven<00:01:48.020> times<00:01:49.759> ten<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.689> one<00:01:53.689> two<00:01:54.689> three
