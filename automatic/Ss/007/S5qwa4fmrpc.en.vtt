00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.520
 good this in this tutorial 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.879
 the theme of let's work the theme of 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:17.490
 care either water or touch if they voted 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:19.830
 with spines you have no problem why 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.620
 depends on air what type of potassium is 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.420
 act soft 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.000
 very finite times the thicknesses of 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.630
 but if you are going to play with a 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.630
 I say 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.070
 let's say the long and take care of it in a way 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.790
 I do not know that it does not break you 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:43.640
 sanding mostly me what I used 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.250
 for sanding they are sandpaper to the water and it says 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.280
 as the paintings have lines by 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:53.000
 example instead of 4 200 that a slight 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.980
 pretty finite average follow if you have 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.320
 to put and reduce a lot using a sandpaper 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.809
 for example of 2 I feel that it is a bit 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.480
 more envelopes also in the case of here this 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.070
 do not choose the 240 that for example I go 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.470
 I'm pretty sanding thumb that 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.020
 I have to leave it long purpose for 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.090
 show this video and when we choose the 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.090
 nail always because we support lightly 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.509
 a surface let's say flat and we do 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.509
 this work 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.710
 always so we hit them transposing 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.540
 down because 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.840
 I answer down here I am 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.840
 respecting 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.359
 when when I tell you that the guitar 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:35.450
 always all you press down 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:37.310
 then this is in the nail to be so 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.990
 fine does not look presided puts on the nail by 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.880
 example so profile in a microscope 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.740
 will see how the pores of the 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.659
 uniã that followed the sandpaper and back 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.939
 let's do this that is not this or this 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.850
 it is so it does not always agree as 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:55.490
 removing her case not 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.759
 to know that after you turn on the side 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.759
 above 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.620
 it is all finite once it is as if 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.780
 out all the nail and then as if 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.940
 you play cutting upside down and you take out all 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.450
 the works of the nail yes but always 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:15.810
 It would be the process as I say 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.319
 well it's not like I'm going and I'm not coming back 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.170
 neither nor always respecting what 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:28.440
 it's going to be good now with a thinner 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:31.680
 a little bit of 1500 that the more you go up 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.200
 the finest number is that of the 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.440
 kilograms that has d 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.930
 of cast 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.629
 Ailén seems a little bit I'm staying 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.239
 relatively more and I have is that the 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.760
 I have very short that of the index 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.800
 let's try to round up a little bit 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.230
 least to not be without fear because 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.610
 the issue but also is it happening 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.349
 when it emits as I said water you 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.480
 always breaks what is usually broken by 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:59.250
 That's the biggest finger because apart 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.140
 of the longest finger in the hand and over there 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.670
 whenever he got something from the 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.519
 first ones that will face and break will 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.590
 be it the nail of the major to be the day more 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.360
 long me for example the one of voiding the 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.860
 He used a little bit longer for the 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.410
 question that I have the ring pretty 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.560
 shorter than the major no other question 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.120
 if they are observed they are not 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.099
 perfectly rounded but they have 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.870
 as a fall back there not for the 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.000
 touch that I have on the guitar the 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.130
 rope enters here and it comes out easier 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.380
 down therefore the same with the thumb 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.519
 the brand I stayed a little bit I'm going to 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.519
 lower the middle of the thumb 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:42.390
 me out there what he also advised the 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.930
 use of enamels because the glazes by 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:48.030
 there of the fabrics fortify certify 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.340
 if it is I hope it happens that leaves it very 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.010
 crystalline does not belong to me as a whole 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:57.600
 coup de union very strong and you left the 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:00.480
 bone nail that is to say and in sound sometimes 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.810
 yes but lose in 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.370
 then to the altar so crystalline more 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.370
 easy to break and I camels and the 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:11.069
 nail that as well is enough we have left 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.819
 porous enough not absorbed more 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.819
 blows and then 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.580
 also all equal the index 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.910
 It would have to be a little more me 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.100
 he broke the other day 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.520
 important that always have rest of 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.470
 nails will not be the limit of having almost 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.370
 nothing that in case it breaks now 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.370
 have to lower not 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:44.930
 If you want to sign above, look how 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:48.199
 make the finger already enters here and low 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:52.400
 and with the angles it's easier when you 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:55.759
 Swiss is like the rope goes through 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.940
 everything goes up the nail and down the other 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:57.940
 side 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.520
 ah 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.320
 There is a little bit of question as I use 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.320
 the wikis and every guitarist has his 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.780
 hands have their daughters have their 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.450
 different care this is a formula 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.850
 special that worked for me and good 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.380
 last if you break some out there just 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.660
 before a concert you always have to 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:30.190
 go to an esthetician who makes you water 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:31.810
 and sculpted and find several videos 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.360
 more say fortunately now makes 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.550
 quite that I do not have to say that 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:41.010
 make my nails sculpted but good 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:45.910
 that is the first tutorial of this new 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:49.360
 video and workshops that can be go 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:51.580
 you can subscribe to the channel 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.159
 or write send mail any little thing 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.030
 Any doubt or suggestion or advice 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:58.169
 yes yes 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.169
 thank you very much
