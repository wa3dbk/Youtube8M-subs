00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.929
 the amount is good I post back 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.599
 How do you exchange this? 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.780
 gear that looks like a bug of seven 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.850
 but it's not a very 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.630
 difficult because it's not difficult because you 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.039
 have to study you do to execute 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.510
 the service 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:30.330
 So it's betting on you guys. 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:33.809
 in this video that I find interesting 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.940
 important for anyone who is starting the 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.440
 advice of anything you have 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:44.219
 to study the mechanism to be able to 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:48.059
 the service then show you how 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.989
 this gear is exchanged higher than I 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.120
 I already changed this machine so I can only vote 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.960
 showing step by step how you go 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.010
 do 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.379
 First you're going to ride the bike. 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:07.770
 the machine on the bench 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:11.630
 so you 're turning the machine one 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:18.270
 and will be releasing this theory 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:22.530
 that she has been tempted then this rush 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.549
 Stay here, there you go. 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.780
 here screw is at the bottom 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:39.590
 It is only somewhat this theory and docks 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:39.590
 will condition the machine again via 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:53.750
 I do it to loose as I told you. 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:56.719
 it goes so far it is releasing 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.829
 This cucumber is 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:00.829
 then you loose 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.020
 It is right careful not to break because 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.450
 can be resected by time 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.840
 so you will have access where you go 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.800
 have access to pure here and see 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.390
 to hold 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:24.890
 you will have access to some bolt 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.440
 You see, you let go of this gear. 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.650
 So this is the tip I do not want to pass. 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.050
 between us you puzzle to do 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:38.269
 but he does not need is one thing 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:41.330
 simple you can do even at home 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:45.290
 Even though I do not work today, I worked 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:47.660
 in electronic electronics 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.750
 So I decided to talk, it always goes like it does. 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.720
 something I try to do for a 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.540
 known is that the mechanical part does not 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.630
 I like this line and also have 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.630
 knowledge in electronics will then I 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.790
 I want to show you exchange of 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.230
 upper gear zigzag machine 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.829
 zag noted 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.560
 here the notice not puzzle 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.600
 dismantling any machine that does not have 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.269
 need 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.850
 I'm tohÃ¡ tip player 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:23.060
 you will have access to change this 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:27.590
 gear of my exchange then come back 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:32.540
 there riding to take the customer who 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:35.510
 It's an acquaintance and it's worth you. 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:40.310
 always learning and this is very good for 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:45.790
 people always want to do something 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.790
 Thank you, thank you, if you liked jewelry.
