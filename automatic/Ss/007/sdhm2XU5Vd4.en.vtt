this was $15 so if you don't want to go

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.490 
this was $15 so if you don't want to go
too<00:02:09.429> pricey<00:02:09.970> on<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:10.630> laptop<00:02:10.989> case<00:02:11.200> you<00:02:11.350> could

about which is it candles and um you
kind<00:03:03.579> of<00:03:03.700> from<00:03:04.299> in<00:03:04.450> my<00:03:04.600> opinion<00:03:04.870> i<00:03:05.079> wouldn't

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470

pay twenty dollars for just one candle

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.030
