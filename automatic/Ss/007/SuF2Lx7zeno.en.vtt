 What can I say? I think that the duel as a debut in the new group successful, victorious. We would like to know a knockout. One would like to win the fight by knockout, then there is no 'Ale'. But he did not manage to knock him out. I was boxing well. I was well prepared and I am very happy. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 It is true. We waited a bit in the locker room, because we were told that I would be boxing around 11:00 PM. It stretched a little. It seems to me that it did not disturb me. It was a bit sad, because at some point the stands were deserted. But nothing, maybe next time it will be at more appropriate times and in full bleachers. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 This is not to judge me anymore. I had the advantage, and he did not blow and only defended himself. What to do. Such situations are always contradictory, because it is not known whether my opponent does not blow, because he can not. Did he just take such tactics and so on. it depends on the judge. One judge would not stop it, and this judge was very careful. Do not judge me. 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 It seems to me that yes, although everyone looks at the duel differently. Everyone sees the advantages differently. I do not know ... I have done so much to please myself. If you liked it well. 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 The first topic was that we will see each other at the gala in Stuttgart. At the gala of Povetkin with Huck. We talked about the next fight I will be on March 31. 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 Still actual. On the last day of March I will box, I do not know exactly where. As you can see right now I am in the room and I am starting to move slowly. There is not much rest. I hope he will present himself well. 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 Definitely yes. I hope soon. I hope this year. 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:04:10.000
 I never thought about changing citizenship and I will never do it. I will definitely want to give spectacular fights. I will present a good, hard and interesting box. intelligent boxing I think that everywhere will appreciate the artistry of my box.
