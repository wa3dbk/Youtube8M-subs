 show how to make homemade preparations 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.419
 with medicinal plants or herbs to 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.029
 that the herbs can be used 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:25.710
 for their consumption or application they have to 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.140
 be submitted to a process of 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.599
 processing that varies according to the part of 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.809
 the plant that is used and if it is for 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.309
 internal use or for external use here you 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.650
 I'm going to show some types of 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.110
 medicinal preparations for internal use 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:42.269
 and external that do not require devices 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.440
 laboratory but they can be done 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:48.510
 calmly with the home resources 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.670
 infusions are used internally to 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.309
 treat all kinds of problems according to the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.920
 Plant class are prepared with a

 teaspoon of dried plant per cup of 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.949
 filtered water preferably and it is better 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.930
 do not sweeten it with anything so you do not 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.870
 lose properties 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.300
 foundations are more loaded infusions 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.550
 and they differ from the first ones in that 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.220
 the plant is boiled between 10 and 15 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.310
 minutes thing that the normal infusions 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.440
 it's not done because they submerge before 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.190
 that the water reaches boiling and 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.950
 let cool tincture are used 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.650
 mainly in an its internal and it 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.950
 Employ using 70 degree alcohol 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.740
 or vinegar the alcohol waists are 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.780
 more concentrated but have more 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.930
 contraindications can not be given to 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.509
 children can not be taken by people who 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.490
 they are detoxifying by alcohol the 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.260
 of vinegar can be used without these 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.710
 limitations 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.840
 Arabs are also used in internal use 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.450
 and they are elaborated through knowledge of 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.910
 the plant with sugar so that they form a 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.830
 gelatinous viscosity that is taken as 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:03.430
 any normal syrup 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:06.340
 macerated are used externally to

 preparation as olives jova almonds 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.890
 etc. the preparation mode is the 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.840
 same as for waists dips 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.720

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.920
 macerated and tinctures are used 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.860

 externally diluting in an oil 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.360
 because they are very concentrated and 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.650
 extracted from the plants by 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:58.650
 distillation ointments there are two forms 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.819
 of preparing ointments a more elaborate and

 the other more simple 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.909
 that is the first most elaborate option 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.620

 conservation 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.160
 this type of preparation has many 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:06.740
 applications for example with plantain are

 Plant assets can be 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.880
 ingested since they are the substances that
