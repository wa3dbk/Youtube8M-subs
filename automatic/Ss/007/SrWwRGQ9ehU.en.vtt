best way to upgrade now that said I will

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.640 
best way to upgrade now that said I will
say<00:02:36.580> windows<00:02:37.060> 8<00:02:37.300> windows<00:02:37.540> 10<00:02:38.140> they've<00:02:38.440> done<00:02:38.620> a

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
say windows 8 windows 10 they've done a

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.010 
say windows 8 windows 10 they've done a
much<00:02:38.980> better<00:02:39.040> job<00:02:39.520> than<00:02:39.970> they<00:02:40.120> had<00:02:40.420> from<00:02:40.750> past

20<00:02:41.770> years<00:02:42.010> of<00:02:42.540> upgrading<00:02:43.540> operating<00:02:43.989> systems

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
20 years of upgrading operating systems

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.729 
20 years of upgrading operating systems
by<00:02:45.360> they've<00:02:46.360> just<00:02:46.540> improved<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.020> process<00:02:47.230> to

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
by they've just improved the process to

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.800 
by they've just improved the process to
make<00:02:47.860> sure<00:02:47.920> not<00:02:48.459> as<00:02:48.610> many<00:02:48.760> problems<00:02:49.060> can<00:02:49.480> carry

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
make sure not as many problems can carry

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.009 
make sure not as many problems can carry
forward<00:02:50.410> it<00:02:51.310> used<00:02:51.489> to<00:02:51.580> be<00:02:51.730> that<00:02:51.880> if<00:02:52.030> you<00:02:52.209> didn't

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
forward it used to be that if you didn't

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.040 
forward it used to be that if you didn't
upgrade<00:02:53.260> say<00:02:54.070> from<00:02:54.400> windows<00:02:55.000> 2000<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:55.750> windows

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
upgrade say from windows 2000 to windows

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.250 
upgrade say from windows 2000 to windows
XP<00:02:56.500> oh<00:02:56.739> yeah<00:02:57.519> if<00:02:58.420> there<00:02:58.600> were<00:02:58.690> inherent

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
XP oh yeah if there were inherent

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.810 
XP oh yeah if there were inherent
problems<00:02:59.739> in<00:02:59.860> the<00:02:59.980> system<00:03:00.130> a<00:03:00.400> lot<00:03:00.610> of<00:03:00.700> those

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
problems in the system a lot of those

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.420 
problems in the system a lot of those
would<00:03:01.030> just<00:03:01.209> carry<00:03:01.600> forward<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:02.430> would

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
would just carry forward and would

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.660 
would just carry forward and would
become<00:03:03.730> a<00:03:03.760> an<00:03:04.269> ongoing<00:03:04.510> problem<00:03:05.110> for<00:03:05.380> you<00:03:05.800> so

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
become a an ongoing problem for you so

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.449 
become a an ongoing problem for you so
they<00:03:06.790> do<00:03:06.850> a<00:03:07.060> better<00:03:07.690> job<00:03:07.810> but<00:03:08.380> that<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.769> never

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
they do a better job but that the never

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.780 
they do a better job but that the never
have<00:03:09.850> but<00:03:10.470> my<00:03:11.470> recommendation<00:03:11.860> if<00:03:12.459> you<00:03:12.610> have

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
have but my recommendation if you have

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.610 
have but my recommendation if you have
the<00:03:12.940> capability<00:03:13.750> if<00:03:13.810> you<00:03:13.930> have<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.350> knowledge

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
the capability if you have the knowledge

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.110 
the capability if you have the knowledge
if<00:03:14.980> you<00:03:15.070> have<00:03:15.190> someone<00:03:15.430> that<00:03:15.610> can<00:03:15.670> do<00:03:15.940> it<00:03:15.970> for

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
if you have someone that can do it for

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.449 
if you have someone that can do it for
you<00:03:16.540> if<00:03:16.989> you<00:03:17.110> have<00:03:17.350> all<00:03:17.560> your<00:03:17.709> disks<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:18.310> your

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
you if you have all your disks and your

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.400 
you if you have all your disks and your
software<00:03:19.000> things<00:03:19.360> like<00:03:19.570> that<00:03:19.780> you<00:03:20.019> have<00:03:20.260> all

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
software things like that you have all

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.830 
software things like that you have all
your<00:03:20.530> data<00:03:20.709> back<00:03:20.980> it<00:03:21.190> up<00:03:21.310> backed<00:03:21.640> up<00:03:21.850> to<00:03:22.540> do<00:03:22.810> a

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
your data back it up backed up to do a

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.949 
your data back it up backed up to do a
fresh<00:03:23.320> installation<00:03:23.829> but<00:03:24.760> you<00:03:25.239> know<00:03:25.390> really

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
fresh installation but you know really

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.990 
fresh installation but you know really
look<00:03:26.410> think<00:03:26.709> hard<00:03:26.980> about<00:03:27.070> that<00:03:27.220> before<00:03:27.700> you<00:03:27.730> do

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
look think hard about that before you do

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.660 
look think hard about that before you do
it<00:03:28.030> because<00:03:28.380> if<00:03:29.380> you<00:03:29.560> run<00:03:29.739> into<00:03:29.769> problems<00:03:29.980> and

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
it because if you run into problems and

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.130 
it because if you run into problems and
you<00:03:30.730> don't<00:03:30.940> have<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.209> resources<00:03:31.360> to<00:03:31.810> figure

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
you don't have the resources to figure

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.930 
you don't have the resources to figure
out<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:32.500> problems<00:03:33.040> or<00:03:33.220> someone<00:03:33.519> to<00:03:33.610> help<00:03:33.820> you

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
out the problems or someone to help you

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.060 
out the problems or someone to help you
with<00:03:34.120> it<00:03:34.269> or<00:03:34.360> something<00:03:34.750> then<00:03:35.170> they<00:03:35.440> could<00:03:35.650> you

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
with it or something then they could you

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.650 
with it or something then they could you
know<00:03:36.220> turn<00:03:36.489> out<00:03:36.610> really<00:03:36.760> bad<00:03:37.060> for<00:03:37.360> you<00:03:37.510> and

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
give you some real headaches before you

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.030 
give you some real headaches before you
get<00:03:41.560> things<00:03:41.769> back<00:03:41.950> on<00:03:42.160> line<00:03:42.489> and<00:03:42.760> working<00:03:43.209> a

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.130 
of people post very positive feedback I
will<00:03:49.720> say<00:03:49.959> that<00:03:49.989> the<00:03:51.030> reason<00:03:52.030> things<00:03:52.420> run<00:03:52.750> fast

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
will say that the reason things run fast

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.289 
will say that the reason things run fast
and<00:03:53.440> smooth<00:03:53.829> and<00:03:54.130> design<00:03:54.519> space<00:03:54.790> seems<00:03:55.060> a<00:03:55.180> lot

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
and smooth and design space seems a lot

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.819 
and smooth and design space seems a lot

that<00:04:19.150> they<00:04:19.630> were<00:04:19.690> messing<00:04:20.109> with<00:04:20.289> the<00:04:20.410> system

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
that they were messing with the system

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.460 
that they were messing with the system
and<00:04:22.760> you<00:04:23.760> know<00:04:23.880> it<00:04:24.090> a<00:04:24.330> year<00:04:24.960> from<00:04:24.990> now<00:04:25.170> your

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
and you know it a year from now your

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.450 
and you know it a year from now your
systems<00:04:25.860> probably<00:04:26.010> going<00:04:26.280> to<00:04:26.340> run

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
systems probably going to run

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.530 
systems probably going to run
differently<00:04:26.880> it's<00:04:27.060> going<00:04:27.210> to<00:04:27.270> perform

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
differently it's going to perform

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.170 
differently it's going to perform
differently<00:04:27.990> because<00:04:28.230> people<00:04:29.010> put<00:04:29.220> sulfur<00:04:29.760> on

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
differently because people put sulfur on

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.610 
differently because people put sulfur on
and<00:04:30.450> they<00:04:30.510> take<00:04:30.720> it<00:04:30.840> off<00:04:30.930> they<00:04:31.110> put<00:04:31.260> trial

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
and they take it off they put trial

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.370 
and they take it off they put trial
sulfur<00:04:32.250> on<00:04:32.430> and<00:04:32.640> they<00:04:32.730> uninstall<00:04:33.360> it<00:04:33.390> and<00:04:33.630> all

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
sulfur on and they uninstall it and all

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.280 
sulfur on and they uninstall it and all
that<00:04:34.560> stuff<00:04:34.680> and<00:04:35.010> you<00:04:35.640> know<00:04:35.670> it<00:04:36.240> just<00:04:36.510> runs<00:04:37.140> the

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
that stuff and you know it just runs the

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.320 
that stuff and you know it just runs the
system<00:04:37.650> down<00:04:37.800> and<00:04:38.280> hurts<00:04:38.670> performance<00:04:39.180> and

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
system down and hurts performance and

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.780 
system down and hurts performance and
stability<00:04:39.480> a<00:04:39.870> little<00:04:40.110> bit<00:04:40.230> so<00:04:40.700> that's<00:04:41.700> the

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
stability a little bit so that's the

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:45.500 
stability a little bit so that's the
reason<00:04:41.880> people<00:04:42.300> are<00:04:42.450> seeing<00:04:42.780> a<00:04:43.970> such<00:04:44.970> a<00:04:45.000> huge

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
reason people are seeing a such a huge

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.270 
reason people are seeing a such a huge
important<00:04:46.080> performance<00:04:46.560> and<00:04:47.130> stability

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
important performance and stability

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.000 
important performance and stability
difference<00:04:48.000> with<00:04:48.150> Windows<00:04:48.420> 10<00:04:48.780> after<00:04:49.590> they<00:04:49.950> do

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
difference with Windows 10 after they do

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.740 
difference with Windows 10 after they do
the<00:04:50.220> upgrade<00:04:52.220> cosmetically<00:04:53.220> you<00:04:54.060> know<00:04:54.240> they

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
the upgrade cosmetically you know they

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.900 
the upgrade cosmetically you know they
added<00:04:55.020> the<00:04:55.140> start<00:04:55.440> button<00:04:55.680> back<00:04:55.950> in<00:04:56.280> they

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
added the start button back in they

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.090 
added the start button back in they
change<00:04:57.510> the<00:04:57.780> look<00:04:58.020> of<00:04:58.320> the<00:04:58.440> icons<00:04:58.890> on<00:04:59.070> the

from<00:05:40.500> my<00:05:40.710> standpoint<00:05:41.070> say<00:05:41.550> everyone<00:05:42.420> should

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.830 
from my standpoint say everyone should
upgrade<00:05:42.900> because<00:05:43.380> cricket<00:05:43.980> hasn't<00:05:44.280> announced

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840

think they're going to take very long

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.690 
think they're going to take very long
