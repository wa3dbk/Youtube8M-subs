with<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.909> audio<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.630> previous<00:01:24.930> episode

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
with the audio on the previous episode

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.539 
with the audio on the previous episode
of<00:01:25.290> path<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.530> power<00:01:25.619> i'm<00:01:25.890> at<00:01:26.009> my<00:01:26.189> cousin's

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549

of path to power i'm at my cousin's
place<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.509> think<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.900> sound<00:01:28.439> was<00:01:28.619> like

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
place and I think the sound was like

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.080 
place and I think the sound was like
echoing<00:01:29.040> off<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.250> floors<00:01:29.579> or<00:01:29.759> something<00:01:30.030> I

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
echoing off the floors or something I

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.850 
echoing off the floors or something I
don't<00:01:30.150> know<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.390> really<00:01:30.479> weird<00:01:30.750> listening<00:01:31.740> to
