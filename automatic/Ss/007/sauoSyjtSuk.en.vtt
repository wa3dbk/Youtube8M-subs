00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.839 
frizzy so I divide my hair into sections
and<00:05:37.780> then<00:05:37.960> I<00:05:37.990> curl<00:05:38.380> the<00:05:38.620> first<00:05:38.889> strand<00:05:39.250> away

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:39.849 
and then I curl the first strand away

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:42.120 
and then I curl the first strand away
from<00:05:40.120> my<00:05:40.270> face<00:05:40.539> and<00:05:40.870> then<00:05:41.260> the<00:05:41.380> next<00:05:41.650> strand<00:05:41.889> I

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130

from my face and then the next strand I
curl<00:05:42.430> it<00:05:42.550> towards<00:05:42.820> my<00:05:43.120> face<00:05:43.389> that<00:05:43.990> way<00:05:44.169> they're

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.410 
curl it towards my face that way they're

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.650 
curl it towards my face that way they're
more<00:05:44.650> broken<00:05:45.099> up<00:05:45.220> and<00:05:45.400> they<00:05:45.520> don't<00:05:45.760> all<00:05:46.060> push

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
more broken up and they don't all push

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.540 
more broken up and they don't all push
together<00:05:46.810> into<00:05:47.380> one<00:05:47.590> big<00:05:47.860> curl<00:05:48.099> if<00:05:48.340> you<00:05:48.460> know

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
together into one big curl if you know

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:49.740 
together into one big curl if you know
what<00:05:48.639> I'm<00:05:48.729> talking<00:05:49.030> about<00:05:49.120> it's<00:05:49.389> kind<00:05:49.539> of<00:05:49.570> hard

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
what I'm talking about it's kind of hard

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.690 
what I'm talking about it's kind of hard
to<00:05:49.870> explain<00:05:50.200> but<00:05:50.560> that<00:05:50.830> way<00:05:51.220> they<00:05:51.400> don't<00:05:51.580> all

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:51.700 
to explain but that way they don't all

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.370 
to explain but that way they don't all
clump<00:05:52.030> together<00:05:52.210> and<00:05:52.660> it<00:05:52.750> just<00:05:52.780> makes<00:05:53.020> them

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
clump together and it just makes them

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.960 
clump together and it just makes them
more<00:05:53.590> broken<00:05:53.830> up<00:05:54.039> and<00:05:54.280> look<00:05:54.520> a<00:05:54.639> little<00:05:54.789> bit

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
more broken up and look a little bit

00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:00.629 
more broken up and look a little bit
more<00:05:55.120> natural<00:05:57.870> and<00:05:58.919> then<00:05:59.919> I<00:06:00.010> just<00:06:00.190> continue

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 
more natural and then I just continue

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:02.370 
more natural and then I just continue
doing<00:06:00.970> that<00:06:01.090> all<00:06:01.330> the<00:06:01.479> way<00:06:01.599> around<00:06:01.960> until<00:06:02.169> I

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.380 
doing that all the way around until I

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.500 
doing that all the way around until I
get<00:06:02.590> to<00:06:02.740> my<00:06:02.770> bangs<00:06:03.130> and<00:06:03.460> then<00:06:03.940> I<00:06:03.970> just<00:06:04.270> curl

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
get to my bangs and then I just curl

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.510 
get to my bangs and then I just curl
those<00:06:04.690> both<00:06:04.900> away<00:06:05.229> from<00:06:05.470> my<00:06:05.560> face<00:06:05.800> and<00:06:06.160> kind<00:06:06.400> of

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
those both away from my face and kind of

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.250 
those both away from my face and kind of
use<00:06:06.669> my<00:06:06.700> fingertips<00:06:07.150> just<00:06:07.630> to<00:06:07.780> shape<00:06:08.020> them

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:08.260 
use my fingertips just to shape them

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:17.620 
use my fingertips just to shape them
into<00:06:08.919> the<00:06:09.010> rest<00:06:09.190> of<00:06:09.370> my<00:06:09.520> hair

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.720 

and<00:06:17.720> then<00:06:18.380> I<00:06:18.410> get<00:06:18.740> dressed<00:06:18.950> for<00:06:19.190> the<00:06:19.310> day<00:06:19.460> and
