00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:10.639
 well it's all two issued these 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:13.190
 virtuosos today we find ourselves on 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.659
 gta 5 for a new round top 5 dead 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.130
 of the week like every episode 

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:17.720
 You Czech and description you 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.520
 see all your dead weird what 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.710
 the fuck you in lucerne at this same 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.910
 email address we lose no more time 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.060
 and we start right now that's it 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.060
 left 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.100
 sometimes on gt in laye does not reappear 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.300
 necessarily at the right place 8 does not have 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.300
 really lucky we will say 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.440
 to steal a car it does not seem so 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.000
 complicated than that but when 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.740
 Passive people get involved 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.250
 becomes more complicated especially when the 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.250
 car bugs 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.360
 so this death was really weird 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.740
 Maslard happened in slow motion so we see 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.970
 although the people they were in 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.920
 way to pass to push the 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.780
 charring blow it's the comet that 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.670
 is driven the ustv over this person 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.620
 who wanted to ride in this car and 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.210
 there was a little bug the break between 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.200
 the cults a bunch of people etc 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.200
 they are dead it's really weird 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.799
 even though the helicopter cops are hs 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.049
 believe me my experience and this clip 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.439
 they will do everything to really love everything for 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.439
 kill you 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.030
 you know the expression have the 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.680
 mold I never had but he he 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.640
 was really lucky we can 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.079
 can say it like that 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.079
 two sales next year 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.520
 we always told you when you 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.910
 work to keep from right to 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.560
 left 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.060
 I like to listen to separate his highway 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.770
 sure this time this person does not 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:03:00.110
 did not do it and he did not have much 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:03:01.970
 of luck a pretty new thing I'm going 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.590
 ask yourself a little question that 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.750
 will it happen in the sequence that 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.610
 will follow answer 1 the bus will stop 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.099
 answer 2 the bus will not stop 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.200
 answer 3 the bus will fly to go to 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.459
 beyond then you answer this 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.110
 little question in space 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.310
 comment I would see who found 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.060
 the right answer i'll let you look 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.060
 the rest of the clip 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.230
 obviously the bus was not 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.790
 stopped otherwise the clip would not be the 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.010
 first position it did me well 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.200
 to see the bus arrive from far and 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.000
 to see that he did not stop these 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.260
 civilians really do not know how to drive 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.209
 he really was unlucky 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.380
 here we are at the end of the set top 5 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.610
 I really hope they would have done 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.110
 pleasure you in the comments area 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.549
 you tell me everything you think of 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.690
 that and you do not forget to send me 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.370
 all your death what the fuck 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.290
 hallucinating etc to the address but who 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.829
 will be in the description and we feel a 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.829
 next 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.800
 ah ah
