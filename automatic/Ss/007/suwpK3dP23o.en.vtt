second was I had a really high pitched

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.600 
second was I had a really high pitched
whine<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.500> background<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:38.040> couldn't<00:00:38.370> I

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
whine in the background I couldn't I

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.299 
whine in the background I couldn't I
couldn't<00:00:38.790> figure<00:00:39.149> out<00:00:39.860> when<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:40.950> comes<00:00:41.010> out<00:00:41.219> of

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
couldn't figure out when it comes out of

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.889 
couldn't figure out when it comes out of
the<00:00:41.370> box<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.760> plug<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.120> right<00:00:42.239> in<00:00:42.420> I'm<00:00:42.600> using<00:00:42.629> a

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
the box you plug it right in I'm using a

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.410 
the box you plug it right in I'm using a
Windows<00:00:43.050> machine<00:00:43.290> with<00:00:43.590> 8.1<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.309> plugged<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.300> in

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
Windows machine with 8.1 I plugged it in

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.299 
Windows machine with 8.1 I plugged it in
instantly<00:00:46.020> recognized<00:00:46.530> no<00:00:46.770> problem<00:00:47.129> there

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
instantly recognized no problem there

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.180 
instantly recognized no problem there
but<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.899> loud<00:00:49.200> buzz<00:00:49.559> was<00:00:50.120> really<00:00:51.120> pretty<00:00:51.510> bad

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
but the loud buzz was really pretty bad

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.029 
but the loud buzz was really pretty bad
so<00:00:53.190> just<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.489> bunch<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:54.440> trial<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.559> error<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.890> I

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
so just a bunch of trial and error and I

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.569 
so just a bunch of trial and error and I
realized<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.260> light<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:58.859> had<00:00:59.160> on<00:00:59.399> my

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
realized that the light that I had on my

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.970 
realized that the light that I had on my
desktop<00:01:00.030> had<00:01:00.989> one<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.320> these<00:01:01.410> compact

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
desktop had one of these compact

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.179 
desktop had one of these compact
florescent<00:01:02.550> curlicue<00:01:03.180> bulbs<00:01:03.710> so<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:04.739> turned

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
florescent curlicue bulbs so I turned

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.160 
florescent curlicue bulbs so I turned
that<00:01:05.339> light<00:01:05.640> off<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.390> buzzing<00:01:06.570> went<00:01:06.810> away

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
that light off and the buzzing went away

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.080 
that light off and the buzzing went away
replace<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:07.890> light<00:01:08.280> bulb<00:01:08.520> with<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.760> regular

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
replace that light bulb with a regular

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.950 
replace that light bulb with a regular
old<00:01:09.299> incandescent<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:11.210> no<00:01:12.210> more<00:01:12.390> buzzing<00:01:12.750> so

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
old incandescent and no more buzzing so

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.840 
old incandescent and no more buzzing so
I'm<00:01:13.740> sure<00:01:13.920> there's<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.130> bunch<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.400> reasons<00:01:14.700> for

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
I'm sure there's a bunch of reasons for

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.460 
I'm sure there's a bunch of reasons for
buzzing<00:01:15.180> but<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.810> was<00:01:16.049> what<00:01:16.200> was<00:01:16.320> causing

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
buzzing but that was what was causing

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.149 
buzzing but that was what was causing
the<00:01:16.740> issue<00:01:16.860> on<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.400> my<00:01:17.640> setup<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:19.070> once<00:01:20.070> that

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
the issue on on my setup so once that

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.310 
the issue on on my setup so once that
buzzing<00:01:20.580> was<00:01:20.729> gone<00:01:20.939> that's<00:01:21.659> when<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:21.900> realized

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
buzzing was gone that's when I realized

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.690 
buzzing was gone that's when I realized
that<00:01:22.500> there<00:01:22.680> was<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.799> high-pitched<00:01:23.220> whine<00:01:23.460> in

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
that there was a high-pitched whine in

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.450 
that there was a high-pitched whine in
the<00:01:23.790> back<00:01:24.409> it<00:01:25.409> took<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.740> little<00:01:25.860> more<00:01:26.009> screwing

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
the back it took a little more screwing

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.219 
the back it took a little more screwing
around<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:27.090> get<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.450> figured<00:01:27.840> out<00:01:29.450> but<00:01:30.450> just

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
around to get that figured out but just

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.240 
around to get that figured out but just
checking<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.560> few<00:01:31.590> things<00:01:31.979> first<00:01:32.759> off<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
checking a few things first off that the

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.890 
checking a few things first off that the
the<00:01:35.250> instructions<00:01:35.939> actually<00:01:36.360> point<00:01:36.630> out<00:01:36.720> the

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:02.940 
see what was gonna happen and that high
pinch<00:02:01.720> wine<00:02:01.960> went<00:02:02.260> away<00:02:02.320> completely

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
pinch wine went away completely

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.240 
pinch wine went away completely
so<00:02:03.610> no<00:02:04.240> idea<00:02:04.420> why<00:02:04.780> but<00:02:04.810> that<00:02:05.650> certainly<00:02:05.830> worked

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
so no idea why but that certainly worked

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.840 
so no idea why but that certainly worked
and<00:02:07.240> I've<00:02:07.420> tested<00:02:07.960> this<00:02:08.140> with<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:09.459> levels

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
and I've tested this with the levels

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.080 
and I've tested this with the levels
from<00:02:10.179> 40<00:02:10.840> 50<00:02:11.140> 60<00:02:11.470> 70<00:02:11.500> it's<00:02:12.130> on<00:02:12.220> 70<00:02:12.640> right<00:02:12.820> now<00:02:12.970> as

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
from 40 50 60 70 it's on 70 right now as

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.410 
from 40 50 60 70 it's on 70 right now as
you<00:02:13.180> can<00:02:13.300> see<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:15.459> it<00:02:15.610> seems<00:02:15.790> to<00:02:15.880> be<00:02:15.940> fine<00:02:16.120> all

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
you can see and it seems to be fine all

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.970 
you can see and it seems to be fine all
the<00:02:16.480> way<00:02:16.570> across<00:02:16.720> those<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:17.350> if<00:02:17.470> I<00:02:17.590> get<00:02:17.740> up<00:02:17.830> into

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
the way across those so if I get up into

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.060 
the way across those so if I get up into
the<00:02:18.100> 80s<00:02:18.130> and<00:02:18.730> 90s<00:02:18.970> I<00:02:19.510> get<00:02:20.320> a<00:02:20.350> different<00:02:20.680> kind

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
the 80s and 90s I get a different kind

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.280 
the 80s and 90s I get a different kind
of<00:02:21.250> weird<00:02:21.520> um<00:02:22.800> kind<00:02:23.800> of<00:02:23.860> deal<00:02:24.360> but<00:02:25.360> in<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.600> 60

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
of weird um kind of deal but in the 60

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.780 
of weird um kind of deal but in the 60
70<00:02:26.620> range<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:26.950> output<00:02:27.220> seems<00:02:27.370> to<00:02:27.489> be<00:02:27.580> just

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
70 range the output seems to be just

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.900 
70 range the output seems to be just
fine<00:02:27.970> so<00:02:28.260> overall<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:30.280> know<00:02:30.400> it<00:02:30.520> seems<00:02:30.730> like<00:02:30.790> a

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
fine so overall you know it seems like a

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.840 
fine so overall you know it seems like a
really<00:02:31.090> good<00:02:31.390> 30<00:02:32.110> bucks<00:02:32.380> spent<00:02:32.550> I'd<00:02:33.550> seem<00:02:33.760> to
