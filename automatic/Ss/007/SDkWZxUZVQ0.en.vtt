00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.909 
on top of that tree jump to the tree
right<00:04:26.099> next<00:04:26.460> to<00:04:26.550> it<00:04:27.020> now<00:04:28.020> get<00:04:28.199> a<00:04:28.260> high<00:04:28.410> jump<00:04:28.710> and

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
right next to it now get a high jump and

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.409 
right next to it now get a high jump and
go<00:04:29.699> straight<00:04:29.910> to<00:04:30.030> that<00:04:30.150> tree<00:04:30.570> and<00:04:32.240> I'll<00:04:33.240> walk

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
go straight to that tree and I'll walk

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.090 
go straight to that tree and I'll walk
to<00:04:33.599> the<00:04:33.720> highest<00:04:33.930> point<00:04:34.289> high<00:04:35.159> jump

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.720 

let's<00:04:38.790> try<00:04:39.090> that<00:04:39.270> again<00:04:39.470> highest<00:04:40.470> point<00:04:40.730> okay

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
let's try that again highest point okay

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.000 
let's try that again highest point okay
and<00:04:41.940> you're<00:04:42.120> up<00:04:42.240> and<00:04:42.510> you<00:04:43.320> can<00:04:43.500> go<00:04:43.680> over<00:04:43.710> there

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
and you're up and you can go over there

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.280 
and you're up and you can go over there
on<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:44.250> trees<00:04:44.580> and<00:04:44.760> everything<00:04:44.970> but<00:04:45.840> you<00:04:46.170> know

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
on the trees and everything but you know

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.260 
on the trees and everything but you know
i'm<00:04:46.560> showing<00:04:46.950> you<00:04:47.040> the<00:04:47.460> big<00:04:47.700> part<00:04:48.060> of<00:04:48.150> this

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
i'm showing you the big part of this

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.990 
i'm showing you the big part of this

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
the corner and here is the tunnel that

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.080 
the corner and here is the tunnel that
you<00:04:57.720> should<00:04:58.020> be<00:04:58.260> able<00:04:58.350> to<00:04:58.530> get<00:04:58.650> in<00:04:58.910> so<00:04:59.910> you're

you should be able to get in so you're
in<00:05:00.210> this<00:05:00.330> tunnel<00:05:00.600> and<00:05:00.900> you're<00:05:01.740> wondering

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
in this tunnel and you're wondering

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.480 
in this tunnel and you're wondering
where<00:05:02.820> is<00:05:03.060> this<00:05:03.240> tunnel<00:05:03.950> your<00:05:04.950> questions<00:05:05.340> will

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
where is this tunnel your questions will

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.670 
where is this tunnel your questions will
be<00:05:05.520> answered<00:05:06.320> when<00:05:07.320> i<00:05:07.380> show<00:05:07.680> you<00:05:07.710> this<00:05:09.650> so<00:05:10.650> you

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
be answered when i show you this so you

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
is this rail you're asking know you

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.340 
is this rail you're asking know you
probably<00:05:16.920> know<00:05:17.130> artists<00:05:17.480> so<00:05:18.480> you<00:05:19.080> keep<00:05:19.260> going

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
probably know artists so you keep going

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.460 
probably know artists so you keep going
and<00:05:20.130> it's<00:05:20.400> a<00:05:20.520> rail<00:05:20.730> what<00:05:21.690> you're<00:05:21.870> going<00:05:22.200> on

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
and it's a rail what you're going on

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.260 
and it's a rail what you're going on
Terrell<00:05:22.980> you're<00:05:23.190> actually<00:05:23.310> going<00:05:23.730> on<00:05:23.940> did<00:05:24.180> you

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
Terrell you're actually going on did you

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.710 
Terrell you're actually going on did you
know<00:05:24.360> that<00:05:24.710> so<00:05:25.710> there's<00:05:26.280> is<00:05:26.760> it<00:05:27.120> and<00:05:27.450> you're

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
know that so there's is it and you're

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:40.750 
know that so there's is it and you're
going<00:05:27.930> and<00:05:29.180> then<00:05:30.180> it<00:05:30.780> is<00:05:31.410> right<00:05:32.370> here<00:05:33.360> and<00:05:37.970> it's

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
going and then it is right here and it's

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.120 
going and then it is right here and it's
in<00:05:41.760> the<00:05:41.940> demo<00:05:42.440> that's<00:05:43.440> why<00:05:43.650> beat<00:05:43.860> it<00:05:43.980> in<00:05:44.040> like

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
in the demo that's why beat it in like

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.640 
in the demo that's why beat it in like
five<00:05:44.280> seconds
