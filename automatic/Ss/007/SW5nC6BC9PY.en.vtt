okay thank you getting a little bit more
room<00:03:33.270> in<00:03:33.480> there<00:03:34.670> though<00:03:35.670> if<00:03:35.820> it's<00:03:35.970> too<00:03:36.180> closed

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
room in there though if it's too closed

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.020 
room in there though if it's too closed
off<00:03:36.860> you<00:03:37.860> will<00:03:37.980> not<00:03:38.190> be<00:03:38.430> able<00:03:38.550> to<00:03:38.670> get<00:03:38.880> acrylic

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
off you will not be able to get acrylic

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.970 
off you will not be able to get acrylic
and<00:03:42.030> you'll<00:03:42.180> get<00:03:42.300> air<00:03:42.510> bubbles<00:03:42.690> on<00:03:43.080> the<00:03:43.200> facial

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
and you'll get air bubbles on the facial

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:52.830 
and you'll get air bubbles on the facial
part<00:03:44.190> of<00:03:44.340> it

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:07.490 

take<00:03:53.470> that<00:03:53.650> wax<00:03:53.800> off<00:03:54.099> it's<00:03:54.280> getting<00:03:54.519> away

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.449 

sorry<00:04:08.500> I<00:04:09.540> get<00:04:10.540> that<00:04:10.660> wax<00:04:10.930> off<00:04:11.260> but<00:04:11.680> I<00:04:11.860> trimmed

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
sorry I get that wax off but I trimmed

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:20.009 
sorry I get that wax off but I trimmed
it<00:04:12.549> some<00:04:12.730> more<00:04:12.879> and<00:04:16.169> right<00:04:17.169> here<00:04:17.530> so<00:04:19.019> hopefully

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
it some more and right here so hopefully

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.600 
it some more and right here so hopefully
I<00:04:20.350> can<00:04:20.410> get<00:04:20.680> my<00:04:20.889> acrylic<00:04:21.549> in<00:04:21.760> there<00:04:23.460> that's<00:04:24.460> the

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
I can get my acrylic in there that's the

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.129 
I can get my acrylic in there that's the
only<00:04:24.790> bad<00:04:24.970> thing<00:04:25.030> about<00:04:25.270> doing<00:04:25.780> this<00:04:25.870> method

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
only bad thing about doing this method

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:32.010 
only bad thing about doing this method
is<00:04:26.470> if<00:04:26.830> you<00:04:26.979> don't<00:04:29.430> get<00:04:30.430> a<00:04:30.490> good<00:04:30.669> prep<00:04:31.090> okay

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
is if you don't get a good prep okay

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:40.930 
is if you don't get a good prep okay
got<00:04:32.169> that<00:04:32.410> solid<00:04:32.860> on<00:04:33.220> there

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:47.050 

and<00:04:41.360> I<00:04:41.450> hold<00:04:41.810> that<00:04:43.420> seems<00:04:44.420> kind<00:04:44.750> of<00:04:44.780> wanna<00:04:46.060> move

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
and I hold that seems kind of wanna move

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.800 
and I hold that seems kind of wanna move
on<00:04:47.300> me<00:04:47.540> a<00:04:47.570> little<00:04:47.720> bit

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:59.720 

a<00:04:51.870> lot<00:04:52.700> at<00:04:53.700> twisted<00:04:54.690> in<00:04:54.780> there<00:04:57.470> so<00:04:58.470> now<00:04:58.730> I'm

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
a lot at twisted in there so now I'm

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:07.010 
a lot at twisted in there so now I'm
going<00:04:59.910> to<00:05:00.060> stick<00:05:00.389> this<00:05:02.690> to<00:05:03.690> the<00:05:03.810> matrix<00:05:06.020> the

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
going to stick this to the matrix the

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.940 
going to stick this to the matrix the
wax<00:05:07.320> does<00:05:08.070> not<00:05:08.340> stick<00:05:08.820> to<00:05:09.180> this<00:05:09.590> matrix<00:05:10.590> putty

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
wax does not stick to this matrix putty

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.020 
wax does not stick to this matrix putty
this<00:05:11.520> lab<00:05:11.790> putty<00:05:12.120> very<00:05:12.419> well<00:05:13.669> so<00:05:14.669> I'd<00:05:14.760> like<00:05:14.970> to

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
this lab putty very well so I'd like to

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.850 
this lab putty very well so I'd like to
get<00:05:15.330> it<00:05:15.419> really<00:05:15.720> hot<00:05:17.540> so<00:05:18.540> that<00:05:18.620> maybe<00:05:19.620> we'll

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
get it really hot so that maybe we'll

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:28.820 
get it really hot so that maybe we'll
get<00:05:20.040> into<00:05:20.190> that<00:05:20.340> putty<00:05:20.700> some

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:37.340 

check<00:05:29.520> and<00:05:29.640> make<00:05:29.820> sure<00:05:30.030> it's<00:05:30.290> solid<00:05:31.290> in<00:05:31.650> there

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.470 

now<00:05:38.100> so<00:05:38.940> pretty<00:05:39.570> much<00:05:39.720> what<00:05:39.840> we<00:05:39.930> have<00:05:39.960> now<00:05:40.380> is<00:05:40.680> a

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:41.480 
now so pretty much what we have now is a

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:50.300 
now so pretty much what we have now is a
floating<00:05:42.480> tooth<00:05:43.700> all<00:05:44.700> right<00:05:47.990> so<00:05:48.990> the<00:05:49.830> tooth<00:05:50.100> is

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
floating tooth all right so the tooth is

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.960 
floating tooth all right so the tooth is
just<00:05:50.490> hanging<00:05:50.850> by<00:05:51.470> this<00:05:52.470> matrix<00:05:52.770> stuff<00:05:53.280> so<00:05:53.910> I'm

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
just hanging by this matrix stuff so I'm

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.380 
just hanging by this matrix stuff so I'm
going<00:05:54.180> to<00:05:54.210> wet<00:05:54.930> some<00:05:55.250> acrylic<00:05:56.250> let<00:05:57.030> it<00:05:57.120> flow

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
going to wet some acrylic let it flow

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.920 
going to wet some acrylic let it flow
down<00:05:57.420> in<00:05:57.810> there<00:05:58.020> and<00:05:58.410> then<00:05:59.330> cure<00:06:00.330> it<00:06:00.420> and<00:06:00.630> it

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
down in there and then cure it and it

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.490 
down in there and then cure it and it
should<00:06:01.110> flow<00:06:01.350> against<00:06:02.100> this<00:06:02.310> matrix<00:06:02.790> and

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
should flow against this matrix and

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.790 
should flow against this matrix and
reinstate<00:06:04.500> that<00:06:04.530> a<00:06:04.940> that<00:06:06.350> gingival<00:06:07.350> margin

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
reinstate that a that gingival margin

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.860 
reinstate that a that gingival margin
that<00:06:08.490> was<00:06:08.610> on<00:06:08.760> there<00:06:08.880> before<00:06:08.910> that<00:06:09.420> the<00:06:09.540> matrix

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
that was on there before that the matrix

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:15.830 
that was on there before that the matrix
captured<00:06:10.820> in<00:06:12.170> itself<00:06:13.170> and<00:06:13.440> the<00:06:13.620> matrix<00:06:13.980> I<00:06:14.840> just

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
captured in itself and the matrix I just

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.330 
captured in itself and the matrix I just
like<00:06:15.960> saying<00:06:16.200> the<00:06:16.350> matrix<00:06:18.440> okay<00:06:19.440> meant<00:06:20.070> for<00:06:20.310> a

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
like saying the matrix okay meant for a

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.710 
like saying the matrix okay meant for a
little<00:06:20.490> wax<00:06:20.700> on<00:06:20.910> this<00:06:21.030> too<00:06:21.210> so<00:06:21.420> don't<00:06:21.600> get

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 
little wax on this too so don't get

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.170 
little wax on this too so don't get
acrylic<00:06:22.140> on<00:06:22.290> it<00:06:22.610> everything<00:06:23.610> else<00:06:23.910> should<00:06:24.120> be

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
acrylic on it everything else should be

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:29.650 
acrylic on it everything else should be
cool<00:06:26.180> okay

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:29.660 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:37.330 

all<00:06:30.660> right<00:06:30.840> let's<00:06:31.110> pour<00:06:31.320> some<00:06:31.350> acrylic

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:37.340 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.430 

okay<00:06:38.420> fresh<00:06:39.420> out<00:06:39.600> of<00:06:39.630> the<00:06:39.750> pressure<00:06:39.930> pot<00:06:40.200> I

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
okay fresh out of the pressure pot I

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:43.220 
okay fresh out of the pressure pot I
went<00:06:40.890> and<00:06:40.980> steamed<00:06:41.250> it<00:06:41.460> got<00:06:41.970> rid<00:06:42.120> of<00:06:42.150> that<00:06:42.330> wax

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:43.230 
went and steamed it got rid of that wax

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:45.170 
went and steamed it got rid of that wax
that<00:06:43.440> I<00:06:43.500> had<00:06:43.680> holding<00:06:43.920> that<00:06:43.980> tooth<00:06:44.220> so<00:06:44.520> cross

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 
that I had holding that tooth so cross

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:45.800 
that I had holding that tooth so cross
your<00:06:45.360> fingers

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:45.810 
your fingers

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.930 
your fingers
let's<00:06:46.410> hope<00:06:46.710> it<00:06:46.980> came<00:06:47.220> out<00:06:47.460> okay<00:06:48.980> not<00:06:49.980> bad<00:06:50.520> I

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:50.940 
let's hope it came out okay not bad I

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:58.589 
let's hope it came out okay not bad I
see<00:06:51.180> a<00:06:51.600> little<00:06:52.470> bit<00:06:52.830> of
