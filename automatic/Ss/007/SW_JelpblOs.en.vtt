00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:38.530 

so<00:02:32.500> yeah<00:02:33.500> we<00:02:33.650> had<00:02:33.799> just<00:02:34.040> emerged<00:02:37.359> from<00:02:38.359> the

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
so yeah we had just emerged from the

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.420 
so yeah we had just emerged from the
vowel<00:02:38.689> caverns<00:02:39.260> realizing<00:02:39.829> we<00:02:39.950> needed<00:02:40.219> rope

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
vowel caverns realizing we needed rope

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.240 
vowel caverns realizing we needed rope
and<00:02:41.650> though<00:02:42.650> they<00:02:42.799> wanted<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.069> buy<00:02:43.189> two

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
and though they wanted to buy two

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.460 
and though they wanted to buy two
firearms<00:02:44.120> so<00:02:44.299> we're<00:02:44.540> just<00:02:44.569> gonna<00:02:44.720> travel<00:02:45.109> back

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
firearms so we're just gonna travel back

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.440 
firearms so we're just gonna travel back
here<00:02:45.769> to<00:02:45.859> junk<00:02:46.129> town<00:02:46.400> as<00:02:47.030> if<00:02:47.239> we're

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
here to junk town as if we're

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.470 
here to junk town as if we're
discovering<00:02:47.840> it<00:02:48.140> for<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.349> first<00:02:48.590> time<00:02:48.859> again

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.179 

and<00:02:53.480> like<00:02:53.720> last<00:02:53.989> time<00:02:54.290> we're<00:02:54.650> getting<00:02:54.739> random

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:55.189 
and like last time we're getting random

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:56.619 
and like last time we're getting random
encounters<00:02:55.609> though<00:02:55.879> I<00:02:55.970> don't<00:02:56.090> think<00:02:56.389> we<00:02:56.480> saw

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
encounters though I don't think we saw

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.699 
encounters though I don't think we saw
rats<00:02:56.930> last<00:02:57.319> time<00:02:57.730> so<00:02:58.840> they'll<00:02:59.840> be<00:02:59.930> helping<00:03:00.230> in

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
rats last time so they'll be helping in

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:08.259 
rats last time so they'll be helping in
does<00:03:01.519> his<00:03:01.700> job<00:03:01.730> here<00:03:06.250> having<00:03:07.250> an<00:03:07.609> easy<00:03:07.760> time<00:03:08.060> it

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
does his job here having an easy time it

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.530 
does his job here having an easy time it
looks<00:03:08.389> like

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.819 

yes<00:03:14.540> supposedly<00:03:15.079> that<00:03:15.639> issue<00:03:16.639> of<00:03:17.060> NPCs

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
yes supposedly that issue of NPCs

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.899 
yes supposedly that issue of NPCs
blocking<00:03:18.829> the<00:03:18.950> character<00:03:19.519> is<00:03:20.680> sounds<00:03:21.680> almost

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:21.909 
blocking the character is sounds almost

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:26.679 
blocking the character is sounds almost
commonplace<00:03:22.909> I<00:03:24.220> even<00:03:25.220> saw<00:03:25.370> warnings<00:03:25.879> that<00:03:26.180> you

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:26.689 
commonplace I even saw warnings that you

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:28.690 
commonplace I even saw warnings that you
should<00:03:26.870> always<00:03:26.959> save<00:03:27.319> before<00:03:28.189> you<00:03:28.280> go<00:03:28.400> into<00:03:28.579> a

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
should always save before you go into a

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.509 
should always save before you go into a
building<00:03:29.030> in<00:03:29.329> case<00:03:29.480> it<00:03:29.689> happens<00:03:33.310> and<00:03:34.310> I<00:03:34.489> think

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
building in case it happens and I think

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.409 
building in case it happens and I think
what<00:03:35.000> they<00:03:35.120> did<00:03:36.849> at<00:03:37.849> least<00:03:38.030> I<00:03:38.150> guess<00:03:38.299> in

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:38.419 
what they did at least I guess in

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:41.199 
what they did at least I guess in
Fallout<00:03:38.840> 2<00:03:39.139> is<00:03:39.440> they<00:03:39.650> gave<00:03:39.859> you<00:03:40.040> a<00:03:40.400> drop-down

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
Fallout 2 is they gave you a drop-down

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.240 
Fallout 2 is they gave you a drop-down
you<00:03:41.449> could<00:03:41.629> shove<00:03:42.019> people<00:03:42.349> out<00:03:42.680> of<00:03:42.799> the<00:03:42.859> way<00:03:42.979> or

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
you could shove people out of the way or

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.839 
you could shove people out of the way or
ask<00:03:43.400> them<00:03:43.609> to<00:03:43.729> move<00:03:43.909> one<00:03:44.449> hax<00:03:45.489> so<00:03:46.489> it's<00:03:46.669> really

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
ask them to move one hax so it's really

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.309 
ask them to move one hax so it's really
I<00:03:47.269> I<00:03:48.819> don't<00:03:49.819> know<00:03:49.930> now<00:03:50.930> I'm<00:03:51.079> really<00:03:51.199> nervous

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
I I don't know now I'm really nervous

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.860 
I I don't know now I'm really nervous
because<00:03:51.739> I<00:03:52.220> don't<00:03:52.639> want<00:03:52.879> how<00:03:53.329> often<00:03:53.720> is<00:03:53.840> that

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
because I don't want how often is that

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:54.819 
because I don't want how often is that
going<00:03:54.169> to<00:03:54.260> happen

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
going to happen

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.080 
going to happen
I<00:03:54.859> just<00:03:55.159> hope<00:03:55.370> that's<00:03:55.549> a<00:03:55.760> really<00:03:56.030> rare<00:03:56.530> thing

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
I just hope that's a really rare thing

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.890 
I just hope that's a really rare thing
okay<00:04:00.549> well<00:04:01.549> you<00:04:01.729> survived<00:04:02.090> the<00:04:02.299> random<00:04:02.690> rat

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
okay well you survived the random rat

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.330 
okay well you survived the random rat
encounter<00:04:03.620> and<00:04:04.690> this<00:04:05.690> area<00:04:06.530> that<00:04:06.799> might<00:04:07.190> be

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
encounter and this area that might be

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.979 
encounter and this area that might be
important<00:04:07.760> will<00:04:07.909> come<00:04:08.120> back<00:04:08.299> to<00:04:08.540> I<00:04:08.569> think<00:04:08.690> when

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
important will come back to I think when

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.539 
important will come back to I think when
we<00:04:09.169> come<00:04:10.129> back<00:04:10.280> to<00:04:10.459> visit<00:04:10.639> vol<00:04:11.889> 15<00:04:12.889> with<00:04:13.519> the

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
we come back to visit vol 15 with the

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:18.470 
we come back to visit vol 15 with the
rope<00:04:15.729> but<00:04:16.729> like<00:04:17.269> I<00:04:17.389> said

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
rope but like I said

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.890 
rope but like I said
though<00:04:19.200> his<00:04:19.350> main<00:04:19.530> objective<00:04:20.070> is<00:04:20.220> to<00:04:20.250> get<00:04:20.460> to

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
though his main objective is to get to

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.880 
though his main objective is to get to
firearms<00:04:22.610> that<00:04:23.610> she<00:04:23.790> can<00:04:24.000> use<00:04:24.360> and<00:04:25.080> the<00:04:25.710> right

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
firearms that she can use and the right

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:32.600 
firearms that she can use and the right
ammunition<00:04:26.460> for<00:04:26.700> it<00:04:26.880> and<00:04:31.520> because<00:04:32.520> she

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
ammunition for it and because she

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.760 
ammunition for it and because she
doesn't<00:04:32.910> even<00:04:33.120> necessarily<00:04:33.390> trust<00:04:33.840> Ian<00:04:34.050> okay

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
doesn't even necessarily trust Ian okay

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.380 
doesn't even necessarily trust Ian okay
so<00:04:34.830> I<00:04:35.370> think<00:04:35.900> yeah<00:04:36.900> here<00:04:37.320> again<00:04:37.590> is<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:38.490> guard

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
so I think yeah here again is the guard

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.470 
so I think yeah here again is the guard
I<00:04:39.600> think<00:04:39.630> his<00:04:39.870> name<00:04:40.080> was<00:04:40.110> okay

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
I think his name was okay

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.050 
I think his name was okay
Cal<00:04:42.480> Noah<00:04:43.190> is<00:04:44.190> going<00:04:44.400> to<00:04:44.460> tell<00:04:44.610> us<00:04:44.700> that<00:04:44.850> it's

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
Cal Noah is going to tell us that it's

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.610 
Cal Noah is going to tell us that it's
closed<00:04:45.480> I<00:04:45.900> think<00:04:48.080> and<00:04:49.080> again<00:04:49.200> she's<00:04:49.500> gonna

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
closed I think and again she's gonna

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.380 
closed I think and again she's gonna
plead<00:04:53.180> okay

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
plead okay

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.840 
plead okay
don't<00:04:55.140> know<00:04:55.230> if<00:04:55.320> you<00:04:55.380> can<00:04:55.500> hear<00:04:55.650> that<00:04:55.850> excuse

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
don't know if you can hear that excuse

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.870 
don't know if you can hear that excuse
me<00:04:56.880> it's<00:04:57.210> a<00:04:57.510> battery<00:04:58.110> backup<00:04:58.500> signal<00:04:59.010> going

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
me it's a battery backup signal going

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.660 
me it's a battery backup signal going
off<00:05:00.440> it<00:05:01.440> is<00:05:01.740> not<00:05:02.040> part<00:05:02.460> of<00:05:02.520> the<00:05:02.610> game<00:05:02.820> okay<00:05:04.670> yeah

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
off it is not part of the game okay yeah

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.710 
off it is not part of the game okay yeah
so<00:05:06.090> I<00:05:06.390> think<00:05:07.380> just<00:05:07.920> to<00:05:08.190> reveal<00:05:08.940> areas<00:05:09.270> on<00:05:09.630> the

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
so I think just to reveal areas on the

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.120 
so I think just to reveal areas on the
map<00:05:09.930> just<00:05:10.680> gonna<00:05:11.400> cover<00:05:11.640> this<00:05:11.850> again<00:05:12.890> not<00:05:13.890> that

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
map just gonna cover this again not that

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.870 
map just gonna cover this again not that
we're<00:05:14.250> really<00:05:14.520> using<00:05:15.090> our<00:05:15.950> map<00:05:16.950> that<00:05:17.250> much<00:05:17.490> but

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
we're really using our map that much but

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:26.240 
we're really using our map that much but
you<00:05:18.840> never<00:05:18.990> know<00:05:24.740> yeah<00:05:25.740> as<00:05:25.860> far<00:05:26.040> as<00:05:26.100> I<00:05:26.190> remember

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
you never know yeah as far as I remember

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.540
