track<00:01:27.390> for<00:01:27.600> example<00:01:28.020> we<00:01:28.409> can<00:01:28.560> double<00:01:28.799> click<00:01:28.829> on

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
track for example we can double click on

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.800 
track for example we can double click on
that<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.549> opens<00:01:29.610> up<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.030> MIDI<00:01:30.210> editor<00:01:30.540> it's<00:01:30.720> a

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
that it opens up a MIDI editor it's a

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.690 
that it opens up a MIDI editor it's a
standard<00:01:31.140> editor<00:01:31.409> as<00:01:31.530> you'd<00:01:31.650> see<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:31.920> any<00:01:32.040> da<00:01:32.280> W

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
standard editor as you'd see in any da W

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.520 
standard editor as you'd see in any da W
and<00:01:33.210> up<00:01:33.299> here<00:01:33.509> we<00:01:33.540> have<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.750> toolbar<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.259> gives

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
and up here we have a toolbar that gives

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.350 
and up here we have a toolbar that gives
us<00:01:34.650> options<00:01:34.860> for<00:01:35.220> drawing<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:35.640> new<00:01:35.700> notes<00:01:36.060> for

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
us options for drawing in new notes for

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.630 
us options for drawing in new notes for
undo<00:01:36.750> we<00:01:37.290> can<00:01:37.409> also<00:01:37.560> transpose<00:01:38.189> we<00:01:38.490> can

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
undo we can also transpose we can

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.190 
undo we can also transpose we can
quantize<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.299> we<00:01:39.390> have<00:01:39.509> all<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.720> MIDI<00:01:39.900> editing

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
quantize so we have all the MIDI editing

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.020 
quantize so we have all the MIDI editing
functionality<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.920> we<00:01:41.040> need<00:01:41.220> shifting<00:01:41.970> over

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
functionality that we need shifting over

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.789 
functionality that we need shifting over
to<00:01:42.240> an<00:01:42.329> audio<00:01:42.570> track<00:01:42.659> will<00:01:43.140> close<00:01:43.380> up<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.560> MIDI

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
to an audio track will close up the MIDI

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.530 
to an audio track will close up the MIDI
editor<00:01:44.159> we'll<00:01:44.610> double<00:01:44.909> click<00:01:44.939> on<00:01:45.119> an<00:01:45.299> audio

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
editor we'll double click on an audio

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.319 
editor we'll double click on an audio
region<00:01:45.990> we<00:01:46.439> can<00:01:46.560> zoom<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:47.040> horizontally<00:01:47.729> we

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
region we can zoom in horizontally we

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.510 
region we can zoom in horizontally we
can<00:01:48.479> also<00:01:48.600> pull<00:01:48.960> things<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.350> tighter<00:01:49.649> we<00:01:50.340> can

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
can also pull things in tighter we can

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.109 
can also pull things in tighter we can
use<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.600> control<00:01:52.320> here<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:53.040> determine<00:01:53.970> what

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
use the control here to determine what

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.090 
use the control here to determine what
we're<00:01:54.270> looking<00:01:54.570> at<00:01:54.689> within<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.020> track<00:01:55.350> we<00:01:55.979> can

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
we're looking at within the track we can

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.859 
we're looking at within the track we can
also<00:01:56.219> pull<00:01:56.520> over<00:01:56.670> our<00:01:56.909> start<00:01:57.210> point<00:01:57.420> we<00:01:57.719> can

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
also pull over our start point we can

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.649 
also pull over our start point we can
trim<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.350> by<00:01:59.009> hitting<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.369> trim<00:01:59.579> control<00:02:00.030> we

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
trim that by hitting the trim control we

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.060 
trim that by hitting the trim control we
can<00:02:00.780> also<00:02:00.899> erase<00:02:01.320> from<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.619> track<00:02:01.829> we<00:02:01.979> can

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
can also erase from the track we can

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.160 
can also erase from the track we can
reverse<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.640> audio<00:02:02.909> file<00:02:03.270> we<00:02:03.509> can<00:02:03.600> fade<00:02:03.840> in<00:02:03.990> we

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
reverse the audio file we can fade in we

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.990 
reverse the audio file we can fade in we
can<00:02:04.320> fade<00:02:04.530> out<00:02:04.710> we<00:02:04.890> can<00:02:05.009> normalize<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:05.490> if<00:02:05.880> we

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
can fade out we can normalize so if we

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.789 
can fade out we can normalize so if we
click<00:02:06.119> on<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:07.049> entire<00:02:07.320> track<00:02:07.590> will<00:02:07.710> be

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
click on that the entire track will be

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.589 
click on that the entire track will be
normalized<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.759> course<00:02:09.030> we<00:02:09.149> also<00:02:09.300> have<00:02:09.569> our

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
normalized of course we also have our

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.180 
normalized of course we also have our
undo<00:02:10.020> functions<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.590> things<00:02:10.709> available<00:02:10.920> as

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
undo functions and things available as

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.100 
undo functions and things available as
well

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
well

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.440 
well
so<00:02:14.070> we<00:02:14.160> can<00:02:14.280> undo<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.520> normalizing<00:02:15.060> we<00:02:15.300> can

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
so we can undo the normalizing we can

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.150 
so we can undo the normalizing we can
undo<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.750> trimming<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.500> get<00:02:16.770> back<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.040> where

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
undo the trimming and get back to where

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.830 
undo the trimming and get back to where
we<00:02:17.250> started<00:02:17.280> over<00:02:17.970> here<00:02:18.120> on<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.360> left<00:02:18.570> side<00:02:18.720> of

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
we started over here on the left side of

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.170 
we started over here on the left side of
the<00:02:18.900> screen<00:02:19.080> we<00:02:19.350> have<00:02:19.470> our<00:02:19.560> track<00:02:19.830> display<00:02:20.250> so

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
the screen we have our track display so

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.730 
the screen we have our track display so
if<00:02:21.270> we<00:02:21.360> choose<00:02:21.570> this<00:02:21.840> we<00:02:22.080> have<00:02:22.230> what<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.530> track

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
if we choose this we have what the track

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.560 
if we choose this we have what the track
is<00:02:22.770> this<00:02:23.100> is<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.250> rock<00:02:23.460> drum<00:02:23.730> kit<00:02:23.940> for<00:02:24.120> example

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
is this is a rock drum kit for example

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.330 
is this is a rock drum kit for example
if<00:02:24.660> we<00:02:24.780> click<00:02:24.960> on<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:25.290> it<00:02:25.770> opens<00:02:25.800> up<00:02:26.160> our

control over some of the parameters that
are<00:02:32.850> available<00:02:33.330> we<00:02:33.420> can<00:02:33.540> shift<00:02:33.780> through<00:02:33.990> the

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
are available we can shift through the

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.390 
are available we can shift through the
different<00:02:34.350> instruments<00:02:34.710> also<00:02:34.860> by<00:02:35.070> using<00:02:35.220> the

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
different instruments also by using the

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.090 
different instruments also by using the
plus/minus<00:02:35.610> keys<00:02:36.380> here<00:02:37.380> we<00:02:37.500> have<00:02:37.650> our<00:02:37.740> insert

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
plus/minus keys here we have our insert

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.210 
plus/minus keys here we have our insert
effects<00:02:39.170> we<00:02:40.170> can<00:02:40.320> open<00:02:40.440> those<00:02:40.710> up<00:02:40.740> and<00:02:41.070> take<00:02:41.190> a

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
effects we can open those up and take a

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.560 
effects we can open those up and take a
look<00:02:41.430> at<00:02:41.520> which<00:02:41.640> ones<00:02:41.820> are<00:02:41.940> available<00:02:42.030> there

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
look at which ones are available there

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.150 
look at which ones are available there
are<00:02:42.600> 10<00:02:42.780> available<00:02:42.960> there<00:02:43.380> and<00:02:43.920> we<00:02:44.010> have

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
are 10 available there and we have

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.710 
are 10 available there and we have
editing<00:02:44.520> available<00:02:44.910> for<00:02:45.060> those<00:02:45.150> as<00:02:45.330> well<00:02:45.450> so

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
editing available for those as well so

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.260 
editing available for those as well so
you<00:02:45.960> have<00:02:45.990> access<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.620> parameters<00:02:47.070> the

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
you have access to the parameters the

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.920 
you have access to the parameters the
send<00:02:48.270> effects<00:02:48.540> worked<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.870> same<00:02:49.020> way<00:02:50.900> so<00:02:51.900> we

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
send effects worked the same way so we

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.360 
send effects worked the same way so we
have<00:02:52.020> the<00:02:52.230> 3<00:02:52.410> send<00:02:52.650> effects<00:02:52.920> there<00:02:53.130> you<00:02:53.250> can

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
have the 3 send effects there you can

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.460 
have the 3 send effects there you can
turn<00:02:53.550> them<00:02:53.670> on<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:53.820> off<00:02:54.000> for<00:02:54.240> each<00:02:54.300> track<00:02:54.600> you

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
turn them on and off for each track you

also can manage our projects here but

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:58.910 
also can manage our projects here but
one<00:03:57.780> of<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.930> most<00:03:58.019> important<00:03:58.530> sections<00:03:58.830> of

one of the most important sections of

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.680 
one of the most important sections of
the<00:03:59.010> Media<00:03:59.250> Browser<00:03:59.310> is<00:03:59.790> the<00:03:59.910> mix<00:04:00.090> down<00:04:00.300> screen

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
the Media Browser is the mix down screen

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.479 
the Media Browser is the mix down screen
so<00:04:01.290> when<00:04:01.380> we<00:04:01.470> click<00:04:01.650> that<00:04:01.860> we<00:04:02.070> get<00:04:02.190> a<00:04:02.220> screen

so when we click that we get a screen

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:03.920 
so when we click that we get a screen
here<00:04:02.610> that<00:04:02.640> lets<00:04:02.880> us<00:04:03.000> create<00:04:03.180> a<00:04:03.300> mix<00:04:03.540> down<00:04:03.690> and

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
here that lets us create a mix down and

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.240 
here that lets us create a mix down and
that<00:04:04.050> will<00:04:04.140> do<00:04:04.230> a<00:04:04.260> stereo<00:04:04.680> mix<00:04:04.860> down<00:04:05.070> of<00:04:05.190> our

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
that will do a stereo mix down of our

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.040 
that will do a stereo mix down of our
entire<00:04:05.519> project<00:04:05.790> so<00:04:06.510> if<00:04:06.600> we<00:04:06.690> click<00:04:06.840> that

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
entire project so if we click that

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.140 
entire project so if we click that
button<00:04:07.260> we'll<00:04:08.010> have<00:04:08.160> the<00:04:08.280> option<00:04:08.430> to<00:04:08.670> mix<00:04:09.000> down

we can choose to include all the effects

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.380 
we can choose to include all the effects

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
included and we can also set this up so

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.620 
included and we can also set this up so
that<00:04:20.519> we<00:04:20.640> have<00:04:20.790> separate<00:04:21.090> files<00:04:21.359> for<00:04:21.600> each

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
that we have separate files for each

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.000 
that we have separate files for each
track<00:04:21.959> if<00:04:22.080> we<00:04:22.169> want<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.350> have<00:04:22.440> a<00:04:22.500> multitrack

mix<00:04:23.280> that<00:04:23.729> we<00:04:23.820> can<00:04:23.970> then<00:04:24.060> import<00:04:24.300> into<00:04:24.510> Cubase

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900

now when we do our mix down now once our

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.200 
now when we do our mix down now once our
file<00:04:29.890> is<00:04:29.920> mixed<00:04:30.310> down<00:04:30.430> it<00:04:30.640> shows<00:04:30.790> up<00:04:31.000> here<00:04:31.180> in

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
the mixed down screen this is it right

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:38.960 
the mixed down screen this is it right
here<00:04:33.130> we<00:04:33.310> can<00:04:33.400> play<00:04:33.550> it<00:04:33.700> from<00:04:33.850> this<00:04:33.940> location

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.950 

but<00:04:39.970> at<00:04:40.090> this<00:04:40.180> point<00:04:40.450> we<00:04:40.570> also<00:04:40.690> have<00:04:40.870> the

but at this point we also have the

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.660 
but at this point we also have the
option<00:04:41.230> to<00:04:41.350> share<00:04:41.560> this<00:04:41.830> and<00:04:42.040> that<00:04:42.430> allows<00:04:42.640> us

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:40.720 
app for an iOS device I'm sure we're

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.790 
app for an iOS device I'm sure we're
gonna<00:05:40.780> see<00:05:40.990> the<00:05:41.080> others<00:05:41.290> following<00:05:41.620> right

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.580 
behind and that's gonna be a good thing
for<00:05:43.419> all<00:05:43.479> of<00:05:43.660> us

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.840 

the<00:05:47.590> other<00:05:47.710> day<00:05:47.830> I<00:05:47.860> was<00:05:48.010> working<00:05:48.280> on<00:05:48.340> my<00:05:48.400> iPad

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:48.850 
the other day I was working on my iPad

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.490 
the other day I was working on my iPad
and<00:05:49.300> what<00:05:49.450> kept<00:05:49.630> happening<00:05:49.810> was<00:05:50.170> the<00:05:50.320> battery

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
and what kept happening was the battery

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.170 
and what kept happening was the battery
kept<00:05:50.800> running<00:05:51.010> out<00:05:51.250> and<00:05:51.490> have<00:05:51.760> to<00:05:51.880> recharge

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
kept running out and have to recharge

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.400 
kept running out and have to recharge
the<00:05:52.420> iPad<00:05:52.690> more<00:05:52.870> often<00:05:53.140> than<00:05:53.290> I<00:05:53.350> normally

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
the iPad more often than I normally

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.080 
the iPad more often than I normally
would<00:05:53.740> I<00:05:54.070> couldn't<00:05:54.430> figure<00:05:54.520> out<00:05:54.640> why<00:05:54.850> that<00:05:55.030> was

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
would I couldn't figure out why that was

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.580 
would I couldn't figure out why that was
why<00:05:55.480> the<00:05:55.540> battery<00:05:55.900> life<00:05:56.050> had<00:05:56.200> changed<00:05:56.470> so

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
why the battery life had changed so

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.080 
why the battery life had changed so
dramatically<00:05:57.040> and<00:05:57.250> then<00:05:57.520> it<00:05:57.640> occurred<00:05:57.910> to<00:05:57.940> me

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
dramatically and then it occurred to me

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.730 
dramatically and then it occurred to me
the<00:05:58.570> day<00:05:58.720> before<00:05:58.750> had<00:05:59.200> turned<00:05:59.500> up<00:05:59.650> the

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
the day before had turned up the

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.020 
the day before had turned up the
brightness<00:05:59.950> on<00:06:00.250> the<00:06:00.280> screen<00:06:00.580> because<00:06:00.760> I<00:06:00.910> was

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
brightness on the screen because I was

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.700 
brightness on the screen because I was
in<00:06:01.150> a<00:06:01.210> dim<00:06:01.390> environment<00:06:01.960> so<00:06:02.410> once<00:06:02.590> I'd

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
in a dim environment so once I'd

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.020 
in a dim environment so once I'd
realized<00:06:03.040> what<00:06:03.190> the<00:06:03.280> problem<00:06:03.310> was<00:06:03.790> it<00:06:03.910> was<00:06:04.000> a

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
realized what the problem was it was a

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.850 
realized what the problem was it was a
very<00:06:04.270> easy<00:06:04.480> fix<00:06:04.780> I<00:06:05.080> just<00:06:05.440> went<00:06:05.590> into<00:06:05.710> the

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
very easy fix I just went into the

wallpaper and when I peered to the

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.250 
wallpaper and when I peered to the
brightness<00:06:09.820> slider<00:06:10.030> and<00:06:10.360> pulled<00:06:10.810> it<00:06:10.930> back<00:06:11.080> to

a<00:06:11.290> more<00:06:11.470> normal<00:06:11.530> setting<00:06:12.250> when<00:06:12.640> I<00:06:12.670> did<00:06:12.850> that

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
a more normal setting when I did that

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.310 
a more normal setting when I did that
the<00:06:13.300> battery<00:06:13.570> life<00:06:13.720> came<00:06:13.930> right<00:06:14.110> back<00:06:14.260> to

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
the battery life came right back to

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.080 
the battery life came right back to
where<00:06:14.530> I<00:06:14.560> expected<00:06:15.010> it<00:06:15.130> to<00:06:15.160> be<00:06:15.340> so<00:06:15.550> if<00:06:15.910> you<00:06:15.970> have
