instead of thirty one transport is

having an bad image in actually and

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.710 
having an bad image in actually and
therefore<00:05:31.760> they're<00:05:31.940> putting<00:05:32.479> a<00:05:32.540> lot<00:05:32.690> of

therefore they're putting a lot of

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.520 
therefore they're putting a lot of

efforts to reduce fuel consumption and

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.370 
efforts to reduce fuel consumption and
to<00:05:36.740> have<00:05:37.130> an<00:05:37.310> good<00:05:37.790> image<00:05:38.150> and<00:05:38.380> therefore

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
to have an good image and therefore

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.629
