keep someone to go back there and see
against<00:00:20.410> the<00:00:20.500> back<00:00:20.680> of<00:00:20.950> the<00:00:21.039> fan<00:00:21.279> motor<00:00:21.490> and

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
against the back of the fan motor and

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.150 
against the back of the fan motor and
then<00:00:22.090> stops<00:00:22.420> I<00:00:22.990> try<00:00:23.380> to<00:00:23.439> show<00:00:23.680> you<00:00:23.740> what<00:00:24.040> this

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
then stops I try to show you what this

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.400 
then stops I try to show you what this
one's<00:00:24.400> doing<00:00:24.669> basically<00:00:25.599> I<00:00:25.720> just<00:00:25.990> mimicked

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
one's doing basically I just mimicked

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.769 
one's doing basically I just mimicked
what<00:00:26.500> it's<00:00:26.770> doing<00:00:27.099> just<00:00:27.910> by<00:00:28.029> pushing<00:00:28.270> it<00:00:28.599> all

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:28.779 
what it's doing just by pushing it all

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.350 
what it's doing just by pushing it all
the<00:00:28.810> way<00:00:29.080> against<00:00:29.410> the<00:00:29.529> back<00:00:29.800> I<00:00:30.130> pull<00:00:31.059> it<00:00:31.210> out

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
the way against the back I pull it out

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.779 
the way against the back I pull it out
it'll<00:00:32.200> it'll<00:00:32.619> spin<00:00:33.070> free

00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:34.789 
it'll it'll spin free

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:36.759 
it'll it'll spin free
so<00:00:35.329> we<00:00:35.780> need<00:00:35.899> to<00:00:36.019> prevent<00:00:36.589> that<00:00:36.710> from

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:36.769 
so we need to prevent that from

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:39.579 
so we need to prevent that from
happening<00:00:37.210> if<00:00:38.210> your<00:00:38.390> fridge<00:00:38.600> is<00:00:38.809> on<00:00:38.930> a<00:00:38.960> GFI<00:00:39.530> you

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:39.589 
happening if your fridge is on a GFI you

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:42.250 
happening if your fridge is on a GFI you
can<00:00:39.949> just<00:00:40.129> push<00:00:40.309> your<00:00:40.489> gf5<00:00:41.030> money<00:00:41.329> to<00:00:41.719> reset<00:00:42.109> it

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
can just push your gf5 money to reset it

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.369 
can just push your gf5 money to reset it

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:48.229 
the GFI button and I'm going to test it

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:50.889 
the GFI button and I'm going to test it
and<00:00:49.010> there<00:00:49.609> we<00:00:49.699> go<00:00:49.850> that<00:00:49.969> turn<00:00:50.269> the<00:00:50.420> fridge<00:00:50.629> off

and there we go that turn the fridge off
if<00:00:51.649> it's<00:00:51.920> not<00:00:52.129> then<00:00:52.399> you're<00:00:52.549> going<00:00:52.670> to<00:00:52.729> need<00:00:52.879> to

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
if it's not then you're going to need to

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.630 
if it's not then you're going to need to
unplug<00:00:53.360> in<00:00:54.079> order<00:00:54.320> to<00:00:54.440> do<00:00:54.589> this<00:00:54.739> what<00:00:55.549> we're

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
unplug in order to do this what we're

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.299 
unplug in order to do this what we're
going<00:00:55.760> to<00:00:55.789> do<00:00:55.940> is<00:00:56.059> just<00:00:56.239> pull<00:00:56.479> the<00:00:56.659> fan<00:00:56.899> off

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:01.840 

there<00:01:01.309> we<00:01:01.430> go

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
there we go

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.109 
there we go
be<00:01:02.719> careful<00:01:03.140> not<00:01:03.260> to<00:01:03.440> break<00:01:03.619> these<00:01:03.859> II<00:01:04.119> just

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
be careful not to break these II just

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:06.850 
be careful not to break these II just
plastic<00:01:05.689> it's<00:01:05.899> probably<00:01:06.229> kind<00:01:06.380> of<00:01:06.530> easy<00:01:06.680> to

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
plastic it's probably kind of easy to

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.649 
plastic it's probably kind of easy to
break<00:01:07.069> what<00:01:07.550> I'm<00:01:07.640> gonna<00:01:07.729> do<00:01:07.970> is<00:01:08.119> here<00:01:08.360> it's<00:01:08.479> got

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
break what I'm gonna do is here it's got

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.200 
break what I'm gonna do is here it's got
this<00:01:08.780> little<00:01:09.110> clip<00:01:09.470> then<00:01:10.310> pull<00:01:10.610> that<00:01:10.819> clip

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
this little clip then pull that clip

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.370 
this little clip then pull that clip
forward<00:01:12.670> and<00:01:13.670> take<00:01:13.940> it<00:01:14.090> off<00:01:14.240> and<00:01:14.569> then<00:01:14.869> see<00:01:15.259> if

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
forward and take it off and then see if

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:27.850 
forward and take it off and then see if
I<00:01:15.470> can<00:01:15.649> strengthen<00:01:16.039> it<00:01:16.369> up<00:01:16.460> a<00:01:16.640> bit<00:01:26.319> so<00:01:27.319> here's

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
I can strengthen it up a bit so here's

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.309 
I can strengthen it up a bit so here's
the<00:01:28.069> little<00:01:28.580> clip<00:01:30.399> okay<00:01:31.810> so<00:01:32.810> I<00:01:32.869> got<00:01:33.080> that

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:33.319 
the little clip okay so I got that

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:35.590 
the little clip okay so I got that
that's<00:01:33.709> pretty<00:01:34.039> strong<00:01:34.369> and<00:01:34.729> then<00:01:35.270> I'm<00:01:35.479> gonna

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
that's pretty strong and then I'm gonna

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:44.889 
that's pretty strong and then I'm gonna
squeeze<00:01:36.020> these<00:01:36.350> down<00:01:36.970> together<00:01:40.929> tiny<00:01:41.929> bit<00:01:43.899> and

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
squeeze these down together tiny bit and

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:50.639 
squeeze these down together tiny bit and
we're<00:01:45.229> gonna<00:01:45.319> seat<00:01:45.739> this<00:01:45.979> back<00:01:46.310> on<00:01:46.879> here<00:01:46.940> and

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.740 

keep<00:01:51.649> it<00:01:51.860> more<00:01:52.099> towards<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:52.700> front<00:01:52.970> so<00:01:53.539> that

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
keep it more towards the front so that

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.109 
keep it more towards the front so that
it<00:01:53.899> puts<00:01:54.140> more<00:01:54.379> pressure<00:01:54.739> so<00:01:55.129> that<00:01:55.849> it

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
it puts more pressure so that it

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.240 
it puts more pressure so that it
squeezes<00:01:56.330> everything<00:01:56.929> down<00:01:57.259> so<00:02:00.190> this<00:02:01.190> is

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
squeezes everything down so this is

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.339 
squeezes everything down so this is
gonna<00:02:01.580> be<00:02:01.849> just<00:02:02.209> the<00:02:02.330> little<00:02:02.750> tricky<00:02:03.019> part<00:02:03.259> of

00:02:03.339 --> 00:02:03.349 
gonna be just the little tricky part of

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:11.470 
gonna be just the little tricky part of
getting<00:02:03.560> this<00:02:03.709> started<00:02:04.190> here<00:02:04.399> oh<00:02:09.550> it's<00:02:10.550> hot<00:02:11.209> on

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.910 
getting this started here oh it's hot on
my<00:02:11.599> finger<00:02:12.019> that<00:02:12.200> does<00:02:12.379> not<00:02:12.560> feel<00:02:12.830> good<00:02:14.920> there

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
my finger that does not feel good there

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.880 
my finger that does not feel good there
we<00:02:15.980> go<00:02:17.110> okay

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
we go okay

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.250 
we go okay
so<00:02:20.610> I'm<00:02:20.820> just<00:02:20.970> gonna<00:02:21.060> squeeze<00:02:21.570> in<00:02:21.870> between

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
so I'm just gonna squeeze in between
