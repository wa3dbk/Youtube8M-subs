00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
happy yeah sure do you think your form

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.350 
happy yeah sure do you think your form
is<00:01:07.560> higher<00:01:08.159> than<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.460> tour<00:01:08.820> or<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.270> it

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
is higher than the tour or is it

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.140 
is higher than the tour or is it
possible<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.840> compare<00:01:11.000> mmm<00:01:12.000> no<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.570> are<00:01:14.150> you

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
possible to compare mmm no I are you

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.600 
possible to compare mmm no I are you
know<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.540> rate<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.960> very<00:01:16.020> different<00:01:16.610> in

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
know that the rate is very different in

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.249 
know that the rate is very different in
that<00:01:17.759> perspective<00:01:18.090> close<00:01:18.600> difficult<00:01:18.840> to

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
that perspective close difficult to

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.370 
that perspective close difficult to
compare<00:01:19.590> indeed<00:01:19.890> but<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.159> think<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.759> my<00:01:21.380> you

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
compare indeed but I think on my you

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.230 
compare indeed but I think on my you
know<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.830> think<00:01:23.220> now<00:01:23.930> this<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.140> performance

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
know I think now this is the performance

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.260 
know I think now this is the performance
yeah<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:28.020> do<00:01:28.140> think<00:01:28.439> it's<00:01:28.829> better<00:01:29.040> um<00:01:29.369> skinny<00:01:30.090> or

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
yeah I do think it's better um skinny or

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.319 
yeah I do think it's better um skinny or
even<00:01:30.570> another<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.549> more<00:01:32.549> experienced<00:01:33.060> again

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
even another and more experienced again

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.420 
even another and more experienced again
so<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.689> secure<00:01:34.079> would<00:01:34.259> mine<00:01:34.439> was<00:01:34.799> my<00:01:34.979> first<00:01:35.220> on

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
so the secure would mine was my first on

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.929 
so the secure would mine was my first on
rotting<00:01:35.880> know<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.810> rob<00:01:37.530> when<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.369> was<00:01:38.490> 13<00:01:38.759> into

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 
lot of thinking thought then that would

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.870 
lot of thinking thought then that would
have<00:05:51.450> been<00:05:52.040> bettering<00:05:53.040> maybe<00:05:53.280> over-ambitious

have been bettering maybe over-ambitious

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.670 
have been bettering maybe over-ambitious
at<00:05:54.360> the<00:05:54.450> end<00:05:54.930> when<00:05:55.020> I<00:05:55.050> arrived<00:05:55.260> at<00:05:55.410> the<00:05:55.500> world

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
at the end when I arrived at the world

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.090 
at the end when I arrived at the world
that<00:05:55.800> take<00:05:56.100> up<00:05:56.280> five<00:05:56.490> yeah<00:05:57.210> um<00:05:58.110> deafening<00:05:59.010> all

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 
that take up five yeah um deafening all

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:04.880 
that take up five yeah um deafening all
people<00:05:59.600> but<00:06:00.600> uh<00:06:02.240> no<00:06:03.240> I'm<00:06:03.450> you<00:06:03.810> know<00:06:03.900> I'm<00:06:04.560> happy

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:04.890 
people but uh no I'm you know I'm happy

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.080 
people but uh no I'm you know I'm happy
because<00:06:05.040> pop<00:06:05.370> then<00:06:05.550> would<00:06:05.700> have<00:06:05.790> been<00:06:05.940> great

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
because pop then would have been great

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.110 
because pop then would have been great
and<00:06:06.620> subject<00:06:07.620> five<00:06:07.920> is<00:06:08.160> now<00:06:08.340> something<00:06:08.730> better

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
and subject five is now something better

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.240 
and subject five is now something better
I<00:06:09.480> think<00:06:10.080> it's<00:06:10.200> another<00:06:10.410> big<00:06:10.710> step<00:06:10.890> for<00:06:11.130> you

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
I think it's another big step for you

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.340 
I think it's another big step for you
