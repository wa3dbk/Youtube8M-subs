00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.720
 so hello everyone now i want to do 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:10.940
 a small review on my phone is a copy 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.429
 iphone 5 bundling you've seen in 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:17.789
 ad on 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:23.039
 and now I want you to do is review 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:25.170
 phone phone looks one-to-one under 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.090
 see the original here double 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:33.239
 apple flash mirror camera 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:35.760
 write everything is present here from behind 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:40.250
 there is a film stuck here 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.739
 plenochka here it is glass or plastic 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.039
 Something in my opinion is plastic, but here it is 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.070
 flew 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:53.449
 so what's on the left side of us 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.030
 is the volume rocker and 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:01:04.790
 switch to silent and sonorous 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:07.409
 look here mode sonorous and silent 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.070
 so now tell a little 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.210
 the phone 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:17.060
 here is the android on the processor 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:23.720
 I will give from android 4 2 2 on the processor mtk 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.720
 6577 so here's a button 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:33.240
 complete set as I said you saw 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.900
 in the ad will go 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.240
 block lightning cable and headphones so 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.159
 go to the phone itself, so look 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.130
 and I forgot to tell 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:48.630
 Simka is applied here as in the original 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:52.290
 so look at the phone itself 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.660
 from dual core running smoothly i'm here 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.400
 before selling made a reset here 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.149
 yourself 2 programs for photos 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.550
 left here look to download 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.420
 games go empty we have here to play 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:14.760
 market and here's the marketplace sing all the games 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:19.380
 swing so what else to say do in 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:22.620
 svayp down here you have a search on iphone here 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.140
 she here we have a key here 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.180
 this one is just a bad connection here 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.470
 he already does not see the map but it is normal 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.989
 because he and everyone else 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.239
 I also had phones that did not happen 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.760
 sees the network because the house is bad 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:39.840
 link see here are shortcuts 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:42.799
 access here here are the keys back and so 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.750
 then you can drag to any place 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.940
 so here's a calculator all like the original 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.250
 go to the construction site get the settings 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.090
 here is completely completely completely 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.020
 to tell 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:03:00.400
 identical as 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:03.910
 in the original here see here all here 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.960
 even here there is the Safari and itunes here 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:15.100
 here is aiklaud here everything is here is wi-fi 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:18.520
 for example everything has access so you still 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.740
 here are the main updates he would be here 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.730
 writes that there is the latest firmware 82 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:27.220
 state about it sit down see dim all 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.190

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.610
 serial number 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.040
 here is the memory here its 8 gigabytes but here 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.740
 writes that 16 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:44.410
 only if the original is doing only 16 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:45.760
 higher so what else would tell here is a watch 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.610
 also how to cut out here and now 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.680

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.940

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.630

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.310
 data connection here 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.130
 pulls back the curtain 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.610

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:10.390
