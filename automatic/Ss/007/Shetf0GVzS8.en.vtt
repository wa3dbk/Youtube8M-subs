00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
actually no no I think no no that's a

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.319 
actually no no I think no no that's a
lot<00:01:40.500> actually<00:01:40.680> that's<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.070> lot<00:01:41.250> because<00:01:41.939> if<00:01:42.210> i

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
lot actually that's a lot because if i

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.219 
lot actually that's a lot because if i
go<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.659> my<00:01:44.000> battle<00:01:45.000> reports<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.689> look<00:01:45.930> at<00:01:46.049> my

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
go to my battle reports and look at my

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.679 
go to my battle reports and look at my
actual<00:01:46.500> tournament<00:01:46.770> history<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.759> think<00:01:48.570> I

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
actual tournament history I think I

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.560 
actual tournament history I think I
scored<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:51.049> what<00:01:52.049> percentage<00:01:52.530> wise

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
scored this is the what percentage wise

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.830 
scored this is the what percentage wise
let's<00:01:54.570> see

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
let's see

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.429 
let's see
you<00:01:55.250> rank<00:01:56.250> yeah<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.479> actually<00:01:57.659> yeah<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.320> got

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
you rank yeah so actually yeah it got

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.169 
you rank yeah so actually yeah it got
harder<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.340> actually<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.759> seasons<00:02:00.090> are

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
harder it so actually the seasons are

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.090 
harder it so actually the seasons are
getting<00:02:00.390> harder<00:02:00.630> cuz<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:00.990> got<00:02:01.170> three<00:02:01.619> thousand

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
getting harder cuz I got three thousand

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.539 
getting harder cuz I got three thousand
two<00:02:02.280> thousand<00:02:03.200> 1600<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.409> then<00:02:05.069> of<00:02:05.219> course<00:02:05.250> you

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
two thousand 1600 and then of course you

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.859 
two thousand 1600 and then of course you
see<00:02:05.700> why<00:02:05.819> I<00:02:05.850> came<00:02:06.000> out<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.390> slump<00:02:06.630> in

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869
