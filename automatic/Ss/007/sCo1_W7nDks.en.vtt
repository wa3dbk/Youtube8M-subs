00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
a clicking noise which basically means

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.490 
a clicking noise which basically means
it's<00:02:29.860> all<00:02:29.950> done<00:02:30.599> so<00:02:31.599> now<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:31.780> can<00:02:31.989> pop<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.349> key

in and hopefully now you should have a
stronger<00:02:34.810> signal<00:02:35.050> when<00:02:35.349> opening<00:02:35.709> your<00:02:35.890> car
