00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 Hello everyone and today we will have this 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.309
 a small lesson disappeared nyud that is 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.800
 string jamming when we play 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.679
 overload 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:16.619
 we alternate wilderness all the time 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.340
 he is not her wilderness he is her strings well any 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.220
 songs 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:26.420
 it all alternates depending on 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:30.210
 melody and here are many beginners that here 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:34.649
 mislead them leads away that no one 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.829
 tells them that the edge of the palm is originally 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:43.770
 it should lie right here 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:47.850
 Here in this place she already initially 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:51.210
 lies with us and rises only in those 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.809
 cases when we need something not wilderness about 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:59.160
 on and even in tablature here 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:03.930
 written for example there is written to play 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:07.049
 twice chord e 5 not wilderness he them not 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.020
 wilderness he hey man both looks 2 not 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.170
 wilderness he blows them that is he makes here 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.170
 So 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:24.759
 and it turns out some garbage 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:26.560
 And these two are not the wilderness, they are there in the same tact 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:31.600
 there is a tablature too 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:34.450
 and the duration of the notes is usually two not 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:44.380
 Glushyonok will not look like this 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:59.140
 and so here and two Glushyonok will 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:02:01.000
 look like I almost 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.789
 especially now so high here 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.750
 hand bounces showing you what I 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:11.650
 just kept well the moment of impact I let go 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:16.299
 countries here and then immediately had offered again 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:19.360
 hand that is the trick is that we hand 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:23.470
 a bed not at the moment when it is written to us 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:27.000
 play wilderness he her strings and our hand 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:31.269
 here lies always and we only 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.340
 We raise when it is written that we need 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:41.620
 not stunned and she lies always 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:44.440
 well, teach it, in principle, not 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:49.150
 presents opportunities as each 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:52.209
 man does it in his own way 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:56.109
 here he holds his hand like that 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:59.709
 Everybody like a mediator holds who so 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:03.100
 who keeps there so dick knows who 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:06.280
 as it is more comfortable, for example, like here 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:10.750
 explain who does not understand at all how 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:14.769
 this is now released hand imagine well 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:19.209
 it is not literally just necessary 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:22.750
 imagine that we jump away from 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:25.090
 when we need to play a string 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.100
 wilderness he his here we pushed off 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.290
 a mediator from the parties and so that we have 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:35.739
 this part has risen but it is not straight 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.739
 in the sense we pushed as if 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:52.450
 that 's not the point here for example we played 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.670
 if we had written it was not even 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.850
 wilderness it will be written here 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:01.680
 tablature 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.680
 if we play as it is written 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:16.610
 see the mash it turns out and if we are 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.610
 play like this 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:43.349
 it turns out we suppress even where not 

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:46.629
 It is written that it is necessary to turn off well, since 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:51.300
 if we donâ€™t jam our country 

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:51.300
 will sound to infinity you 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:03.830
 and since we know that for example 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:06.650
 should sound there eighth notes then she 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:10.240
 can't sound to infinity here we are 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.240
 play for example there are eighth notes 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:23.470
 and we get it in the left chord 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:23.470
 we need to play it in cc 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.160
 not all goes 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:40.840
 and it turns out that no matter how we do it 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:45.490
 we are after we are not wilderness he is her 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:48.670
 tugged at us hand still jamming 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:52.570
 drops ending note duration 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:55.840
 so that the first note does not mix with 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:58.560
 the second one is this and what is it all for 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.560
 jamming 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.160
 not to here and so was 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.980
 and here 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:35.400
 I guess you probably understand the meaning 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.370
 but 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:56.280
 not here any song consists of wilderness he 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:07:02.070
 their not wilderness he their not sometimes we 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:07.620
 press to play clutton and sheet music 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:10.530
 sometimes we press in order to 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:15.570
 make a certain duration 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:15.570
 open strings for example here we are 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.510
 note duration by jamming 

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:27.070
 made 

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:32.410
 necessary here for what jamming is applied 

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:35.290
 and the most basic I have already spoken with 

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:36.600
 the second time I repeat the mistake is not 

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:40.810
 need to 

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:44.950
 when it is written that he does not mean the wilderness 

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:49.510
 keep your hand on the weight is always 

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:51.940
 here it is just for more seconds or 

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:54.729
 how much do we need dependencies there 

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:58.210
 from the duration of the notes exactly how it is 

00:07:54.729 --> 00:08:00.430
 and rises from the sides here and back 

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:03.669
 lies that is she lies with us 

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:08.130
 almost always and sometimes rises 

00:08:03.669 --> 00:08:13.330
 they are on the contrary that sometimes hangs hanging 

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:18.510
 but as he could, he explained maybe 

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:18.510
 someone was useful to everyone thanks so far
