00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 talking about the selection already talking about 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.430
 the Argentine and pretoria selection and 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.950
 of south africa and the world lord john 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.320
 carlos are you there good day companion 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:16.230
 How are you doing 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:19.020
 everything is not warm and keeps coming 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.450
 at night to make reports nothing more 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.880
 This will be in oviedo 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.370
 thanks for the clarification always makes 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.430
 It is true that when the 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.530
 climate the reality where I was wrong was 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.330
 staying all day with the 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.430
 heat and practically the same 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.440
 clothing when night approaches 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.809
 which is practically one hour 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.620
 5 at 6 o'clock in the afternoon here in South Africa 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.290
 they lower the thermal and the temperature makes 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.690
 definitely drops by 10 degrees if 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.830
 more or less good fit drenthe and 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.260
 can surely help me a little 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.170
 more but it's amazing what lowers the 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.790
 temperature and really at 8 it is a 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.040
 the time we are usually here 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.200
 very cold fans of 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.490
 Argentina begins to show you the 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.369
 aggressions that come from all over the country 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.900
 florida of sandy areas also some 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.500
 lounge flag in his soul over there 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.090
 further away that of juande from the bonus 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.100
 our friend Gabriel said 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.990
 remains throughout the world me 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.040
 say the boys there the one of oran here you 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.580
 I'm with people will see I have a 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.710
 little minute not to talk to them 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.920
 tell my friend it 's good they came from 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.860
 Oran jumps as was the project for 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.030
 come to south africa good the project what 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.290
 we raised last year so 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.360
 we bought in December to enter the 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.980
 fifa and wang and save up to the date of 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.180
 trips but how was saved because it is not 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.550
 easy to save to come to south africa 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.280
 to see the selection give her support and 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.190
 others and good to sacrifice some output and 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.470
 save them buy something with the 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.540
 comrades they are also companions 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.370
 good as was the fact of the 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.720
 time to come here as was the 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.790
 economic architecture that they had to 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.680
 do together in here is bet for 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.320
 aim to plan and save a savings 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.960
 for four years and good to put together very 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.180
 a lot of money and to get there, it's not going away 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.190
 to come next that Brazil too 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.900
 has to start argentina is the 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.479
 participation here in South Africa but 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.740
 you also think about the next 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.810
 it's much easier to tell when it's a 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.350
 group of friends like you we 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.450
 we came from jumps they 're going to 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.430
 say hello 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.230
 tell me how it is because it is from another place 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.180
 of the world to try to support the 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.739
 Argentina maybe you get one more 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.739
 easy must lead that has others 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.210
 but today the heat is paths and 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.920
 together 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.270
 to be curious that is that this is how it is 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.850
 Canada as it was in Canada from 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.590
 study exists and I am being more 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.060
 international 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.060
 when now 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.769
 everyone's incentive and I think that 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.900
 Argentina in this we agree did not play 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.340
 as well as to incentivize but the 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.660
 names I think are the best letter of 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.269
 presentation what the name and the 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:00.160
 I think Maradona like 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.290
 technical the margin said that there are in 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.450
 Argentina then we went with it well 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.549
 lodged denounced nothing and now I give the 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.080
 drying puts everything with the selection you 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.090
 I appreciate very much that your name sounds 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.310
 where are you coming with aura I'm from 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.690
 rosario but came from Barcelona I stayed 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.840
 without laburo last Friday and has 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.640
 made in the bronque passage let's say 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.920
 also administration all the 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.660
 we invest the truth that a good 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.670
 incentive although it's not nice to lose 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.950
 work I never tell you an incentive to 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.650
 that and well I give myself at least it is not 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:33.299
 sure it was as it is or plan it and the 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.299
 Sava was on the beach and I'm leaving 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:41.950
 the elections I'm looking for the 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.010
 strategy as for and good in this 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.120
 case by an unfortunate decision of 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.370
 the company itself sure 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.750
 but it was good that he did not encourage me 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.549
 doing the click had to do it the one 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.159
 my friend and click buy it once 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:57.349
 that what I'm going to do with that I'm going to 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:59.239
 go and good luckily the first two 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.220
 days were half pesaditos because here 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.569
 there is no transport, there is nothing 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.459
 public had rooms and designs 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.799
 complicated and the truth that a little 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.870
 disorganized in that aspect but good 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.430
 good bad experiences but 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.610
 experiences in the end to warm the 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:17.479
 selection and come that is touched by the 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.010
 wand and what I go with friends 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:22.720
 with the men who did some 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.720
 way the endurance to the selection 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:33.350
 we are on the beach the game and wide 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:35.710
 laburo said I want to leave home and the 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.710
 passage 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.469
 del rosario also live in barcelona 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:43.969
 as a mother and also from Rosario 

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:47.409
 Argentines encouraging the year selection 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:51.669
 working also in may I cracked 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:52.779
 and we're also going to let you talk to the 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.269
 last one that also has to do with 

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:56.800
 alma mater of what the group is is not 

00:04:55.269 --> 00:04:59.169
 the soul mÃ¡ter by the aspect with the 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:03.310
 curlers I do not think it's the most 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:05.200
 unruly but 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:09.010
 at this time the most important of the 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:11.980
 labor group handled very well how 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.150
 comes the theme of the night the food that 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.060
 they adapted well to South Africa that 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.440
 it always costs a little and two days ago 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.930
 It's unfortunate but I had to sleep in the 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.460
 airport because I had nowhere to fall and 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.560
 the world for us started to go from 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.880
 come here to start the World Cup up 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.080
 now it was like I was traveling these 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.750
 things you saw of 20,000 hours in a 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.120
 airport a little something but nothing 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:35.590
 we know nothing I have not left I will not go out 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.040
 I promise not to leave him no one takes no 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.620
 we believe 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:42.290
 at night for those bourgeois breads and 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.200
 from 8 o'clock the thing disappears 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.250
 policemen and the environment is totally 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.630
 heavy the truth life ends very 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.160
 early guys thank you and thank you for 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.180
 be on public television live 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.460
 for the whole country are seeing the 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.630
 obviously on the internet through everything 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.400
 the world 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:57.200
 good continuity has to do with 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.470
 this with what the fans mark 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.240
 it is joy this past hope as 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.590
 we have been saying practically all the 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.170
 editions and much more 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.610
 remarking since we are in pretoria 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:09.500
 maybe not because of what the team gave 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.080
 Argentine but that thing on the shirt 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.850
 so special plus the names of the 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.920
 more players diego armando maradona a 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.360
 absolute motivator that maybe a lot 

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.820
 criticize that as a technician you are missing 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.380
 good things all may be missing but 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.210
 I say has that magic wand as they said 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.680
 200 very good results today the 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.650
 training for the press the last 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:30.140
 15 minutes after attention of two 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.180
 players we understand that regarding the 

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:35.270
 possibilities and the orders that the 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.160
 fifa that in correlative order will go 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.230
 talking players talked wells and 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:42.020
 demichelis today it would be the turn of 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:43.300
 burdisso and clemente rodrÃ­guez obviously 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.490
 we will be on TV 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.810
 live with that press conference 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.699
 you in study if we wanted 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.289
 ask yourself first tell you 'juan cas' 

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:52.120
 thank you for the report how good it is 

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:53.740
 listen to the Argentine fans in 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.870
 anywhere in the world that passion is 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.430
 impressive and how much effort that 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.580
 do to be present in this case 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:03.340
 in the world-2010 of south africa and how 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.560
 is the subject injured on the campus 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:07.080
 how is the health of the players of 

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.879
 the 23 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.500
 Look, it's very good, you know that 

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:13.080
 highlighted the other day demichelis that was 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.909
 a great success to the best not wanted in 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.520
 that sense because it was not a decision 

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:19.259
 of maradona not playing one or two games 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.379
 friendly as it practically comes 

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:24.120
 making the Brazilian team a 

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:26.159
 friendly per week before you get to your 

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.419
 debut in the world cup the truth is 

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:29.370
 that this benefited the Argentine team 

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:31.770
 because we already know injuries of 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:34.080
 important players in practically 

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:36.210
 50 percent of the most elections 

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.430
 important that this cup of the 

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:40.949
 world gar is very good and diego 

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:43.590
 Milito who had had a slight sprain 

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:45.629
 of his right ankle is in perfect 

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:47.729
 been so we have knowledge 

00:07:45.629 --> 00:07:49.500
 let's have more precisions obviously 

00:07:47.729 --> 00:07:52.319
