00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
fingerprint magnet as you've seen I

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.210 
fingerprint magnet as you've seen I
haven't<00:01:30.840> really<00:01:31.020> touched<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.500> too<00:01:31.710> much<00:01:31.890> but

function<00:04:14.040> key<00:04:14.220> which<00:04:14.370> actually<00:04:14.880> has<00:04:15.060> to

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
function key which actually has to

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.390

trigger to activate these keys up here

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.699 
trigger to activate these keys up here
but<00:04:17.850> I<00:04:17.880> didn't<00:04:18.299> find<00:04:18.450> that<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:18.810> be<00:04:18.959> such<00:04:19.229> as<00:04:19.410> big

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
but I didn't find that to be such as big

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.460 
but I didn't find that to be such as big
as<00:04:19.829> a<00:04:19.859> problem<00:04:20.370> to<00:04:20.609> negotiate<00:04:21.389> we<00:04:22.049> do<00:04:22.200> have<00:04:22.440> a

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
as a problem to negotiate we do have a

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.980 
as a problem to negotiate we do have a
Windows<00:04:22.979> 7<00:04:23.340> key<00:04:23.760> right<00:04:23.940> here<00:04:23.970> that<00:04:24.360> gets<00:04:24.599> us<00:04:24.810> to

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
Windows 7 key right here that gets us to

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.240 
Windows 7 key right here that gets us to
the<00:04:25.080> starter<00:04:25.500> kit

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
the starter kit

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.970 
the starter kit
we're<00:04:26.550> done<00:04:26.910> the<00:04:27.720> screen<00:04:28.080> I<00:04:28.110> have<00:04:28.320> to<00:04:28.650> say<00:04:28.800> is

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
we're done the screen I have to say is

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.520 
we're done the screen I have to say is
pretty<00:04:29.430> nice<00:04:29.730> as<00:04:30.000> well<00:04:30.210> it's<00:04:30.960> not<00:04:31.020> the<00:04:31.290> best

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
pretty nice as well it's not the best

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.640 
pretty nice as well it's not the best
screen<00:04:32.510> screen<00:04:33.510> quality<00:04:33.990> but<00:04:34.200> I<00:04:34.230> thought<00:04:34.470> it

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
screen screen quality but I thought it

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.550 
screen screen quality but I thought it
was<00:04:34.800> pretty<00:04:35.100> nice<00:04:35.430> for<00:04:35.730> what<00:04:35.910> it<00:04:36.030> offers<00:04:36.560> as

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
was pretty nice for what it offers as

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.410 
was pretty nice for what it offers as
you<00:04:37.770> can<00:04:37.950> see<00:04:38.100> it<00:04:38.220> just<00:04:38.280> offers<00:04:38.760> a<00:04:38.790> 10-point

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
you can see it just offers a 10-point

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.590 
you can see it just offers a 10-point
inch<00:04:39.570> screen<00:04:39.990> 10.1<00:04:40.620> inch<00:04:40.770> screen<00:04:41.330> not<00:04:42.330> too

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
inch screen 10.1 inch screen not too

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.630 
inch screen 10.1 inch screen not too
great<00:04:42.930> but<00:04:42.960> it<00:04:43.320> really<00:04:43.530> does<00:04:43.860> look<00:04:43.890> nice<00:04:44.370> for

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
great but it really does look nice for

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.590 
great but it really does look nice for
what<00:04:44.820> you<00:04:44.970> think<00:04:45.180> of<00:04:45.300> it

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
what you think of it

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.930 
what you think of it
I<00:04:45.630> thought<00:04:46.110> Nokia<00:04:46.530> did<00:04:46.770> a<00:04:46.800> really<00:04:47.160> nice<00:04:47.430> job<00:04:47.490> of

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
I thought Nokia did a really nice job of

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.090 
I thought Nokia did a really nice job of
designing<00:04:48.120> this<00:04:48.630> netbook<00:04:48.960> and<00:04:49.350> I<00:04:49.770> really

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
designing this netbook and I really

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.010 
designing this netbook and I really
think<00:04:50.280> it<00:04:50.460> is<00:04:50.580> a<00:04:50.610> great<00:04:50.910> solution<00:04:51.180> especially

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
think it is a great solution especially

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.140 
think it is a great solution especially
when<00:04:52.170> it<00:04:52.260> does<00:04:52.410> have<00:04:52.620> the<00:04:52.740> built-in<00:04:53.160> 3G<00:04:53.430> in<00:04:53.970> it

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
when it does have the built-in 3G in it

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.360 
when it does have the built-in 3G in it
now<00:04:54.540> when<00:04:54.900> you<00:04:55.020> want<00:04:55.260> to<00:04:55.380> actually<00:04:55.560> activate

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
now when you want to actually activate

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.820 
now when you want to actually activate
the<00:04:56.520> 3G<00:04:57.030> you<00:04:57.750> will<00:04:57.960> have<00:04:58.140> to<00:04:58.320> do<00:04:58.470> that<00:04:58.590> at

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
the 3G you will have to do that at

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:59.300 
the 3G you will have to do that at
launch

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
launch

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.280 
launch
I<00:04:59.430> believe<00:04:59.760> that's<00:04:59.910> what<00:05:00.090> I<00:05:00.150> heard<00:05:00.450> so<00:05:01.110> that's

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
I believe that's what I heard so that's

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.360 
I believe that's what I heard so that's
what<00:05:01.470> you<00:05:01.560> have<00:05:01.710> to<00:05:01.830> do<00:05:01.950> is<00:05:02.070> you<00:05:02.160> have<00:05:02.310> to

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
what you have to do is you have to

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.600 
what you have to do is you have to
activate<00:05:02.850> the<00:05:02.910> 3G<00:05:03.390> once<00:05:03.540> you<00:05:03.690> get<00:05:03.810> the<00:05:03.960> device

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
activate the 3G once you get the device

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.909 
activate the 3G once you get the device
3G<00:05:05.610> let<00:05:06.060> me<00:05:06.150> to<00:05:06.720> be<00:05:06.840> honest<00:05:07.260> when<00:05:07.500> I<00:05:07.530> actually

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
3G let me to be honest when I actually

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:11.360 
3G let me to be honest when I actually
use<00:05:08.370> the<00:05:08.520> 3G<00:05:08.940> in<00:05:09.060> my<00:05:09.210> area<00:05:09.630> I<00:05:09.919> usually<00:05:10.919> got<00:05:11.040> two

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
use the 3G in my area I usually got two

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.700 
use the 3G in my area I usually got two
to<00:05:11.520> three<00:05:11.730> bars<00:05:11.970> unless<00:05:12.360> I<00:05:12.540> was<00:05:12.690> in<00:05:12.930> the<00:05:13.080> most

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
to three bars unless I was in the most

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.300 
to three bars unless I was in the most
popular<00:05:14.310> area<00:05:14.760> of<00:05:14.970> the<00:05:15.300> of<00:05:15.540> the<00:05:15.720> town<00:05:15.990> so<00:05:16.919> you

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
popular area of the of the town so you

one I did a Skype call with it but I

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.620 
one I did a Skype call with it but I
wouldn't<00:06:01.979> take<00:06:02.430> that<00:06:02.460> as<00:06:02.790> like<00:06:03.030> a<00:06:03.060> bad<00:06:03.330> thing

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
wouldn't take that as like a bad thing

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.420 
wouldn't take that as like a bad thing
for<00:06:03.870> this<00:06:04.110> machine<00:06:04.290> since<00:06:04.919> it<00:06:05.070> really<00:06:05.190> does

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
for this machine since it really does

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.490 
for this machine since it really does
have<00:06:05.610> a<00:06:05.640> lot<00:06:05.940> of<00:06:05.970> good<00:06:06.240> things<00:06:06.479> to<00:06:06.690> it<00:06:06.840> but<00:06:07.229> the

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
have a lot of good things to it but the

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.469 
have a lot of good things to it but the
speaker's<00:06:07.919> as<00:06:08.070> I<00:06:08.190> said<00:06:08.400> could<00:06:08.640> be<00:06:08.790> improved<00:06:09.210> as

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 
speaker's as I said could be improved as

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:12.320 
speaker's as I said could be improved as
well<00:06:10.110> as<00:06:10.380> the<00:06:10.710> microphone<00:06:11.070> but<00:06:11.940> other<00:06:12.120> than

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
well as the microphone but other than

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.090 
well as the microphone but other than
that<00:06:12.390> I<00:06:12.570> think<00:06:12.780> this<00:06:13.110> is<00:06:13.290> a<00:06:13.320> great<00:06:13.590> solution

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 
that I think this is a great solution

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.190 
that I think this is a great solution
for<00:06:14.130> a<00:06:14.370> netbook<00:06:14.610> especially<00:06:15.540> since<00:06:15.750> it<00:06:15.870> offers

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:16.200 
for a netbook especially since it offers

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.780 
for a netbook especially since it offers
a<00:06:16.229> lot<00:06:16.470> of<00:06:16.530> things<00:06:16.830> that<00:06:16.979> netbooks<00:06:17.400> do<00:06:17.610> not

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:17.790 
a lot of things that netbooks do not

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.870 
a lot of things that netbooks do not
have<00:06:18.169> including<00:06:19.169> the<00:06:19.200> HDMI<00:06:19.380> port<00:06:19.890> a<00:06:20.400> really

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
have including the HDMI port a really

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.450 
have including the HDMI port a really
nice<00:06:21.060> built-in<00:06:21.570> 3G<00:06:21.810> connectivity<00:06:22.590> as<00:06:23.070> well

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460
