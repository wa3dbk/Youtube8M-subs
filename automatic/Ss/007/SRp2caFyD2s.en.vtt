00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.580 
I think the thing that always drove me
was<00:01:43.479> that<00:01:43.860> if<00:01:44.860> you<00:01:45.039> strive<00:01:45.340> to<00:01:45.369> be<00:01:45.819> the<00:01:46.209> best

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
was that if you strive to be the best

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.169 
was that if you strive to be the best
you<00:01:47.590> always<00:01:47.860> gonna<00:01:48.009> push<00:01:48.190> yourself<00:01:48.640> you're

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
you always gonna push yourself you're

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:50.910 
you always gonna push yourself you're
always<00:01:49.479> gonna<00:01:49.720> have<00:01:49.840> loftier<00:01:50.350> goals<00:01:50.649> and

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
always gonna have loftier goals and

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.140 
the point in my career where his nights
I<00:04:04.050> felt<00:04:04.080> like<00:04:04.410> I<00:04:04.560> had<00:04:04.770> a<00:04:04.800> huge<00:04:05.070> advantage<00:04:05.430> it's

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
I felt like I had a huge advantage it's

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.600 
I felt like I had a huge advantage it's
a<00:04:06.209> really<00:04:06.570> powerful<00:04:06.750> feeling<00:04:07.440> but<00:04:08.100> it<00:04:08.430> was

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
a really powerful feeling but it was

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.030 
a really powerful feeling but it was
really<00:04:09.000> something<00:04:09.450> I<00:04:09.570> would<00:04:09.750> never<00:04:10.050> let

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
really something I would never let

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.210 
really something I would never let
anyone<00:04:11.340> know<00:04:11.700> because<00:04:12.660> I<00:04:13.530> think<00:04:13.830> sometimes

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
anyone know because I think sometimes

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.300 
anyone know because I think sometimes
it's<00:04:14.640> almost<00:04:15.300> demeaning<00:04:15.900> to<00:04:16.080> say<00:04:16.230> that<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:17.220> I

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
it's almost demeaning to say that and I

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.190 
it's almost demeaning to say that and I
think<00:04:17.549> when<00:04:17.670> you<00:04:17.730> compete<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.840> thing<00:04:19.080> you

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
think when you compete the thing you

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.409 
think when you compete the thing you
want<00:04:19.380> to<00:04:19.440> do<00:04:19.590> is<00:04:19.770> to<00:04:19.920> win<00:04:20.070> at<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:21.000> end<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.239> day

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
want to do is to win at the end the day

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.300 
want to do is to win at the end the day
if<00:04:21.660> you<00:04:21.870> are<00:04:22.470> an<00:04:22.590> individual<00:04:23.100> that

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
if you are an individual that

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.460 
if you are an individual that
accomplishes<00:04:23.760> the<00:04:24.000> high<00:04:24.150> level<00:04:24.570> that's<00:04:25.169> all

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
accomplishes the high level that's all

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.540 
accomplishes the high level that's all
well<00:04:25.680> and<00:04:25.830> good<00:04:25.890> because<00:04:26.160> you're<00:04:26.340> going<00:04:26.430> to

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
well and good because you're going to

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.480 
well and good because you're going to
help<00:04:26.669> your<00:04:26.790> team<00:04:27.000> win<00:04:27.030> but<00:04:27.650> as<00:04:28.650> I<00:04:28.740> said<00:04:28.950> I<00:04:28.980> was

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
help your team win but as I said I was

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.490 
help your team win but as I said I was
very<00:04:29.970> fortunate<00:04:30.240> that<00:04:30.600> I<00:04:30.990> had<00:04:31.320> that

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
very fortunate that I had that

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.110 
very fortunate that I had that
competitive<00:04:32.070> desire<00:04:32.430> and<00:04:32.700> I<00:04:32.730> wouldn't<00:04:32.970> want

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
competitive desire and I wouldn't want

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.940 
competitive desire and I wouldn't want
to<00:04:33.180> lose<00:04:33.300> it<00:04:33.450> you<00:04:34.140> know<00:04:34.200> I<00:04:34.290> think<00:04:34.530> the<00:04:34.740> great

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
to lose it you know I think the great

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.880 
to lose it you know I think the great
teams<00:04:35.220> obviously<00:04:36.140> have<00:04:37.140> great<00:04:37.350> players<00:04:37.710> but

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
teams obviously have great players but

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.520 
teams obviously have great players but
sometimes<00:04:38.760> it's<00:04:38.910> just<00:04:39.060> it's<00:04:39.300> a<00:04:39.419> combo<00:04:39.840> it's

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
sometimes it's just it's a combo it's

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.680 
sometimes it's just it's a combo it's
two<00:04:41.010> of<00:04:41.160> them<00:04:41.280> you<00:04:41.400> know<00:04:41.520> Jordan<00:04:42.360> and<00:04:42.540> Pippen
