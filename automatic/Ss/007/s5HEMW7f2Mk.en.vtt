 there you have a rebel a little cliche 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.809
 it's a very polluting balance the correct code for the door to be a little I 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.229
 not understood 

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:17.229
 besides this site 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.009
 the same year and do not know 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:22.749
 the sam neill stable 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:23.939
 a net loss 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.069
 and over two-thirds and so 

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:28.709
 now that guy are better behaved to propose a range 

00:00:28.709 --> 00:00:30.409
 chromatic 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:33.840
 I only have one word on Tuesday 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.040
 we embark world goes badly lived 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.040
 singular and for the moment 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.810
 11 then dry 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.940
 a binocular officer is on sale at the act without a license a few steps away and 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.820
 dies 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.460
 with his calm 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.040
 we took notes of a melodrama 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.440
 a track while he invented 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.970
 but this moment of glory but since the water 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.340
 capsizing 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.340
 percent to the commando 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.370
 the man of snow plagued by singing 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.520
 two soldiers denied a pulp and paper cloth with this club that's out there 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.210
 aaron mnr the beautiful places created 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.320
 ottawa 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.830
 the musician of 53 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.050
 instead of taking 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.120
 a little do not want people who love but I can not not simple 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.080
 these figures exclude a little 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.080
 and high schools starts playing the risk-all 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.080
 thank you for this idea for this idea 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.830
 archaic here the barca you have a lot of spaced in scene a little by 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:42.790
 to beat him 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.250
 a tank 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.630
 it is enough 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.570
 with that and 500 wounded 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.220
 the technician 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.470
 the contract among other walkers could have done better if I still pay it 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.650
 and a model to explore 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.050
 a message 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.810
 around them 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.050
 for example that of snow 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.220
 it's a separation 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.469
 that also for example the club is at the beginning for example 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:11.639
 a team well in place 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:13.659
 we knew that 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.659
 just next door and hit a bag of marbles 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.599
 you have a culture 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:23.709
 he accumulates 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.439
 I could speak to my beginnings but forget your words but a 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:30.669
 friendship for them to carry 

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:33.169
 edel apoula the lougatois 

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:34.339
 they do tests 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:36.329
 it's one of those who take care of that 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.339
 and then we tell them road pottery who does what 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:40.819
 nasser is a little 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.359
 a small separation 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.869
 and very nice way 

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:48.129
 I will not enter a small easy separation 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.239
 of garbage 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.169
 the diamond 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:53.969
 kino-cinÃ© tout quoi 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:55.619
 so that 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:59.729
 this is what is done in head-to-head both texts to advance 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:01.169
 the robots 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:02.309
 as usual 

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:05.309
 when there are many 

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:10.789
 as for him highlighted this case 

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:14.969
 but while israel know his envy that there is some ko 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.569
 wal-mart who is the anpe first a captivating 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:23.999
 why do you think are the dogs that captured him in a sling 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:27.999
 which was increased my performance 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.370
 here is the war that vibrates at 4 5% to 5% at 101 laps 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:35.879
 to stop walking 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.359
 but explains karim benzema 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:40.909
