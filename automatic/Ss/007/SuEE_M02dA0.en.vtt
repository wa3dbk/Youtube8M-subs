thought what I wanted all that work out

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.579 
thought what I wanted all that work out
I<00:01:02.489> did<00:01:02.789> last<00:01:03.000> year<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.449> know<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.750> didn't<00:01:04.439> get<00:01:04.530> to

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
I did last year you know I didn't get to

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.730 
I did last year you know I didn't get to
reap<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.070> rewards<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.409> it's<00:01:07.409> kind<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.650> a

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
reap the rewards of it so it's kind of a

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.580 
reap the rewards of it so it's kind of a
rotten<00:01:08.070> feeling<00:01:08.430> we<00:01:09.180> got<00:01:09.330> work<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.540> do<00:01:09.780> but<00:01:10.380> we

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
rotten feeling we got work to do but we

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.550 
rotten feeling we got work to do but we
got<00:01:10.740> work<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.070> do<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.340> get<00:01:11.490> them<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:12.260> and<00:01:13.260> I

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
got work to do to get them to and I

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.710 
got work to do to get them to and I
think<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.100> knows<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.380> I<00:01:16.380> think<00:01:17.280> he's

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
think that knows that and I think he's

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.120 
think that knows that and I think he's
on<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.869> right<00:01:19.020> track<00:01:19.080> no<00:01:19.560> doubt<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.979> have<00:01:20.009> to

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
on the right track no doubt you have to

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.190 
on the right track no doubt you have to
ask<00:01:20.340> him<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.119> think<00:01:21.420> he<00:01:21.600> will<00:01:21.689> articulate

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
ask him and I think he will articulate

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.840 
ask him and I think he will articulate
it<00:01:22.350> very<00:01:22.530> well<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.920> he's<00:01:23.040> on<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.280> right<00:01:23.430> yeah

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
it very well and he's on the right yeah

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.020 
it very well and he's on the right yeah
I<00:01:24.150> have<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> lost<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.580> two<00:01:26.820> seed

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
I have a lost to the to the two seed

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.469 
I have a lost to the to the two seed
into<00:01:27.180> one<00:01:27.420> seed<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:28.200> know<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.610> I'm<00:01:29.790> more

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
into one seed and I know that I'm more

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.690 
into one seed and I know that I'm more
than<00:01:30.630> capable<00:01:30.810> of<00:01:31.259> turning<00:01:32.100> both<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.579> those

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
than capable of turning both of those

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.880 
than capable of turning both of those
matches<00:01:32.909> in<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.570> different<00:01:33.869> direction<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.500> think

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
matches in a different direction I think

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.640 
matches in a different direction I think
it's<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.130> matter<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.520> doing<00:01:36.180> what<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.630> do<00:01:36.900> to

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
it's a matter of doing what you do to

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.249 
it's a matter of doing what you do to
get<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.100> last<00:01:38.369> peak<00:01:39.180> or<00:01:39.420> edge<00:01:39.600> audio<00:01:40.049> right

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
get the last peak or edge audio right

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.810 
get the last peak or edge audio right
now<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.829> that's<00:01:41.040> where<00:01:41.310> we're<00:01:41.430> at<00:01:41.520> we're<00:01:41.700> at<00:01:41.790> a

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
now and that's where we're at we're at a

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.090 
now and that's where we're at we're at a
peak<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.079> most<00:01:43.290> exciting<00:01:43.470> part

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
peak this is the most exciting part

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.920 
peak this is the most exciting part
