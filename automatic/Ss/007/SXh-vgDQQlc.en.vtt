over<00:06:30.340> there<00:06:31.229> actually<00:06:32.229> I<00:06:32.800> guess<00:06:33.039> we<00:06:33.159> can<00:06:33.310> skip

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 
over there actually I guess we can skip

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.230 
over there actually I guess we can skip
that<00:06:34.319> all<00:06:35.319> we<00:06:35.500> have<00:06:35.620> to<00:06:35.740> do<00:06:35.919> is<00:06:36.099> just<00:06:36.310> jump<00:06:37.120> over

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 
that all we have to do is just jump over

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:45.540 
that all we have to do is just jump over
here<00:06:40.440> so<00:06:41.440> um<00:06:43.590> we<00:06:44.590> can<00:06:44.770> actually<00:06:44.919> pick<00:06:45.250> this<00:06:45.400> up

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:45.550 
here so um we can actually pick this up

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:51.719 
here so um we can actually pick this up
now<00:06:45.789> and<00:06:49.919> there's<00:06:50.919> kind<00:06:51.130> of<00:06:51.250> a<00:06:51.370> little<00:06:51.490> game

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:51.729 
now and there's kind of a little game

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:54.629 
now and there's kind of a little game
that<00:06:51.759> you<00:06:52.060> have<00:06:52.180> to<00:06:52.270> play<00:06:52.449> right<00:06:52.630> here<00:06:52.690> oh<00:06:53.639> I

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 
that you have to play right here oh I

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:59.269 
that you have to play right here oh I
guess<00:06:55.029> it<00:06:55.210> always<00:06:55.599> breaks<00:06:56.080> it<00:06:56.349> I<00:06:57.360> don't<00:06:58.360> know

00:06:59.269 --> 00:06:59.279 
guess it always breaks it I don't know

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:03.540 
guess it always breaks it I don't know
it<00:07:00.279> used<00:07:00.550> to<00:07:00.729> be<00:07:00.849> like<00:07:00.880> you<00:07:01.360> have<00:07:01.479> to<00:07:02.520> you<00:07:03.520> have

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:03.550 
it used to be like you have to you have

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.290 
it used to be like you have to you have
to<00:07:03.669> aim<00:07:03.940> it<00:07:04.150> there<00:07:04.360> though<00:07:04.599> I<00:07:04.840> guess<00:07:05.440> it<00:07:05.620> just

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.300 
to aim it there though I guess it just

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:11.309 
to aim it there though I guess it just
instantly<00:07:07.300> breaks<00:07:07.629> it<00:07:07.930> now<00:07:08.940> but<00:07:09.940> um<00:07:10.319> it's

00:07:11.309 --> 00:07:11.319 
instantly breaks it now but um it's

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:14.249 
instantly breaks it now but um it's
whatever<00:07:11.729> and<00:07:12.729> I<00:07:13.300> think<00:07:13.539> you<00:07:13.629> can<00:07:13.779> just<00:07:13.930> jump

00:07:14.249 --> 00:07:14.259 
whatever and I think you can just jump

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:22.879 
whatever and I think you can just jump
off<00:07:14.409> here<00:07:17.729> but<00:07:18.729> uh<00:07:18.759> ooh<00:07:21.210> you<00:07:22.210> know<00:07:22.330> what

off here but uh ooh you know what

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:24.659 
off here but uh ooh you know what
probably<00:07:23.889> could<00:07:24.009> have<00:07:24.069> gotten<00:07:24.340> that<00:07:24.400> hard

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:24.669 
probably could have gotten that hard

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:30.320 
probably could have gotten that hard
piece<00:07:25.590> that's<00:07:26.590> all<00:07:26.740> right

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:30.330
