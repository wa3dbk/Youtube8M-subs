00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:09.750
 today not that I fight the truth that today in 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:12.300
 the team had 44 clear goals 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.330
 Argentines but if they are upset with 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.279
 our missions because I think that 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.619
 a lot is an extraordinary tournament and 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.970
 extraordinary today like the great 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.100
 scoring are and came out with gunpowder 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.470
 wet as it says over there did not come out with 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.640
 marksmanship as they want to say and how 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.519
 goodbye people give me a lot of courage 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.050
 a lot of courage because I do not think 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.940
 they're being fair to a guy who's 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.309
 killing on the court thanks to pooch 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.929
 we are in this distance what is important 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.999
 is to be in an easy following and another 

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:41.370
 we had made a great game 

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:43.109
 today, the goals did not fall 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.850
 We wanted to add games, the goals 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:47.069
 and today his team is planted in the 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.780
 semifinal when hector has not passed 

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:50.909
 they were fine in the group by the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.309
 television and I want them to be more 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:55.019
 benevolent with their players they are 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.479
 killing to get something for them 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.999
 so that the happiness of all of us 

00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:01.829
 and of course and our great hobby I 

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:04.019
 that I asked that great hobby that 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.830
 behaved as such with a great hobby 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.600
 what is 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.420
 when a player who has been killed comes out 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.520
 a mini-project for getting us in 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.440
 this phase seems to me that people would have 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.030
 that overflow in applause for him because 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.700
 that is the moment that people need 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.740
 the player to his people not when he makes a 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.240
 goal and everyone celebrates this is the 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.510
 moment where pooch had to see leave 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.670
 cheered by the table for the 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.080
 americanistas when you win a match 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.110
 you go to a song that are first 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.450
 three goals you have a wide difference 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.370
 they have to make three goals here in 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.380
 london interned it seems to me that you 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.310
 you can play with everything you did 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.110
 of entry but in the first it is done or 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.090
 you look for it and we did it and what 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.650
 We looked for two hours they had to 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.840
 obligation meets a goal of 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:55.200
 very good height also not one nor one 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.980
 chance more not one I'm not happy 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.200
 because this team already 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.860
 I think we have a team 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.780
 to move forward but the some errors in 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.230
 the part of life cost us the 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.790
 elimination 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.260
 I think we played to have deserved 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.450
 at least one goal 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.000
 we did not have then they are mistakes and 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.390
 conscious 57 of bay errors in each 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.390
 match
