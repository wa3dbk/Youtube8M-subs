00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.800
 welcome again 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.640
 the reuse 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.410
 today we are going to reuse notebooks with 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.750
 back to school the places if we can 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.390
 give a hand to those who can not 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.180
 buy notebooks and have the notebooks 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.369
 since last year that we left them 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.790
 few leaves because we can also 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:36.129
 reuse let's make a video 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.050
 different from what I did with the 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.040
 reuse of notebooks that I will leave 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.770
 around here the link 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.530
 if you want you can not take a look no 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.020
 it's going to be something different but we also 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.469
 will help well in addition to the 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.410
 notebooks that we are going to have 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:56.120
 we will need with the white one a rule the 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.449
 cutter 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.809
 a pencil some scissors we will need 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:06.650
 a piece of cloth I use this that 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:09.080
 has james or cowboy cloth is worth and 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.110
 we will also need a plastic bag 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.620
 it does not matter any massive plastic bag 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.620
 all right 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.280
 the particular that has this form of 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.680
 it's because on the previous trip that I 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.660
 I had taught them to recycle notebooks 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.400
 what we did was remove the 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.640
 spiral 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.460
 and gather all the leaves that are a 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.270
 left over from the notebook 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.610
 and put back the spiral that happens that 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.220
 that only serves for the spirals 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.500
 which are equal is to say that they have the 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.000
 same number of perforations in all 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.979
 the notebooks is to say that all 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.350
 notebooks are the same type but as 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.950
 you can see here these notebooks are not 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.140
 same do not have the same number of 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.360
 perforations would therefore not match 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.570
 the spirals 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.440
 well then what we do is 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.440
 to look for them 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.040
 those that are clean 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.900
 and with a rule 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.290
 Well let's take a measure 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.780
 I was 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.580
 let's take a measurement which we are going to 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.180
 cut all the leaves to that extent 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.180
 OK 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.830
 both this notebook and all the 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.830
 notebooks that we have 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:37.960
 well then with the cutter that is a lot 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.260
 easier where we have done the 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:44.299
 the lines 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.299
 ok let's remove 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.500
 let's take a number of sheets 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.990
 and in this case I have more or less 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:59.030
 100 sheets 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.030
 They are from different notebooks but 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.150
 which coincide by the long at least 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.270
 in long it has to match that yes 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.430
 it is also important 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.720
 and once we have the 100 sheets or 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.990
 what do we want, what do I want? 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.700
 I prefer it to be 100 sheets down 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.650
 because it's going to be a notebook is that the 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.810
 guys are going to take to school 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.810
 It has to be something that does not weigh much 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:28.790
 our sheet our plastic bag with 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.790
 our piece of plastic 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.290
 let's paste it 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.760
 where we have cut on the side that we have 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.569
 chopped up 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.319
 to put white glue 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.469
 we match well 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:48.480
 We accept about the plastic bag 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:51.599
 we put on the plastic bag 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.940
 and this we are going to push towards the wall 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:57.180
 from somewhere or table we are 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:00.510
 working and we press in this way 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.810
 it's worth to equal everything towards 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.810
 wall 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.510
 we are going to press it and here we will have to 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.510
 match everything 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.860
 and let's let this dry 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.410
 we leave it like this for as long as it is 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.550
 necessary 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.550
 so that soccer that 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.800
 once it has dried I here I already have 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.800
 a previous one that I made has dried 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.320
 It is dry but I have also returned to 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:39.200
 add more glue so I've gone back to 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.390
 let dry another time more because it is 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.920
 very important that the tail is in 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.260
 contact with all the sheets so that 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.870
 obviously the leaves do not come out well 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.280
 once it is finished and the second time 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:54.770
 that we have queued 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:57.020
 today we are going to take the piece of cloth 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.440
 that has to have the length of the 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.440
 leaves 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:07.360
 let's take the tapas, it's with him 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:11.800
 covers also the same width as 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.830
 leaves well then we take the piece of 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.500
 cloth 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.500
 in the center we will put with the white 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:23.080
 generous with the crown 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:30.380
 once we have put in the center 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:33.020
 white shape we take the leaves together with 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.750
 the tapas and we're going to 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.500
 apply in the center where we have put 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.500
 the white tail 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.050
 ok now we are going to 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.430
 let's apply 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.430
 more white tail 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.990
 at the end of pasting 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.990
 what would be the tapas 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.930
 we let this be what we're going to see 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:11.510
 how are we going to stay 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:13.940
 good and this is how we have left 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:16.790
 this can change this can put 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:18.680
 What you want, I have is that 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:22.580
 to show them that they come for example 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:26.300
 this as it looks was a box of 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:28.320
 detergent the caps did not and what I did 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.910
 by cutting 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.770
 the covers 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:35.220
 and here stick with zeal 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:38.580
 the two caps 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:42.000
 and that's how we have the level 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:44.940
 perfectly usable is worth all the 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.040
 sheets are well glued 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:50.450
 and the guys can not use it either 

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:54.290
 for the subjects or simply for 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:54.290
 any type of notes 

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:59.990
 well this is how we have been the 

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.310
 today's work I hope you help them 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.870
 I hope you can too 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.450
 do 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:08.420
 I hope I have collaborated a little with the 

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:10.280
 return to classes of the boys then we 

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.700
 we see in the next video until the 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.700
 next
