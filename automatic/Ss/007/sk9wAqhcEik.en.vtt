will work so one bit goes into the USB
and<00:04:47.580> that<00:04:47.730> up<00:04:48.210> a<00:04:48.330> bit<00:04:48.360> goes<00:04:48.660> in<00:04:48.870> tomorrow<00:04:49.310> hdmi

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
off and get a USB the component which

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
off and get a USB the component which
would<00:04:54.210> be<00:04:54.330> quite<00:04:54.540> cool<00:04:56.120> so<00:04:57.120> that's<00:04:57.510> my<00:04:57.720> video
