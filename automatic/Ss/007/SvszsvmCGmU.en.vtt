 It may be a good thing to do in your life and it will be now. 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.269
 These days I went to talk in Belo horizonte 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:21.890

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:26.349
 when I leave there 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.650
 The pass was to take me to the port that was with me. 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.429
 he exposed 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:35.949
 and then instead of going through the road he decided to spend an entire neighborhood 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:38.520
 called new sale 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.580
 when I was passing that neighborhood 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.800
 In front of a square I said yes to tax 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.720
 I was posture that 38 years ago 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.030
 only he can only rise to the attack without him 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.740
 he went up 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.290
 give a stop that in front of your house 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.699
 if you are a white haired lady 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:59.040
 already the elderly 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.270
 I told the lady you lived here a long time ago. 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.440
 she said that my whole life 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.320
 this is where a widow lives 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.320
 called from the beginning 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.570

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.690

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.320
 in the same house 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.039

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.380
 without having anything to eat 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.380
 I was going to visit by the widow and she would give me 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.340
 a cheese she makes at home and when I'm done 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.640
 She knew I would go there just to comply. 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.350
 who is hungry was single yet 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.820

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.770
 I feed myself 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.720
 I rang the bell 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.060
 and tells her daughter who she is. 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.670

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.159
 Then he came home full of mud. 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:26.939
 that same kitchen that same room isolated side of the straw of taboa 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:28.159

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:30.439

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.209
 it was bullshit 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.919
 meanwhile because it was cold 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:12.899
 but people suffer from deflation 

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:15.629
