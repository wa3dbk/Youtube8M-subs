switches<00:01:17.759> I'm<00:01:17.909> not<00:01:18.060> sure<00:01:18.240> if<00:01:18.330> it's<00:01:18.390> like

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
switches I'm not sure if it's like

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.870 
switches I'm not sure if it's like
there's<00:01:19.229> two<00:01:19.500> options<00:01:19.530> two<00:01:20.250> times<00:01:20.460> pick<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.790> up

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
there's two options two times pick it up

over<00:02:41.970> like<00:02:42.330> drones<00:02:42.600> so<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:42.900> really<00:02:43.290> have<00:02:43.320> to

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
over like drones so you really have to

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.350 
over like drones so you really have to
hurry<00:02:44.220> up<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.489> kill<00:02:44.700> everything<00:02:44.970> otherwise

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
hurry up and kill everything otherwise

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.620 
hurry up and kill everything otherwise
they'll<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.920> know<00:02:46.950> take<00:02:47.670> over<00:02:47.700> more<00:02:48.030> people

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.910 

okay<00:02:51.630> I'm<00:02:51.690> gonna<00:02:51.810> stop<00:02:52.049> that<00:02:52.200> because<00:02:52.739> it's

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
okay I'm gonna stop that because it's

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.850 
okay I'm gonna stop that because it's
probably<00:02:53.190> annoying<00:02:53.640> I<00:02:54.320> don't<00:02:55.320> know<00:02:55.380> I<00:02:55.410> say<00:02:55.680> I'm

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
probably annoying I don't know I say I'm

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.759 
probably annoying I don't know I say I'm
a<00:02:55.890> lot<00:02:56.130> my<00:02:56.510> voice<00:02:57.510> overs<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.080> if<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:58.560> have<00:02:58.739> a

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
a lot my voice overs and if you have a

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.400 
a lot my voice overs and if you have a
problem<00:02:59.190> with<00:02:59.310> that

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
problem with that

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.559 
problem with that
stop<00:03:01.410> watching<00:03:01.590> my<00:03:01.800> videos<00:03:05.330> nobody's<00:03:06.330> forcing

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
stop watching my videos nobody's forcing

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.180 
stop watching my videos nobody's forcing
you<00:03:07.910> that's<00:03:08.910> what<00:03:09.060> annoys<00:03:09.209> me<00:03:09.390> about<00:03:09.480> people

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
you that's what annoys me about people

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.010 
you that's what annoys me about people
they<00:03:11.190> they<00:03:11.459> expect<00:03:12.060> they're<00:03:12.390> guaranteed

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
they they expect they're guaranteed

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.170 
they they expect they're guaranteed
stuff<00:03:15.680> not<00:03:16.680> guarantee<00:03:17.070> guaranteed<00:03:17.850> stuff

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
stuff not guarantee guaranteed stuff

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.270 
stuff not guarantee guaranteed stuff
they<00:03:18.480> think<00:03:18.510> they<00:03:18.750> can<00:03:18.900> change<00:03:18.930> me<00:03:19.290> I'm

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
they think they can change me I'm

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.730 
they think they can change me I'm
unchangeable<00:03:21.060> so<00:03:21.570> anyway<00:03:21.840> this<00:03:22.200> assassin

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
unchangeable so anyway this assassin

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:23.900 
unchangeable so anyway this assassin
right<00:03:22.830> here<00:03:22.980> I<00:03:23.010> was<00:03:23.100> trying<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.340> kill<00:03:23.520> him<00:03:23.580> fast

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
right here I was trying to kill him fast

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.820 
right here I was trying to kill him fast
so<00:03:24.150> that<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.390> harbinger<00:03:25.020> can<00:03:25.380> take<00:03:25.590> him<00:03:25.740> over

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
so that a harbinger can take him over

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.760 
so that a harbinger can take him over
but<00:03:26.160> I<00:03:26.220> think<00:03:26.459> in<00:03:26.550> a<00:03:26.580> failing<00:03:27.270> or<00:03:27.390> something<00:03:27.770> do

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
but I think in a failing or something do

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.840 
but I think in a failing or something do
we<00:03:28.860> get<00:03:28.980> him<00:03:29.360> God<00:03:30.360> with<00:03:30.510> our<00:03:30.720> good<00:03:31.310> again<00:03:32.310> yeah

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
we get him God with our good again yeah

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.330 
we get him God with our good again yeah
I<00:03:32.880> got<00:03:33.239> him<00:03:33.330> but<00:03:34.020> no<00:03:34.140> another<00:03:34.890> wave<00:03:35.070> is<00:03:35.220> going

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
I got him but no another wave is going

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.270 
I got him but no another wave is going
to<00:03:35.400> come<00:03:35.550> in<00:03:35.640> here<00:03:35.820> and<00:03:36.830> there<00:03:37.830> was<00:03:37.950> actually

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
to come in here and there was actually

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.670 
to come in here and there was actually
another<00:03:38.340> Harbinger<00:03:38.970> that<00:03:39.150> got<00:03:39.440> appeared<00:03:40.440> I

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
another Harbinger that got appeared I

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.410 
another Harbinger that got appeared I
think<00:03:41.310> it<00:03:41.370> was<00:03:41.459> like<00:03:41.550> one<00:03:41.790> of<00:03:41.820> the<00:03:41.970> ones<00:03:42.120> I<00:03:42.269> left

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
think it was like one of the ones I left

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.170 
think it was like one of the ones I left
over<00:03:43.220> but<00:03:44.220> yeah<00:03:44.340> these<00:03:44.489> guys<00:03:44.550> are<00:03:44.730> the

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
over but yeah these guys are the

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.090 
over but yeah these guys are the
harbingers<00:03:45.600> are<00:03:45.780> just<00:03:45.989> like<00:03:46.170> whenever<00:03:46.709> you're

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
harbingers are just like whenever you're

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.259 
harbingers are just like whenever you're
in<00:03:47.130> a<00:03:47.280> collector<00:03:47.670> level<00:03:48.000> where<00:03:48.150> you're

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
in a collector level where you're

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.880 
in a collector level where you're
fighting<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.570> collectors<00:03:48.989> these<00:03:49.290> harbingers

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
fighting the collectors these harbingers

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.600 
fighting the collectors these harbingers
are<00:03:50.070> a<00:03:50.100> pain<00:03:50.459> in<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.640> ass<00:03:50.850> and<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:53.310> fact<00:03:53.519> that

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
are a pain in the ass and the fact that

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.820 
are a pain in the ass and the fact that
you're<00:03:53.760> playing<00:03:54.030> on<00:03:54.150> insanity<00:03:54.780> doesn't<00:03:55.350> help

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
you're playing on insanity doesn't help

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.030 
you're playing on insanity doesn't help
the<00:03:56.070> fact<00:03:56.900> the<00:03:57.900> reason<00:03:58.260> you<00:03:58.530> picked<00:03:58.709> up<00:03:58.860> the

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
the fact the reason you picked up the

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.699 
the fact the reason you picked up the
particle<00:03:59.640> collector<00:03:59.820> actually<00:04:00.330> or<00:04:00.709> collector

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
particle collector actually or collector

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.220 
particle collector actually or collector
particle<00:04:02.310> beam<00:04:02.519> is<00:04:02.730> that<00:04:02.790> it's<00:04:03.600> really<00:04:04.019> good

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
particle beam is that it's really good

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.460 
particle beam is that it's really good
against<00:04:04.530> barriers<00:04:05.040> and<00:04:06.110> the<00:04:07.110> thing<00:04:07.290> with<00:04:07.410> it

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
against barriers and the thing with it

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.590 
against barriers and the thing with it
is<00:04:07.620> it<00:04:07.890> uses<00:04:08.250> ammunition<00:04:08.940> it<00:04:09.120> doesn't<00:04:09.480> like

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
is it uses ammunition it doesn't like

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.350 
is it uses ammunition it doesn't like
it's<00:04:09.989> not<00:04:10.110> like<00:04:10.170> a<00:04:10.290> rocket<00:04:10.709> launcher<00:04:11.100> so<00:04:11.850> you

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
it's not like a rocket launcher so you

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.210 
it's not like a rocket launcher so you
can<00:04:12.510> like<00:04:12.660> get<00:04:12.959> a<00:04:13.170> lot<00:04:13.410> of<00:04:13.440> heavy<00:04:13.680> weapon<00:04:14.040> ammo

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
can like get a lot of heavy weapon ammo

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.500 
can like get a lot of heavy weapon ammo
for<00:04:14.519> it<00:04:14.579> really<00:04:14.910> easily<00:04:15.120> so<00:04:17.299> usually<00:04:18.299> if

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
for it really easily so usually if

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.000 
for it really easily so usually if
you're<00:04:18.870> running<00:04:19.019> really<00:04:19.320> low<00:04:19.530> on<00:04:19.560> ammo<00:04:19.799> like

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
you're running really low on ammo like

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.890 
you're running really low on ammo like
you're<00:04:20.160> at<00:04:20.250> zero<00:04:20.489> you'll<00:04:20.669> pick<00:04:20.880> up<00:04:20.970> about<00:04:21.180> 200

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
you're at zero you'll pick up about 200

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.430 
you're at zero you'll pick up about 200
shots<00:04:21.930> which<00:04:22.530> is<00:04:22.710> really<00:04:23.190> good<00:04:23.430> and<00:04:24.440> although

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
shots which is really good and although

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.010 
shots which is really good and although
it's<00:04:25.590> not<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.830> most<00:04:25.950> powerful<00:04:27.590> powerful<00:04:28.590> uh

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
it's not the most powerful powerful uh

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.930 
it's not the most powerful powerful uh
heavy<00:04:31.020> weapons<00:04:31.410> i<00:04:31.680> like<00:04:31.890> it<00:04:32.070> just<00:04:32.340> because<00:04:32.669> of

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
heavy weapons i like it just because of

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.830 
heavy weapons i like it just because of
ammo<00:04:33.419> a<00:04:35.090> paired<00:04:36.090> compared<00:04:36.510> to<00:04:36.600> like<00:04:36.690> the

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
ammo a paired compared to like the

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
ammo a paired compared to like the
rocket<00:04:37.140> launchers<00:04:37.440> where<00:04:37.560> you<00:04:37.650> get<00:04:37.740> like

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
rocket launchers where you get like

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.860 
rocket launchers where you get like
three<00:04:38.130> rockets<00:04:38.580> /<00:04:38.820> heavy<00:04:39.090> weapon<00:04:39.419> thing<00:04:39.600> I

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
three rockets / heavy weapon thing I

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.860 
three rockets / heavy weapon thing I
which<00:04:40.320> is<00:04:40.470> I<00:04:40.590> think<00:04:40.620> is<00:04:41.130> really<00:04:41.160> useless<00:04:41.760> but<00:04:42.660> i

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
which is I think is really useless but i

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.390 
which is I think is really useless but i
will<00:04:43.169> use<00:04:43.440> it<00:04:43.650> the<00:04:43.830> only<00:04:43.979> problem<00:04:44.190> with<00:04:44.340> the

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
will use it the only problem with the

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.890 
will use it the only problem with the
collector<00:04:44.700> particle<00:04:45.120> beam<00:04:45.240> is<00:04:45.419> it's<00:04:45.600> really

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
collector particle beam is it's really

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.040 
collector particle beam is it's really
not<00:04:46.110> that<00:04:46.169> good<00:04:46.440> against<00:04:46.830> armor

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
not that good against armor

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.409 
not that good against armor
and<00:04:48.530> don't<00:04:49.220> get<00:04:49.310> me<00:04:49.370> wrong<00:04:49.580> some<00:04:50.090> of<00:04:50.210> the<00:04:50.270> heavy

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
and don't get me wrong some of the heavy

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.180 
and don't get me wrong some of the heavy
weapons<00:04:50.720> later<00:04:50.900> on<00:04:51.080> or<00:04:51.229> better<00:04:51.409> but<00:04:51.710> at<00:04:51.889> this

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
weapons later on or better but at this

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.930 
weapons later on or better but at this
time<00:04:52.250> you<00:04:53.120> want<00:04:53.300> to<00:04:53.389> use<00:04:53.539> the<00:04:54.699> collector<00:04:55.699> beams

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
time you want to use the collector beams

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.939 
time you want to use the collector beams
I<00:04:56.419> think<00:04:57.169> it's<00:04:57.259> much<00:04:57.440> better<00:04:57.590> than<00:04:57.800> the

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
I think it's much better than the

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:01.180 
I think it's much better than the
current<00:04:58.099> aid<00:04:58.220> launcher<00:04:58.610> obviously<00:05:00.039> so<00:05:01.039> yeah

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
current aid launcher obviously so yeah

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.129 
current aid launcher obviously so yeah
that's<00:05:01.669> about<00:05:02.270> it<00:05:02.389> you<00:05:02.599> don't<00:05:02.840> want<00:05:02.930> to<00:05:03.080> look

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
that's about it you don't want to look

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:05.800 
that's about it you don't want to look
these<00:05:03.289> drones<00:05:03.949> lift<00:05:04.250> for<00:05:04.610> too<00:05:04.729> long<00:05:04.909> there

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
these drones lift for too long there

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.570 
these drones lift for too long there
another<00:05:06.050> Harbinger<00:05:06.949> came<00:05:07.159> and<00:05:07.310> I<00:05:07.340> was<00:05:07.430> liking

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
another Harbinger came and I was liking

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.330 
another Harbinger came and I was liking
pissed<00:05:07.940> off<00:05:08.120> a<00:05:08.930> nice<00:05:09.530> little<00:05:09.740> strategy<00:05:10.190> though

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
pissed off a nice little strategy though

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.450 
pissed off a nice little strategy though
is<00:05:10.400> you<00:05:10.639> can<00:05:10.789> use<00:05:10.819> warp<00:05:11.780> like<00:05:12.680> just<00:05:12.979> warp<00:05:13.310> him

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
is you can use warp like just warp him

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.570 
is you can use warp like just warp him
to<00:05:13.610> death<00:05:13.789> just<00:05:14.539> sit<00:05:14.750> behind<00:05:14.870> cover<00:05:15.139> and<00:05:15.590> yeah

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
to death just sit behind cover and yeah

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.129 
to death just sit behind cover and yeah
here<00:05:16.789> I<00:05:16.819> don't<00:05:17.030> want<00:05:17.180> to<00:05:17.240> use<00:05:17.330> any<00:05:17.449> my<00:05:20.139> didn't

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
here I don't want to use any my didn't

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:22.779 
here I don't want to use any my didn't
want<00:05:21.259> to<00:05:21.349> use<00:05:21.440> any<00:05:21.469> my<00:05:21.770> rocket<00:05:22.280> certain<00:05:22.699> ah

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789 
want to use any my rocket certain ah

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.230 
want to use any my rocket certain ah
truck<00:05:22.969> it's<00:05:23.150> a<00:05:23.300> particle<00:05:23.719> beam<00:05:24.789> ammo<00:05:25.789> so<00:05:26.210> I

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
truck it's a particle beam ammo so I

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.559 
truck it's a particle beam ammo so I
just<00:05:26.509> was<00:05:26.690> warping<00:05:27.169> him<00:05:27.319> to<00:05:27.440> death<00:05:29.319> so<00:05:31.150> yeah<00:05:32.150> I

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:32.569 
just was warping him to death so yeah I

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:34.029 
just was warping him to death so yeah I
think<00:05:33.050> that's<00:05:33.319> about<00:05:33.440> it<00:05:33.560> I<00:05:33.770> think<00:05:33.830> I<00:05:34.009> just

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 
think that's about it I think I just

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:37.770 
think that's about it I think I just
looped<00:05:34.550> after<00:05:34.940> this<00:05:35.090> so<00:05:35.599> i<00:05:35.960> think<00:05:36.110> i<00:05:36.740> will<00:05:36.830> just

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
looped after this so i think i will just

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.450 
looped after this so i think i will just
to<00:05:38.780> get<00:05:38.930> off<00:05:39.110> because<00:05:39.469> then<00:05:39.919> you<00:05:40.099> guys<00:05:40.219> won't

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
to get off because then you guys won't

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.420 
to get off because then you guys won't
have<00:05:40.699> to<00:05:40.819> do<00:05:40.940> many<00:05:41.210> more<00:05:41.419> more<00:05:42.020> my<00:05:42.430> pestering

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 
have to do many more more my pestering
