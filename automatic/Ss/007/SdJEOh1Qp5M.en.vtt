00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:07.829
 again and today I bring in auto 

00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:10.230
 shippuden ultimate ninja storm 

00:00:07.829 --> 00:00:13.790
 generations the last game they pulled from 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.250
 Naruto and well then 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.380
 how I see they were and we like it I do not know if 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.000
 you will also like naruto apart from one 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.820
 I already said that 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.090
 and I will keep on raising gloves and good 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.090
 while doing a little game here today 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:40.730
 I've seen the characters that there are with 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:43.940
 hawksbill are the rather well it was the 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.890
 characters from the environment of 2 more than 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.989
 they added and they also focused on the 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.210
 online many people say today is that in 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.810
 story mode is not like the no port 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.730
 I know what but they said what 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:00.310
 that this game takes us towards 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.310
 history and what good are we going to put here 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.440
 the best 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.070
 find Maria behind 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.590
 no no 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.610
 A) Yes 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.810
 and good I wanted to make a proposal 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.280
 you want me to go up to Naruto had 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.100
 thought two things 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.270
 to see how the story mode of this 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:46.740
 good in short and that could go up 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.710
 although it could also go up 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.150
 to that situation 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.150
 an agreement of the controls 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.960
 so I had planned to upload 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.230
 climb very out of this does not happen that is 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.880
 long and that the game should start 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.890
 we owe a lot 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.980
 I had not thought because as of the 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.750
 history of sector two 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.820
 saleh 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.860
 the final buses that are in the 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.490
 important fights of the game where they come out 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.860
 the kinematics and all this work 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.490
 the person went up that is the same 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.000
 the room and the videos 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.210
 the worst is exciting 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.820
 and then we went up the story mode of the 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.620
 gender are not many story ways by 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.140
 characters up to story mode 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.290
 naruto are very differentiated that are 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.520
 monitors ' never nearly eliminate everything and 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:50.610
 derby and mannara and diamond rhombus maluco 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.910
 small are also the new ten 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.910
 stories 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.220
 but if you want to be challenged by 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.070
 climb your fashion ball history 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.680
 Naruto in the following there was a battle 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:06.140
 of questionable around the prison 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.000
 the history of hitachi in the following 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.580
 there was another battle of calm not only go 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.470
 think about it 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.470
 if we have super middle we say 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.910
 if humans, I think I'm going to use it 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.500
 and then I'll go up the others 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.080
 ways 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.640
 the other probable characters those 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.040
 gloves like the license 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:36.410
 that can go alternating from psuv naruto 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.410
 in the show he expanded his naruto story 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.910
 if you think we like it, we like it 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.930
 you can leave in 2 comment that you want 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.270
 make more or less 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:49.030
 I think I 'll do this to see yes 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:52.350
 we like the truth 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.350
 in fact this combat 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.730
 in the game I already had it and I have the 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.550
 banana and everything here and good I'm going to 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:07.250
 teaching modes stories there 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:09.730
 so you can see it a moment 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.730
 Y 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.110
 in story mode 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:19.620
 here we are 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:22.229
 you see is the story of the young naruto 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.710
 and your machine's star course machine 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:27.240
 of those that the one to swim to caracas and 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.710
 well that will demand in quotes 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.360
 because what I'm watching the anime 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.710
 right now 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.180
 well right now it's a break stick a 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.290
 reasoning the face to see if we use 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.870
 and who the fuck is the star and so the 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:45.139
 tell story to get to him innate and 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:48.419
 lerby savuth to daughter qy hitachi good 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:51.180
 with enough history so going up 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.979
 I still hope you like it there is also more 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.930
 game modes that you already taught in a 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:58.560
 video I asked if you want it to go up 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.969
 and I repeat it again to see if you 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.219
 you animate part of the online 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:04.839
 with battle bright tournaments and there are tournaments 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:08.949
 that are entertaining I do not know if you want 

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:11.610
 that climb a tournament invention of people of 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:14.520
 such a character 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.660
 I like what I challenge but it is that 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.190
 it is predetermined 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.570
 here you have these are the ones that you 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.430
 would face tutors that is a character 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.280
 of hands 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.340
 there is a lot 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.780
 he does not like the ones I 'm in combat 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.639
 you believe it, you and you personalize it 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:34.350
 I told myself already the characters that you want 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:35.730
 to fight the one that I told you that I would 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.440
 you can also say if you want them to be 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.840
 a tournament but when in principle I will do 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:43.370
 this go up in a generation story 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:46.770
 and the final fights of the store we 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:50.250
 so it's worth nothing if you liked this 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:52.919
 explanation of the channel and such like 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:56.540
 You should not pay me comment please 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:06:00.710
 not also if you like nothing 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.710
 until next time until later
