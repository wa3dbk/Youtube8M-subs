00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 Hello, this is Jose Marcelino Ortiz and 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.629
 my favorite number is 10 because it gives me 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.970
 a feeling that things are 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.010
 complete my name is from my number 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.830
 favorite since 10 because that day 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.839
 an important person came into my life 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:19.710
 or the one of I am varies the castle my 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:23.449
 favorite number is 13 million 491 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:28.980
 thousand 631 but I like to tell you 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:31.080
 13 49 16 31 and the reason is because it's a 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.600
 number that is like wrapped between two 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.370
 cousins 13 and 31 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.540
 very favorite numbers on 8 because a 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.200
 bumped he told me that in cultures 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:44.219
 oriental means infinity 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.700
 my favorite number is 24 because it's my 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.039
 birthday and because when you take your 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.699
 updates in prime numbers all 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.930
 both cubed by 2 and I like that 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.140
 come out like this 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.300
 this submarine this I am an Olympian 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.700
 Mathematician of Mexicalli and I want 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.860
 say that my favorite number is the j 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.050
 this many know the i like the magazine 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.860
 minus one but if you approach by the 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.210
 straight of the imaginary numbers the j is 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.640
 a number that multiplied by itself 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.700
 it's 1 but it's not 1 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.820
 so I like it because I do not understand it 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.130
 because 13 is the number 6 cousin that is 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.990
 the day of my birthday the 31 is the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.440
 number 11 cousin that I also like 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.800
 a lot and in the middle he has 4,916 which is 2 to 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.740
 square 3 squared and 4 squared and 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:38.140
 also if you add 916 you can give 25 that 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.530
 it's built hi my name is 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:46.510

 more than the beta bio hello my name is 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.229

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.220
 they also have a 49 out there that 7 to 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.290
 square then this number that has 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.390
 many properties and it is not as well known 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.830

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.369
 you can search and find a jet of 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.369
