fit<00:00:31.230> we<00:00:31.470> also<00:00:31.650> discussed<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.550> clinical

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
fit we also discussed that the clinical

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.120 
fit we also discussed that the clinical
symptoms<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.750> pertussis<00:00:34.230> infection<00:00:34.410> can<00:00:34.860> last

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
symptoms of pertussis infection can last

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.460 
symptoms of pertussis infection can last
around<00:00:35.640> 12<00:00:36.000> weeks<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.810> these<00:00:36.960> weeks<00:00:37.290> are

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
around 12 weeks and these weeks are

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.350 
around 12 weeks and these weeks are
broken<00:00:37.770> down<00:00:37.920> into<00:00:38.100> three<00:00:38.579> stages<00:00:39.060> depending

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
broken down into three stages depending

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.330 
broken down into three stages depending
on<00:00:39.720> the<00:00:39.810> clinical<00:00:40.140> symptoms<00:00:40.500> present<00:00:40.710> but<00:00:41.220> we

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
on the clinical symptoms present but we

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.889 
on the clinical symptoms present but we
also<00:00:41.489> talked<00:00:41.820> about<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.090> few<00:00:42.329> modifying

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
also talked about a few modifying

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.900 
also talked about a few modifying
factors<00:00:43.470> and<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.800> modifying<00:00:44.310> factor<00:00:44.700> can<00:00:44.880> be

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
factors and a modifying factor can be

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.670 
factors and a modifying factor can be
anything<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.630> makes<00:00:45.840> these<00:00:46.110> three<00:00:46.410> stages

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
anything that makes these three stages

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.440 
anything that makes these three stages
difficult<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.550> tell<00:00:47.700> apart<00:00:47.820> because<00:00:48.329> the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
difficult to tell apart because the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.240 
difficult to tell apart because the
symptoms<00:00:48.780> are<00:00:49.020> milder<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.680> transmission

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
symptoms are milder and the transmission

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.280 
symptoms are milder and the transmission
rate<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.550> lower<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.090> one<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.630> these<00:00:51.750> factors

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
rate is lower so one of these factors

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.350 
rate is lower so one of these factors
was<00:00:52.710> previous<00:00:53.190> infection<00:00:53.760> with<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.030> disease

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
was previous infection with the disease

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.600 
was previous infection with the disease
so<00:00:55.170> let's<00:00:55.380> say<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.800> data<00:00:56.040> the<00:00:56.250> family

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
so let's say that the data the family

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.610 
so let's say that the data the family
here<00:00:56.880> was<00:00:57.090> infected<00:00:57.690> with<00:00:57.750> pertussis<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.410> few

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
here was infected with pertussis a few

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.010 
here was infected with pertussis a few
years<00:00:58.860> ago<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.640> his<00:00:59.879> body<00:01:00.090> like<00:01:00.480> yours<00:01:00.719> or<00:01:00.840> mine

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
years ago in his body like yours or mine

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.900 
years ago in his body like yours or mine
would<00:01:01.320> mount<00:01:01.469> an<00:01:01.649> immune<00:01:01.770> response<00:01:02.399> by<00:01:02.610> making

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
would mount an immune response by making

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.459 
would mount an immune response by making
antibodies<00:01:03.390> against<00:01:03.750> pertussis<00:01:04.170> these

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:04.469 
antibodies against pertussis these

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:06.199 
antibodies against pertussis these
antibodies<00:01:05.039> are<00:01:05.069> like<00:01:05.309> specialized<00:01:05.880> tags

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:06.209 
antibodies are like specialized tags

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:08.029 
antibodies are like specialized tags
that<00:01:06.630> attach<00:01:06.929> specifically<00:01:07.649> onto<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:08.039 
that attach specifically onto the

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:10.190 
that attach specifically onto the
pertussis<00:01:08.429> bacterium<00:01:09.090> proteins<00:01:09.539> produces

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
pertussis bacterium proteins produces

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.080 
pertussis bacterium proteins produces
and<00:01:10.380> flags<00:01:10.649> them<00:01:10.859> for<00:01:11.009> destruction<00:01:11.159> once<00:01:11.880> that

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
and flags them for destruction once that

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.669 
and flags them for destruction once that
clears<00:01:12.359> the<00:01:12.539> infection<00:01:12.990> he's<00:01:13.139> left<00:01:13.409> with<00:01:13.499> the

00:01:13.669 --> 00:01:13.679 
clears the infection he's left with the

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:15.319 
clears the infection he's left with the
level<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.069> pertussis<00:01:14.490> antibodies<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.179> his

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
body for a long time after so let's give

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.160 
body for a long time after so let's give
him<00:01:17.429> in<00:01:17.579> anybody<00:01:17.969> badge<00:01:18.240> here<00:01:18.719> to<00:01:18.869> remember

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
him in anybody badge here to remember

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.109 
him in anybody badge here to remember
that<00:01:19.409> he<00:01:19.560> has<00:01:19.709> immunity<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.340> pertussis<00:01:20.880> this

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
that he has immunity and pertussis this

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.340 
that he has immunity and pertussis this
means<00:01:21.329> that<00:01:21.420> if<00:01:21.539> he's<00:01:21.659> reinfected<00:01:22.259> with

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
means that if he's reinfected with

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.469 
means that if he's reinfected with
pertussis<00:01:22.829> his<00:01:23.009> immune<00:01:23.310> system<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.880> ready<00:01:24.240> or

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
pertussis his immune system is ready or

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.870 
pertussis his immune system is ready or
primed<00:01:24.929> for<00:01:25.319> the<00:01:25.439> infection<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.130> confide<00:01:26.729> it

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
primed for the infection and confide it

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.459 
primed for the infection and confide it
more<00:01:27.029> quickly<00:01:27.179> so<00:01:27.929> it<00:01:28.049> becomes<00:01:28.289> less

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469 
more quickly so it becomes less

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:30.109 
more quickly so it becomes less
contagious<00:01:28.829> because<00:01:29.310> he<00:01:29.549> kills<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.849> disease

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
contagious because he kills the disease

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.879 
contagious because he kills the disease
faster<00:01:30.539> and<00:01:30.719> the<00:01:30.810> classically<00:01:31.349> clinical

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:31.889 
faster and the classically clinical

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:33.709 
faster and the classically clinical
symptoms<00:01:32.279> of<00:01:32.399> the<00:01:32.490> disease<00:01:32.639> become<00:01:33.149> milder

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719 
symptoms of the disease become milder

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:35.599 
symptoms of the disease become milder
may<00:01:34.139> not<00:01:34.319> occur<00:01:34.560> at<00:01:34.709> all<00:01:34.829> now<00:01:35.310> it's<00:01:35.429> a<00:01:35.459> good

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609 
may not occur at all now it's a good
