in<00:00:04.770> this<00:00:05.700> example<00:00:06.120> I'm<00:00:06.390> going<00:00:06.510> to<00:00:06.600> go<00:00:06.720> over

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
in this example I'm going to go over

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.110 
in this example I'm going to go over
some<00:00:07.080> basic<00:00:07.110> normal<00:00:08.010> anatomy<00:00:08.640> and<00:00:08.850> a<00:00:08.910> little

stop on the coronal but the axial image

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.979 
stop on the coronal but the axial image
is<00:00:32.070> what<00:00:32.220> I<00:00:32.250> want<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.550> focus<00:00:32.730> on<00:00:33.060> and<00:00:33.420> as<00:00:33.600> we<00:00:33.780> go

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
is what I want to focus on and as we go

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.020 
is what I want to focus on and as we go

to the axial and scroll up and down you

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.660 
to the axial and scroll up and down you
can<00:00:36.180> see<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.359> upper<00:00:36.809> sections<00:00:37.410> will<00:00:38.309> go<00:00:38.460> up

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
can see the upper sections will go up

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.930 
can see the upper sections will go up
through<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.359> AC<00:00:39.570> joint<00:00:39.870> shown<00:00:40.649> here<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.309> then

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
through the AC joint shown here and then

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.130 
through the AC joint shown here and then
we'll<00:00:42.059> come<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.390> upper<00:00:42.780> part<00:00:43.019> of<00:00:43.050> the

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
axillary pouch I'm going to switch this

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.069 
axillary pouch I'm going to switch this
one<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.579> sagittal<00:00:57.210> image<00:00:57.510> for<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> minute

one to the sagittal image for a minute

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.880 
one to the sagittal image for a minute
now<00:00:58.199> I've<00:00:58.320> switched<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.670> sagittal

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
now I've switched to the sagittal

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.139 
now I've switched to the sagittal
orientation<00:01:01.890> here<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.399> right-hand<00:01:02.609> panel

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
orientation here on the right-hand panel

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.390 
orientation here on the right-hand panel
and<00:01:03.539> if<00:01:04.140> we're<00:01:04.379> in<00:01:04.410> the<00:01:04.650> plane<00:01:05.100> that's

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
and if we're in the plane that's

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.789 
and if we're in the plane that's
parallel<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.630> glenoid<00:01:06.870> face<00:01:07.290> here<00:01:07.619> you

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
parallel to the glenoid face here you

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.130 
parallel to the glenoid face here you
can<00:01:07.979> see<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.400> glenoid<00:01:09.119> itself

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
can see the glenoid itself

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.130 
can see the glenoid itself
this<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.710> anterior<00:01:11.430> posterior<00:01:11.900> superior<00:01:12.900> and

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
this is anterior posterior superior and

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.319 
this is anterior posterior superior and
inferior<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.700> important<00:01:15.180> because

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.329 
inferior and this is important because

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:17.840 
inferior and this is important because
the<00:01:15.659> conventional<00:01:16.229> clockface<00:01:16.619> approached<00:01:17.549> to

the conventional clockface approached to

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.080 
the conventional clockface approached to
glenoid<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.720> 12<00:01:19.020> o'clock<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.590> the

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
glenoid is that 12 o'clock is the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.690 
glenoid is that 12 o'clock is the
superior<00:01:21.090> position<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.960> then<00:01:22.530> anterior<00:01:23.430> is

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
superior position and then anterior is

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.590 
superior position and then anterior is
going<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:23.970> be<00:01:24.149> the<00:01:24.450> 1<00:01:25.020> 2<00:01:25.320> 3<00:01:25.680> o'clock<00:01:26.189> position<00:01:26.600> 6

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600
