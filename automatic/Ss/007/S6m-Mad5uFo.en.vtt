 young people between 20 and 35 years of age 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.090
 clear age I think so totally 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.980
 reprehensible but finally we the 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.900
 We sell mainly for issues 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.640
 of work 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.860

 as a cast and 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.150
 how 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.480

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:53.319
 fast but really in distances 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.630
 long is not not very good for that is 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:59.320
 use on other motorcycles 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:03.370
 and I think it's very bad that you are 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:05.920
 handling this situation for use 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.380
