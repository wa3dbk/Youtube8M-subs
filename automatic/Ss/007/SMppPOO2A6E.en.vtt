but let's say a story and and it's some

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.560 
but let's say a story and and it's some
information<00:00:20.690> here<00:00:20.960> we're<00:00:21.500> in<00:00:21.740> a<00:00:22.369> few<00:00:22.880> short

woolly<00:00:28.699> mammoth<00:00:28.850> yes<00:00:29.480> that's<00:00:29.720> right<00:00:29.990> the<00:00:30.230> big

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:30.440 
woolly mammoth yes that's right the big

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.499 
woolly mammoth yes that's right the big

Judge<00:00:54.289> disclaimers<00:00:55.159> but<00:00:55.459> the<00:00:55.519> point<00:00:55.789> is<00:00:55.909> this

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
Judge disclaimers but the point is this

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.439 
Judge disclaimers but the point is this
they<00:00:57.530> are<00:00:57.769> now<00:00:58.010> there<00:00:58.429> are<00:00:58.519> scientists<00:00:59.059> over

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
they are now there are scientists over

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.529 
they are now there are scientists over
in<00:00:59.719> Japan<00:00:59.989> out<00:01:00.409> of<00:01:00.530> Kyoto<00:01:00.969> University<00:01:01.969> that

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
in Japan out of Kyoto University that

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.140 
in Japan out of Kyoto University that
have<00:01:02.690> been<00:01:02.869> working<00:01:03.379> on<00:01:03.559> perfecting<00:01:04.280> cloning

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
have been working on perfecting cloning

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.360 
have been working on perfecting cloning
techniques<00:01:05.690> now<00:01:05.960> we<00:01:06.020> know<00:01:06.320> that<00:01:06.350> in<00:01:06.770> Siberia

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
techniques now we know that in Siberia

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.770 
techniques now we know that in Siberia
in<00:01:07.430> other<00:01:07.580> places<00:01:07.850> they've<00:01:08.150> been<00:01:08.300> digging<00:01:08.510> up

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
in other places they've been digging up

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.800 
in other places they've been digging up
these<00:01:08.930> woolly<00:01:09.200> mammoths<00:01:09.710> and<00:01:10.090> up<00:01:11.090> until<00:01:11.390> now

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
these woolly mammoths and up until now

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.360 
these woolly mammoths and up until now
they've<00:01:12.050> been<00:01:12.230> trying<00:01:12.560> to<00:01:12.710> do<00:01:12.890> some<00:01:13.130> kind<00:01:13.340> of

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
they've been trying to do some kind of

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.830 
they've been trying to do some kind of
cloning<00:01:13.610> techniques<00:01:13.940> but<00:01:14.210> because<00:01:14.540> some<00:01:14.810> of

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
cloning techniques but because some of

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.140 
cloning techniques but because some of
the<00:01:16.030> cell<00:01:17.030> nucleus<00:01:17.510> is<00:01:18.110> were<00:01:18.320> too<00:01:18.620> damaged<00:01:19.520> by

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
the cell nucleus is were too damaged by

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.300 
the cell nucleus is were too damaged by
you<00:01:20.570> know<00:01:20.690> the<00:01:21.080> frost<00:01:21.410> and<00:01:21.650> the<00:01:21.680> phrase<00:01:21.980> eNOS

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
you know the frost and the phrase eNOS

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.890 
you know the frost and the phrase eNOS
and<00:01:22.430> that<00:01:22.520> whatever<00:01:22.730> they<00:01:23.210> weren't<00:01:23.600> able<00:01:23.750> to

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
and that whatever they weren't able to

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.390 
and that whatever they weren't able to
be<00:01:24.050> successful<00:01:24.590> but<00:01:24.770> now<00:01:25.010> they've<00:01:25.250> been

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
be successful but now they've been

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.860 
be successful but now they've been
working<00:01:25.520> on<00:01:25.730> these<00:01:25.850> new<00:01:26.030> techniques<00:01:26.450> that

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
working on these new techniques that

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.540 
working on these new techniques that
they've<00:01:27.020> been<00:01:27.140> using<00:01:27.380> in<00:01:27.620> mice<00:01:27.950> that<00:01:28.280> have

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
they've been using in mice that have

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.830 
they've been using in mice that have
been<00:01:28.580> frozen<00:01:28.970> for<00:01:29.060> a<00:01:29.210> long<00:01:29.330> time<00:01:29.570> and<00:01:29.750> they've

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
been frozen for a long time and they've

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.690 
been frozen for a long time and they've
been<00:01:29.990> using<00:01:30.140> also<00:01:30.470> in<00:01:30.620> cattle<00:01:31.010> where<00:01:31.400> they<00:01:31.520> can

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
been using also in cattle where they can

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.850 
been using also in cattle where they can
identify<00:01:31.940> and<00:01:32.720> locate<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:33.380> healthy

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
identify and locate the healthy

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.550 
identify and locate the healthy
nucleuses<00:01:34.670> they<00:01:35.120> are<00:01:35.300> now<00:01:35.690> able<00:01:36.260> to<00:01:36.290> have<00:01:36.410> a

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
nucleuses they are now able to have a

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.160 
nucleuses they are now able to have a
much<00:01:36.890> higher<00:01:37.310> success<00:01:37.850> rate<00:01:38.540> with<00:01:38.750> this<00:01:38.930> and

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
much higher success rate with this and

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.140 
much higher success rate with this and
they<00:01:39.380> really<00:01:39.830> do<00:01:40.220> believe<00:01:40.670> that<00:01:40.730> they<00:01:40.970> have<00:01:41.120> a

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
they really do believe that they have a

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.710 
they really do believe that they have a
very<00:01:41.600> good<00:01:42.140> shot<00:01:42.860> at<00:01:43.160> doing<00:01:43.850> this<00:01:44.180> now<00:01:44.570> what

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
very good shot at doing this now what

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.850 
very good shot at doing this now what
they're<00:01:44.810> going<00:01:44.930> to<00:01:44.990> try<00:01:45.140> to<00:01:45.170> do<00:01:45.380> is<00:01:45.500> take<00:01:45.710> some

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
they're going to try to do is take some

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.340 
they're going to try to do is take some
