restart<00:03:25.549> now<00:03:26.549> if<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:28.079> want<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:28.409> open<00:03:28.530> or<00:03:28.950> run<00:03:29.579> a

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
restart now if you want to open or run a

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:30.770 
restart now if you want to open or run a
program<00:03:30.120> of<00:03:30.299> your<00:03:30.449> choice

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
program of your choice

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.379 
program of your choice
and<00:03:31.079> the<00:03:31.229> startup<00:03:31.650> what<00:03:32.519> you<00:03:32.669> have<00:03:32.849> to<00:03:33.000> do<00:03:33.180> is

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
and the startup what you have to do is

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:37.550 
and the startup what you have to do is
that<00:03:34.109> make<00:03:34.590> shortcut<00:03:35.250> to<00:03:36.000> that<00:03:36.120> program<00:03:36.690> or<00:03:37.049> if

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
that make shortcut to that program or if

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.649 
that make shortcut to that program or if
you<00:03:37.709> have<00:03:37.979> all<00:03:38.159> of<00:03:38.340> your<00:03:38.579> already<00:03:39.120> have<00:03:39.359> one

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659 
you have all of your already have one

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:41.750 
you have all of your already have one
then<00:03:40.229> you<00:03:40.290> just<00:03:40.709> have<00:03:41.010> to<00:03:41.159> copy<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.669> the

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
then you just have to copy to the

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.080 
then you just have to copy to the
startup<00:03:42.180> folder<00:03:42.560> now<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:44.310> first<00:03:44.579> question<00:03:44.909> is

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
startup folder now the first question is

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.339 
startup folder now the first question is
where<00:03:45.359> you're<00:03:45.479> gonna<00:03:45.540> find<00:03:45.659> the<00:03:46.019> startup

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
where you're gonna find the startup

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.030 
where you're gonna find the startup
folder<00:03:47.449> well<00:03:48.449> you<00:03:48.870> need<00:03:49.079> not<00:03:49.109> worry<00:03:49.500> about<00:03:49.530> it

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
folder well you need not worry about it

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.089 
folder well you need not worry about it
because<00:03:50.069> Microsoft<00:03:51.030> has<00:03:51.989> made<00:03:52.019> it<00:03:52.680> pretty

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
because Microsoft has made it pretty

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.789 
because Microsoft has made it pretty
easy<00:03:53.430> in<00:03:53.729> Windows<00:03:54.060> 7<00:03:54.239> to<00:03:54.989> find<00:03:55.440> out<00:03:55.590> the

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
easy in Windows 7 to find out the

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.920 
easy in Windows 7 to find out the
startup<00:03:56.190> folder<00:03:56.430> you<00:03:57.209> can<00:03:57.329> just<00:03:57.599> go<00:03:57.720> to<00:03:57.750> the

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
startup folder you can just go to the

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.689 
startup folder you can just go to the
start<00:03:58.199> button<00:03:58.290> you<00:03:58.620> click<00:03:59.099> on<00:03:59.340> all<00:03:59.430> programs
