 but there are no internet pages this is primarily with it 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.630
 busy out 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.009

 for each one of us daily for all of us 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.300
 who like to write 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.769

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.640
 Percent per contract with a reputed publisher and me 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.680
 no one wants that wonderful thing that i said i would like it 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.370
 with pleasure 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.940

 I talk about the site www prompt delivery box is coming 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.040
 Jürgen Seidel is led by Droemer Knaur Verlag 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.650
 Innumerable initially quite well that may explain why sda give in the first place 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.640
 Jena Dr can not even write people like that now 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.549
 Work of the media can register there for free 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:06.090
 you can not do the internet anymore or with me in that it does not matter 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.580
 and who has the possibility of being modern he could like the lyrics 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.230
 a human 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.390
 Siebert uploaded you can read them and you can 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.470
 Bilfinger 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.740
 People who like to write our writers can enter their own 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.820
 Lyrics there high altitude that is totally but itself 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.060
 with my granddaughter Anna 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.579
 Once you try it you can not just explain 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.250
 Percent yes this is really totally easy is that is very self-explanatory 

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:34.760
 So the location 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.530
 he has no problem here 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.380
 But they can also have the experience as a kind of Lex Google 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.390
 under this little short description the triggered 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.220
 in America the Schalke keeper has been on the calculator after 1 already 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.620
 but we also have the option on this page 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.930
 to buy your own kart 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.990
 at the moment remains from this page 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.710
 and he practically represents the 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.430
 now cost that come 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.900
 Bayer explained 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.860
 Year available that sees read 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.860
 and soul those who can read the texts as I said rate the texts 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.889
 that is not all that I mean mine 

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:13.979
 there will not be a good truck for a long time 

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:15.979
 he is tall that fits 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:17.549
 from Insa Gall too 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.679
 can be recommended for 

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:21.119
 ddp 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:25.329
 in order to be in this competition then the 10 best 

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:29.759
 I watch because they could finally have whole books or had 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:35.499
 while watched by projectors from across it just say 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:37.299
 and seen from these 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.549
 West story 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.169
 Percent like me 

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:42.489
 three months 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.719
 a book title selected or a short story 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:49.060
 and one gets a paperback contract 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.659
 other partners Red No 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.159
 I am not at all 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.740
 because there are so private websites 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.039
 increase by one percent 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:03:01.029
 At high altitudes, there is no need for a paperboard stalk and also for the Rector 

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:02.039
 on the 8th 

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:05.360
 so come to me differently come here every year 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.559
 new authors the chance to give the fat Hofert 

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:10.280
 come to that and I think it's class 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.229
 I mean how everything went a little differently with me 

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:14.459
 and around 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.629
 I get asked many times yes what makes you do it how you weigh that gets you 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:21.629
 You have a contract with a publisher and you have it now 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.509
 a claw place 

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:28.089
 which offers you exactly this opportunity I think the idea is great it prevents 

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:29.330
 represents a great thing 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.890
 the euro rescue 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.560
 to bring the whole life now no longer made a few bullet points 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.699
 actually forget nothing 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:36.620
 I wanted to 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.389
 although most of what I have actually already told 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:42.609
 the site is still in the beta-phase at the moment, that is 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:44.240
 it can be that it again no 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.710
 Things may not work but the organizer agrees 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.139
 of course, all of course one hundred percent 90 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.839
 That's what she's supposed to do in the near future 

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:55.379
 the animal suffered 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.139
 newer works at a self-determined price per watt 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:01.779
 can sell as 

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:06.169
 and of course the author gets money for it 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:09.880
 the best way a really unpopular day and has the opportunity 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.090
 Sell ​​all the other Steelbook pretty dusty percent as well thanks 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.159
 The same is true for the next cry 

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:20.120
 Competitions against certain topics or one she has of course join in 

00:04:20.119 --> 00:04:20.939
 can 

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:24.929
 and rarely as well then from the tours and experienced authors 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:26.800
 be guided 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.610
 and around the 80 also has a great thing 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.650
 if their story is always up high 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.699
 it is so different from the whole of July 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:39.479
 it was known to us as their arrival is still unclear 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:44.520
 then there is the area Crime Fulda there are in the area percent romance novels it 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.210
 gives children youth stories so you have to go far there is quite whole 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.300
 many different possibilities 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.889
 Under the wheels I had no other way just uploaded mine 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.830
 ours and what happens 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.770
 and what stories and also read a few times 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.999
 but as I said every three months it is like that 

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:02.020
 that since the 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.680
 Lectors more valuable rulers 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.470
 puts this top ten but she has 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.219
 I have to look again if I did not forget anything 

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:13.569
 To be the old people, we just have the opportunity 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:14.500
 first 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.960
 around the shareholders 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.690
 Theo is easy to imagine percentages yesterday Sebastian Fitzek would have 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.330
 may be involved in something like that can show wheeler 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.419
 his first book, the therapy he might have in a boxing match 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:27.449
 uploaded 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:31.259
 All would have written from Japan then have this story quite good Altenbuch 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:34.770
 given and the first will be chosen here Albert gives her 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.080
 transform the bestseller 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.210
 born to be born I found the idea 2 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.720
 - So few who customers their box come no question 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.240
 Investors should we just a bit more I have no reservations on the part 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.680
 the clinic in Germany 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.500
 but I think it could be something really big 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.449
 especially for the people 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:55.150
 Jane 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.150
 Write and like to book 

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:00.500
 I am also goals 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.140
 the stories and books high places a lot of fun and above all a lot 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:04.770
 success 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.539
 as I read 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:09.379
 St read the next time for good z
