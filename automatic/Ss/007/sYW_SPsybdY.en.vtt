on<00:00:05.040> a<00:00:05.069> trick<00:00:05.339> i<00:00:05.460> call<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:05.910> open<00:00:06.180> box<00:00:06.410> so

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
on a trick i call the open box so

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.339 
on a trick i call the open box so
involves<00:00:08.250> you<00:00:08.370> see<00:00:08.519> two<00:00:08.700> hoops<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:09.269> this<00:00:10.230> is

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
involves you see two hoops and this is

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:25.350 
involves you see two hoops and this is
what<00:00:10.500> it<00:00:10.530> looks<00:00:10.710> like

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.360 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.890 

so<00:00:25.960> that's<00:00:26.410> it<00:00:26.590> the<00:00:27.340> unboxing<00:00:27.910> involves<00:00:28.330> one

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
so that's it the unboxing involves one

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.750 
so that's it the unboxing involves one
who<00:00:29.080> being<00:00:29.380> horizontal<00:00:29.740> and<00:00:30.160> one<00:00:30.310> hoop<00:00:30.490> being

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
who being horizontal and one hoop being

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.670 
who being horizontal and one hoop being
vertical<00:00:31.300> so<00:00:31.960> first<00:00:32.230> you<00:00:32.349> want<00:00:32.500> to<00:00:32.560> get

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
vertical so first you want to get

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.130 
vertical so first you want to get
comfortable<00:00:33.040> just<00:00:33.430> take<00:00:33.640> one<00:00:33.850> hoop<00:00:34.090> and<00:00:34.330> learn

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
comfortable just take one hoop and learn

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.580 
comfortable just take one hoop and learn
one<00:00:35.410> hand<00:00:35.620> at<00:00:35.740> a<00:00:35.830> time<00:00:36.070> so<00:00:36.940> if<00:00:37.180> first<00:00:37.420> um<00:00:37.690> we<00:00:38.410> use

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
one hand at a time so if first um we use

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.820 
one hand at a time so if first um we use
our<00:00:38.830> left<00:00:39.610> hand<00:00:39.970> as<00:00:40.240> the<00:00:40.900> vertical<00:00:41.320> hand<00:00:41.590> but

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 
our left hand as the vertical hand but

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.070 
our left hand as the vertical hand but
you<00:00:41.860> can<00:00:42.130> do<00:00:42.250> either<00:00:42.460> and<00:00:42.850> so<00:00:43.540> I'll<00:00:43.660> grab<00:00:43.870> it

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.080 
you can do either and so I'll grab it

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.190 
you can do either and so I'll grab it
like<00:00:44.559> this<00:00:45.180> my<00:00:46.180> hand<00:00:46.420> around<00:00:46.480> it<00:00:46.720> and<00:00:46.900> now<00:00:47.050> it's

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
like this my hand around it and now it's

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.720 
like this my hand around it and now it's
in<00:00:47.320> front<00:00:47.559> of<00:00:47.650> me<00:00:47.710> and<00:00:47.920> I'll<00:00:48.040> just<00:00:48.250> swing<00:00:48.700> it

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
in front of me and I'll just swing it

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.410 
in front of me and I'll just swing it
and<00:00:49.150> so<00:00:49.930> it's<00:00:50.110> behind<00:00:50.440> me<00:00:51.000> okay<00:00:52.000> so<00:00:52.059> it<00:00:52.390> looks

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
and so it's behind me okay so it looks

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.380 
and so it's behind me okay so it looks
like<00:00:52.600> from<00:00:52.840> the<00:00:53.050> side<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.910> looks<00:00:55.000> like<00:00:55.239> from

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
like from the side it looks like from

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:02.430 
like from the side it looks like from
the<00:00:55.570> back<00:00:56.040> and<00:01:00.090> from<00:01:01.090> that<00:01:01.240> side<00:01:01.510> so<00:01:02.170> that's

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
the back and from that side so that's

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.350 
the back and from that side so that's
all<00:01:02.590> you're<00:01:02.770> doing<00:01:03.070> with<00:01:03.220> that<00:01:03.250> hand<00:01:03.670> now<00:01:04.300> you

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
all you're doing with that hand now you

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.150 
all you're doing with that hand now you
can<00:01:04.630> do<00:01:04.809> it<00:01:04.930> at<00:01:05.050> different<00:01:05.199> levels<00:01:05.500> you<00:01:05.800> can<00:01:05.830> do

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
can do it at different levels you can do

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.190 
can do it at different levels you can do
it<00:01:06.310> right<00:01:06.490> here<00:01:06.729> at<00:01:06.759> the<00:01:06.910> center<00:01:07.300> you<00:01:07.570> could<00:01:08.050> do

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
it right here at the center you could do

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.180 
it right here at the center you could do
it<00:01:08.320> more<00:01:08.590> down<00:01:09.180> by<00:01:10.180> your<00:01:10.300> legs<00:01:10.710> or<00:01:11.710> you<00:01:11.800> can<00:01:12.009> do

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
it more down by your legs or you can do

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:14.550 
it more down by your legs or you can do
it<00:01:12.310> with<00:01:12.820> your<00:01:12.970> arm<00:01:13.180> extended<00:01:13.810> all<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.080> way<00:01:14.290> up

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
it with your arm extended all the way up

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.999 
it with your arm extended all the way up
and<00:01:15.690> so<00:01:16.690> you<00:01:16.750> can<00:01:17.020> kind<00:01:17.259> of<00:01:17.350> alternate<00:01:17.890> between

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
and so you can kind of alternate between

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.480 
and so you can kind of alternate between
those<00:01:18.520> while<00:01:18.759> you're<00:01:18.790> doing<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.390> trick<00:01:20.490> at

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
those while you're doing the trick at

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.389 
those while you're doing the trick at
the<00:01:21.640> different<00:01:22.030> levels<00:01:22.660> and<00:01:23.020> then<00:01:23.950> the<00:01:24.369> next

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
the different levels and then the next

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.820 
the different levels and then the next
step<00:01:24.759> is<00:01:25.119> using<00:01:25.600> your<00:01:25.750> other<00:01:25.899> hand<00:01:26.259> having<00:01:26.619> the

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
step is using your other hand having the

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.920 
step is using your other hand having the
hoop<00:01:27.009> horizontal<00:01:27.759> that's<00:01:28.149> all<00:01:28.479> you're<00:01:28.600> doing

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
hoop horizontal that's all you're doing

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.250 
hoop horizontal that's all you're doing
is<00:01:29.140> just<00:01:30.090> kind<00:01:31.090> of<00:01:31.180> swinging<00:01:31.450> it<00:01:31.810> back<00:01:31.990> and

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
is just kind of swinging it back and

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.800 
is just kind of swinging it back and
forth<00:01:33.870> you're<00:01:34.870> never<00:01:35.080> letting<00:01:35.350> go<00:01:35.530> of<00:01:35.740> it<00:01:36.810> it's

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
forth you're never letting go of it it's

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.539 
forth you're never letting go of it it's
not<00:01:37.960> even<00:01:38.170> coming<00:01:38.560> to<00:01:38.710> slide<00:01:39.070> through<00:01:39.400> your

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
not even coming to slide through your

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.580 
not even coming to slide through your
hand<00:01:39.850> so<00:01:40.540> this<00:01:40.720> is<00:01:40.840> what<00:01:40.990> it<00:01:41.080> looks<00:01:41.229> like<00:01:41.380> from

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
hand so this is what it looks like from

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.110 
hand so this is what it looks like from
the<00:01:41.740> side<00:01:41.909> front<00:01:42.909> back<00:01:43.320> front<00:01:44.320> back<00:01:45.250> and

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:47.120

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.760 
the side front back front back and
and<00:01:48.120> I'll<00:01:48.270> kind<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.600> use<00:01:48.780> my<00:01:48.960> body<00:01:49.230> to<00:01:49.380> let<00:01:49.680> it

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
and I'll kind of use my body to let it

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.210 
and I'll kind of use my body to let it
bounce<00:01:49.920> off<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.420> you<00:01:51.420> see<00:01:51.660> it<00:01:51.780> hits<00:01:51.990> my<00:01:52.200> back<00:01:52.680> up

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220
