MIT license and I've started a simple

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.570 
MIT license and I've started a simple
project<00:00:27.200> to<00:00:27.410> get<00:00:27.619> used<00:00:27.800> to<00:00:27.890> the<00:00:28.039> engine<00:00:28.369> and

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
project to get used to the engine and

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.640 
project to get used to the engine and
that's<00:00:29.570> what<00:00:29.720> I'm<00:00:29.810> going<00:00:29.960> to<00:00:30.050> show<00:00:30.260> you<00:00:30.320> here

that's what I'm going to show you here
so<00:00:31.520> this<00:00:31.670> is<00:00:31.789> a<00:00:31.880> simple<00:00:32.180> character<00:00:32.329> I've

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
so this is a simple character I've

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.840 
so this is a simple character I've
created<00:00:34.270> he's<00:00:35.320> yeah<00:00:36.320> similar<00:00:36.980> to<00:00:37.130> the<00:00:37.250> logo<00:00:37.520> of

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
created he's yeah similar to the logo of

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.790 
created he's yeah similar to the logo of
co-taught<00:00:38.210> and<00:00:39.050> I<00:00:39.170> wanted<00:00:39.410> to<00:00:39.470> create<00:00:39.770> a

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
co-taught and I wanted to create a

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.319 
co-taught and I wanted to create a
character<00:00:40.310> that<00:00:40.610> is<00:00:42.520> which<00:00:43.520> I<00:00:43.670> can<00:00:43.850> use<00:00:44.000> for

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
character that is which I can use for

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.170 
character that is which I can use for
testing<00:00:44.780> purposes<00:00:45.350> and<00:00:45.970> animation<00:00:46.970> test

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
testing purposes and animation test

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.850 
testing purposes and animation test
scripting<00:00:47.960> tests<00:00:48.320> and<00:00:48.470> so<00:00:48.590> on

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
scripting tests and so on

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.330 
scripting tests and so on
so<00:00:49.370> I've<00:00:49.489> created<00:00:49.790> a<00:00:50.030> few<00:00:50.300> animations<00:00:51.050> in<00:00:51.950> idle

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
so I've created a few animations in idle

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.560 
so I've created a few animations in idle
animation

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.619 

a<00:00:55.660> run<00:00:56.200> animation

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
a run animation

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.160 
a run animation
or<00:00:59.730> Gnostic<00:01:00.730> animation

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
or Gnostic animation

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.630 
or Gnostic animation
so<00:01:02.800> these<00:01:03.370> are<00:01:03.520> all<00:01:03.700> two<00:01:04.330> deep<00:01:04.479> lines<00:01:04.750> and/or

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
so these are all two deep lines and/or

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.380 
so these are all two deep lines and/or
2d<00:01:06.640> textures<00:01:07.510> and<00:01:07.810> I'm<00:01:08.650> using<00:01:08.860> a<00:01:09.159> 2d<00:01:09.940> cutout

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
2d textures and I'm using a 2d cutout

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.340 
2d textures and I'm using a 2d cutout
animation<00:01:10.600> system<00:01:11.320> in<00:01:11.830> Godot<00:01:12.280> and<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:14.080> great

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
animation system in Godot and the great

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.200 
animation system in Godot and the great
thing<00:01:14.530> is<00:01:14.680> you<00:01:14.710> can<00:01:15.070> script<00:01:15.340> here<00:01:15.640> you<00:01:16.060> have<00:01:16.180> a

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
thing is you can script here you have a

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.830 
thing is you can script here you have a
3d<00:01:16.630> view<00:01:16.690> a<00:01:16.840> 2d<00:01:17.460> scripting<00:01:18.460> and<00:01:18.759> I<00:01:19.000> scripted<00:01:19.750> a

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
3d view a 2d scripting and I scripted a

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.670 
3d view a 2d scripting and I scripted a
simple<00:01:20.320> movement<00:01:20.680> cave<00:01:21.220> here<00:01:21.400> and<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.840> will

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
simple movement cave here and I will

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.380 
simple movement cave here and I will
show<00:01:23.860> you<00:01:23.920> this<00:01:24.160> now

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
show you this now

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.480 
show you this now
so<00:01:27.110> here's<00:01:27.380> a<00:01:27.440> very<00:01:27.650> simple<00:01:27.770> scene<00:01:28.280> I've

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
so here's a very simple scene I've

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.230 
so here's a very simple scene I've
created<00:01:28.760> just<00:01:29.150> a<00:01:29.720> very<00:01:29.900> basic<00:01:30.170> level<00:01:30.470> and<00:01:31.340> the

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
created just a very basic level and the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.110 
created just a very basic level and the
character<00:01:32.690> now<00:01:33.470> I<00:01:33.500> just<00:01:33.560> have<00:01:33.860> to<00:01:34.010> press<00:01:34.250> a<00:01:34.580> 5

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
character now I just have to press a 5

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.960 
character now I just have to press a 5
or<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.420> play<00:01:35.810> button<00:01:36.110> here<00:01:36.370> the<00:01:37.370> game<00:01:37.550> starts

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
or the play button here the game starts

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.770 
or the play button here the game starts
so<00:01:38.530> here<00:01:39.530> you<00:01:39.620> can<00:01:39.800> see<00:01:40.010> my<00:01:40.220> G<00:01:40.820> bot<00:01:41.030> that's<00:01:41.570> what

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
so here you can see my G bot that's what

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.240 
so here you can see my G bot that's what
the<00:01:41.900> drone<00:01:42.080> project<00:01:42.410> is<00:01:42.770> called<00:01:43.010> at<00:01:43.160> the

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
the drone project is called at the

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.340 
the drone project is called at the
moment<00:01:43.550> and<00:01:44.229> I<00:01:45.229> can<00:01:45.680> jump

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
moment and I can jump

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.130 
moment and I can jump
run

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
run

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.270 
run
I<00:01:49.260> have<00:01:49.710> many<00:01:49.920> best<00:01:50.159> four

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.490 

up<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.090> down<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.369> wild<00:01:56.369> he's<00:01:56.460> jumping

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
up and down in the wild he's jumping

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.450 
up and down in the wild he's jumping
I<00:01:58.560> can<00:01:59.220> make<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> double<00:02:00.090> jump<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:01.070> can<00:02:02.070> stick<00:02:02.310> to

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
I can make a double jump I can stick to

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.090 
I can make a double jump I can stick to
walls<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.420> jump<00:02:03.780> through<00:02:03.990> there

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
walls and jump through there

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.800 
walls and jump through there
yeah<00:02:07.080> at<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.170> moment<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:10.149> far<00:02:10.330> I<00:02:10.360> have<00:02:10.539> to<00:02:10.570> say

yeah at the moment so far I have to say

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.260 
yeah at the moment so far I have to say
that<00:02:10.990> the<00:02:11.110> engine<00:02:11.380> is<00:02:11.470> very<00:02:11.860> cool<00:02:12.190> very<00:02:13.000> well

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
that the engine is very cool very well

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.600 
that the engine is very cool very well
designed<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:14.200> can<00:02:14.590> create<00:02:15.250> lots<00:02:15.490> of

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
designed and you can create lots of

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.500 
designed and you can create lots of
stuff

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
stuff

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.890 
stuff
yeah<00:02:18.140> this<00:02:18.319> is<00:02:18.440> just<00:02:18.680> a<00:02:18.800> project<00:02:19.040> I<00:02:19.400> am<00:02:19.459> working

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
yeah this is just a project I am working

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.670 
yeah this is just a project I am working
on<00:02:20.900> to<00:02:21.230> get<00:02:21.379> used<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.190> it<00:02:22.280> more<00:02:22.580> and<00:02:22.849> to<00:02:23.650> get<00:02:24.650> a

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
on to get used to it more and to get a

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.949 
on to get used to it more and to get a
basic<00:02:25.489> understanding<00:02:25.700> of<00:02:26.299> the<00:02:26.360> complete

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
basic understanding of the complete
