hello my dear friends so today's

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.909 
hello my dear friends so today's
question<00:00:05.670> is<00:00:05.819> just<00:00:06.299> how<00:00:06.450> much<00:00:07.080> video<00:00:07.440> memory

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
question is just how much video memory

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.839 
question is just how much video memory
can<00:00:08.790> you<00:00:09.030> use<00:00:09.389> up<00:00:09.630> if<00:00:10.620> you're<00:00:10.830> playing<00:00:11.160> at<00:00:11.490> high

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
can you use up if you're playing at high

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.090 
can you use up if you're playing at high
resolution<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:13.519> ultra<00:00:14.519> settings<00:00:15.590> in<00:00:16.590> modern

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100

games<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:20.840> with<00:00:21.840> one<00:00:22.050> monitor<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:22.980> basically

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
games and with one monitor so basically

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.550 
games and with one monitor so basically
this<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:23.910> shadow<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.359> mordor<00:00:24.779> from<00:00:25.380> what<00:00:25.529> I

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
this is shadow of mordor from what I

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.279 
this is shadow of mordor from what I
hear<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:26.279> talks<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.820> most<00:00:26.970> video<00:00:27.390> memory<00:00:27.630> with

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
hear it talks the most video memory with

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.970 
hear it talks the most video memory with
its<00:00:28.529> HD<00:00:29.039> ultra<00:00:30.170> texture<00:00:31.170> pack<00:00:31.439> which<00:00:31.740> is

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
its HD ultra texture pack which is

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.040 
its HD ultra texture pack which is
downloaded<00:00:32.579> right<00:00:32.759> now<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.270> I'm<00:00:33.450> gonna<00:00:33.690> show

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
you the resolution is at 4k and video

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.180 
you the resolution is at 4k and video
settings<00:00:39.420> are<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.379> absolute<00:00:40.800> maximum

nothing<00:00:41.820> else<00:00:42.059> can<00:00:42.239> be<00:00:42.270> increased<00:00:42.840> even

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
nothing else can be increased even

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.150 
nothing else can be increased even
motion<00:00:44.280> blur<00:00:44.730> which<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.510> absolutely<00:00:46.289> do<00:00:46.980> not

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
motion blur which I absolutely do not

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.430 
motion blur which I absolutely do not
like<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.910> turned<00:00:48.270> on<00:00:48.450> everything's<00:00:48.930> turned<00:00:49.230> on

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
like is turned on everything's turned on

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.229 
like is turned on everything's turned on
and<00:00:49.969> at<00:00:50.969> first<00:00:51.180> location<00:00:51.870> we<00:00:52.680> have<00:00:52.949> six<00:00:53.640> point

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
and at first location we have six point

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.260 
and at first location we have six point
almost<00:00:54.780> six<00:00:55.079> point<00:00:55.320> four<00:00:55.500> gig<00:00:55.800> gigs<00:00:59.270> believe

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
almost six point four gig gigs believe

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.479 
almost six point four gig gigs believe
me<00:01:00.420> if<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.870> go<00:01:01.079> down<00:01:01.289> there<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:02.010> stays<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.460> same

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
me if I go down there it stays the same

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.350 
me if I go down there it stays the same
around<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.329> same<00:01:03.650> so<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:05.010> actually<00:01:05.430> found<00:01:05.939> a

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
around the same so I actually found a

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.060 
around the same so I actually found a
location<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:07.760> uses<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.790> lot<00:01:09.000> more<00:01:10.070> video

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
location that uses a lot more video

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.670 
location that uses a lot more video
memory<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:12.360> I'm<00:01:12.420> going<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.720> show<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.409> one

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
memory so I'm going to show you that one

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.520 
memory so I'm going to show you that one
and<00:01:14.750> I'm<00:01:15.750> going<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.049> show<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:18.200> action<00:01:19.200> as<00:01:19.350> well

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
and I'm going to show you action as well

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.780 
and I'm going to show you action as well
so<00:01:20.840> let's<00:01:21.840> have<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.110> look<00:01:22.290> at<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:23.189> video<00:01:23.430> memory

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
so let's have a look at the video memory

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:33.539 
so let's have a look at the video memory
when<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.240> action<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.200> involved<00:01:26.869> just

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.289 

okay

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
okay

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.190 
okay
well<00:01:36.170> now<00:01:36.380> I<00:01:36.409> forget<00:01:37.329> which<00:01:38.329> one<00:01:38.390> with<00:01:38.750> was<00:01:39.049> it

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
well now I forget which one with was it

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.350 
well now I forget which one with was it
this<00:01:39.560> one<00:01:39.770> -<00:01:39.890> this<00:01:39.979> one<00:01:40.159> right<00:01:40.189> here<00:01:43.060> so<00:01:44.060> as<00:01:44.240> you

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
this one - this one right here so as you

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.209 
this one - this one right here so as you
can<00:01:44.509> see<00:01:44.570> six<00:01:45.350> point<00:01:45.890> six<00:01:47.619> six<00:01:48.619> point<00:01:48.950> six

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
can see six point six six point six

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:52.149 
can see six point six six point six
gigabytes<00:01:49.700> now<00:01:49.969> and<00:01:50.380> I'm<00:01:51.380> going<00:01:51.679> to<00:01:51.860> show<00:01:52.100> you

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
gigabytes now and I'm going to show you

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.389 
gigabytes now and I'm going to show you
that<00:01:52.689> not<00:01:53.689> much<00:01:53.840> is<00:01:54.110> going<00:01:54.619> to<00:01:54.709> change<00:01:54.799> if

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
that not much is going to change if

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.309 
that not much is going to change if
we're<00:01:55.700> gonna<00:01:55.819> go<00:01:56.090> ahead<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:57.100> enter<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.549> fight

00:01:59.309 --> 00:01:59.319 
we're gonna go ahead and enter the fight

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:06.819 
we're gonna go ahead and enter the fight
with<00:02:00.319> multiple<00:02:00.920> enemies<00:02:01.840> involved<00:02:05.770> by<00:02:06.770> the

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
with multiple enemies involved by the

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.059 
with multiple enemies involved by the
way<00:02:07.119> at<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.239> moment<00:02:08.269> Titan<00:02:09.079> is<00:02:09.289> overclocked

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
way at the moment Titan is overclocked

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.750 
way at the moment Titan is overclocked
so<00:02:10.900> you<00:02:11.900> will<00:02:12.079> not<00:02:12.260> be<00:02:12.470> getting<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.890> same<00:02:13.099> fps

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
so you will not be getting the same fps

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.610 
so you will not be getting the same fps
if<00:02:14.120> you're<00:02:14.420> just<00:02:14.660> playing<00:02:15.519> with<00:02:17.500> with<00:02:18.500> the

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
if you're just playing with with the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:26.170 
if you're just playing with with the
standard<00:02:18.980> settings

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.000 

then<00:02:26.810> just<00:02:27.109> to<00:02:27.290> stay<00:02:27.590> above<00:02:27.890> 30<00:02:28.250> FPS<00:02:28.790> so<00:02:29.359> I

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
then just to stay above 30 FPS so I

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.530 
then just to stay above 30 FPS so I
guess<00:02:32.500> it's<00:02:33.500> not<00:02:33.590> too<00:02:33.650> bad<00:02:33.920> for<00:02:34.129> 4k<00:02:34.400> but<00:02:35.239> still

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
guess it's not too bad for 4k but still

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.649 
guess it's not too bad for 4k but still
you<00:02:35.930> know<00:02:36.049> I<00:02:36.260> still<00:02:36.799> prefer<00:02:36.980> 60<00:02:37.930> steady<00:02:38.930> 60<00:02:40.659> so

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:41.659 
you know I still prefer 60 steady 60 so

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:45.789 
you know I still prefer 60 steady 60 so
as<00:02:41.719> you<00:02:41.810> can<00:02:41.900> see<00:02:43.599> we're<00:02:44.599> coasting<00:02:44.870> just<00:02:45.439> below

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
as you can see we're coasting just below

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:53.120 
as you can see we're coasting just below
seven<00:02:46.430> six<00:02:46.909> point<00:02:47.150> seven

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:03.880 

Oh<00:02:53.960> went<00:02:54.960> over<00:02:55.940> went<00:02:56.940> over

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:19.030 

Wow<00:03:05.060> getting<00:03:06.060> close<00:03:06.330> to<00:03:07.519> 6.8

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.460 

so<00:03:21.800> basically<00:03:22.880> think<00:03:23.880> I'm<00:03:24.000> gonna<00:03:24.260> wrap<00:03:25.260> this

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
so basically think I'm gonna wrap this

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:33.560 
so basically think I'm gonna wrap this
test<00:03:25.800> up<00:03:29.780> so<00:03:30.780> yeah<00:03:30.960> as<00:03:31.140> you've<00:03:31.350> seen<00:03:32.570> 6.8

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
test up so yeah as you've seen 6.8

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.760 
test up so yeah as you've seen 6.8
almost<00:03:35.060> with<00:03:36.060> maximum<00:03:36.690> settings<00:03:37.110> and<00:03:37.530> one

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
almost with maximum settings and one

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.520 
almost with maximum settings and one
monitor<00:03:38.250> so<00:03:38.670> maybe<00:03:38.970> if<00:03:39.450> you<00:03:39.660> are<00:03:39.780> running<00:03:40.140> on

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
monitor so maybe if you are running on
