00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.830 

our<00:01:25.680> land<00:01:25.950> sunset<00:01:26.460> did<00:01:26.729> an<00:01:26.820> okay<00:01:27.210> job<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.689> going

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
our land sunset did an okay job of going

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.840 
our land sunset did an okay job of going
over<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.470> areas<00:01:28.829> with<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.070> single<00:01:29.310> coat<00:01:29.490> but<00:01:29.820> I

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
over the areas with a single coat but I

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.609 
over the areas with a single coat but I
still<00:01:30.119> recommend<00:01:30.420> doing<00:01:30.689> probably<00:01:31.200> two<00:01:31.439> with

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
still recommend doing probably two with

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.530 
still recommend doing probably two with
this<00:01:31.740> particular<00:01:32.280> paint<00:01:32.549> color<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:33.390> way<00:01:33.479> you

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
this particular paint color that way you

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.480 
this particular paint color that way you
get<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.720> nice<00:01:33.900> true<00:01:34.320> yellow<00:01:34.710> color<00:01:34.950> on<00:01:35.250> all

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
get a nice true yellow color on all

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.609 
get a nice true yellow color on all
these<00:01:35.640> areas

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.260 

I<00:01:41.890> then<00:01:42.890> highlighted<00:01:43.369> them<00:01:43.460> all<00:01:43.609> with<00:01:43.880> Uriel

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
I then highlighted them all with Uriel

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.789 
I then highlighted them all with Uriel
yellow<00:01:44.600> there's<00:01:45.049> really<00:01:45.170> no<00:01:45.409> point<00:01:45.710> in

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
yellow there's really no point in

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.169 
yellow there's really no point in
shading<00:01:46.159> them<00:01:46.310> since<00:01:46.609> they<00:01:46.729> don't<00:01:46.820> have<00:01:46.969> any

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
shading them since they don't have any

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:49.929 
shading them since they don't have any
recesses<00:01:47.570> in<00:01:47.780> them<00:01:48.079> and<00:01:48.609> it's<00:01:49.609> not

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
recesses in them and it's not

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:51.969 
recesses in them and it's not
particularly<00:01:50.600> easy<00:01:50.840> to<00:01:51.140> shade<00:01:51.380> yellow<00:01:51.770> unless

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
particularly easy to shade yellow unless

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.959 
particularly easy to shade yellow unless
you<00:01:52.069> have<00:01:52.159> a<00:01:52.189> yellow<00:01:52.369> shading<00:01:53.049> and<00:01:54.789> as<00:01:55.789> with

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
you have a yellow shading and as with

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:58.059

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
really love a grey liner is it appears

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.539 
really love a grey liner is it appears
black<00:02:14.599> in<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.260> shades<00:02:15.560> but<00:02:16.130> actually<00:02:16.430> will

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
black in the shades but actually will

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.360 
black in the shades but actually will
appear<00:02:16.849> a<00:02:16.880> very<00:02:17.120> dark<00:02:17.569> matte<00:02:17.989> gray<00:02:18.470> when<00:02:19.190> hit

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
appear a very dark matte gray when hit

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.740 
appear a very dark matte gray when hit
by<00:02:19.400> any<00:02:19.700> light<00:02:19.880> source<00:02:20.180> so<00:02:20.420> it<00:02:20.510> really

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
by any light source so it really

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.080 
by any light source so it really
provides<00:02:21.230> some<00:02:21.319> nice<00:02:21.560> contrast<00:02:22.190> that<00:02:22.760> out<00:02:22.880> on

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
provides some nice contrast that out on

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.800 
provides some nice contrast that out on
black<00:02:23.329> wouldn't<00:02:23.750> normally<00:02:23.959> provide<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:25.780> so<00:02:26.780> I

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
black wouldn't normally provide and so I

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.400 
black wouldn't normally provide and so I
painted<00:02:27.079> his<00:02:27.440> chest<00:02:27.980> plate<00:02:28.209> the<00:02:29.209> parts<00:02:30.049> on<00:02:30.230> his

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
painted his chest plate the parts on his

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.039 
painted his chest plate the parts on his
axe<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:32.420> metal<00:02:33.319> loincloth<00:02:33.860> on<00:02:34.280> him<00:02:34.790> his<00:02:35.629> belt

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
axe the metal loincloth on him his belt

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.030 
axe the metal loincloth on him his belt
and<00:02:36.440> I<00:02:37.400> even<00:02:37.610> painted<00:02:37.970> wire<00:02:38.690> on<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.500> wiring<00:02:39.680> I

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
and I even painted wire on the wiring I

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.039 
and I even painted wire on the wiring I
painted<00:02:40.549> some<00:02:40.730> stripes<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.420> make<00:02:41.569> just<00:02:42.019> a

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
painted some stripes to make just a

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.979 
painted some stripes to make just a
little<00:02:42.200> bit<00:02:42.290> of<00:02:42.379> a<00:02:42.470> pattern<00:02:42.709> on<00:02:43.069> the<00:02:43.280> wiring<00:02:43.489> I

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
little bit of a pattern on the wiring I

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.670 
little bit of a pattern on the wiring I
also<00:02:44.989> choose<00:02:45.230> some<00:02:46.000> more<00:02:47.000> of<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.900> coiled

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
also choose some more of the coiled

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.500 
also choose some more of the coiled
wiring<00:02:49.100> on<00:02:49.190> his<00:02:49.340> back<00:02:49.549> inside<00:02:50.000> to<00:02:50.150> paint<00:02:50.329> that

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
wiring on his back inside to paint that

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.559 
wiring on his back inside to paint that
grey<00:02:51.440> liner<00:02:51.650> as<00:02:51.859> well

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.830 

and<00:02:54.709> finally<00:02:55.709> I<00:02:55.769> also<00:02:55.859> painted<00:02:56.249> the<00:02:56.840> chimneys

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
and finally I also painted the chimneys

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.170 
and finally I also painted the chimneys
as<00:02:58.019> you<00:02:58.170> can<00:02:58.319> see<00:02:58.499> here<00:02:59.040> gray<00:02:59.549> liner<00:02:59.790> which

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
as you can see here gray liner which

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.699 
as you can see here gray liner which
they<00:03:00.389> will<00:03:00.540> be<00:03:00.689> later<00:03:00.870> going<00:03:01.049> on<00:03:01.200> with<00:03:01.319> more

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
they will be later going on with more

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.260 
they will be later going on with more
golds

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.730 

gray<00:03:08.270> liner<00:03:08.480> is<00:03:08.600> a<00:03:08.660> particularly<00:03:08.960> thin<00:03:09.470> color

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
gray liner is a particularly thin color

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.620 
gray liner is a particularly thin color
but<00:03:10.460> it<00:03:10.550> does<00:03:10.700> tend<00:03:10.940> to<00:03:11.030> give<00:03:11.150> good<00:03:11.360> coverage

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
but it does tend to give good coverage

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.520 
but it does tend to give good coverage
with<00:03:11.780> a<00:03:11.840> single<00:03:12.050> coat

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
with a single coat

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.110 
with a single coat
I<00:03:12.560> do<00:03:13.010> recommend<00:03:13.430> just<00:03:13.640> making<00:03:13.850> sure<00:03:13.940> you<00:03:14.030> have

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
I do recommend just making sure you have

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.270 
I do recommend just making sure you have
a<00:03:14.180> nice<00:03:14.360> even<00:03:15.140> coverage<00:03:15.350> of<00:03:15.740> this<00:03:15.950> color

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
a nice even coverage of this color

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:30.690 
a nice even coverage of this color
before<00:03:17.030> proceeding<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.540> any<00:03:17.690> shading

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.870 

and<00:03:31.150> as<00:03:31.240> you<00:03:31.330> can<00:03:31.390> see<00:03:31.480> here<00:03:31.690> I'm<00:03:31.990> pinning<00:03:32.319> his

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
and as you can see here I'm pinning his

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.790 
and as you can see here I'm pinning his
backpack<00:03:33.880> just<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:34.959> center<00:03:35.200> part<00:03:35.470> of<00:03:35.560> it<00:03:35.680> with

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
backpack just the center part of it with

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.610 
backpack just the center part of it with
grey<00:03:35.980> liner<00:03:36.810> as<00:03:37.810> well<00:03:38.080> as<00:03:38.170> the<00:03:38.260> backs<00:03:38.440> the

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
grey liner as well as the backs the

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.280 
grey liner as well as the backs the
chimneys<00:03:38.980> which<00:03:39.660> will<00:03:40.660> be<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:40.900> surrounding

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
chimneys which will be the surrounding

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.040 
chimneys which will be the surrounding
parts<00:03:41.530> of<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.770> gold<00:03:42.010> ghosts<00:03:42.670> I<00:03:42.910> really<00:03:43.900> love

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
parts of the gold ghosts I really love

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.479 
parts of the gold ghosts I really love
about<00:03:44.140> this<00:03:44.319> new<00:03:44.470> model<00:03:44.770> is<00:03:44.860> the<00:03:45.010> awesome

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
about this new model is the awesome

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.190 
about this new model is the awesome
detail<00:03:45.880> in<00:03:46.060> such<00:03:46.239> areas<00:03:46.630> as<00:03:46.660> the<00:03:46.810> chimneys

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
detail in such areas as the chimneys

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.820 
detail in such areas as the chimneys
with<00:03:47.410> the<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:48.390> ghosts<00:03:49.390> on<00:03:49.959> the<00:03:50.140> chimneys<00:03:50.530> and

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
with the the ghosts on the chimneys and

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:59.410 
with the the ghosts on the chimneys and
some<00:03:51.400> of<00:03:51.489> this<00:03:51.550> amazing<00:03:51.730> detail<00:03:52.510> on<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:52.930> back

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.550 

as<00:04:00.420> you<00:04:00.599> can<00:04:00.689> see<00:04:00.810> here<00:04:01.019> I'm<00:04:01.170> just<00:04:01.349> painting

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
as you can see here I'm just painting

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.490 
as you can see here I'm just painting
very<00:04:02.010> thin<00:04:02.489> lines<00:04:02.879> of<00:04:03.390> gray<00:04:03.659> liner<00:04:03.870> over<00:04:04.019> the

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
very thin lines of gray liner over the

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.050 
very thin lines of gray liner over the
Reds<00:04:04.709> to<00:04:05.069> give<00:04:05.189> it<00:04:05.280> a<00:04:05.340> nice<00:04:05.489> pattern<00:04:05.760> I

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
Reds to give it a nice pattern I

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.390 
Reds to give it a nice pattern I
recommend<00:04:06.900> just<00:04:06.930> doing<00:04:07.049> some<00:04:07.409> slow<00:04:07.769> thin

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
recommend just doing some slow thin

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.160 
recommend just doing some slow thin
brush<00:04:08.670> strokes<00:04:09.030> and<00:04:09.209> building<00:04:09.510> them<00:04:09.629> up<00:04:09.840> a

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
brush strokes and building them up a

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.839 
brush strokes and building them up a
little<00:04:10.290> bit<00:04:10.470> at<00:04:10.590> a<00:04:10.620> time<00:04:10.650> until<00:04:11.489> you<00:04:11.610> get<00:04:11.760> to

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
little bit at a time until you get to

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.759 
little bit at a time until you get to
the<00:04:11.970> desired<00:04:12.269> thickness<00:04:12.599> of<00:04:12.989> stripes<00:04:13.650> that

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
the desired thickness of stripes that

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:21.920 
the desired thickness of stripes that
you'd<00:04:14.040> like<00:04:20.180> for<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:21.269> yellow<00:04:21.419> wiring<00:04:21.810> I

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
you'd like for the yellow wiring I

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.870 
you'd like for the yellow wiring I
decided<00:04:22.229> to<00:04:22.380> paint<00:04:22.590> them<00:04:22.949> at<00:04:23.190> about<00:04:23.430> a<00:04:23.460> 45

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
decided to paint them at about a 45

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.159 
decided to paint them at about a 45
degree<00:04:23.910> angle<00:04:24.180> just<00:04:24.720> to<00:04:24.840> provide<00:04:25.110> some

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
degree angle just to provide some

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:32.480 
degree angle just to provide some
variation<00:04:30.260> when<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.590> base<00:04:31.710> coat<00:04:31.889> is<00:04:31.979> dry<00:04:32.010> I

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
variation when the base coat is dry I

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.900 
variation when the base coat is dry I
gave<00:04:33.150> all<00:04:33.360> the<00:04:33.539> great<00:04:33.720> liner<00:04:33.979> areas<00:04:34.979> a<00:04:35.220> non-oil

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
gave all the great liner areas a non-oil

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.320 
gave all the great liner areas a non-oil
shading<00:04:36.380> which<00:04:37.380> will<00:04:37.530> still<00:04:37.680> keep<00:04:37.889> the<00:04:38.729> dark

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
shading which will still keep the dark

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.930 
shading which will still keep the dark
gray<00:04:39.780> but<00:04:40.650> it'll<00:04:40.889> end<00:04:41.010> up<00:04:41.100> just<00:04:41.340> darkening<00:04:41.820> the

gray but it'll end up just darkening the
recesses<00:04:42.300> and<00:04:42.660> the<00:04:42.810> edges<00:04:43.320> or<00:04:43.560> anything

recesses and the edges or anything

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.770 
recesses and the edges or anything
that's<00:04:44.039> ordering<00:04:44.789> an<00:04:44.880> edge<00:04:45.000> a<00:04:45.270> little<00:04:45.690> bit

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
that's ordering an edge a little bit

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.330 
that's ordering an edge a little bit
more<00:04:45.960> just<00:04:46.470> to<00:04:46.620> give<00:04:46.710> it<00:04:46.800> a<00:04:46.860> little<00:04:46.979> bit<00:04:47.130> more

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
more just to give it a little bit more

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.270 
more just to give it a little bit more
darkness<00:04:48.300> and<00:04:48.660> shading<00:04:49.139> and<00:04:49.289> keep<00:04:49.979> the<00:04:50.160> nice

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
darkness and shading and keep the nice

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:59.570 
darkness and shading and keep the nice
dark<00:04:50.580> gray<00:04:50.820> on<00:04:51.150> the<00:04:51.210> raised<00:04:51.510> areas

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.950 

luckily<00:05:00.580> once<00:05:00.880> again<00:05:01.120> this<00:05:01.240> was<00:05:01.419> a<00:05:01.450> very<00:05:01.720> quick

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
luckily once again this was a very quick

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.659 
luckily once again this was a very quick
step<00:05:02.260> cuz<00:05:02.650> shading<00:05:02.919> tends<00:05:03.100> to<00:05:03.280> be<00:05:03.430> a

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
step cuz shading tends to be a

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:05.430 
step cuz shading tends to be a
relatively<00:05:04.240> quick<00:05:04.480> step<00:05:04.720> comparing<00:05:05.169> to<00:05:05.350> the

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
relatively quick step comparing to the

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:19.840 
relatively quick step comparing to the
base<00:05:05.590> coats

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.520 

another<00:05:20.540> thing<00:05:20.810> that's<00:05:20.900> up<00:05:21.080> to<00:05:21.200> you<00:05:21.290> is

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
another thing that's up to you is

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.930 
another thing that's up to you is
whether<00:05:21.710> or<00:05:21.860> not<00:05:21.950> you<00:05:22.130> want<00:05:22.310> to<00:05:22.370> water<00:05:22.580> down

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
whether or not you want to water down

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.090 
whether or not you want to water down
your<00:05:22.970> shading<00:05:23.570> for<00:05:23.960> this<00:05:24.110> one<00:05:24.380> I<00:05:24.530> decided<00:05:24.620> not

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
your shading for this one I decided not

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.190 
your shading for this one I decided not
to<00:05:25.160> water<00:05:25.490> down<00:05:25.790> my<00:05:25.820> non<00:05:26.240> oil<00:05:26.540> at<00:05:26.720> all<00:05:26.840> cuz<00:05:27.140> I

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
to water down my non oil at all cuz I

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.960 
to water down my non oil at all cuz I
really<00:05:27.410> wanted<00:05:27.710> to<00:05:27.770> dark<00:05:28.250> in<00:05:28.430> those<00:05:28.580> recesses

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
really wanted to dark in those recesses

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.850 
really wanted to dark in those recesses
but<00:05:29.900> if<00:05:30.020> you<00:05:30.110> want<00:05:30.260> to<00:05:30.320> provide<00:05:30.500> a<00:05:30.560> little<00:05:30.770> bit

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
but if you want to provide a little bit

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.560 
but if you want to provide a little bit
less<00:05:31.010> contrast<00:05:31.430> to<00:05:31.640> feel<00:05:31.820> free<00:05:32.030> to<00:05:32.060> do<00:05:32.210> one<00:05:32.450> to

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
less contrast to feel free to do one to

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:54.869 
less contrast to feel free to do one to
one<00:05:32.690> mix<00:05:32.900> of<00:05:33.080> non<00:05:33.260> oil<00:05:33.650> and<00:05:33.980> water

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:54.879 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:57.419 

and<00:05:55.240> I<00:05:55.779> decided<00:05:56.259> to<00:05:56.409> a<00:05:56.439> very<00:05:56.770> thin<00:05:56.860> edge

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:57.429 
and I decided to a very thin edge

00:05:57.429 --> 00:06:00.779 
and I decided to a very thin edge
highlight<00:05:58.059> on<00:05:58.270> all<00:05:58.419> these<00:05:58.599> black<00:05:59.469> areas<00:05:59.800> with

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:00.789 
highlight on all these black areas with

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:03.570 
highlight on all these black areas with
a<00:06:00.819> minister<00:06:01.330> Adam<00:06:01.539> gray<00:06:02.050> and<00:06:02.379> the<00:06:03.069> nice<00:06:03.219> gray

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
a minister Adam gray and the nice gray

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:04.649 
a minister Adam gray and the nice gray
will<00:06:03.759> provide<00:06:03.969> a<00:06:04.089> really<00:06:04.300> nice<00:06:04.419> contrast

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:04.659 
will provide a really nice contrast

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:06.689 
will provide a really nice contrast
belong<00:06:05.110> the<00:06:05.199> edges<00:06:05.499> and<00:06:05.679> make<00:06:05.740> them<00:06:06.459> really

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:06.699 
belong the edges and make them really

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:09.079 
belong the edges and make them really
stand<00:06:06.939> out<00:06:07.089> and<00:06:07.330> pop<00:06:07.449> compared<00:06:08.409> to<00:06:08.589> the<00:06:08.709> dark

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:09.089 
stand out and pop compared to the dark

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:17.899 
stand out and pop compared to the dark
gray<00:06:10.089> on<00:06:10.479> the<00:06:10.619> other<00:06:11.619> parts<00:06:12.189> of<00:06:12.339> the<00:06:12.490> model

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:17.909 

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:19.889 

just<00:06:18.909> with<00:06:19.029> a<00:06:19.089> step<00:06:19.300> remember<00:06:19.539> to<00:06:19.719> take<00:06:19.869> your

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:19.899 
just with a step remember to take your

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:22.769 
just with a step remember to take your
time<00:06:20.229> and<00:06:20.499> to<00:06:20.860> slowly<00:06:21.219> drag<00:06:21.610> your<00:06:21.759> brush<00:06:21.909> along

00:06:22.769 --> 00:06:22.779 
time and to slowly drag your brush along

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:24.719 
time and to slowly drag your brush along
the<00:06:23.110> very<00:06:23.319> edges<00:06:23.770> that<00:06:24.009> you<00:06:24.099> want<00:06:24.339> to<00:06:24.550> stand

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:24.729 
the very edges that you want to stand

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:31.109 
the very edges that you want to stand
out<00:06:25.679> as<00:06:28.110> you<00:06:29.110> can<00:06:29.229> see<00:06:29.409> I<00:06:29.649> also<00:06:30.069> decided<00:06:30.610> to<00:06:30.819> use

00:06:31.109 --> 00:06:31.119 
out as you can see I also decided to use

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:34.109 
out as you can see I also decided to use
an<00:06:31.539> over<00:06:31.779> brush<00:06:31.929> technique<00:06:32.499> on<00:06:32.709> the<00:06:33.639> handles

00:06:34.109 --> 00:06:34.119 
an over brush technique on the handles

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:36.209 
an over brush technique on the handles
and<00:06:34.330> the<00:06:34.599> front<00:06:34.839> wiring<00:06:35.349> just<00:06:35.649> make<00:06:35.860> them<00:06:36.009> pop

00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:36.219 
and the front wiring just make them pop

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:40.619 
and the front wiring just make them pop
a<00:06:36.459> little<00:06:36.759> bit<00:06:36.909> more<00:06:39.179> and<00:06:40.179> with<00:06:40.389> this<00:06:40.479> step

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:40.629 
a little bit more and with this step

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:41.909 
a little bit more and with this step
nearing<00:06:40.869> completion<00:06:40.990> we<00:06:41.469> can<00:06:41.619> turn<00:06:41.769> our

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:41.919 
nearing completion we can turn our

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:43.949 
nearing completion we can turn our
attention<00:06:41.949> to<00:06:42.369> focusing<00:06:42.969> on<00:06:43.059> the<00:06:43.179> gold<00:06:43.449> areas

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:43.959 
attention to focusing on the gold areas

00:06:43.959 --> 00:06:51.850 
attention to focusing on the gold areas
of<00:06:44.050> the<00:06:44.110> model<00:06:44.259> and<00:06:44.499> finishing<00:06:45.219> up<00:06:45.279> the<00:06:45.399> rest

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860
