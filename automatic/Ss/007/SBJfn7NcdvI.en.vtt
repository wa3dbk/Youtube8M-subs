00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.569
 my dear awakened souls I am the 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.059
 xavi or mariano garcés next to a 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.720
 great lovely friendship and teacher of 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.940
 yoga marisol gonzález 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.250
 they invited through here in the 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.230
 nature and sharing to people 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.760
 some kids the other day they wrote me a 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.270
 mail and they told me how we can do 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.100
 I want to grow a little bit more like 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.900
 lengthen your spine or something like that 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.450
 something like how we do it for 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.759
 seems to be we see a small series of 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.190
 exercises that will help us as 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.770
 put strong legs activate the 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.420
 feet although apart create a little bit of 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.280
 space and the low column sounds 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.440
 perfect when we're going to start in front 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.060
 to the mat 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.470
 ok then there we are not going to give it a 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.890
 very long step to the right side 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.290
 with the little fingers looking in or 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.770
 which coccyx to the front I open my chest 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:57.010
 for your exact mix we're going to take 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.589
 a deep inhalation 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.989
 as I exhale my hip backwards with 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:04.659
 my back as straight as I can climb 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.540
 my knees to activate thighs and I'm going to 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.030
 bring my arms to my leg and we 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.920
 we were about five breaths and 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.880
 then I'm going to take my right hand to 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.420
 center and thinking about lengthening my column 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.420
 I raise my left arm 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.330
 the whole column 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:30.760
 under my left palm he placed it in the 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.520
 center and raise my right arm to heaven 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.070
 I keep stretching my knee column towards 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.500
 up and very strong legs and the 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.350
 legs stretched and strong and as much as 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.160
 but we think more about extending the 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.620
 column and exhaled and this time I cross my 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.380
 right hand below the left 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.330
 try to take my cucumber and let's 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.180
 do a column extension but with 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.140
 a little bit of twisting and I try to add my 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.850
 heart to heaven 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.929
 and he returned my two palms to the center 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.969
 long in my column 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:09.940
 exact let's go to the other side thanks and 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:13.330
 he came to heaven to prepare 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.810
 I cross below the right I try to 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.600
 take my ankle to the long column 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.530
 I extend arm and heart to heaven and nothing 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.100
 strong legs 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.100
 straight 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.859
 and gently under the palms to the center 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.940
 He extended my column we looked a little at 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:36.580
 front 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:41.610
 he exhaled relax my neck arms to me 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.610
 waist inhaled I raise my torso 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.739
 extra 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.069
 thank you for being on this planet with 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.069
 we
