00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 who grow apple banana from the municipality of 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.080
 50 miles from the capital 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.170
 know the difficulties of production 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.599
 but does not abandon range between 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.210
 banana diseases are the evil of panama 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.279
 but here the control of the disease is not 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.710
 made with chemical defenses 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.560
 application in farming can jeopardize the 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.740
 profit of producers 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:31.730
 economically sent there are techniques 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:34.350
 to soften this one but would become, 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:40.280
 uneconomic for the producer 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:43.350
 you surround yourself with technicians and use of 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.710
 defensive and other needs 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.379
 suitable for the production of apple banana 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.800
 because there her productivity does not 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.989
 would correspond to the cost of production 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.780
 choose soils with a higher content of matter 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.989
 organic acquisition of resistant seedlings 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.329
 it is also an alternative but to change the 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.439
 banana variety is not in the interests of 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.990
 producers 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.890
 The apple banana is one of the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.890
 market in the state 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.600
 luiz has been a producer for a while now and 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.490
 think of increasing the area planted 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.549
 is happy with the sales 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.409
 we sell everything is good trade avoid the 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.659
 planting on land that already has a 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.080
 history of the disease contributes to a 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.640
 productive crop in addition 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.100
 spacing and pruning of plants 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.659
 are details that help reduce 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.790
 disease risks 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.670
 the recommended spacing between the 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.200
 supporters is three by two meters 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.540
 but the producer also has to stay 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.350
 with the number of feet inside the 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.560
 same pit is not even your exact magnet 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.560
 technically driven guru 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:58.860
 we recommend you keep it for a pit 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:03.659
 only three plants is that it is the mother 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:06.780
 daughter and granddaughter and consequently the mother 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.720
 is with cash already in development 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.300
 vegetative is following as soon as 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.770
 collected, which is already in the 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.890
 next car 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.600
 here is already at a point of preparation 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.410
 and automatically 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.990
 will have another granddaughter who will be left in 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.600
 to replace their lazaro that they have 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.210
 years of production of this variety 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.520
 neglects land management and is 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:36.450
 for a good crop 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.520
 hit the marketing that does the tour 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.820
 To kill him, that's what we 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.100
 today does not use anything else, but by law 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:49.160
 also can not use any remedy 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.160
 also use nothing is to count luck
