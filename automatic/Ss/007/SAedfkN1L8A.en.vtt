 natural and definitive complications 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.040
 they are rare because of the pre-strike

 there is no plastic surgery without 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:37.410
 scars everyone has a process of 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.620
 different healing that does not depend

 similar to some famous or someone to 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:54.810
 who you admire surgical technique the 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:58.620
 abdominal wall is formed by skin 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:01.190
 fatty tissue and musculature every surgery 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.480
 of abdomen is meticulously planned 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:07.440
 analyzing the general format of 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:10.500
 Body Let's see how it performs 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.900
 abdominal surgery is performed a 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.470
 horizontal incision above the hairs 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.049
 Julian 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.510
 through it the surgeon has 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.820
 access to the abdominal muscles that 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.030
 can be approximate home 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:28.000
 separated leaving the abdominal wall more 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.880
 Firm the flaccid tissue that covers the 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.640
 abdominal muscle is carried and stretched 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.820
 down then removed leaving the 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:39.580
 abdomen firm and beautiful the navel is what 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.980
 located in the original premises through 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.080
 a new building whose incision is left 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.770
 hidden in the scar itself 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:50.350
 umbilical the size of the scar will be 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.960
 determined by the degree of flaccidity of 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.420
 abdomen when the patient presents little 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.660
 excess skin the size of the incision 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:01.800
 is less similar to the size of 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.450
 na technique known as mini caesarean 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.090
 tummy tuck in cases where there is 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.910
 great skin flaccidity the scar is more 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.370
 large however it is hidden in the 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.650
 brand of swimsuits the use of 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.410
 dre may not be necessary to eliminate 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.630
 liquids that form under the skin 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.980
 facilitating healing and 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.950
 promoting a 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:26.170
 faster operation he will be retired in 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:29.890
 the days following surgery according to 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:32.350
 each case, liposuction is often 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:35.220
 associated with abdominal surgery for 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:37.840
 remove localized fat 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.720
 thus providing a better contour 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:43.000
 bodily scars mature and 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.490
 they become less and less visible with the 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.540
 the passage of time may take some 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:52.210
 months for the final result 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:54.550
 post surgical recommendations the use 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.130
 of the modeling tape is necessary in 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.550
 the postoperative helping to remodel 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:02.650
 the new abdomen format decrease 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.350
 the accumulation of liquids and also 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:08.320
 accelerate recovery through 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.900
 compression of the region operated in the 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.000
 first days and in some cases the 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.760
 patient should maintain a position 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.100
 curved so as not to compromise the points 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.930
 When sleeping, you must also maintain 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.450
 curved position with the help of 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:25.570
 pillows under the knees and in the 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:28.030
 back sessions of lymphatic drainage and 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:30.670
 Ultrasound accelerate recovery 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:34.860
 promoting the absorption of swelling and 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:34.860
 improving internal healing
