much<00:01:11.400> much<00:01:11.640> more<00:01:11.700> quickly<00:01:12.270> than<00:01:12.690> before<00:01:12.930> we

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
much much more quickly than before we

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.070 
much much more quickly than before we
find<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.190> nurses<00:01:14.640> can<00:01:14.850> do<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.630> same<00:01:15.810> sort<00:01:16.050> of

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
find that nurses can do the same sort of

assessments that used to be done by

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.300 
assessments that used to be done by
doctors<00:01:17.910> because<00:01:18.660> we<00:01:19.020> run<00:01:19.230> to<00:01:19.410> a<00:01:19.440> protocol<00:01:20.040> and

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
doctors because we run to a protocol and

doctors because we run to a protocol and
things<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.300> come<00:01:21.480> outside<00:01:21.660> that<00:01:22.290> guideline

things that come outside that guideline

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.740 
things that come outside that guideline
then<00:01:23.460> we<00:01:23.550> do<00:01:23.700> refer<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.240> doctors<00:01:24.570> that's

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
then we do refer to the doctors that's

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.180 
then we do refer to the doctors that's
where<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.020> consultants<00:01:25.590> act<00:01:25.980> as<00:01:26.220> our<00:01:26.310> backup

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
where the consultants act as our backup

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.830 
where the consultants act as our backup
I<00:01:27.280> think<00:01:27.910> we<00:01:28.000> found<00:01:28.030> you<00:01:28.330> didn't<00:01:28.540> empty<00:01:28.720> your

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
I think we found you didn't empty your

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.600 
I think we found you didn't empty your
bladder<00:01:29.080> very<00:01:29.290> well<00:01:29.470> but<00:01:29.680> now<00:01:29.800> that's<00:01:30.310> much

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
bladder very well but now that's much

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.180 
bladder very well but now that's much
better<00:01:30.790> so<00:01:31.710> everything's<00:01:32.710> going<00:01:32.770> very<00:01:32.980> well

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
better so everything's going very well

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.280 
better so everything's going very well
very<00:01:33.520> satisfactory<00:01:34.240> there's<00:01:34.600> a<00:01:34.660> chance<00:01:34.930> to<00:01:35.170> be

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
very satisfactory there's a chance to be

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.720 
very satisfactory there's a chance to be
challenged<00:01:35.770> there's<00:01:35.980> a<00:01:36.040> chance<00:01:36.310> to<00:01:36.460> do<00:01:36.580> a<00:01:36.610> bit

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:36.730 
challenged there's a chance to do a bit

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:37.950 
challenged there's a chance to do a bit
more<00:01:36.760> learning<00:01:37.090> I've<00:01:37.420> been<00:01:37.600> off<00:01:37.690> to<00:01:37.840> do

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
more learning I've been off to do

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.470 
more learning I've been off to do
urology<00:01:38.440> course<00:01:38.680> I<00:01:39.040> don't<00:01:40.000> think<00:01:40.240> I<00:01:40.270> can<00:01:40.450> think

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.480 
urology course I don't think I can think

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.330 
urology course I don't think I can think
of<00:01:40.750> a<00:01:40.840> patient<00:01:41.230> who's<00:01:41.410> been<00:01:41.620> unhappy<00:01:42.010> being

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
of a patient who's been unhappy being

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.560 
of a patient who's been unhappy being
seen<00:01:42.520> by<00:01:42.550> a<00:01:42.700> nurse<00:01:42.880> rather<00:01:43.150> than<00:01:43.240> the<00:01:43.390> doctor

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
seen by a nurse rather than the doctor

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.430 
seen by a nurse rather than the doctor
yeah<00:01:44.260> face<00:01:44.770> that's<00:01:45.010> fine<00:01:45.660> consultant<00:01:46.660> really

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
yeah face that's fine consultant really

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.670 
yeah face that's fine consultant really
starts<00:01:47.830> to<00:01:47.890> see<00:01:48.190> and<00:01:48.460> have<00:01:49.180> time<00:01:49.480> to<00:01:49.720> see<00:01:49.930> those

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
starts to see and have time to see those

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.100 
starts to see and have time to see those
patients<00:01:51.310> that<00:01:51.820> really<00:01:52.270> need<00:01:52.450> a<00:01:52.480> surgical

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
patients that really need a surgical

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.720 
patients that really need a surgical
input<00:01:53.890> rather<00:01:54.100> than<00:01:54.430> medical<00:01:55.210> treatment<00:01:56.730> the

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
input rather than medical treatment the

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.140 
input rather than medical treatment the
main<00:01:57.910> challenge<00:01:58.420> in<00:01:58.780> this<00:01:59.050> was<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.550> logistics

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
main challenge in this was the logistics

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.720 
main challenge in this was the logistics
of<00:02:01.300> training<00:02:01.780> up<00:02:01.930> nurses<00:02:02.470> getting<00:02:03.190> the<00:02:03.310> GPS

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
of training up nurses getting the GPS

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.820 
of training up nurses getting the GPS
familiar<00:02:04.360> with<00:02:04.960> what<00:02:05.260> we<00:02:05.440> wanted<00:02:05.770> to

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
familiar with what we wanted to

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.450 
familiar with what we wanted to
investigate<00:02:06.250> but<00:02:07.180> once<00:02:07.390> we've<00:02:07.630> done<00:02:07.870> that<00:02:07.930> we

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
investigate but once we've done that we

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.950 
investigate but once we've done that we
found<00:02:09.460> that<00:02:09.670> the<00:02:09.850> service<00:02:10.210> was<00:02:10.420> very<00:02:10.480> well

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
found that the service was very well

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.140 
found that the service was very well
accepted<00:02:11.380> by<00:02:11.860> GPS<00:02:12.430> and<00:02:12.700> more<00:02:12.880> to<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.030> point

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
accepted by GPS and more to the point

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.230 
accepted by GPS and more to the point
very<00:02:13.840> well<00:02:13.930> accepted<00:02:14.440> by<00:02:14.890> patients<00:02:15.730> I<00:02:15.850> think

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
very well accepted by patients I think

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.350 
very well accepted by patients I think
it's<00:02:16.360> cost-effective<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:17.910> yeah<00:02:18.910> closer<00:02:19.240> to

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
it's cost-effective and yeah closer to

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.580 
it's cost-effective and yeah closer to
