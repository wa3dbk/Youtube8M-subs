00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:40.430
 I put some water on the stove and 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.879

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.879
 shape

 carve in all areas 5 suns 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:18.310
 Apart from that it is an economic recipe is 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.890
 easy we will not need so much 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.780
 effort not so many chemicals that are 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.750
 abrasive to our hands good yo 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.920
 I'm using gloves because I was 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.759
 cleaning part of my kitchen with chlorine 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.460
 and good that it was very dirty then 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.970
 I wanted to give derogatory to this guy more 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.500
 well so you know how to remove 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.460
 the car very easily since I'm going to 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.640
 burst a little fast without much 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.159
 effort very easy they saw how I was 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.810
 well now as it is, you have to have a 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.570
 little bit more in this part of here like this 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.280
 But well, it's not like this cookie 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.240
 and detail is fine and with a lot of effort 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.270
 except lightly scratching the stove is 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.979
 economic is not aggressive with our 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.049
 hands and it's something that we find 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.149
 easily in the kitchen they serve the 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.799
 difference with state 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.230
 it's easy to find a kitchen 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:16.349
 sodium bicarbonate and a piece of 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:20.090
