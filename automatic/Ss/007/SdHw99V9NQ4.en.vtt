00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
how do you tube Darlington farm here

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.220 
how do you tube Darlington farm here
just<00:00:02.669> over<00:00:02.850> here<00:00:03.000> in<00:00:03.090> the<00:00:03.179> woodshop<00:00:03.510> and<00:00:03.810> I

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
just over here in the woodshop and I

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.740 
just over here in the woodshop and I
thought<00:00:05.009> I<00:00:05.040> would<00:00:05.370> do<00:00:06.029> a<00:00:06.060> little<00:00:06.359> comparison

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
thought I would do a little comparison

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.740 
thought I would do a little comparison
video<00:00:07.200> here<00:00:07.500> I've<00:00:07.740> been<00:00:07.919> using<00:00:08.130> my<00:00:08.309> TS<00:00:09.059> 75

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
video here I've been using my TS 75

video here I've been using my TS 75
track<00:00:10.260> saw<00:00:10.530> by<00:00:10.800> Festool<00:00:11.160> for<00:00:11.880> about<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.300> year

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
track saw by Festool for about a year

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.250 
track saw by Festool for about a year
now<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:14.309> really<00:00:14.730> like<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.299> just<00:00:15.990> lately

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
now and I really like it just lately

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.800 
now and I really like it just lately
I've<00:00:16.410> been<00:00:16.740> doing<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.130> whole<00:00:17.310> lot<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.810> moulding

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
I've been doing a whole lot of moulding

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.109 
I've been doing a whole lot of moulding
and<00:00:19.050> things<00:00:19.980> like<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.220> where<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.640> need<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.000> do

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
and things like that where I need to do

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.050 
and things like that where I need to do
straight-line<00:00:21.810> ripping<00:00:22.640> so<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.670> broke<00:00:24.029> down

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
straight-line ripping so I broke down

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.830 
straight-line ripping so I broke down
and<00:00:24.330> bought<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.260> TS<00:00:25.680> 55<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:27.300> make<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.689> little

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
and bought a TS 55 to make that a little

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.450 
and bought a TS 55 to make that a little
easier<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.760> really<00:00:29.760> liked<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.060> 75<00:00:30.890> but<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.189> is

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
easier I really liked the 75 but it is

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.520 
easier I really liked the 75 but it is
really<00:00:33.000> heavy<00:00:33.210> that's<00:00:34.020> kind<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.469> only

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
really heavy that's kind of the only

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.990 
really heavy that's kind of the only
downside<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.730> looked<00:00:36.690> in<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.899> book<00:00:37.079> here

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
downside to it I looked in the book here

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.760 
downside to it I looked in the book here
and<00:00:39.110> the<00:00:40.160> 55<00:00:41.160> weighs<00:00:41.550> nine<00:00:42.059> point<00:00:42.360> nine<00:00:42.770> pounds

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
and the 55 weighs nine point nine pounds

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.250 
and the 55 weighs nine point nine pounds
and<00:00:43.950> then<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.360> 75<00:00:45.360> here<00:00:45.629> weighs<00:00:45.809> thirteen

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
and then the 75 here weighs thirteen

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.220 
and then the 75 here weighs thirteen
point<00:00:46.469> six<00:00:46.649> pounds<00:00:47.420> really<00:00:48.420> makes<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.200> big

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
point six pounds really makes a big

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.840 
point six pounds really makes a big
difference<00:00:49.800> when<00:00:50.010> you're<00:00:50.100> hefting<00:00:50.700> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
difference when you're hefting the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.240 
difference when you're hefting the
sucker<00:00:51.120> around<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:52.199> really<00:00:52.350> feels<00:00:52.739> like<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.039> lot

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
sucker around it really feels like a lot

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.560 
sucker around it really feels like a lot
bigger<00:00:53.430> difference<00:00:53.910> than<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.270> don't<00:00:54.449> know

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
bigger difference than that I don't know

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.930 
bigger difference than that I don't know
if<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.930> weight<00:00:55.739> there<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.039> for<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.460> tool<00:00:56.610> and

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
if the weight there is for the tool and

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.060 
if the weight there is for the tool and
the<00:00:57.030> case<00:00:57.239> or<00:00:57.480> what<00:00:57.690> but<00:00:57.899> man<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:58.559> feels<00:00:58.770> a

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
the case or what but man this feels a

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.529 
the case or what but man this feels a
whole<00:00:59.100> lot<00:00:59.550> lighter<00:01:00.120> than<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:01.260> 75<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.539> really

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
whole lot lighter than the 75 I really

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.230 
whole lot lighter than the 75 I really
like<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.780> 75<00:01:04.229> for<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.500> versatility<00:01:05.210> what<00:01:06.210> I

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
like the 75 for the versatility what I

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.510 
like the 75 for the versatility what I
really<00:01:06.540> like<00:01:06.740> well<00:01:07.740> aside<00:01:07.979> from<00:01:08.040> just<00:01:08.400> you

really like well aside from just you

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.580 
really like well aside from just you

hundred<00:01:25.259> pound<00:01:25.590> piece<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.860> wood<00:01:26.159> onto<00:01:26.490> a

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
hundred pound piece of wood onto a

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.390 
hundred pound piece of wood onto a
jointer<00:01:27.390> planer<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:28.049> really<00:01:28.860> like<00:01:29.040> being<00:01:29.280> able

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
jointer planer so really like being able

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.730 
jointer planer so really like being able
to<00:01:29.579> put<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.090> nice<00:01:30.299> straight<00:01:30.659> edge<00:01:30.689> down<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.259> piece

of<00:01:31.799> wood<00:01:32.040> like<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.460> but<00:01:32.790> it's<00:01:33.420> really<00:01:33.750> heavy

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
of wood like that but it's really heavy

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.230 
of wood like that but it's really heavy
the<00:01:34.860> difference<00:01:35.250> between<00:01:35.460> these<00:01:35.729> again<00:01:36.119> if

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
the difference between these again if

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.510 
the difference between these again if
you're<00:01:36.360> not<00:01:36.450> familiar<00:01:36.680> 75<00:01:37.680> millimeter<00:01:38.220> cut

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
you're not familiar 75 millimeter cut

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.200 
you're not familiar 75 millimeter cut
depth<00:01:39.020> versus<00:01:40.020> 55<00:01:40.860> millimeter<00:01:41.340> cut<00:01:41.549> depth<00:01:41.850> a

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
depth versus 55 millimeter cut depth a

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.240 
depth versus 55 millimeter cut depth a
little<00:01:42.720> bit<00:01:42.840> bigger<00:01:42.990> motor<00:01:43.290> on<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:43.950> forget

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
little bit bigger motor on this I forget

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.090 
little bit bigger motor on this I forget
exactly<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:45.409> wattage<00:01:46.409> difference<00:01:46.890> but

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
exactly the wattage difference but

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.420 
exactly the wattage difference but
they're<00:01:47.399> pretty<00:01:47.640> close<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:48.119> power<00:01:49.310> you<00:01:50.310> can

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
they're pretty close in power you can

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.639 
they're pretty close in power you can
kind<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.700> see<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.229> difference<00:01:52.229> in<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.439> blades

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
kind of see the difference in the blades

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.560 
kind of see the difference in the blades
back<00:01:52.890> here<00:01:53.189> this<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.610> 55<00:01:54.030> blade<00:01:54.299> that's

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
back here this is the 55 blade that's

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.219 
back here this is the 55 blade that's
the<00:01:54.689> 75<00:01:55.200> blade<00:01:55.530> 210<00:01:56.430> millimeter<00:01:57.229> 160

millimeter<00:01:58.710> blade<00:01:59.520> there<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.860> smaller

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
millimeter blade there the smaller

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.280 
millimeter blade there the smaller
blades<00:02:02.219> are<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.399> little<00:02:02.640> cheaper<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:03.540> have<00:02:04.049> the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
blades are a little cheaper I have the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.080 
blades are a little cheaper I have the
same<00:02:04.560> ATB<00:02:05.219> grind<00:02:05.549> blade<00:02:06.000> for<00:02:06.960> my<00:02:07.580> 75<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:08.970> I

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
same ATB grind blade for my 75 and I

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.760 
same ATB grind blade for my 75 and I
think<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.479> was<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.629> hundred<00:02:10.170> and<00:02:10.410> thirty

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
think it was a hundred and thirty

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.309 
think it was a hundred and thirty
dollars<00:02:10.890> ish<00:02:11.760> don't<00:02:12.180> quote<00:02:12.360> me<00:02:12.569> on<00:02:12.599> that<00:02:12.720> but

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
dollars ish don't quote me on that but

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.619 
dollars ish don't quote me on that but
think<00:02:13.469> it<00:02:13.590> was<00:02:13.650> about<00:02:13.769> 130<00:02:14.430> bucks<00:02:14.640> versus<00:02:15.090> 75

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
think it was about 130 bucks versus 75

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.869 
think it was about 130 bucks versus 75
so<00:02:15.989> they're<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.709> little<00:02:16.950> cheaper<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.549> you<00:02:17.730> know

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
so they're a little cheaper and you know

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.160 
so they're a little cheaper and you know
if<00:02:17.939> you're<00:02:18.060> just<00:02:18.180> doing<00:02:18.299> a<00:02:18.450> high-volume<00:02:18.840> of

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
if you're just doing a high-volume of

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.920 
if you're just doing a high-volume of
sheet<00:02:19.319> goods<00:02:19.560> or<00:02:19.859> just<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.549> know<00:02:20.670> ripping<00:02:20.930> 3/4

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
sheet goods or just you know ripping 3/4

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.500 
sheet goods or just you know ripping 3/4
stuff<00:02:22.230> then<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.519> know<00:02:23.609> there's<00:02:23.790> really<00:02:24.329> no

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
stuff then you know there's really no

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.739 
stuff then you know there's really no
reason<00:02:24.719> to<00:02:24.900> use<00:02:25.109> D<00:02:25.349> s<00:02:25.469> 75<00:02:26.060> these<00:02:27.060> do<00:02:27.239> blades<00:02:27.569> do

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:27.749 
reason to use D s 75 these do blades do

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:30.530 
reason to use D s 75 these do blades do
last<00:02:27.959> quite<00:02:28.079> a<00:02:28.260> long<00:02:28.349> time<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:29.069> I<00:02:29.189> have<00:02:30.030> had

last quite a long time and I have had
really<00:02:30.719> good<00:02:30.930> luck<00:02:30.989> sending<00:02:31.560> them<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.859> forest

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
really good luck sending them to forest

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.160 
really good luck sending them to forest
for<00:02:32.760> resharpening<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.629> don't<00:02:33.810> know<00:02:33.870> if<00:02:33.930> there's

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
for resharpening I don't know if there's

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.920 
for resharpening I don't know if there's
any<00:02:34.829> place<00:02:35.099> closer<00:02:35.459> that<00:02:36.150> does<00:02:36.359> it<00:02:36.510> but<00:02:36.659> I

any place closer that does it but I

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.530 
any place closer that does it but I
really<00:02:37.290> like<00:02:37.439> forest<00:02:37.829> for<00:02:38.040> that<00:02:38.299> was<00:02:39.299> kind<00:02:39.510> of

00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:40.439 
route than having this thing underneath

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:42.350

there<00:04:40.830> but<00:04:41.069> if<00:04:41.250> you're<00:04:41.729> doing<00:04:41.879> a<00:04:41.969> really<00:04:42.120> high

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
there but if you're doing a really high

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.290 
there but if you're doing a really high
volume<00:04:42.599> I<00:04:43.110> really<00:04:43.620> does<00:04:43.860> get<00:04:44.009> expensive<00:04:44.490> the

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
volume I really does get expensive the

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.640

filter<00:04:45.599> bags<00:04:45.810> for<00:04:46.080> this<00:04:46.259> are<00:04:46.439> fairly

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
filter bags for this are fairly

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.399 
filter bags for this are fairly
expensive<00:04:47.150> they<00:04:48.150> do<00:04:48.210> last<00:04:48.539> quite<00:04:48.659> a<00:04:48.900> long<00:04:49.139> time

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:49.409 
expensive they do last quite a long time

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:52.550 
expensive they do last quite a long time
