00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
but that doesn't that that wasn't from

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.100 
but that doesn't that that wasn't from
this<00:01:35.979> test<00:01:36.280> this<00:01:36.550> was<00:01:36.759> from<00:01:37.149> the<00:01:37.210> use<00:01:37.600> I've<00:01:37.899> put

this test this was from the use I've put
it<00:01:38.200> through<00:01:38.380> so<00:01:38.890> you<00:01:38.950> can't<00:01:39.369> say<00:01:39.610> that<00:01:39.640> this

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
it through so you can't say that this

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.820 
it through so you can't say that this
over<00:01:40.360> strike<00:01:40.630> test<00:01:40.960> has<00:01:41.200> affected<00:01:41.710> the

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
performance of the blade it's just a

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.539 
performance of the blade it's just a
really<00:01:44.290> tough<00:01:44.560> blade<00:01:44.829> and<00:01:45.100> ugly<00:01:47.490> personally<00:01:48.490> I

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
shingles with this blade but in my

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
shingles with this blade but in my
opinion<00:03:51.170> that<00:03:51.580> would<00:03:52.580> be<00:03:52.700> like<00:03:53.470> grabbing<00:03:54.470> a

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
opinion that would be like grabbing a

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.160 
opinion that would be like grabbing a
tuxedo<00:03:55.190> and<00:03:55.520> repainting<00:03:56.269> your<00:03:56.300> house<00:03:56.570> could

gravel
first<00:04:44.750> of<00:04:44.960> all<00:04:45.160> s30v<00:04:46.160> isn't<00:04:46.610> even<00:04:46.820> gonna<00:04:46.970> hold

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
first of all s30v isn't even gonna hold

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.390 
first of all s30v isn't even gonna hold
a<00:04:47.330> razor-sharp<00:04:47.690> edge<00:04:48.169> and<00:04:48.560> you<00:04:48.620> also<00:04:48.830> run<00:04:49.280> the

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
a razor-sharp edge and you also run the

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.420 
a razor-sharp edge and you also run the
risk<00:04:49.430> of<00:04:49.850> chipping<00:04:50.270> out<00:04:50.390> your<00:04:50.630> blade<00:04:50.870> and<00:04:51.430> you

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
risk of chipping out your blade and you

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.490 
risk of chipping out your blade and you
know<00:04:52.520> this<00:04:52.729> is<00:04:52.880> a<00:04:52.910> $200<00:04:53.810> blade<00:04:54.169> so<00:04:54.850> again<00:04:55.850> I

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
know this is a $200 blade so again I

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.020 
know this is a $200 blade so again I
recommend<00:04:57.500> the<00:04:58.040> koodoo<00:04:59.979> I<00:05:00.979> believe<00:05:01.789> that's

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
recommend the koodoo I believe that's

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.780 
recommend the koodoo I believe that's
all<00:05:02.210> I<00:05:02.270> have<00:05:02.660> so<00:05:03.140> basically<00:05:03.710> to<00:05:03.979> sum<00:05:04.220> it<00:05:04.250> up

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
all I have so basically to sum it up

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.530 
all I have so basically to sum it up
it's<00:05:05.630> ugly<00:05:05.930> cheap<00:05:06.800> knife<00:05:07.190> now<00:05:07.940> get<00:05:08.180> the<00:05:08.330> job

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
it's ugly cheap knife now get the job

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.140
