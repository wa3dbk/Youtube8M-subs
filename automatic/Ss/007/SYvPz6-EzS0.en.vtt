and part out 20 sections and bobby pin
those<00:01:00.329> into<00:01:00.600> place<00:01:00.750> your<00:01:01.559> next<00:01:01.890> step<00:01:02.039> would<00:01:02.219> be

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
those into place your next step would be

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.060 
those into place your next step would be
to<00:01:02.609> apply<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.969> product<00:01:03.359> for<00:01:04.080> her<00:01:04.170> hair<00:01:04.379> I'd<00:01:04.619> like

to apply a product for her hair I'd like

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.370 
to apply a product for her hair I'd like
to<00:01:05.189> apply<00:01:05.489> just<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.820> little<00:01:06.090> bit<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.570> cream

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
to apply just a little bit of a cream

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.140 
to apply just a little bit of a cream
based<00:01:07.650> product<00:01:08.070> because<00:01:08.369> it's<00:01:08.549> just<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:09.030> little

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
based product because it's just a little

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.910 
based product because it's just a little
bit<00:01:09.390> dry<00:01:09.600> since<00:01:09.869> we've<00:01:10.020> done<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.229> blow-dry

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
bit dry since we've done a blow-dry

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.280 
bit dry since we've done a blow-dry
and<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.400> our<00:01:11.549> next<00:01:11.790> step<00:01:12.090> would<00:01:12.299> be<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:15.259> add<00:01:16.259> a

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
and so our next step would be to add a

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.170 
and so our next step would be to add a
small<00:01:16.799> amount<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.250> cream<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.880> section

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
small amount of cream to that section

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.539 
small amount of cream to that section
the<00:01:19.170> next<00:01:19.439> decision<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.890> have<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.220> make<00:01:20.250> is

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
the next decision you have to make is

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.450 
the next decision you have to make is
whether<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.090> want<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.600> coil<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.350> twists<00:01:23.220> into

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
whether you want to coil the twists into

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.210 
whether you want to coil the twists into
place<00:01:23.820> or<00:01:24.270> whether<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.960> want<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.680> twist<00:01:26.009> the
