00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.150
 It was people, my refrigerator stopped. 

00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:11.150
 to function 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:14.119
 it is the brastemp're left vian a save 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:19.519
 but this one should be your model 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:21.769
 I do not know any idea what this is 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:26.089
 She 'll do it down there, you can see 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:28.220
 empty can in two days and has less than 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:31.210
 three weeks I switched the board one 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.210
 thermostat 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.969
 And there's a screw here. 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.899
 I let this champion stay like that 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:49.370
 is adapted here below and I saw the 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:53.660
 video of the LG that was said to be in 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:56.480
 end of the cat and I decided to take her 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.120
 understood to take a look until 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.500
 because if the technician comes, it will be expensive 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:06.500
 I paid three hundred and eighty -five 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:10.670
 to change the thermostat 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.780
 tire is I will now own this 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.720
 off 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.509
 the handset is off I already the wind 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.890
 hot in here I know you're 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:29.590
 I'll go there if it's there 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:29.590
 I thought I was going to record from the ice 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.400
 I'm going to play Alberto here. 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:07.729
 the hot wind to see if I can 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:14.420
 jump her 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:16.430
 she still has lots of ice and lots of ice 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:22.910
 I called the technician he sent it off 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:24.770
 But she did not tell me that she could be alone. 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.360
 asked me to hang up there and leave 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:31.239
 off and off 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:34.310
 Only there was in the YouTube video that 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.770
 It freezes up here and down here. 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.489
 have a little plate wanted to freeze and 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.410
 that does not let the little fan pass the 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:47.840
 wind down the fridge and there 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:50.420
 underneath it without revealing without ice none 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.239

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:57.590
