00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
I've done a few tutorials on it before

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.460 
I've done a few tutorials on it before
but<00:02:44.460> we're<00:02:45.360> going<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.660> use<00:02:45.840> this<00:02:46.020> to<00:02:46.200> change

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
but we're going to use this to change

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.400 
but we're going to use this to change
the<00:02:46.590> color<00:02:46.770> of<00:02:46.830> our<00:02:46.920> bit<00:02:47.180> so<00:02:48.180> go<00:02:48.570> to<00:02:48.630> file<00:02:48.990> open

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
the color of our bit so go to file open

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.520 
the color of our bit so go to file open
and<00:02:49.830> select<00:02:50.630> where<00:02:51.630> you<00:02:51.720> have<00:02:51.870> placed<00:02:52.290> your

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
and select where you have placed your

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.900 
and select where you have placed your
terrain<00:02:53.310> dot<00:02:53.550> PNG<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.560> open<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.680> now<00:02:56.610> we're

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
terrain dot PNG and open it now we're

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.720 
terrain dot PNG and open it now we're
going<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.150> zoom<00:02:57.270> in<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.930> 400%<00:02:58.620> just<00:02:59.370> so<00:02:59.460> we<00:02:59.580> can

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
going to zoom in to 400% just so we can

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.120 
going to zoom in to 400% just so we can
get<00:02:59.820> this<00:02:59.970> a<00:03:00.030> bit<00:03:00.270> better<00:03:00.420> so<00:03:00.740> if<00:03:01.740> your<00:03:01.890> isn't<00:03:02.100> a

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
get this a bit better so if your isn't a

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.410 
get this a bit better so if your isn't a
vendor<00:03:02.490> and<00:03:02.580> as<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:02.790> can<00:03:02.910> see<00:03:02.970> is<00:03:03.270> already

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
vendor and as you can see is already

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.970 
vendor and as you can see is already
green<00:03:03.780> let's<00:03:04.260> say<00:03:04.380> I<00:03:04.440> want<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.620> make<00:03:04.800> it<00:03:04.890> a

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
green let's say I want to make it a

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.980 
green let's say I want to make it a
different<00:03:05.100> color<00:03:05.430> I'm<00:03:06.210> going<00:03:06.510> to<00:03:06.630> make<00:03:06.810> it

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
different color I'm going to make it

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:12.470 
different color I'm going to make it
blue<00:03:07.860> for<00:03:08.130> this<00:03:08.250> tutorial<00:03:08.990> we're<00:03:09.990> going<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:11.480> do

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
blue for this tutorial we're going to do

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.090 
blue for this tutorial we're going to do
this<00:03:12.630> a<00:03:12.690> bit<00:03:12.960> differently<00:03:13.410> than<00:03:13.740> the<00:03:13.950> way<00:03:14.070> I

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
this a bit differently than the way I

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.990 
this a bit differently than the way I
actually<00:03:14.490> did<00:03:14.850> it<00:03:14.970> but<00:03:15.720> this<00:03:16.080> will<00:03:16.320> still<00:03:16.530> work

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
actually did it but this will still work

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000 
actually did it but this will still work
so<00:03:18.000> we're<00:03:18.180> going<00:03:18.330> to<00:03:18.570> select<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:19.260> lasso<00:03:19.980> tool

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
so we're going to select the lasso tool

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.480 
so we're going to select the lasso tool
of<00:03:20.520> the<00:03:21.060> free<00:03:21.480> select<00:03:21.660> tool<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:22.220> we're<00:03:23.220> going

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
of the free select tool and we're going

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:30.980 
of the free select tool and we're going
to<00:03:25.250> select<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:29.760> edges<00:03:30.150> of<00:03:30.240> the<00:03:30.300> bed<00:03:30.480> this<00:03:30.750> is<00:03:30.959> a

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
to select the edges of the bed this is a

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.080 
to select the edges of the bed this is a
bit<00:03:31.440> harder<00:03:32.070> since<00:03:32.370> you<00:03:32.520> have<00:03:32.700> to<00:03:32.850> get<00:03:33.000> it

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
bit harder since you have to get it

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.840 
bit harder since you have to get it
almost<00:03:33.390> exact<00:03:34.820> but<00:03:35.820> it's<00:03:36.230> faster<00:03:37.230> so<00:03:37.709> if<00:03:38.640> you

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
almost exact but it's faster so if you

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:45.330 
almost exact but it's faster so if you
can<00:03:39.209> do<00:03:39.510> it<00:03:39.540> then<00:03:40.350> do<00:03:40.620> it

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.880 

um<00:03:46.340> alright<00:03:47.300> and<00:03:47.600> once<00:03:48.080> you<00:03:48.200> select<00:03:48.350> it<00:03:48.590> it'll

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
um alright and once you select it it'll

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.800 
um alright and once you select it it'll
go<00:03:49.130> to<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:49.370> nearest<00:03:49.670> pixel<00:03:49.940> to<00:03:50.330> add<00:03:50.420> anyways

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
go to the nearest pixel to add anyways

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.010 
go to the nearest pixel to add anyways
so<00:03:51.500> not<00:03:52.280> much<00:03:52.520> to<00:03:52.940> worry

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
so not much to worry

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.640 
so not much to worry
um<00:03:55.240> you<00:03:56.240> still<00:03:56.569> do<00:03:56.750> have<00:03:56.780> to<00:03:57.140> get<00:03:57.260> it<00:03:57.350> close

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
um you still do have to get it close

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.500 
um you still do have to get it close
enough<00:03:57.830> so<00:03:58.280> that<00:03:58.310> it<00:03:58.550> doesn't<00:03:58.880> go<00:03:58.970> to<00:03:59.030> another

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
enough so that it doesn't go to another

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.650 
enough so that it doesn't go to another
half<00:03:59.750> pixel<00:04:00.110> so<00:04:00.550> alright<00:04:01.550> so<00:04:01.880> now<00:04:02.420> that<00:04:02.510> we

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
half pixel so alright so now that we

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.180 
half pixel so alright so now that we
have<00:04:02.690> this<00:04:02.990> selected<00:04:03.230> sorry<00:04:03.770> I'll<00:04:03.950> stop
