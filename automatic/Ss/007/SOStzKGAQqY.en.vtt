hey<00:00:03.510> Phoebe<00:00:03.990> r51<00:00:04.410> here<00:00:04.799> I'm<00:00:05.520> going<00:00:05.850> to<00:00:05.940> be

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
hey Phoebe r51 here I'm going to be

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.470 
hey Phoebe r51 here I'm going to be
doing<00:00:06.330> a<00:00:06.690> run<00:00:06.870> of<00:00:07.140> my<00:00:07.470> lego<00:00:07.950> jet<00:00:08.309> engine<00:00:08.700> but

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
doing a run of my lego jet engine but

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.000 
doing a run of my lego jet engine but
before<00:00:09.809> I<00:00:09.840> do<00:00:10.019> that<00:00:10.170> there's<00:00:10.620> been<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:10.860> little

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
before I do that there's been a little

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.789 
before I do that there's been a little
bit<00:00:11.130> of<00:00:11.280> confusion<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:12.210> which<00:00:12.990> engines<00:00:13.440> I<00:00:13.590> have

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
bit of confusion of which engines I have

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.640 
bit of confusion of which engines I have
and<00:00:14.130> what<00:00:14.400> they're<00:00:14.549> called<00:00:14.820> so<00:00:15.599> I'm<00:00:16.199> just

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
and what they're called so I'm just

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.140 
and what they're called so I'm just
going<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.890> quickly<00:00:17.070> show<00:00:17.430> you<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.670> four

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
going to quickly show you the four

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.970 
going to quickly show you the four
engines<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.630> have<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.109> what<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.320> call<00:00:19.590> them

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
engines I have and what I call them

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.450 
engines I have and what I call them
so<00:00:20.789> we'll<00:00:21.090> start<00:00:21.330> out<00:00:21.480> with<00:00:21.630> this<00:00:21.779> one<00:00:22.460> you'll

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
so we'll start out with this one you'll

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.880 
so we'll start out with this one you'll
recognize<00:00:23.880> this<00:00:24.060> one<00:00:24.330> from<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:25.470> fastest

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
recognize this one from the fastest

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.089 
recognize this one from the fastest
engine<00:00:26.099> on<00:00:26.340> YouTube<00:00:27.349> 16,000<00:00:28.349> plus<00:00:28.560> rpm<00:00:29.269> so

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
engine on YouTube 16,000 plus rpm so

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.030 
engine on YouTube 16,000 plus rpm so
it's<00:00:32.099> just<00:00:32.430> an<00:00:33.390> error<00:00:33.840> engine<00:00:34.350> basically<00:00:34.800> I

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
it's just an error engine basically I

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.830 
it's just an error engine basically I
call<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.700> turn<00:00:35.880> on<00:00:36.000> but<00:00:36.210> it's<00:00:36.360> not<00:00:36.510> actual

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
call it turn on but it's not actual

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.010 
call it turn on but it's not actual
turbine<00:00:37.670> so<00:00:39.110> that's<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:41.300> now<00:00:42.300> here<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.899> the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
turbine so that's that now here is the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.200 
turbine so that's that now here is the
one<00:00:43.140> I'm<00:00:43.290> going<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.530> be<00:00:43.649> running

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
one I'm going to be running

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.930 
one I'm going to be running
it's<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.360> Lego<00:00:45.719> jet<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.860> what<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.340> call<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.760> it's

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
it's a Lego jet is what I call it it's

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.600 
it's a Lego jet is what I call it it's
in<00:00:48.140> the<00:00:49.140> turbine<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.680> from<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.370> passenger

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
in the turbine and from the passenger

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.869 
in the turbine and from the passenger
jet<00:00:51.289> set<00:00:53.719> from<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.780> couple<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.410> years<00:00:55.590> ago<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.070> I

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
jet set from a couple of years ago and I

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.430 
jet set from a couple of years ago and I
think<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.239> sets<00:00:57.510> discontinued<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.320> it's

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
think that sets discontinued so it's

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.750 
think that sets discontinued so it's
going<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.620> be<00:00:58.680> hard<00:00:58.859> for<00:00:58.949> me<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.250> get<00:00:59.370> any<00:00:59.640> more

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
going to be hard for me to get any more

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.639 
going to be hard for me to get any more
because<00:00:59.910> that's<00:01:00.120> my<00:01:00.300> last<00:01:00.539> one<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:01.079> it's

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
because that's my last one that it's

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.969 
because that's my last one that it's
working<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.809> here's<00:01:03.809> my<00:01:04.019> four-stroke<00:01:04.589> that

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
working and here's my four-stroke that

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.550 
working and here's my four-stroke that
I'm<00:01:05.189> still<00:01:05.430> working<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:05.930> I'll<00:01:06.930> have<00:01:07.080> an<00:01:07.229> update

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
I'm still working on I'll have an update

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.840 
I'm still working on I'll have an update
video<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.720> out<00:01:09.720> in<00:01:10.110> like<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.860> few<00:01:11.189> weeks<00:01:11.310> or

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
video of this out in like a few weeks or

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.270 
video of this out in like a few weeks or
so<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.530> finally<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.909> fourth<00:01:15.210> engine<00:01:15.720> I

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
so and finally is the fourth engine I

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.590 
so and finally is the fourth engine I
just<00:01:17.280> built<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.670> like<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.850> week<00:01:18.090> ago<00:01:18.330> it's<00:01:18.509> my

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
just built it like a week ago it's my

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.710 
just built it like a week ago it's my
newest<00:01:18.900> engine<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:20.000> it's<00:01:21.000> based<00:01:21.299> off<00:01:21.479> one

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
newest engine and it's based off one

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.859 
newest engine and it's based off one
youtubers<00:01:22.290> design<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.860> can't<00:01:23.310> recall<00:01:23.430> his<00:01:23.670> name

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
youtubers design I can't recall his name

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.780 
youtubers design I can't recall his name
but<00:01:24.869> he<00:01:25.049> showed<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> video<00:01:25.710> on<00:01:26.130> how<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.310> build<00:01:26.549> it

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
but he showed a video on how to build it

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.399 
but he showed a video on how to build it
and<00:01:28.909> I'll<00:01:29.909> have<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.060> video<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.509> this<00:01:30.689> running<00:01:31.020> in

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
and I'll have a video of this running in

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.109 
and I'll have a video of this running in
about<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.740> week<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:34.520> there<00:01:35.520> are<00:01:35.909> my<00:01:36.090> four

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
about a week so there are my four

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.719 
about a week so there are my four
engines<00:01:39.049> so<00:01:40.049> now<00:01:40.200> let's<00:01:40.590> get<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.460> jet

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
engines so now let's get to the jet

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.310 
engines so now let's get to the jet
engine<00:01:44.149> okay<00:01:45.149> here's<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.630> jet<00:01:45.840> I'm<00:01:46.049> going<00:01:46.259> to

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
engine okay here's the jet I'm going to

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.289 
engine okay here's the jet I'm going to
do<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.590> just<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.920> minute<00:01:47.070> but<00:01:47.610> before<00:01:47.670> I'm<00:01:48.119> going

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
do in just a minute but before I'm going

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.539 
do in just a minute but before I'm going
to<00:01:48.390> show<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.540> how<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.930> works

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
to show you how it works

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.580 
to show you how it works
so<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.579> have<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.060> sideways<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.720> what<00:01:52.229> I'm<00:01:52.350> going

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
so I have it sideways and what I'm going

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.760 
so I have it sideways and what I'm going
to<00:01:52.649> do<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:53.070> put<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.340> funnel<00:01:53.610> down<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.090> hole<00:01:54.299> and

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
to do is put a funnel down that hole and

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.830 
to do is put a funnel down that hole and
pour<00:01:55.770> water<00:01:55.979> in<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.399> from<00:01:56.549> water<00:01:56.820> bottle<00:01:57.149> the

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
pour water in it from water bottle the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.020 
pour water in it from water bottle the
water<00:01:58.079> goes<00:01:58.500> straight<00:01:58.890> down<00:01:58.950> onto<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.790> fan

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
water goes straight down onto the fan

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.889 
water goes straight down onto the fan
blade<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:01.520> it<00:02:02.520> lowers<00:02:03.119> friction<00:02:03.689> and

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
blade and it lowers friction and

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.130 
blade and it lowers friction and
minimizes<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.740> wear<00:02:05.420> and<00:02:06.420> also<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.960> water

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
minimizes the wear and also the water

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.710 
minimizes the wear and also the water
mystifies<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.340> comes<00:02:08.640> out<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.849> back<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.390> it

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
mystifies and comes out the back and it

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.750 
mystifies and comes out the back and it
looks<00:02:09.750> like<00:02:10.020> exhaust<00:02:10.890> smoke<00:02:11.160> which<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.459> pretty

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
looks like exhaust smoke which is pretty

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.240 
looks like exhaust smoke which is pretty
cool

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
cool

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.309 
cool
so<00:02:14.250> I'm<00:02:14.459> going<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.849> get<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.209> air<00:02:15.599> compressor

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
so I'm going to get the air compressor

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.290 
so I'm going to get the air compressor
nozzle<00:02:16.770> and<00:02:16.950> hold<00:02:17.520> it<00:02:17.670> right<00:02:17.790> here<00:02:18.030> in<00:02:18.150> front

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
nozzle and hold it right here in front

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.270 
nozzle and hold it right here in front
of<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:18.780> that's<00:02:19.440> going<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.709> cause<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.069> fan

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
of it and that's going to cause the fan

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.210 
of it and that's going to cause the fan
blade<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:20.730> spin<00:02:20.970> really<00:02:21.330> fast<00:02:21.980> probably<00:02:22.980> about

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
blade to spin really fast probably about

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.690 
blade to spin really fast probably about
30,000<00:02:24.090> rpm<00:02:24.560> but<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.590> have<00:02:25.920> no<00:02:26.160> way<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.370> measure

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
30,000 rpm but I have no way to measure

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.120 
30,000 rpm but I have no way to measure
it<00:02:26.910> because<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:27.750> can<00:02:28.319> connect<00:02:28.739> it<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:28.980> the

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
it because I can connect it to the

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.750 
it because I can connect it to the
kilometer<00:02:29.790> so<00:02:30.330> I'm<00:02:30.420> just<00:02:30.630> judging<00:02:30.900> by<00:02:31.110> sound

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
kilometer so I'm just judging by sound

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.699 
kilometer so I'm just judging by sound
it's<00:02:32.760> probably<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.450> fastest<00:02:33.989> one<00:02:34.260> that<00:02:34.620> I

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
it's probably the fastest one that I

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.860 
it's probably the fastest one that I
have<00:02:35.540> so<00:02:36.540> that'll<00:02:37.170> be<00:02:37.290> pretty<00:02:37.319> cool<00:02:37.790> um<00:02:38.870> so

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
have so that'll be pretty cool um so

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.809 
have so that'll be pretty cool um so
before<00:02:40.019> I<00:02:40.200> do<00:02:40.319> it<00:02:40.590> please<00:02:41.190> check<00:02:41.550> out<00:02:41.700> my

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
how to run it in case you have one

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.430 
how to run it in case you have one
pictures<00:02:54.180> of<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.510> kind<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:54.870> where<00:02:55.019> that<00:02:55.290> it

pictures of the kind of where that it

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:40.920 
pictures of the kind of where that it
gets<00:02:57.080> so<00:02:58.080> now<00:02:58.830> let's<00:02:59.069> go

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:04:16.870 

well<00:03:41.930> I<00:03:41.959> just<00:03:42.020> got<00:03:42.440> stuck

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.220 

okay<00:04:17.880> I<00:04:17.910> just<00:04:17.970> got<00:04:18.359> stuck

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.370 

well<00:04:22.230> fast<00:04:22.620> engine<00:04:23.160> it<00:04:23.370> sounded<00:04:24.240> really<00:04:24.900> fast

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
well fast engine it sounded really fast

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.520 
well fast engine it sounded really fast
towards<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:25.889> ending<00:04:26.160> part<00:04:26.810> so<00:04:27.810> that<00:04:28.320> was

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
towards the ending part so that was

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.390 
towards the ending part so that was
probably<00:04:28.980> definitely<00:04:29.100> 30,000<00:04:30.060> rpm<00:04:30.450> and<00:04:31.400> good

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
probably definitely 30,000 rpm and good

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.250 
probably definitely 30,000 rpm and good
thing<00:04:32.580> I<00:04:32.639> didn't<00:04:32.880> break<00:04:33.090> anything<00:04:33.389> so<00:04:33.750> I'll

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260
