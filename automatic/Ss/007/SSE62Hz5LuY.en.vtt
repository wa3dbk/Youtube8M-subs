00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
theme of the program so you can make it

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.320 
theme of the program so you can make it
look<00:06:26.360> completely<00:06:26.719> different<00:06:28.180> some<00:06:29.180> of<00:06:29.270> these

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330

of<00:06:31.879> them<00:06:32.029> are<00:06:32.120> pretty<00:06:32.360> good<00:06:32.569> so<00:06:32.839> we<00:06:32.959> have

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990 
of them are pretty good so we have

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.760 
of them are pretty good so we have
people<00:06:33.349> that<00:06:33.500> like<00:06:34.039> at<00:06:34.190> all<00:06:34.310> different<00:06:34.490> ways

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:37.770 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.339 

you<00:06:38.770> can<00:06:38.860> see<00:06:39.039> now<00:06:39.389> the<00:06:40.389> different<00:06:40.780> looks<00:06:41.020> now

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:41.349 
you can see now the different looks now

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:44.070 
you can see now the different looks now
you<00:06:41.409> can<00:06:41.620> also<00:06:41.800> disable<00:06:42.400> the<00:06:43.270> color<00:06:43.509> setup

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 
you can also disable the color setup

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.399 
you can also disable the color setup
which<00:06:44.560> right<00:06:45.520> here<00:06:45.999> and<00:06:46.180> that<00:06:46.810> will<00:06:46.960> turn<00:06:47.169> off

00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:47.409 
which right here and that will turn off

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:49.019 
which right here and that will turn off
the<00:06:47.590> color<00:06:47.800> themes<00:06:48.159> and<00:06:48.400> make<00:06:48.550> the<00:06:48.639> program<00:06:48.819> a

00:06:49.019 --> 00:06:49.029 
the color themes and make the program a

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:52.950 
the color themes and make the program a
little<00:06:49.330> faster<00:06:51.120> so<00:06:52.120> I<00:06:52.150> can<00:06:52.330> go<00:06:52.419> down<00:06:52.629> here<00:06:52.659> and

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 
little faster so I can go down here and

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.589 
little faster so I can go down here and
I<00:06:53.139> can<00:06:53.319> pick<00:06:54.099> a<00:06:54.129> color<00:06:54.219> theme<00:06:54.789> and<00:06:55.180> I<00:06:55.300> think<00:06:55.509> I

00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:55.599 
I can pick a color theme and I think I

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:57.570 
I can pick a color theme and I think I
have<00:06:55.779> them<00:06:55.930> turned<00:06:56.199> off<00:06:56.439> right<00:06:56.800> now<00:06:57.009> so<00:06:57.340> let's

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:57.580 
have them turned off right now so let's

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.170 
have them turned off right now so let's
turn<00:06:57.789> them<00:06:57.909> back<00:06:58.090> on<00:06:58.889> there<00:06:59.889> you<00:06:59.979> go<00:07:00.129> you<00:07:00.939> see<00:07:01.029> I

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:01.180 
turn them back on there you go you see I

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:09.080 
turn them back on there you go you see I
can<00:07:01.300> change<00:07:01.479> the<00:07:01.629> whole<00:07:01.749> look<00:07:01.990> of<00:07:02.080> the<00:07:02.139> program

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.090 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.080 

okay<00:07:10.090> also<00:07:10.270> there's<00:07:10.659> a<00:07:10.719> sound<00:07:11.050> theme<00:07:11.409> option

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:12.090 
okay also there's a sound theme option

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.459 
okay also there's a sound theme option
so<00:07:13.090> if<00:07:13.180> we<00:07:13.270> want<00:07:13.389> to<00:07:13.449> turn<00:07:13.539> sound<00:07:13.870> themes<00:07:14.229> on

00:07:14.459 --> 00:07:14.469 
so if we want to turn sound themes on

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:17.760 
so if we want to turn sound themes on
you<00:07:14.710> can<00:07:15.090> collect<00:07:16.090> a<00:07:16.210> sound<00:07:16.479> theme<00:07:16.810> select<00:07:17.590> it

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:17.770 
you can collect a sound theme select it

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.999 
you can collect a sound theme select it
and<00:07:18.330> it<00:07:19.330> will<00:07:19.479> make<00:07:19.539> sounds<00:07:20.080> for<00:07:20.289> you<00:07:20.439> if<00:07:20.860> you

00:07:20.999 --> 00:07:21.009 
and it will make sounds for you if you

00:07:21.009 --> 00:07:23.399 
and it will make sounds for you if you
don't<00:07:21.189> like<00:07:21.370> that<00:07:21.550> you<00:07:21.759> can<00:07:21.909> turn<00:07:22.090> them<00:07:22.210> off<00:07:22.409> so

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:23.409 
don't like that you can turn them off so

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:24.959 
don't like that you can turn them off so
that's<00:07:23.590> a<00:07:23.680> quick<00:07:23.830> overview<00:07:23.889> of<00:07:24.370> the<00:07:24.520> software

00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:24.969 
that's a quick overview of the software

00:07:24.969 --> 00:07:27.360 
that's a quick overview of the software
I'll<00:07:25.479> go<00:07:25.689> into<00:07:25.900> more<00:07:26.050> detail<00:07:26.529> on<00:07:26.560> each<00:07:26.770> section

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:27.370 
I'll go into more detail on each section

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:31.860 
I'll go into more detail on each section
