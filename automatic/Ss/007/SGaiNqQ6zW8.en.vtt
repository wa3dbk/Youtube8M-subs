00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
so basically I'm starting with with its

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.330 
so basically I'm starting with with its
1<00:00:09.840> by<00:00:09.960> fours<00:00:10.230> of<00:00:10.530> Redwood<00:00:10.860> you<00:00:11.040> can<00:00:11.190> buy

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
1 by fours of Redwood you can buy

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.089 
1 by fours of Redwood you can buy
special<00:00:12.330> on<00:00:12.570> like<00:00:12.929> baseboard<00:00:13.500> stuff<00:00:13.799> but<00:00:13.980> it's

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
special on like baseboard stuff but it's

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.589 
special on like baseboard stuff but it's
a<00:00:14.130> lot<00:00:14.280> more<00:00:14.429> expensive<00:00:14.610> per<00:00:14.820> square<00:00:15.059> foot<00:00:15.299> so

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
a lot more expensive per square foot so

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.420 
a lot more expensive per square foot so
I<00:00:15.660> just<00:00:15.750> prefer<00:00:16.020> just<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.350> start<00:00:16.619> with<00:00:16.830> like

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
I just prefer just to start with like

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.370 
I just prefer just to start with like
just<00:00:17.670> just<00:00:17.850> basic<00:00:18.330> 1<00:00:18.480> by<00:00:18.630> 4<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.199> way<00:00:19.320> you

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
just just basic 1 by 4 is the way you

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.960 
just just basic 1 by 4 is the way you
have<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.500> prep<00:00:19.680> it<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:19.859> first<00:00:20.070> you<00:00:20.160> sand<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.550> if

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
have to prep it is first you sand it if

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.130 
have to prep it is first you sand it if
it's<00:00:21.090> if<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.330> starts<00:00:21.570> out<00:00:21.660> pretty<00:00:21.840> rough<00:00:21.990> you

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
it's if it starts out pretty rough you

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.240 
it's if it starts out pretty rough you
start<00:00:22.350> with<00:00:22.439> kind<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.680> heavier<00:00:23.010> grit

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
start with kind of a heavier grit

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.470 
start with kind of a heavier grit
sandpaper<00:00:23.460> but<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:23.910> want<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.119> finish<00:00:24.240> off

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
sandpaper but you want to finish off

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.269 
sandpaper but you want to finish off
with<00:00:24.570> like<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.779> 220<00:00:25.260> grit<00:00:25.439> so<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.010> get<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.160> nice

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
with like a 220 grit so you get a nice

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.950 
with like a 220 grit so you get a nice
smooth<00:00:26.580> finish<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:27.180> smoother<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.720> the

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
smooth finish the smoother it is the

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.660 
smooth finish the smoother it is the
less<00:00:28.140> stain<00:00:28.410> it's<00:00:28.590> actually<00:00:28.830> gonna<00:00:28.920> take<00:00:29.130> and

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
less stain it's actually gonna take and

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.160 
less stain it's actually gonna take and
you<00:00:30.150> get<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> slightly<00:00:30.480> lighter<00:00:30.660> color<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.109> you

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
you get a slightly lighter color so you

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.299 
you get a slightly lighter color so you
actually<00:00:31.320> wants<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.650> start<00:00:31.830> getting<00:00:32.009> good<00:00:32.189> at

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
actually wants to start getting good at

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.100 
actually wants to start getting good at
it<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.489> can<00:00:32.610> play<00:00:32.820> with<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.000> by<00:00:33.239> doing<00:00:33.300> by

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
it you can play with it by doing by

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.630 
it you can play with it by doing by
doing<00:00:34.350> sandy<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:34.829> less<00:00:34.980> or<00:00:35.160> sanding<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.430> more

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
doing sandy it less or sanding it more

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.889 
doing sandy it less or sanding it more
in<00:00:35.730> order<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:35.969> get<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.180> take<00:00:36.420> more<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.809> get

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
in order to get it to take more to get

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.119 
in order to get it to take more to get
darker<00:00:37.170> or<00:00:37.230> light<00:00:37.380> or<00:00:37.410> whatever<00:00:37.559> color<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.010> go

is is you need your stain obviously your

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.680 
is is you need your stain obviously your
wood<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:56.039> need<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.399> brush<00:00:56.969> I'd<00:00:57.270> use<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.449> foam

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
wood you need a brush I'd use a foam

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.970 
wood you need a brush I'd use a foam
brush<00:00:57.870> for<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.260> because<00:00:58.440> if<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:58.710> not<00:00:58.739> nice

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
brush for it because if it's not nice

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.610 
brush for it because if it's not nice
and<00:00:59.160> smooth<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.609> then<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.449> cloth<00:01:01.020> wipe<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.500> down

and smooth and then a cloth wipe it down

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.139 
and smooth and then a cloth wipe it down
with<00:01:01.680> you'll<00:01:02.039> see<00:01:02.280> where<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:02.850> comes<00:01:03.059> in

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
with you'll see where this comes in

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.189 
with you'll see where this comes in
later<00:01:03.300> because<00:01:03.420> staining<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:03.899> not<00:01:04.019> like

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
later because staining is not like

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.899 
later because staining is not like
painting<00:01:04.589> painting<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.369> put<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.580> stuff<00:01:05.790> on

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
painting painting you put the stuff on

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:06.920 
painting painting you put the stuff on
there<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.299> let<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.570> dry<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.750> there

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
there and you let it dry in there

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.020 
there and you let it dry in there
staining<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:07.950> exactly<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.760> you're<00:01:08.880> trying

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
staining is exactly that you're trying

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.550 
staining is exactly that you're trying
to<00:01:09.060> stain<00:01:09.330> your<00:01:09.360> woods<00:01:09.720> color<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.350> put

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
to stain your woods color and so you put

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.289 
to stain your woods color and so you put
it<00:01:10.650> on<00:01:10.740> there<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.100> soaks<00:01:11.430> in<00:01:11.640> leaves<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.119> stain

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
it on there it soaks in leaves a stain

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.510 
it on there it soaks in leaves a stain
and<00:01:12.540> then<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.990> actually<00:01:13.229> wipe<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.560> off<00:01:13.680> after

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
and then you actually wipe it off after

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.710 
and then you actually wipe it off after
like<00:01:14.700> five<00:01:14.909> minutes<00:01:15.060> putting<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.450> sit<00:01:15.600> there

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
like five minutes putting a sit there

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.960 
like five minutes putting a sit there
depending<00:01:16.020> on<00:01:16.080> how<00:01:16.140> dark<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.470> want<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.740> get

stain on liberally anyway for about five

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.389 
stain on liberally anyway for about five
minutes<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.469> you<00:01:43.740> remove<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.069> with<00:01:44.189> like<00:01:44.310> a

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:49.709 
it pretty you wipe it pretty good

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:51.050 
it pretty you wipe it pretty good
because<00:01:50.039> you<00:01:50.280> want<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.520> make<00:01:50.670> sure<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.939> get

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
because you want to make sure you get

00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:53.459 
everything off of it all the excess off

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:55.490 
everything off of it all the excess off
of<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.670> if<00:01:54.209> you<00:01:54.329> leave<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.659> excess<00:01:54.959> on<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.409> it

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
of it if you leave the excess on and it

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.429 
of it if you leave the excess on and it
dries<00:01:55.739> onto<00:01:56.069> there<00:01:56.840> it<00:01:57.840> can<00:01:57.989> make<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.319> the

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
dries onto there it can make it so the

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.600 
dries onto there it can make it so the
varnish<00:01:58.709> doesn't<00:01:58.979> stick<00:01:59.159> as<00:01:59.280> well<00:01:59.310> when<00:01:59.549> you

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
varnish doesn't stick as well when you

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.619 
varnish doesn't stick as well when you
put<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.819> on<00:01:59.879> there<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.239> you<00:02:00.270> want<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.479> get<00:02:00.569> the

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:00.629 
put that on there so you want to get the

00:02:00.629 --> 00:02:01.910 
put that on there so you want to get the
excess<00:02:00.869> off<00:02:00.989> so<00:02:01.170> it's<00:02:01.259> just<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.590> stain<00:02:01.799> that's

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920

thin and evenly and let it dry for about

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.630 
thin and evenly and let it dry for about
two<00:03:00.120> hours<00:03:00.150> before<00:03:00.690> your<00:03:01.140> next<00:03:01.410> coat<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:01.890> know

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
two hours before your next coat I know

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.790 
two hours before your next coat I know
you're<00:03:02.850> attempted<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.209> stop<00:03:03.510> just<00:03:04.410> now<00:03:04.470> is

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
you're attempted to stop just now is

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.410 
you're attempted to stop just now is
even<00:03:04.920> more<00:03:05.160> tempted<00:03:05.550> to<00:03:05.610> stop<00:03:05.850> because<00:03:06.090> it

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
even more tempted to stop because it

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.170 
even more tempted to stop because it
looks<00:03:06.600> pretty<00:03:06.660> damn<00:03:07.050> nice<00:03:07.350> but<00:03:08.160> if<00:03:08.760> you<00:03:08.850> sand

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
looks pretty damn nice but if you sand

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.880 
looks pretty damn nice but if you sand
it<00:03:09.300> down<00:03:09.330> lightly<00:03:09.690> with<00:03:09.959> 220<00:03:10.470> grit<00:03:10.500> sandpaper

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
it down lightly with 220 grit sandpaper

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.890 
it down lightly with 220 grit sandpaper
and<00:03:11.280> then<00:03:11.400> apply<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.730> second<00:03:12.060> coat<00:03:12.090> not<00:03:12.660> only

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
and then apply a second coat not only

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.360 
and then apply a second coat not only
will<00:03:13.020> it<00:03:13.050> last<00:03:13.260> longer<00:03:13.560> but<00:03:13.830> it<00:03:13.920> also<00:03:14.040> turns

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
will it last longer but it also turns

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.130 
will it last longer but it also turns
out<00:03:14.489> to<00:03:14.550> smooth<00:03:14.850> air<00:03:15.000> each<00:03:15.090> time<00:03:15.360> so<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.050> way

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
out to smooth air each time so the way

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.630 
out to smooth air each time so the way
you<00:03:16.200> do<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.440> sanding<00:03:16.769> is<00:03:16.860> always<00:03:17.160> always<00:03:17.430> with

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
you do the sanding is always always with

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.000 
you do the sanding is always always with
the<00:03:17.790> grain<00:03:18.000> you<00:03:18.470> sand<00:03:19.470> it<00:03:19.590> real<00:03:19.800> lightly

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
the grain you sand it real lightly

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.860 
the grain you sand it real lightly
because<00:03:20.730> you<00:03:20.910> don't<00:03:21.090> want<00:03:21.239> to<00:03:21.300> take<00:03:21.450> off<00:03:21.630> you

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
because you don't want to take off you

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.630 
because you don't want to take off you
don't<00:03:21.959> want<00:03:22.110> to<00:03:22.170> take<00:03:22.320> off<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.890> varnish<00:03:23.430> gonna

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
don't want to take off the varnish gonna

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.680 
don't want to take off the varnish gonna
take<00:03:23.760> all<00:03:23.880> of<00:03:23.910> it<00:03:24.030> off<00:03:24.090> although<00:03:24.300> it<00:03:24.360> is<00:03:24.480> going

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
take all of it off although it is going

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.360 
take all of it off although it is going
backwards<00:03:25.170> these<00:03:25.560> want<00:03:25.709> to<00:03:25.769> take<00:03:25.890> off<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.160> top

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
backwards these want to take off the top

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.650 
backwards these want to take off the top
of<00:03:26.550> little<00:03:26.670> bumps<00:03:27.000> on<00:03:27.120> it<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.360> just<00:03:27.420> kind<00:03:27.540> of

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
of little bumps on it and just kind of

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.690 
of little bumps on it and just kind of
rub<00:03:27.840> up<00:03:27.959> the<00:03:28.050> surface<00:03:28.260> you<00:03:29.100> make<00:03:29.280> it<00:03:29.400> so<00:03:29.550> that

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
rub up the surface you make it so that

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.190 
rub up the surface you make it so that
the<00:03:29.819> the<00:03:30.000> next<00:03:30.239> Co<00:03:30.360> can<00:03:30.540> bond<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.900> it<00:03:31.019> if<00:03:31.140> you

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
the the next Co can bond to it if you

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.270 
the the next Co can bond to it if you
don't<00:03:31.230> do<00:03:31.470> it<00:03:31.530> so<00:03:31.590> it's<00:03:31.709> not<00:03:31.739> just<00:03:32.010> to<00:03:32.069> smooth

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
don't do it so it's not just to smooth

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.620 
don't do it so it's not just to smooth
it<00:03:32.370> out<00:03:32.459> it's<00:03:32.670> also<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:32.910> make<00:03:33.060> it<00:03:33.150> so<00:03:33.239> it<00:03:33.330> bonds

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
it out it's also to make it so it bonds

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.850 
it out it's also to make it so it bonds
better

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.370

before I go on to that I'm gonna show
you<00:03:45.470> guys<00:03:45.560> what<00:03:45.800> you<00:03:45.830> do<00:03:46.010> after<00:03:46.310> this<00:03:46.370> and<00:03:46.640> you

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
you guys what you do after this and you

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.540 
you guys what you do after this and you
always<00:03:47.210> have<00:03:47.450> to<00:03:47.540> remove<00:03:47.780> all<00:03:47.990> the<00:03:48.140> dust<00:03:48.550> if

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
always have to remove all the dust if

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:50.770 
always have to remove all the dust if
you<00:03:49.670> leave<00:03:49.820> the<00:03:49.940> dust<00:03:50.150> on<00:03:50.330> there<00:03:50.510> then<00:03:50.690> the

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
you leave the dust on there then the

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.330 
you leave the dust on there then the
varnish<00:03:51.050> won't<00:03:51.260> have<00:03:51.380> a<00:03:51.410> complete<00:03:51.740> seal<00:03:52.010> so

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
varnish won't have a complete seal so

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.770 
varnish won't have a complete seal so
take<00:03:52.490> my<00:03:52.580> rag<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:52.970> same<00:03:53.150> rag<00:03:53.330> I<00:03:53.420> used<00:03:53.570> to<00:03:53.660> wipe

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
take my rag the same rag I used to wipe

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:00.660 
take my rag the same rag I used to wipe
the<00:03:53.960> stain<00:03:54.880> and<00:03:56.590> clean<00:03:57.590> the<00:03:57.680> dust<00:03:57.890> up

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.290 

so<00:04:01.270> you<00:04:01.330> don't<00:04:01.480> leave<00:04:01.600> that<00:04:01.660> in<00:04:01.870> between<00:04:01.960> there

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
so you don't leave that in between there

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.580 
so you don't leave that in between there
once<00:04:04.300> you've<00:04:04.420> lightly<00:04:04.720> sanded<00:04:05.110> it<00:04:05.200> and<00:04:05.260> remove

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
once you've lightly sanded it and remove

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.890 
once you've lightly sanded it and remove
the<00:04:05.709> dust<00:04:05.940> it's<00:04:06.940> really<00:04:07.150> smooth<00:04:07.420> now<00:04:07.750> it's

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
the dust it's really smooth now it's

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.780 
the dust it's really smooth now it's
time<00:04:08.050> to<00:04:08.080> apply<00:04:08.410> your<00:04:08.530> next<00:04:08.770> coat<00:04:08.980> and<00:04:09.700> this

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
time to apply your next coat and this

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.240 
time to apply your next coat and this
second<00:04:10.150> coat<00:04:10.300> should<00:04:10.569> turn<00:04:10.840> out<00:04:11.020> even<00:04:11.260> nicer

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
second coat should turn out even nicer

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.050 
second coat should turn out even nicer
looking<00:04:12.580> and<00:04:12.850> smoother<00:04:13.420> than<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:13.600> first<00:04:13.840> one

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
looking and smoother than the first one

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.800 
looking and smoother than the first one
when<00:04:16.060> applying<00:04:16.329> the<00:04:16.450> coat

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
when applying the coat

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.090
