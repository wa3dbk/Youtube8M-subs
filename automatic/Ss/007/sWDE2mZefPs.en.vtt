00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.140
 in the window sector of a tour of 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.390
 the vulva parish 20 minutes from 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.119
 canton holy water baths is located 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.039
 the tree house where Carlos 

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:14.709
 Sanchez carries out the work of 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:17.050
 tungurahua volcano my full name is 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:22.290
 Carlos Sanchez watchtower of the volcano 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:24.760
 tungurahua since 1999 because we talk about 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.420
 1999 because with the patrician engineer 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.100
 mod her husband the doctor miguel calls 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.169
 we started to go through all these 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.510
 mountain ranges looking for strategic areas 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.149
 to locate the monitoring equipment 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.969
 because there were already symptoms that the 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:43.089
 volcano entered was going to go into activity 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:46.690
 then from there the work begins and 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:49.390
 then the location of sensors 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.760
 short period that is still one here 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.949
 others up in the mountains sensors of 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.350
 lahares that are so important to 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:59.379
 feel the descent of this material 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.600
 volcanic that when it rains it is very 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:05.239
 prone to go down in large quantities 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.939
 for all the undulations there is 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.549
 Carlos spends the days between observing 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.439
 colossus deliver news reports and 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.450
 instruct tourists on the subject 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.509
 volcanological as they did 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.970
 professional as this 71 year old lookout 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.070
 of age has military training was 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.979
 Volunteer of the Red Cross and the former 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.689
 civil defense bathrooms and now it's all 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:29.330
 a connoisseur on the subject of volcanology 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.710
 It would seem to know more than 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.560
 experts of the volcanological observatory 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.360
 of tungurahua when he expresses himself before 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.479
 the curious who come in search of 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.819
 stories and news broadcast ended 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:44.149
 telling them is cleaning keep the 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:47.420
 clean solar panels keep keep 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.759
 the wiring in good condition that 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.009
 everything is working communication 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.080
 via radio with the volcanologists and when 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.229
 it's a little private communication 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.689
 that it is not necessary to water 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.459
 through this means of communication the 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.399
 handy then you have to do it via 

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:07.039
 telephone lives alone in its modest and 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:09.739
 narrow house located at 2,600 meters 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.770
 above sea level a small room 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.100
 3 x 5 meters 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.350
 is a new museum has a 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.030
 TV and several tables where 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.160
 they locate innumerable glass jars 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.900
 with samples of ash from the 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.570
 different eruptions of the water tour 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:31.210
 from 1999 to date this vibration 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:34.150
 these sensors are feeling 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:38.320
 broadband seismic and based on it 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:42.090
 volcanologists announce or warn the 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.459
 volume of material that is coming out 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.819
 the degrees of intensity by this 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.959
 movement and by this bending that happens 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.940
 upwards 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.560
 this voluntary work is done in 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.989
 thanks to God for having 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.050

 while I have life and health back 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.420
 avoiding all the controls that had 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:06.709
 entrance toilets arrived here with the truck 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.780
 won and nothing has happened here 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.250
