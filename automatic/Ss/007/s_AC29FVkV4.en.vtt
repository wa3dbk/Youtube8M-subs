00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
and as you can see not much around here

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.850 
and as you can see not much around here
but<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.969> just<00:00:45.750> have<00:00:45.900> I<00:00:45.930> found<00:00:46.290> this<00:00:46.440> set<00:00:46.680> of

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
but I just have I found this set of

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.440 
but I just have I found this set of
monkey<00:00:47.280> bars<00:00:47.670> right<00:00:47.880> here<00:00:48.060> as<00:00:48.150> you<00:00:48.180> can<00:00:48.300> see

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
monkey bars right here as you can see

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.310 
monkey bars right here as you can see
and<00:00:49.880> so<00:00:50.880> I<00:00:50.910> basically<00:00:51.450> put<00:00:51.720> I<00:00:51.960> just<00:00:52.110> kind<00:00:52.260> of

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
and so I basically put I just kind of

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.410 
and so I basically put I just kind of
spent<00:00:52.650> five<00:00:52.890> minutes<00:00:53.160> putting<00:00:53.790> together<00:00:54.030> an

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
spent five minutes putting together an

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.600 
spent five minutes putting together an
hour-long<00:00:54.870> set<00:00:55.380> that<00:00:56.100> I'm<00:00:56.280> going<00:00:56.400> to<00:00:56.460> do

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
hour-long set that I'm going to do

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.400 
hour-long set that I'm going to do
basically<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.120> has<00:00:57.239> an<00:00:57.420> interval<00:00:57.810> so<00:00:58.079> six

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
basically that has an interval so six

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.740 
basically that has an interval so six
sets<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.800> 10<00:00:59.040> minutes<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.489> you<00:00:59.579> start<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.180> set<00:01:00.600> on

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
sets of 10 minutes so you start a set on

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.330 
sets of 10 minutes so you start a set on
the<00:01:00.899> start<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.350> every<00:01:01.620> minute<00:01:01.800> for<00:01:02.130> ten

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
and then I'm going to do some dips on

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.649 
and then I'm going to do some dips on
this<00:01:55.830> concrete<00:01:56.280> as<00:01:56.369> well<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.909> then<00:01:59.600> do<00:02:00.600> a

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
this concrete as well and then do a

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.149 
this concrete as well and then do a
little<00:02:00.780> bit<00:02:00.900> of<00:02:00.990> CD<00:02:01.290> core<00:02:01.530> on<00:02:01.650> the<00:02:01.770> concrete

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
little bit of CD core on the concrete

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.880 
little bit of CD core on the concrete
and<00:02:02.369> I'll<00:02:02.460> show<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.670> how<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:02.970> do<00:02:03.150> that<00:02:03.299> one

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
and I'll show you how to do that one

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.640 
and I'll show you how to do that one
squat<00:02:04.890> jumps<00:02:05.280> onto<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.759> concrete<00:02:06.110> for<00:02:07.110> 20<00:02:07.470> and

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
squat jumps onto the concrete for 20 and

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.619 
squat jumps onto the concrete for 20 and
then<00:02:08.580> I've<00:02:08.700> got<00:02:08.849> kind<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.179> back<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.420> forth

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
then I've got kind of back and forth

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.680 
then I've got kind of back and forth
core

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
core

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.350 
core
just<00:02:11.020> controlling<00:02:11.410> and<00:02:11.770> then<00:02:12.550> finish<00:02:13.210> off

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
just controlling and then finish off

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.150 
just controlling and then finish off
with<00:02:13.630> my<00:02:14.050> grip<00:02:14.260> push-ups<00:02:14.470> and<00:02:14.710> that'll<00:02:14.920> bring

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
with my grip push-ups and that'll bring

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.950 
with my grip push-ups and that'll bring
me<00:02:15.280> ten<00:02:15.700> minutes<00:02:15.850> and<00:02:16.210> then<00:02:16.630> what<00:02:16.720> I'm<00:02:16.840> going

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
me ten minutes and then what I'm going

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.770 
me ten minutes and then what I'm going
to<00:02:16.990> do<00:02:17.170> is<00:02:17.350> just<00:02:17.940> work<00:02:18.940> that<00:02:19.090> around<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:19.630> do<00:02:19.750> it

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
to do is just work that around and do it

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.770 
to do is just work that around and do it
again<00:02:20.200> for<00:02:20.920> six<00:02:21.190> sets<00:02:21.490> so<00:02:21.790> it's<00:02:21.970> pretty<00:02:22.480> brutal

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
again for six sets so it's pretty brutal

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.070 
again for six sets so it's pretty brutal
but<00:02:23.850> it'll<00:02:24.850> be<00:02:24.940> a<00:02:24.970> good<00:02:25.180> mixture<00:02:25.540> of<00:02:25.690> cardio

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
but it'll be a good mixture of cardio

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.920 
but it'll be a good mixture of cardio
core<00:02:27.010> strength<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:28.090> then<00:02:28.360> basically<00:02:28.780> how<00:02:28.900> I

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
core strength and then basically how I

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.370 
core strength and then basically how I
set<00:02:29.260> it<00:02:29.380> up<00:02:29.530> is<00:02:29.740> I<00:02:30.490> want<00:02:31.240> to<00:02:31.360> be<00:02:31.510> exhaust<00:02:32.230> a

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
set it up is I want to be exhaust a

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.260 
set it up is I want to be exhaust a
certain<00:02:32.650> body<00:02:32.830> part<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.340> then<00:02:33.580> kind<00:02:34.000> of<00:02:34.120> move

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
certain body part and then kind of move

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.670 
certain body part and then kind of move
on<00:02:34.420> to<00:02:34.570> the<00:02:34.660> next<00:02:34.780> one<00:02:35.020> so<00:02:35.050> that's<00:02:35.290> why<00:02:35.440> I<00:02:35.500> have

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
on to the next one so that's why I have

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.160 
on to the next one so that's why I have
like<00:02:35.710> the<00:02:36.040> put<00:02:36.610> pull<00:02:36.880> ups<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.360> then<00:02:37.870> you<00:02:38.020> have

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
like the put pull ups and then you have

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.440 
like the put pull ups and then you have
the<00:02:38.470> push<00:02:38.710> up<00:02:38.890> segment<00:02:39.490> so<00:02:40.060> you're<00:02:40.210> kind<00:02:40.390> of

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
the push up segment so you're kind of

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.090 
the push up segment so you're kind of
working<00:02:40.630> your<00:02:40.900> back<00:02:41.080> and<00:02:41.410> biceps<00:02:41.860> and<00:02:41.980> then

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
working your back and biceps and then

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.050 
working your back and biceps and then
you're<00:02:42.250> going<00:02:42.340> to<00:02:42.430> start<00:02:42.670> working<00:02:42.940> your<00:02:43.000> chest

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
you're going to start working your chest

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.240 
you're going to start working your chest
a<00:02:43.450> little<00:02:43.480> bit<00:02:43.720> more<00:02:43.810> chest<00:02:44.560> and<00:02:44.740> triceps<00:02:45.190> for

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
a little bit more chest and triceps for

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.460 
a little bit more chest and triceps for
that<00:02:45.460> next<00:02:45.670> part<00:02:45.970> so<00:02:46.240> not<00:02:46.810> further<00:02:47.140> adieu

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
that next part so not further adieu

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.820 
that next part so not further adieu
let's<00:02:47.740> uh<00:02:47.920> let's<00:02:48.250> get<00:02:48.460> this<00:02:48.610> thing<00:02:48.670> going

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
let's uh let's get this thing going

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.110 
let's uh let's get this thing going
all<00:02:50.830> right<00:02:51.010> guys<00:02:51.220> starting<00:02:51.730> off<00:02:51.820> here<00:02:51.850> with

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
all right guys starting off here with

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.810 
all right guys starting off here with
the<00:02:52.420> pull-ups<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:53.110> as<00:02:53.980> you<00:02:54.190> can<00:02:54.310> see<00:02:54.370> I'm<00:02:54.790> kind

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
the pull-ups and as you can see I'm kind

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.660 
the pull-ups and as you can see I'm kind
of<00:02:55.060> working<00:02:55.480> my<00:02:55.600> way<00:02:55.630> down<00:02:56.100> the<00:02:57.100> monkey<00:02:57.430> bars

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
of working my way down the monkey bars

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.850 
of working my way down the monkey bars
just<00:02:57.760> going<00:02:58.180> one<00:02:58.330> at<00:02:58.450> a<00:02:58.540> time<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.200> doing<00:02:59.770> a

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
just going one at a time and doing a

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.310 
just going one at a time and doing a
pull-up<00:03:00.130> on<00:03:00.430> each<00:03:01.150> bar<00:03:01.480> and<00:03:01.510> that<00:03:01.930> just<00:03:02.140> makes

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
pull-up on each bar and that just makes

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.110 
pull-up on each bar and that just makes
it<00:03:02.500> a<00:03:02.830> little<00:03:03.070> bit<00:03:03.220> tougher<00:03:03.610> just<00:03:03.790> because<00:03:03.970> you

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
it a little bit tougher just because you

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.550 
it a little bit tougher just because you
have<00:03:04.210> to<00:03:04.360> switch<00:03:04.630> your<00:03:04.660> grip<00:03:04.900> every<00:03:05.350> time

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
have to switch your grip every time

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.440 
have to switch your grip every time
instead<00:03:05.920> of<00:03:05.980> just<00:03:06.070> doing<00:03:06.280> a<00:03:06.430> set<00:03:06.640> of<00:03:06.730> 10

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
instead of just doing a set of 10

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.930 
instead of just doing a set of 10
pull-ups<00:03:07.720> and<00:03:08.200> it<00:03:09.070> really<00:03:09.280> works<00:03:09.550> your<00:03:09.670> grip

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
pull-ups and it really works your grip

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.090 
pull-ups and it really works your grip
strength<00:03:10.240> and<00:03:10.510> then<00:03:10.750> right<00:03:11.230> into<00:03:11.470> this<00:03:11.680> the

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
strength and then right into this the

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.950 
strength and then right into this the
next<00:03:12.430> minute<00:03:12.790> starting<00:03:13.240> next<00:03:13.330> minute<00:03:13.690> we<00:03:13.840> do

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
next minute starting next minute we do

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.590 
next minute starting next minute we do
the<00:03:14.080> monkey<00:03:14.380> bars<00:03:14.650> and<00:03:15.040> as<00:03:15.700> you<00:03:15.910> can<00:03:16.090> see<00:03:16.150> I'm<00:03:16.480> a

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
the monkey bars and as you can see I'm a

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.540 
the monkey bars and as you can see I'm a
little<00:03:16.630> bit<00:03:16.900> challenged<00:03:17.740> on<00:03:17.860> the<00:03:17.950> monkey<00:03:18.280> bars

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
little bit challenged on the monkey bars

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.090 
little bit challenged on the monkey bars
but<00:03:19.170> kind<00:03:20.170> of<00:03:20.230> start<00:03:20.440> working<00:03:20.740> my<00:03:20.890> way<00:03:20.920> through

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
but kind of start working my way through

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.430 
but kind of start working my way through
it<00:03:21.610> and<00:03:21.790> on<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.570> way<00:03:22.600> back<00:03:22.900> it<00:03:23.170> a<00:03:23.200> little

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
it and on the way back it a little

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.570 
it and on the way back it a little
better<00:03:23.590> rhythm<00:03:24.100> going

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
better rhythm going

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.110 
better rhythm going
and<00:03:25.170> so<00:03:26.170> that's<00:03:26.350> the<00:03:26.590> second<00:03:27.040> minute<00:03:27.370> and<00:03:27.520> so

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
and so that's the second minute and so

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.570 
and so that's the second minute and so
once<00:03:28.270> I<00:03:28.390> finish<00:03:28.450> that<00:03:28.720> I<00:03:29.620> get<00:03:30.100> a<00:03:30.130> little<00:03:30.220> slight

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
once I finish that I get a little slight

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.920 
once I finish that I get a little slight
little<00:03:30.820> rest<00:03:31.150> there<00:03:31.450> and<00:03:31.630> then<00:03:31.720> we're<00:03:31.840> going

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
little rest there and then we're going

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.780 
little rest there and then we're going
to<00:03:31.990> go<00:03:32.110> straight<00:03:32.440> into<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:33.130> Close<00:03:33.340> Grip<00:03:33.370> push

to go straight into the Close Grip push

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.170 
to go straight into the Close Grip push
ups<00:03:34.060> which<00:03:34.870> is<00:03:35.110> on<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.380> concrete<00:03:35.800> here<00:03:36.190> and<00:03:36.400> as

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
ups which is on the concrete here and as

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.199 
ups which is on the concrete here and as
you<00:03:37.300> can<00:03:37.390> see<00:03:37.630> just<00:03:37.900> very<00:03:38.230> controlled<00:03:39.180> get<00:03:40.180> a

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
you can see just very controlled get a

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.960 
you can see just very controlled get a
little<00:03:40.360> slight<00:03:40.600> pause<00:03:40.870> at<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.260> top<00:03:41.790> slow<00:03:42.790> on

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
little slight pause at the top slow on

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.550 
little slight pause at the top slow on
the<00:03:43.090> down<00:03:43.300> so<00:03:43.600> about<00:03:43.780> two<00:03:43.959> seconds<00:03:44.350> on<00:03:44.410> the

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
the down so about two seconds on the

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.620 
the down so about two seconds on the
down<00:03:44.770> one<00:03:45.190> second<00:03:45.550> on<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:45.760> up<00:03:45.850> with<00:03:46.330> a<00:03:46.360> little

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
down one second on the up with a little

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.270 
down one second on the up with a little
slight<00:03:46.959> hold<00:03:47.260> at<00:03:47.530> the<00:03:47.650> top<00:03:47.860> should<00:03:48.100> get<00:03:48.250> a

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
slight hold at the top should get a

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.610 
slight hold at the top should get a
little<00:03:49.030> extra<00:03:49.180> burn<00:03:49.600> in<00:03:49.780> your<00:03:49.870> tricep<00:03:50.380> there

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
little extra burn in your tricep there

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.100 
little extra burn in your tricep there
and<00:03:50.830> then<00:03:51.430> hop<00:03:51.790> up<00:03:52.000> here<00:03:52.300> I<00:03:52.540> thought<00:03:52.930> these

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
and then hop up here I thought these

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.500 
and then hop up here I thought these
would<00:03:53.260> be<00:03:53.380> pretty<00:03:53.650> fun<00:03:54.390> basically<00:03:55.390> what

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
would be pretty fun basically what

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.670 
would be pretty fun basically what
you're<00:03:55.630> going<00:03:55.720> to<00:03:55.810> do<00:03:55.930> is<00:03:56.080> just<00:03:56.230> walk<00:03:56.440> your

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
you're going to do is just walk your

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.920 
you're going to do is just walk your
hand<00:03:56.890> I<00:03:56.950> just<00:03:57.100> walk<00:03:57.280> my<00:03:57.459> hands<00:03:57.730> down<00:03:58.030> on<00:03:58.330> the

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
hand I just walk my hands down on the

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.050 
hand I just walk my hands down on the
log<00:03:59.140> every<00:03:59.440> time<00:03:59.620> and<00:03:59.860> then<00:03:59.980> as<00:04:00.160> you<00:04:00.400> can<00:04:00.520> see<00:04:00.580> I

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
log every time and then as you can see I

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.820 
log every time and then as you can see I
kind<00:04:01.600> of<00:04:01.690> started<00:04:01.900> to<00:04:01.959> change<00:04:02.230> it<00:04:02.410> up<00:04:02.560> just<00:04:02.709> to

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
kind of started to change it up just to

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.530 
kind of started to change it up just to
make<00:04:02.860> it<00:04:02.980> a<00:04:03.070> little<00:04:03.160> bit<00:04:03.340> more<00:04:03.489> dynamic<00:04:03.700> on<00:04:04.330> the

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
make it a little bit more dynamic on the

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.570 
make it a little bit more dynamic on the
next<00:04:04.840> log<00:04:05.020> here<00:04:05.320> you<00:04:05.410> can<00:04:05.530> see<00:04:05.739> I<00:04:05.770> just<00:04:06.100> put<00:04:06.340> one

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
next log here you can see I just put one

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.520 
next log here you can see I just put one
hand<00:04:06.790> forward<00:04:07.180> instead<00:04:07.390> of<00:04:07.480> both<00:04:07.720> and<00:04:08.050> you

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
hand forward instead of both and you

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.040 
hand forward instead of both and you
kind<00:04:08.770> of<00:04:08.830> get<00:04:08.980> a<00:04:09.040> sideways<00:04:09.670> push<00:04:10.420> up<00:04:10.630> so<00:04:10.750> I<00:04:10.840> kind

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
kind of get a sideways push up so I kind

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.440 
kind of get a sideways push up so I kind
of<00:04:11.080> started<00:04:11.320> to<00:04:11.410> do<00:04:11.590> it<00:04:11.709> like<00:04:11.890> that<00:04:11.920> from<00:04:12.520> from

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
of started to do it like that from from

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.690 
of started to do it like that from from
that<00:04:13.600> on<00:04:13.780> out<00:04:13.989> and<00:04:14.260> I<00:04:14.860> made<00:04:15.100> a<00:04:15.130> little<00:04:15.340> bit<00:04:15.489> more

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
that on out and I made a little bit more

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.060 
that on out and I made a little bit more
dynamic<00:04:15.880> and<00:04:16.390> then<00:04:16.750> I<00:04:17.169> was<00:04:17.320> straighten<00:04:17.770> here

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
dynamic and then I was straighten here

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.840 
dynamic and then I was straighten here
into<00:04:18.310> the<00:04:18.430> core<00:04:18.700> a<00:04:18.729> hanging<00:04:19.239> core<00:04:19.539> and<00:04:20.310> so<00:04:21.310> as<00:04:21.640> I

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
of just made this one up I didn't know

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.279 
of just made this one up I didn't know
what<00:04:55.210> I<00:04:55.300> was<00:04:55.419> doing<00:04:55.720> but<00:04:55.870> it<00:04:55.990> ended<00:04:56.169> up<00:04:56.229> working

out pretty well and you kind of have to

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.990 
out pretty well and you kind of have to
get<00:04:58.930> creative<00:04:59.139> like<00:04:59.500> this<00:04:59.740> once<00:05:00.699> you're<00:05:00.849> in

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
get creative like this once you're in

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.119 
get creative like this once you're in
here<00:05:01.270> in<00:05:01.719> a<00:05:01.780> park<00:05:02.050> and<00:05:02.259> you're<00:05:02.349> not<00:05:02.500> in<00:05:02.740> a<00:05:02.770> gym

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:06.069 
where you have kind of a core machine

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:08.969 
where you have kind of a core machine
you<00:05:06.819> can<00:05:07.000> kind<00:05:07.240> of<00:05:07.330> make<00:05:07.840> your<00:05:08.020> own<00:05:08.110> core

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979

get a nice little squeeze at the top and
that's<00:06:02.440> it<00:06:02.740> and<00:06:03.009> so<00:06:03.039> that's<00:06:03.430> a<00:06:03.639> 10-minute<00:06:04.270> set

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:04.569

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:06.959 
that's it and so that's a 10-minute set
and<00:06:04.810> so<00:06:05.349> I<00:06:05.379> was<00:06:05.590> doing<00:06:05.740> a<00:06:05.949> set<00:06:06.219> on<00:06:06.370> every<00:06:06.759> single

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:06.969 
and so I was doing a set on every single

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:09.420 
and so I was doing a set on every single
minute<00:06:07.330> and<00:06:07.629> then<00:06:08.199> I<00:06:08.229> just<00:06:08.650> basically<00:06:08.979> started

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
minute and then I just basically started

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.760 
minute and then I just basically started
over<00:06:09.729> that<00:06:09.849> 10-minute<00:06:10.270> set<00:06:10.659> and<00:06:10.900> did<00:06:11.349> that<00:06:11.469> six

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.680 
over that 10-minute set and did that six
times<00:06:12.099> so<00:06:12.310> I<00:06:12.370> kind<00:06:12.639> of<00:06:12.729> came<00:06:12.909> out<00:06:13.120> to<00:06:13.330> an<00:06:13.479> hour

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
times so I kind of came out to an hour

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.890 
times so I kind of came out to an hour
at<00:06:13.990> the<00:06:14.139> end<00:06:14.289> and<00:06:15.000> you'll<00:06:16.000> be<00:06:16.120> pretty<00:06:16.330> burnt<00:06:16.690> at

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
at the end and you'll be pretty burnt at

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.809 
at the end and you'll be pretty burnt at
the<00:06:17.020> end<00:06:17.169> of<00:06:17.349> it<00:06:17.500> but<00:06:17.919> you<00:06:18.129> can<00:06:18.310> always<00:06:18.430> just

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:18.819 
the end of it but you can always just

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:20.399 
the end of it but you can always just
augment<00:06:19.270> it<00:06:19.330> like<00:06:19.509> that<00:06:19.750> you<00:06:19.870> don't<00:06:20.050> have<00:06:20.229> to

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:20.409 
augment it like that you don't have to

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:22.830 
augment it like that you don't have to
do<00:06:20.529> is<00:06:20.680> set<00:06:20.949> on<00:06:21.190> every<00:06:22.000> minute<00:06:22.330> you<00:06:22.449> could<00:06:22.599> do

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:26.259 
something like a minute on and then a

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:28.110

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:35.889 
doesn't need to be that format I just

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:37.589 
doesn't need to be that format I just
use<00:06:36.070> that<00:06:36.099> format<00:06:36.699> because<00:06:36.969> it<00:06:37.029> gives<00:06:37.360> me<00:06:37.449> a

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:37.599 
use that format because it gives me a

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:38.370 
use that format because it gives me a
little<00:06:37.810> bit

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:38.380 
little bit

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.860

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
and rest between each set and then I

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.590 
and rest between each set and then I
just<00:06:41.050> repeat<00:06:41.200> it<00:06:41.440> for<00:06:42.310> six<00:06:42.760> times<00:06:42.970> to<00:06:43.330> get<00:06:43.480> to

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:43.600 
just repeat it for six times to get to

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.990
