00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:07.030
 they the boys of the girls to song 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:09.610
 and blast for studies like this arm the 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.900
 jet with in zombies in transit is a very 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.850
 powerful but you do not have to find 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.849
 four parts ok 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.589
 things because they are the first two 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.630
 they are very easy to notice the first one is 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:22.419
 in the tunnel in which it is barely moving 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.390
 you start playing and you just grab the 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:28.179
 bus you will enter this tunnel and 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.029
 you have to get off in just this 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:32.079
 place the truth is a huge tank 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.750
 then you can see it at a great distance 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:38.920
 it's mouth here it took me a little work 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.510
 because he changed his place but I burned it 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.870
 the place but it's always going to be in that 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.850
 for that area, there you will find it 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.710
 and this is going to be the first piece and 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.579
 later to be able to arm the jet with 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.920
 they have to be in town and they only go 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.780
 to be able to arm it in this place only in 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.329
 this in others does not only serve us in 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.070
 this ok ok bonnet on the first piece the 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.079
 second piece later with this 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.060
 electricity is going to be like a fan 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:11.200
 He cited something like that and you barely turn on the light 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.120
 you go up and there you have to throw and 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.550
 again you know you have to put together in a 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.140
 place that two pieces carry another thing not 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.660
 you can have two pieces of jet gong 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.130
 because if you are not going to exchange it good 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.590
 when you finish that, I recommend you 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.409
 have more than 3000 points 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.899
 and we are going to find the third piece that 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.549
 it's a bit complicated to study 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.200
 because they have to have written and they 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.450
 presented you always have to be at 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.659
 the left always remember left 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.270
 and left is based where the smoke is and 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.310
 always on the left ok always they 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.079
 is not to be missed and because here they go 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.509
 to find a cabin where they go to 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:49.710
 able to buy the bobby knight and the other 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.320
 piece to assemble the grass 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.610
 you know the good time costs more than 3000 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.210
 that's why I recommend you have more than 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.299
 6000 points 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.890
 and if you reference there are only a few 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.140
 zombies that I was calling finished the part but 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.930
 that happens to me because I think that only 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.210
 Zombies were missing and I killed him but hey 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.390
 ok when we already have writings are going to 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:14.150
 notice that the smoke is going to be removed and 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.250
 they take in the cabin then there then 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.170
 then you have to buy the type we live 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.460
 leak english optional as you 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.500
 want but they were going to have to stay 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.880
 as a small register but always 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.800
 will be in the cabin of the fence always 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.400
 you go to the cabin then you have to 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.400
 search well 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.140
 I already found it 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.330
 perfect the right always if they have 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.300
 that back on the right ok so that 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.330
 return to town safe and sound 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.430
 ok they have to put together that third piece 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.530
 there is a place you know and they only need 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.810
 one piece ok the last piece is going to be 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.540
 in 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.550
 where are those corn crops 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.080
 then they get off just when they see the 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.760
 car there happens to me has to go back 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.640
 it's a little bit more and it's going to look like a 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.280
 ok they go first right 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.980
 right after to the left and right 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.170
 again they have to be the little way 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.200
 we launched this one does not get confused 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.769
 because I left them right and then 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.930
 right to the right sorry for having a 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.360
 change then I think it continues without 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.090
 defeat and in that camp I'm going to 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.060
 take to Manchester with tote that is 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.150
 where will they find the last piece uy 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.030
 luckily here I found a bomb 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.850
 nuclear if he had not died 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.700
 Well, it may vary but it is always going to 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.810
 be at maximum with totem and it's a bit 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.580
 hard to find because it 's 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.310
 small but they are always at the big 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.060
 for almost always ok when they already have the 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.760
 last piece are returned to town 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.580
 and finally armand the last party of a 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.040
 diego and perfect are going to have the ye 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.000
 gon in the 4 steps that we just had 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.580
 tell 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.620
 only that there are some things that have to 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.170
 keep in mind to like the jet ghosn 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.970
 that will encourage them a bit because the 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.550
 fasting is not a very heavy weapon 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.500
 too heavy then when 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.080
 you shoot you're going to draw a little bit and 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.150
 something else does not warm her up a lot because 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.070
 if it warms you if you heat it up a lot 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.630
 explodes in the james bond and it's not going to 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.570
 serve and if it explodes they have to arm 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.070
 all over again all the new ok that 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.670
 had an error because I was a new pen 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:25.030
 acm the my first management 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.770
 and there I had a really good long just 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.150
 they see almost I put it in red and almost 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.580
 it explodes down has like 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.410
 ay you mark yourself so being red is that already 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.440
 it's super overheated and you have to 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.690
 let it rest but that did not know 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.560
 nothing then I followed alone element of 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.870
 a lot of boom exploits good agreement that 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.560
 subscribe comments and like and I hope that 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.560
 you liked it
