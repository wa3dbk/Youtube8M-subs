efficientdynamics<00:00:12.559> concept<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:13.799> here<00:00:14.340> we

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
efficientdynamics concept and here we

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.480 
efficientdynamics concept and here we
have<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:15.089> production<00:00:15.480> version<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:16.199> i8<00:00:16.830> you

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
have the production version the i8 you

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.470 
have the production version the i8 you
can<00:00:17.609> tell<00:00:17.730> it's<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.940> production<00:00:18.359> version

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
can tell it's a production version

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.420 
can tell it's a production version
because<00:00:18.869> if<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.080> look<00:00:19.260> closely<00:00:19.650> just<00:00:20.220> there

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
because if you look closely just there

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.820 
because if you look closely just there
you<00:00:21.359> can<00:00:21.480> see<00:00:21.630> it's<00:00:21.750> got<00:00:21.840> parking<00:00:22.350> sensors<00:00:22.710> on

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
you can see it's got parking sensors on

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.220 
you can see it's got parking sensors on
it<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.400> real<00:00:23.609> Road<00:00:24.000> car<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:25.080> the

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
it so this is the real Road car and the

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.620 
it so this is the real Road car and the
car<00:00:25.380> itself<00:00:25.769> it's<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.369> little<00:00:26.910> bit<00:00:27.029> toned<00:00:27.359> down

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
car itself it's a little bit toned down

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.480 
car itself it's a little bit toned down
the<00:00:27.840> styling<00:00:28.349> compared<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.400> original

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
the styling compared to the original

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.089 
the styling compared to the original
content<00:00:30.210> but<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.390> still<00:00:30.599> looks<00:00:30.630> pretty

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
content but it still looks pretty

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.020 
content but it still looks pretty
sporting<00:00:32.099> it's<00:00:32.279> got<00:00:32.399> some<00:00:32.550> really<00:00:32.759> nice

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
sporting it's got some really nice

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.610 
sporting it's got some really nice
features<00:00:33.059> on<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.630> as<00:00:33.780> well<00:00:33.960> can<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.500> actually

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
features on it as well can I actually

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.200 
features on it as well can I actually
see<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.040> now<00:00:35.160> because<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.550> haven't<00:00:35.850> got<00:00:36.090> the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
see it now because I haven't got the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.450 
see it now because I haven't got the
mamba<00:00:36.510> apparently<00:00:37.140> those<00:00:37.739> lights<00:00:38.129> are

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
mamba apparently those lights are

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.900 
mamba apparently those lights are
actually<00:00:39.090> lasers<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.710> yeah<00:00:41.550> some<00:00:41.760> new

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
actually lasers so yeah some new

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.340 
actually lasers so yeah some new
features<00:00:42.059> they<00:00:42.329> it's<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.540> first<00:00:42.780> car<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
features they it's the first car in the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.380 
features they it's the first car in the
world<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.739> have<00:00:43.950> that<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.610> body<00:00:44.820> itself<00:00:45.000> is

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
world to have that the body itself is

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.569 
world to have that the body itself is
made<00:00:45.570> from<00:00:45.750> carbon<00:00:46.050> reinforced<00:00:46.770> plastic<00:00:47.309> and

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
made from carbon reinforced plastic and

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.130 
made from carbon reinforced plastic and
I<00:00:47.910> want<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.090> show<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.329> some<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.690> workings

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
I want to show you some of the workings

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.750 
I want to show you some of the workings
of<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.379> car<00:00:49.590> because<00:00:49.890> obviously<00:00:50.039> it's<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
of the car because obviously it's a

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.090 
of the car because obviously it's a
hybrid<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.600> we'll<00:00:52.110> do<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.469> by<00:00:52.620> heading<00:00:53.010> over

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
hybrid and we'll do that by heading over

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.900 
hybrid and we'll do that by heading over
there<00:00:53.989> ok<00:00:54.989> then<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.410> it's<00:00:55.770> not<00:00:56.100> quite<00:00:56.640> so

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
there ok then so it's not quite so

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.060 
there ok then so it's not quite so
pretty<00:00:57.329> without<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.809> out<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.440> skin<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:58.800> but<00:00:58.980> it

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
pretty without it out of skin on but it

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.540 
pretty without it out of skin on but it
does<00:00:59.219> let<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.460> see<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.910> it's<00:01:00.059> made<00:01:00.930> up<00:01:01.140> of

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
does let you see that it's made up of

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.320 
does let you see that it's made up of
carbon<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.500> aluminium<00:01:04.760> it<00:01:05.760> also<00:01:05.939> lets<00:01:06.240> you

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
carbon and aluminium it also lets you

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.300 
carbon and aluminium it also lets you
see<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.720> powertrain<00:01:07.110> at<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> back<00:01:08.100> there

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
see the powertrain at the back there

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.270 
see the powertrain at the back there
good<00:01:08.670> luck<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.090> 1.5<00:01:09.869> liter<00:01:10.140> turbo<00:01:10.560> engine<00:01:10.890> and

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
good luck to 1.5 liter turbo engine and

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.630 
good luck to 1.5 liter turbo engine and
it<00:01:11.430> puts<00:01:11.610> out<00:01:11.790> about<00:01:12.200> 230<00:01:13.200> horsepower<00:01:13.520> if<00:01:14.520> you

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
it puts out about 230 horsepower if you

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.280 
it puts out about 230 horsepower if you
come<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.000> front<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:17.540> here<00:01:18.540> there's

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
come to the front in here there's

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.070 
come to the front in here there's
actually<00:01:19.770> an<00:01:19.920> electric<00:01:20.369> motor<00:01:20.580> which<00:01:21.360> adds<00:01:21.630> an

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
actually an electric motor which adds an

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.830 
actually an electric motor which adds an
extra<00:01:22.259> 130<00:01:23.220> horsepower<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.240> total<00:01:24.420> you've

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
extra 130 horsepower so in total you've

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.350 
extra 130 horsepower so in total you've
got<00:01:25.400> 360<00:01:26.400> in<00:01:26.520> apparently<00:01:26.820> that's<00:01:26.970> good<00:01:27.180> for

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
got 360 in apparently that's good for

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.990 
got 360 in apparently that's good for
nought<00:01:27.810> 62<00:01:28.350> miles<00:01:28.530> an<00:01:28.680> hour<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:29.009> about<00:01:29.340> 4.4

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
nought 62 miles an hour in about 4.4

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.640 
nought 62 miles an hour in about 4.4
seconds<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.960> top<00:01:30.990> speed<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.380> going<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.590> be

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
seconds and the top speed is going to be

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.760 
seconds and the top speed is going to be
limited<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:32.250> 155<00:01:33.240> miles<00:01:33.630> an<00:01:33.810> hour<00:01:33.930> now<00:01:34.290> this

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
limited to 155 miles an hour now this

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.260 
limited to 155 miles an hour now this
car<00:01:35.070> itself<00:01:35.369> because<00:01:35.880> you've<00:01:36.000> got<00:01:36.119> this

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
car itself because you've got this

car itself because you've got this
hybrid<00:01:36.810> setup<00:01:37.680> it's<00:01:38.340> actually<00:01:38.790> very<00:01:38.820> very

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
hybrid setup it's actually very very

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.590 
hybrid setup it's actually very very
efficient<00:01:39.750> apparently<00:01:40.170> BMW<00:01:40.650> say<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.040> can<00:01:41.250> do

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
efficient apparently BMW say it can do

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.270 
efficient apparently BMW say it can do
130<00:01:42.600> miles<00:01:43.200> per<00:01:43.439> gallon<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.860> missions

driving<00:01:57.210> around<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.570> BMW<00:01:58.080> stand<00:01:58.409> in<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:59.250> i8

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
driving around the BMW stand in the i8

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.330 
driving around the BMW stand in the i8
smaller<00:02:00.689> brother<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.200> i3<00:02:01.860> it's<00:02:02.009> because<00:02:02.189> it's

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
smaller brother the i3 it's because it's

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.550 
smaller brother the i3 it's because it's
electric<00:02:02.790> pad<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.240> can<00:02:03.390> actually<00:02:03.509> drive<00:02:04.439> the

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
electric pad you can actually drive the

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.190 
electric pad you can actually drive the
i8<00:02:04.830> on<00:02:05.040> electric<00:02:05.430> power<00:02:05.460> line<00:02:05.820> for<00:02:06.119> up<00:02:06.330> to<00:02:06.570> 22

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
i8 on electric power line for up to 22

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.350 
i8 on electric power line for up to 22
miles<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.799> it'll<00:02:08.220> do<00:02:08.340> top<00:02:08.550> speed<00:02:08.849> on<00:02:09.030> battery

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
miles and it'll do top speed on battery

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.449 
miles and it'll do top speed on battery
power<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.810> 75<00:02:10.530> miles<00:02:10.890> an<00:02:11.009> hour<00:02:11.130> which<00:02:11.310> is

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
power of 75 miles an hour which is

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.660 
power of 75 miles an hour which is
pretty<00:02:11.760> quick<00:02:12.239> now<00:02:12.780> if<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:12.930> look<00:02:13.020> inside<00:02:13.670> I'll

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
pretty quick now if you look inside I'll

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.100 
pretty quick now if you look inside I'll
get<00:02:14.790> some<00:02:14.940> shots<00:02:15.090> inside<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.540> cars<00:02:15.780> actually

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
get some shots inside the cars actually

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.180 
get some shots inside the cars actually
a<00:02:16.500> four-seater<00:02:17.510> yet<00:02:18.510> despite<00:02:18.780> that<00:02:18.989> and<00:02:19.440> the

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
a four-seater yet despite that and the

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.470 
a four-seater yet despite that and the
fact<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.550> you've<00:02:20.730> got<00:02:20.819> other<00:02:20.940> battery

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
fact that you've got other battery

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.570 
fact that you've got other battery
turbines<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.170> electric<00:02:22.500> motor<00:02:22.680> it<00:02:23.280> still

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
turbines and the electric motor it still

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.570 
turbines and the electric motor it still
weighs<00:02:23.819> under<00:02:24.349> 1,500<00:02:25.349> kilos<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:26.190> that's<00:02:26.310> less

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
weighs under 1,500 kilos and that's less

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.270 
weighs under 1,500 kilos and that's less
than<00:02:26.790> an<00:02:26.910> Audi<00:02:27.209> r8<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.650> that's<00:02:29.160> obviously

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
than an Audi r8 and that's obviously

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.490 
than an Audi r8 and that's obviously
because<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.940> extensive<00:02:30.600> use<00:02:30.630> of<00:02:30.780> this<00:02:31.080> carbon

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
because the extensive use of this carbon

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.350 
because the extensive use of this carbon
reinforced<00:02:31.920> plastic<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.580> lightweight

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
aluminium and core itself like I say

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.120 
aluminium and core itself like I say
it's<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.120> production<00:02:36.600> car<00:02:36.810> going<00:02:37.260> on<00:02:37.380> sale<00:02:37.620> you

it's a production car going on sale you

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.410 
it's a production car going on sale you
