00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
could it be responsible not just for

could it be responsible not just for

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:48.870 
rhythms but also for Rage the switch is
turned<00:01:45.810> then<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:47.080> switch<00:01:47.290> is<00:01:47.470> turned<00:01:47.650> off<00:01:47.980> so

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
turned then the switch is turned off so

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.149 
turned then the switch is turned off so
indeed<00:01:49.300> the<00:01:49.540> hypothalamus<00:01:50.350> does<00:01:50.650> control
