I think one of the greatest losses on

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.490 
I think one of the greatest losses on
this<00:02:05.350> continent<00:02:05.860> is<00:02:06.100> if<00:02:06.430> if<00:02:07.390> we<00:02:07.600> destroy<00:02:08.110> our

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
this continent is if if we destroy our

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.979 
this continent is if if we destroy our
herds<00:02:08.830> of<00:02:09.009> wild<00:02:09.190> horses<00:02:09.550> they<00:02:10.479> basically

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
herds of wild horses they basically

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.449 
herds of wild horses they basically
represent<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.970> spirit<00:02:13.630> of<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.470> Americas<00:02:15.069> in

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
a way that we can only begin to

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.309 
a way that we can only begin to
understand<00:02:19.090> and<00:02:19.450> it's<00:02:20.080> through

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319
