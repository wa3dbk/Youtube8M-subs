00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.240
 you tachen de mundo was trying the new baby I sell x 3 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.800
 23 is a little more the network of the greater contest of 9 centimeters 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.350
 It smells good because it allows the deaths of the transformation center 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.670
 to overcome the legs 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.710
 also regrets that they have a capacity of 70 liters more than the Andean 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.510
 allow a greater load capacity 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.039
 this new version the x3 that these make more powerful of all 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.430
 has a 3-cubic-centimeter motor that is a 6 in line 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.880
 and developing nothing less than 306 horsepower the engine is biturbo which 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.620
 for about four meters time per minute so the pilot does accelerate to the bottom 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.620
 the seat is stuck 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.620
 the AR 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.920
 Letters this model has 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.950
 eight changes which allows the revolutions to be a little bit more 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.439
 low when celebrating 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:16.170
 and they consume less fuel in fact this van supposedly would consume 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:18.039
 A little less 

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:21.039
 therefore 40 kilometers the gate 

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:30.369
 later 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:33.479
 jajajajajajajajajajajaja 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:37.959
 the protests 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.959
 3 

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:43.669
 the driver has 

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:45.319
 or access to the car 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.759
 is the spark stick of the box is obviously the volume change and 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:53.199
 radio station was his mentor the bush command phone 

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:55.059
 and linked control 

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:58.179
 another novelty is that it also presents hitchhiking 

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:01.179
 when one arrives for example a traffic light and stepped on the brake 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.489
 the car separated as ethically and if it lights alone a decelerated what 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.479
 allows you to save around 10 percent of fuel another novelty by 

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:14.679
 example of the suspension that the driver can choose can be in normal 

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:17.449
 emerson sports as they are sports plus 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:21.929
 which allows the suspension to harden as well as the direction for 

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:24.929
 a little more dynamic handling 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:37.719
 until 

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:42.669
 pomegranate
