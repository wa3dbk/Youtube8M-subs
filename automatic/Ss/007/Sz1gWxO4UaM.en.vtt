 hello in this new section I will teach you to 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.249
 make a bottle of colors that the 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.440
 let's use as a paperweight this is a 

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:13.719
 very great and ideal gift that you can 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.630
 give away I hope you like this new 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.130
 tutorial and this new section 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.320
 we will need a bottle that we can 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.650
 get anywhere from 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:28.210
 crafts a spoon plastic cups 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:32.320
 or glass to put the salt salt chalks 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.890
 a cutter a sheet of paper and some 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.110
 ribbon to decorate the bottle 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.330
 The first thing we are going to do is roll up 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.250
 the paper to make a kind of 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.820
 funnel and then enter it into the 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.820
 bottle 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.630
 we introduce it to the bottle with a lot 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:57.510
 careful then we put the salt and we have 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.910
 to fill everything until everything is 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.960
 full to calculate how much salt 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.710
 use it 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.710
 the mind 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.299
 when we are finished we are going to 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.120
 equitably distribute salt in the 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.680
 low to be able to color it later 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.980
 writes 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.980
 look 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.290
 all right 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.490
 yes 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.590
 then let's start the part of 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.930
 coloring the room let's take the 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.210
 colors and we're going to drag them with the 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.150
 cutter so they can be colored very 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:46.310
 very well 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.310
 of this domain 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.970
 then we will go putting the colors 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.520
 by sections that is little by little and 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.160
 every time we finish with a color there is 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.470
 have to give a little blow in the part of 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.630
 the base of the bottle so that the line 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.990
 of the colors look straight and a lot 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.990
 best 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.629
 by winfrey 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.780
 it's mine in the former mine 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.910
 you 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.910
 when issuing 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.360
 Chile 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.010
 and it's OK 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.349
 and then we close it and we see that the 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.299
 You can put any ribbon on it 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:00.020
 color that gives with the colors that we have 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:03.860
 put in the salt 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:07.930
