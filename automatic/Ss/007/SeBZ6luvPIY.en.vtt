2<00:00:48.960> game<00:00:49.230> I'm<00:00:49.620> going<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.890> show<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.100> how<00:00:50.489> it's

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
2 game I'm going to show you how it's

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
2 game I'm going to show you how it's
done<00:00:51.230> first<00:00:52.230> these<00:00:52.860> things<00:00:53.219> here<00:00:53.489> are<00:00:53.690> quantum

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
done first these things here are quantum

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.319 
done first these things here are quantum
indicators<00:00:55.530> they<00:00:56.190> show<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.489> how<00:00:56.910> much<00:00:57.030> once

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
indicators they show you how much once

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.849 
indicators they show you how much once
we<00:00:57.629> have<00:00:57.859> the<00:00:58.859> pillars<00:00:59.280> give<00:00:59.850> you<00:01:00.030> Quantum's

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859 
we have the pillars give you Quantum's

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.429 
we have the pillars give you Quantum's
you<00:01:01.859> see<00:01:02.070> each<00:01:02.309> then<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.969> fire<00:01:03.629> console<00:01:04.229> is

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
you see each then a fire console is

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.219 
you see each then a fire console is
generated<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.700> column<00:01:06.180> like<00:01:06.360> this<00:01:06.840> mark

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
generated this column like this mark

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.520 
generated this column like this mark
mark<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.220> choose<00:01:10.220> itself<00:01:11.270> does<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.750> well<00:01:13.229> if

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
mark you choose itself does it well if

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.020 
mark you choose itself does it well if
you<00:01:13.740> choose<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.189> mark<00:01:14.460> then<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.820> will

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
you choose the mark then it will

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.100 
you choose the mark then it will
generates<00:01:15.540> one<00:01:15.979> mark<00:01:17.360> quantum<00:01:18.360> everything

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
generates one mark quantum everything

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.730 
generates one mark quantum everything
these<00:01:20.040> are<00:01:20.100> quantum<00:01:20.820> pillars<00:01:21.330> itself<00:01:22.080> they

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
these are quantum pillars itself they

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.450 
these are quantum pillars itself they
generate<00:01:23.220> random<00:01:23.720> randomly<00:01:24.920> like<00:01:25.920> three

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
generate random randomly like three

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.399 
generate random randomly like three
random<00:01:26.939> cancer<00:01:29.180> every<00:01:30.180> turn<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.869> these<00:01:31.110> are

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
random cancer every turn and these are

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.810 
random cancer every turn and these are
fire<00:01:31.619> pendulums<00:01:32.360> this<00:01:33.360> generates<00:01:33.960> one<00:01:34.820> well

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
fire pendulums this generates one well

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.140 
fire pendulums this generates one well
each<00:01:36.450> element<00:01:37.020> has<00:01:37.170> its<00:01:37.200> own<00:01:37.680> pendulums<00:01:38.220> first

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
each element has its own pendulums first

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.550 
each element has its own pendulums first
it<00:01:39.509> generates<00:01:40.470> one<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:42.060> element<00:01:42.560> pendulum

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
it generates one the element pendulum

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.550 
it generates one the element pendulum
that<00:01:43.590> it's<00:01:44.070> from<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.990> one<00:01:45.990> your<00:01:46.350> main

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
that it's from and one your main

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:55.219 
that it's from and one your main
elements<00:01:48.110> cancer<00:01:49.280> so<00:01:50.280> let's<00:01:50.850> see<00:01:53.750> yeah<00:01:54.750> three

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
elements cancer so let's see yeah three

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.910 
elements cancer so let's see yeah three
fire<00:01:55.439> Quan<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:55.950> want<00:01:56.159> gravity<00:01:56.579> constant<00:01:56.820> and

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
fire Quan so want gravity constant and

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.410 
fire Quan so want gravity constant and
Hollis<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:59.540> see<00:02:00.540> now<00:02:01.219> this<00:02:02.219> is<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.759> really<00:02:03.299> good

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
Hollis I see now this is a really good

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.430 
Hollis I see now this is a really good
card<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.380> might<00:02:05.100> as<00:02:05.250> well<00:02:05.399> just<00:02:05.820> destroyed

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.630 

whoo<00:02:10.570> let's<00:02:11.570> see<00:02:14.050> okay<00:02:15.070> can't<00:02:16.070> do<00:02:16.250> anything

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
whoo let's see okay can't do anything

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.730 
whoo let's see okay can't do anything
this<00:02:16.790> time<00:02:18.880> no<00:02:19.880> I'm<00:02:20.750> gonna<00:02:20.990> wait<00:02:21.200> until<00:02:21.440> I<00:02:21.620> get

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
this time no I'm gonna wait until I get

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.230 
this time no I'm gonna wait until I get
seven<00:02:22.390> grab<00:02:23.390> it<00:02:23.510> ten<00:02:24.110> fire<00:02:24.490> so<00:02:25.490> I<00:02:25.520> could<00:02:25.880> put

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
seven grab it ten fire so I could put

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.380 
seven grab it ten fire so I could put
Crimson<00:02:26.840> Dragon<00:02:27.200> in<00:02:27.730> it's<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:28.820> very<00:02:28.850> good<00:02:29.090> card

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
Crimson Dragon in it's a very good card

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
Crimson Dragon in it's a very good card
yes<00:02:29.990> now<00:02:30.260> hot<00:02:30.470> Sun<00:02:30.710> 38<00:02:31.520> mm<00:02:33.400> Wow<00:02:34.900> okay<00:02:35.930> Crimson

yes now hot Sun 38 mm Wow okay Crimson

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.830 
yes now hot Sun 38 mm Wow okay Crimson
Dragon<00:02:36.820> here<00:02:37.820> is<00:02:38.180> 12<00:02:38.990> line<00:02:39.650> zero<00:02:40.280> put<00:02:41.090> 12<00:02:41.510> nine

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
Dragon here is 12 line zero put 12 nine

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.370 
Dragon here is 12 line zero put 12 nine
and<00:02:42.200> three<00:02:42.910> that<00:02:43.910> means<00:02:44.150> that<00:02:44.480> it<00:02:44.720> will<00:02:44.930> deal

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
and three that means that it will deal

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.990 
and three that means that it will deal
swell<00:02:45.950> damage<00:02:46.490> each<00:02:46.850> turn<00:02:47.330> and<00:02:48.370> it<00:02:49.370> has<00:02:49.610> three

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
swell damage each turn and it has three

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.670 
swell damage each turn and it has three
lives<00:02:50.270> so<00:02:51.080> if<00:02:51.410> someone<00:02:52.540> hits<00:02:53.540> it<00:02:53.750> with<00:02:53.990> some

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
lives so if someone hits it with some

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.170 
lives so if someone hits it with some
spell<00:02:55.220> cards

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
spell cards

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.150 
spell cards
it<00:02:56.870> takes<00:02:57.140> away<00:02:57.560> like<00:02:57.830> 2<00:02:58.190> 2<00:02:59.120> HP<00:02:59.740> then<00:03:00.740> it<00:03:00.980> will

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
it takes away like 2 2 HP then it will

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.020
