00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
air dry right now like a little bit

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
air dry right now like a little bit
right<00:02:09.959> there<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.259> can<00:02:10.410> see<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:10.619> sweat<00:02:10.830> a

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860

little bit

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.970 
little bit
and<00:02:13.150> as<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.330> air<00:02:14.510> dries<00:02:14.840> throughout<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.800> day

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980
