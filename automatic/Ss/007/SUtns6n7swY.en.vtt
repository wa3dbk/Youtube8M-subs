gemstones and quite often I get into
discussions<00:00:06.899> with<00:00:07.049> people<00:00:07.230> on<00:00:07.529> how<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.859> crimp

crimp beads come in different shapes

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.480 
crimp beads come in different shapes
there's<00:00:22.109> tubes<00:00:22.470> there's<00:00:22.800> knurled<00:00:23.250> leads

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
there's tubes there's knurled leads

there's tubes there's knurled leads
there's<00:00:23.910> round<00:00:24.330> ones<00:00:24.689> there's<00:00:25.019> all<00:00:25.170> kinds<00:00:25.500> of

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
there's round ones there's all kinds of

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.620 
there's round ones there's all kinds of
crimp<00:00:26.609> beads<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.029> they're<00:00:27.150> they<00:00:27.359> all<00:00:27.449> come<00:00:27.599> in

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
crimp beads and they're they all come in

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.570 
crimp beads and they're they all come in
different<00:00:27.779> sizes<00:00:28.140> as<00:00:28.560> well<00:00:28.590> there's<00:00:29.429> two

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
different sizes as well there's two

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.009 
different sizes as well there's two
millimeters<00:00:30.000> long<00:00:30.179> two<00:00:30.420> millimeters<00:00:30.840> wide

millimeters long two millimeters wide

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.749 
millimeters long two millimeters wide
and<00:00:31.050> then<00:00:31.529> there's<00:00:31.710> different<00:00:32.250> sizes<00:00:32.610> for

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
and then there's different sizes for

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.970 
and then there's different sizes for
different<00:00:32.820> sizes<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.480> wire<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.989> personally

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
different sizes of wire I personally

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.470 
different sizes of wire I personally
don't<00:00:35.160> like<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.309> get<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.610> technical<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.239> want

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
don't like to get that technical I want

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.630 
don't like to get that technical I want
one<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.200> want<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.680> work<00:00:37.710> on<00:00:38.040> everything

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
one and I want it to work on everything

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.440 
one and I want it to work on everything
I<00:00:38.760> do<00:00:39.079> so<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.530> have<00:00:40.710> come<00:00:41.070> up<00:00:41.100> with<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.700> way<00:00:42.059> to

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
I do so I have come up with a way to

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.060 
I do so I have come up with a way to
make<00:00:42.809> them<00:00:42.989> work<00:00:43.020> for<00:00:43.260> me<00:00:43.379> no<00:00:43.469> matter<00:00:43.590> what

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
make them work for me no matter what

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.510 
make them work for me no matter what
size<00:00:44.309> wire<00:00:44.550> I'm<00:00:44.820> using<00:00:45.649> and<00:00:46.649> what<00:00:47.129> I'm<00:00:47.250> doing

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
size wire I'm using and what I'm doing

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.569 
size wire I'm using and what I'm doing
so<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.750> usually<00:00:49.440> use<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.800> two<00:00:50.010> millimeter<00:00:50.399> long

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
so I usually use the two millimeter long

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.340 
so I usually use the two millimeter long
two<00:00:50.879> millimeter<00:00:51.270> wide<00:00:51.420> crimp<00:00:51.750> tubes

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
two millimeter wide crimp tubes

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.470 
two millimeter wide crimp tubes
I<00:00:52.559> like<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.100> sterling<00:00:53.489> ones<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.149> copper

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
I like the sterling ones and the copper

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.400 
I like the sterling ones and the copper
ones<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:54.989> carry<00:00:56.840> now

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
ones that I carry now

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.160 
ones that I carry now
before<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.070> always<00:00:59.430> use<00:00:59.640> two<00:00:59.969> crimp<00:01:00.690> beads

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
before I always use two crimp beads

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.380 
before I always use two crimp beads
because<00:01:01.949> my<00:01:02.280> jewelry<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.670> usually<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.180> heavy

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
because my jewelry is usually so heavy

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.030 
because my jewelry is usually so heavy
and<00:01:03.629> if<00:01:03.780> one<00:01:03.989> gives<00:01:04.199> then<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.619> have<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.769> backup

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
and if one gives then you have a backup

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.510 
and if one gives then you have a backup
of<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.430> other<00:01:05.580> one<00:01:06.229> now<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.290> flip<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.369> over

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
of the other one now you flip it over

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.640 
of the other one now you flip it over
and<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:09.150> work<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.420> end<00:01:09.780> back<00:01:10.080> through<00:01:10.110> but

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
and you work the end back through but

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.380 
and you work the end back through but
before<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.070> do<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.340> if<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.640> want<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.060> attach

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
before you do that if you want to attach

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.670 
before you do that if you want to attach
a<00:01:12.510> chain<00:01:12.540> or<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.549> link<00:01:14.549> now<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.290> time<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.590> do

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
a chain or a link now is the time to do

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.859 
a chain or a link now is the time to do
that<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:17.040> prefer<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.030> use<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.180> jump<00:01:18.570> ring<00:01:18.720> to

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
that I prefer to use a jump ring to

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.870 
that I prefer to use a jump ring to
attach<00:01:19.110> these<00:01:19.530> later<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.340> have<00:01:20.610> a

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
attach these later so that you have a

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.730 
attach these later so that you have a
weak<00:01:21.180> spot<00:01:21.420> in<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.810> necklace<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.350> can<00:01:22.500> give

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
weak spot in the necklace that can give

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.249 
weak spot in the necklace that can give
in<00:01:23.040> case<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.790> know<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.030> get<00:01:24.780> hung<00:01:24.960> up<00:01:25.080> on<00:01:25.200> a

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
in case you know you get hung up on a

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.710 
in case you know you get hung up on a
car<00:01:25.590> or<00:01:25.770> something<00:01:26.180> but<00:01:27.180> let's<00:01:27.330> see<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.570> want

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
car or something but let's see you want

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.609 
car or something but let's see you want
this<00:01:27.840> end<00:01:28.049> piece

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
this end piece

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.069 
this end piece
there's<00:01:29.250> Sycamore<00:01:29.759> secure<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.689> put<00:01:30.960> this

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
there's Sycamore secure so I put this

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.600 
there's Sycamore secure so I put this
straight<00:01:31.350> through<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.650> chain<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.159> take<00:01:32.460> my

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
straight through the chain I take my

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.660 
straight through the chain I take my
pliers<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:33.060> bend<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.689> end<00:01:33.840> over<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.500> then<00:01:35.460> I

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
pliers I bend the end over and then I

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.870 
pliers I bend the end over and then I
work<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.210> end<00:01:36.450> into<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:39.200> crimps<00:01:40.610> so<00:01:41.610> that

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
work the end into the crimps so that

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.569 
work the end into the crimps so that
they've<00:01:42.210> gone<00:01:42.390> through<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.869> crimps<00:01:43.229> twice

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
they've gone through the crimps twice

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.690 
they've gone through the crimps twice
it's<00:01:44.579> gonna<00:01:44.700> be<00:01:44.850> easier<00:01:45.060> said<00:01:45.240> than<00:01:45.390> done

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
it's gonna be easier said than done

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.330 
it's gonna be easier said than done
there<00:01:47.700> we<00:01:47.909> go<00:01:48.380> one<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.530> places<00:01:49.860> where<00:01:50.100> your

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
there we go one of the places where your

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.780 
there we go one of the places where your
wire<00:01:50.640> can<00:01:51.240> get<00:01:51.840> weak<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.530> up<00:01:52.890> in<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:53.490> area

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790

which<00:02:13.540> one<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.980> is<00:02:15.330> but<00:02:16.330> make<00:02:16.510> sure<00:02:16.540> it's<00:02:16.810> going

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
which one it is but make sure it's going

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.260 
which one it is but make sure it's going
through<00:02:17.230> parallel<00:02:17.830> it<00:02:18.220> hasn't<00:02:18.640> crossed<00:02:18.760> over

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
inside the crimp beads because then

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.620 
inside the crimp beads because then
it'll<00:02:22.900> create<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.350> weak<00:02:23.680> point<00:02:24.070> where<00:02:24.970> the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
it'll create a weak point where the

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.600 
it'll create a weak point where the
necklace<00:02:25.960> could<00:02:26.140> break<00:02:26.350> so<00:02:27.250> I'm<00:02:27.340> gonna<00:02:27.430> leave

necklace could break so I'm gonna leave

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.800 
necklace could break so I'm gonna leave
about<00:02:27.760> that<00:02:27.940> much<00:02:28.000> room<00:02:28.330> because<00:02:28.540> that<00:02:28.630> looks

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
about that much room because that looks

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.680 
about that much room because that looks
like<00:02:28.930> a<00:02:28.990> good<00:02:29.230> amount<00:02:29.410> of<00:02:29.530> play<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.480> am

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
like a good amount of play and I am

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.160 
like a good amount of play and I am
going<00:02:32.050> to<00:02:32.260> take<00:02:32.980> my<00:02:33.010> crimping<00:02:33.730> pliers<00:02:34.210> now<00:02:34.570> at

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
going to take my crimping pliers now at

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.480 
going to take my crimping pliers now at
this<00:02:35.290> point<00:02:35.440> one<00:02:35.740> of<00:02:35.770> the<00:02:35.920> things<00:02:36.130> you<00:02:36.250> can<00:02:36.400> do

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
this point one of the things you can do

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.860 
this point one of the things you can do
is<00:02:36.550> you<00:02:36.610> can<00:02:36.700> just<00:02:36.850> flat<00:02:37.090> crimp<00:02:37.420> a<00:02:37.570> lot<00:02:37.780> of

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
is you can just flat crimp a lot of

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.060 
is you can just flat crimp a lot of
people<00:02:38.080> do<00:02:38.200> that<00:02:38.320> they<00:02:38.500> just<00:02:38.680> take<00:02:38.800> a<00:02:38.830> pair<00:02:39.040> of

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
people do that they just take a pair of

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.470 
people do that they just take a pair of
pliers<00:02:39.160> and<00:02:39.610> they<00:02:40.560> flatten<00:02:41.560> this<00:02:41.770> crimp<00:02:42.130> out

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
pliers and they flatten this crimp out

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.730 
pliers and they flatten this crimp out
some<00:02:43.480> people<00:02:43.600> don't<00:02:43.840> even<00:02:44.020> cover<00:02:44.200> it<00:02:44.380> up<00:02:44.470> I

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
some people don't even cover it up I

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.260 
some people don't even cover it up I
will<00:02:45.130> sometimes<00:02:45.340> flat<00:02:45.730> crimp<00:02:46.000> but<00:02:46.150> if

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
will sometimes flat crimp but if

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.610 
will sometimes flat crimp but if
something<00:02:46.630> if<00:02:46.750> I<00:02:46.870> have<00:02:46.960> a<00:02:46.990> really<00:02:47.290> really

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620

going through that bead now I'm going to

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.020 
going through that bead now I'm going to
do<00:03:38.530> that<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.739> second<00:03:39.070> crimp<00:03:39.250> bead<00:03:39.400> and<00:03:39.640> I<00:03:39.790> want

to leave some room because I want to put

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.220 
to leave some room because I want to put
on<00:03:41.730> crimp<00:03:42.730> bead<00:03:42.880> covers<00:03:43.300> after<00:03:43.780> I'm<00:03:43.900> all<00:03:44.020> done

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
on crimp bead covers after I'm all done

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.140 
on crimp bead covers after I'm all done
to<00:03:44.380> clean<00:03:44.590> this<00:03:44.709> look<00:03:44.950> up<00:03:45.130> so<00:03:45.850> I'm<00:03:45.940> going<00:03:46.060> to

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
to clean this look up so I'm going to

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.970 
to clean this look up so I'm going to
leave<00:03:46.510> a<00:03:46.540> little<00:03:46.720> tiny<00:03:46.959> bit<00:03:47.140> of<00:03:47.200> room<00:03:47.440> and<00:03:47.770> I'm

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
leave a little tiny bit of room and I'm

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.710 
leave a little tiny bit of room and I'm
going<00:03:48.220> to<00:03:48.340> separate<00:03:49.239> my<00:03:49.300> wires<00:03:49.690> and<00:03:50.020> make<00:03:50.170> sure

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
going to separate my wires and make sure

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.360 
going to separate my wires and make sure
that<00:03:52.720> they've<00:03:53.020> they're<00:03:53.739> pulled<00:03:54.010> apart<00:03:54.280> a

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
that they've they're pulled apart a

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.360 
that they've they're pulled apart a
little<00:03:54.489> bit<00:03:54.760> and<00:03:55.209> I've<00:03:56.050> made<00:03:56.410> my<00:03:56.680> dent<00:03:57.040> on<00:03:57.340> the

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
little bit and I've made my dent on the

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.580 
little bit and I've made my dent on the
front<00:03:57.670> of<00:03:57.730> the<00:03:57.790> crimp<00:03:58.030> tube<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.989> back<00:03:59.200> is

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
front of the crimp tube the back is

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.580 
front of the crimp tube the back is
straight<00:04:00.570> because<00:04:01.570> this<00:04:02.020> part<00:04:02.290> of<00:04:02.350> the<00:04:02.410> tool

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
straight because this part of the tool

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.670 
straight because this part of the tool
was<00:04:03.070> only<00:04:03.310> dented<00:04:03.610> on<00:04:03.700> one<00:04:03.880> side<00:04:04.260> so<00:04:05.260> sometimes

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
was only dented on one side so sometimes

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.800 
was only dented on one side so sometimes
now<00:04:05.950> when<00:04:06.220> you<00:04:06.340> go<00:04:06.550> to<00:04:06.610> the<00:04:06.880> back<00:04:07.120> and<00:04:07.390> you<00:04:07.600> try

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
now when you go to the back and you try

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.900 
now when you go to the back and you try
to<00:04:07.840> fold<00:04:08.260> this<00:04:08.530> over<00:04:08.709> with<00:04:09.100> the<00:04:09.250> rounded<00:04:09.640> part

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
to fold this over with the rounded part

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.570 
to fold this over with the rounded part
it<00:04:10.300> won't<00:04:10.480> fold<00:04:10.750> because<00:04:10.989> the<00:04:11.290> dent<00:04:11.980> wasn't

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
it won't fold because the dent wasn't

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.020 
it won't fold because the dent wasn't
deep<00:04:12.760> enough<00:04:13.230> and<00:04:14.230> that<00:04:15.220> happens<00:04:15.550> especially

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
deep enough and that happens especially

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.670 
deep enough and that happens especially
if<00:04:16.090> you're<00:04:16.299> using<00:04:16.510> too<00:04:16.840> small<00:04:17.109> a<00:04:17.140> wire<00:04:17.350> for<00:04:17.530> too

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
if you're using too small a wire for too

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.279 
if you're using too small a wire for too
big<00:04:17.830> of<00:04:17.950> a<00:04:18.010> crimpy<00:04:18.400> so<00:04:19.359> what<00:04:19.539> I<00:04:19.570> do<00:04:19.690> is<00:04:19.989> I<00:04:20.109> take

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
big of a crimpy so what I do is I take

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:23.790 
big of a crimpy so what I do is I take
the<00:04:20.350> tip<00:04:20.739> of<00:04:20.950> this<00:04:21.760> of<00:04:22.000> the<00:04:22.450> pliers<00:04:22.720> I<00:04:23.050> put<00:04:23.710> it

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
the tip of this of the pliers I put it

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.720 
the tip of this of the pliers I put it
in<00:04:23.919> the<00:04:24.039> dense

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
in the dense

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.060 
in the dense
and<00:04:24.790> I<00:04:24.880> just<00:04:25.090> give<00:04:25.240> a<00:04:25.450> little<00:04:25.510> tiny<00:04:25.990> press<00:04:26.350> you

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
and I just give a little tiny press you

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.770 
and I just give a little tiny press you
never<00:04:27.250> want<00:04:27.460> to<00:04:27.520> squeeze<00:04:27.790> too<00:04:28.000> hard<00:04:28.030> because

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
never want to squeeze too hard because

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.020 
never want to squeeze too hard because
you<00:04:29.200> don't<00:04:29.410> want<00:04:29.800> to<00:04:30.010> create<00:04:30.340> a<00:04:30.430> really<00:04:30.760> tight

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
you don't want to create a really tight

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.600 
you don't want to create a really tight
spot<00:04:31.240> or<00:04:31.480> mush<00:04:31.690> your<00:04:32.140> wire<00:04:32.460> because<00:04:33.460> then

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
spot or mush your wire because then

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.560 
spot or mush your wire because then
you're<00:04:33.730> gonna<00:04:33.820> have<00:04:34.000> a<00:04:34.060> place<00:04:34.240> that<00:04:34.270> will

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
you're gonna have a place that will

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.650 
you're gonna have a place that will
break<00:04:35.190> now<00:04:36.190> if<00:04:36.370> it<00:04:36.700> still<00:04:36.970> doesn't<00:04:37.150> look<00:04:37.330> like

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
break now if it still doesn't look like

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.320 
break now if it still doesn't look like
it's<00:04:38.530> enough<00:04:39.010> of<00:04:39.130> a<00:04:39.250> dent<00:04:39.490> where<00:04:39.700> when<00:04:39.910> I<00:04:39.940> fold

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
it's enough of a dent where when I fold

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.570 
it's enough of a dent where when I fold
it<00:04:40.480> it'll<00:04:40.720> fold<00:04:41.020> over<00:04:41.290> instead<00:04:42.040> it<00:04:42.190> is<00:04:42.220> opening

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
it it'll fold over instead it is opening

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.210 
it it'll fold over instead it is opening
up<00:04:42.730> again<00:04:42.880> I'll<00:04:43.660> take<00:04:43.930> two<00:04:44.260> pairs<00:04:44.620> of<00:04:44.950> flat

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
up again I'll take two pairs of flat

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.580 
up again I'll take two pairs of flat
nose<00:04:45.250> pliers<00:04:45.720> grab<00:04:46.720> one<00:04:47.080> on<00:04:47.380> each<00:04:47.950> side<00:04:48.870> of<00:04:49.870> the

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
nose pliers grab one on each side of the

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.030 
nose pliers grab one on each side of the
dent<00:04:50.800> I<00:04:52.200> can't<00:04:53.200> grab<00:04:53.380> it<00:04:53.410> with<00:04:53.650> these<00:04:53.770> players

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
dent I can't grab it with these players

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.800 
dent I can't grab it with these players
anyway<00:04:54.790> you<00:04:54.850> get<00:04:54.940> the<00:04:55.000> idea<00:04:55.150> put<00:04:55.450> it<00:04:55.540> there<00:04:55.660> and

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
anyway you get the idea put it there and

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.510 
anyway you get the idea put it there and
then<00:04:55.870> I<00:04:56.020> bend<00:04:56.380> it<00:04:57.330> so<00:04:58.330> that<00:04:58.510> it's<00:04:59.160> more<00:05:00.160> of<00:05:00.430> an

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
then I bend it so that it's more of an

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.970 
then I bend it so that it's more of an
angle<00:05:00.790> so<00:05:01.210> that<00:05:01.720> when<00:05:01.960> I<00:05:01.990> take<00:05:02.260> the<00:05:02.440> crimps<00:05:02.860> and

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
angle so that when I take the crimps and

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.940 
angle so that when I take the crimps and
I<00:05:03.100> fold<00:05:03.580> it<00:05:03.910> it<00:05:04.720> does<00:05:05.020> so<00:05:05.230> with<00:05:05.380> ease<00:05:05.620> and<00:05:05.860> it

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
I fold it it does so with ease and it

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.000 
I fold it it does so with ease and it
doesn't<00:05:06.280> open<00:05:06.490> up<00:05:06.850> that<00:05:07.060> jump<00:05:07.360> ring<00:05:07.540> or<00:05:07.660> the

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
doesn't open up that jump ring or the

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.800 
doesn't open up that jump ring or the
crimp<00:05:09.010> bead<00:05:09.070> so<00:05:10.030> let's<00:05:10.210> see<00:05:10.390> if<00:05:10.480> these<00:05:10.600> will

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
crimp bead so let's see if these will

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.020 
crimp bead so let's see if these will
fold<00:05:11.020> over<00:05:11.430> that<00:05:12.430> one<00:05:12.580> fold<00:05:12.850> it<00:05:12.940> over

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
fold over that one fold it over

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:21.300 
fold over that one fold it over
beautifully<00:05:17.580> perfect<00:05:19.410> okay<00:05:20.410> so<00:05:20.470> then<00:05:20.830> I<00:05:21.040> take

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
beautifully perfect okay so then I take

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.650 
beautifully perfect okay so then I take
my<00:05:21.390> tips<00:05:22.390> of<00:05:22.720> these<00:05:22.960> crimp<00:05:23.890> pliers<00:05:24.250> and<00:05:24.940> I<00:05:25.390> kind

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
my tips of these crimp pliers and I kind

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.060 
my tips of these crimp pliers and I kind
of<00:05:25.720> squeeze<00:05:27.360> that<00:05:28.360> full<00:05:28.780> just<00:05:29.290> a<00:05:29.530> touch<00:05:29.800> to

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
of squeeze that full just a touch to

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.820 
of squeeze that full just a touch to
give<00:05:30.220> it<00:05:30.340> a<00:05:30.400> little<00:05:30.760> bit<00:05:31.300> more<00:05:32.370> home<00:05:33.370> security

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
give it a little bit more home security

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.010 
give it a little bit more home security
so<00:05:35.830> now<00:05:35.980> this<00:05:36.160> is<00:05:36.220> this<00:05:37.090> crimp<00:05:37.390> bead<00:05:37.570> down<00:05:37.750> here

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
so now this is this crimp bead down here

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.800 
so now this is this crimp bead down here
it's<00:05:38.170> kind<00:05:38.380> of<00:05:38.440> opening<00:05:39.280> up<00:05:39.340> on<00:05:39.550> me<00:05:39.700> but<00:05:40.660> that's

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:40.810 
it's kind of opening up on me but that's

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.450 
it's kind of opening up on me but that's
okay<00:05:41.200> because<00:05:41.500> it's<00:05:41.770> going<00:05:41.950> to<00:05:42.040> have<00:05:42.190> some

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
okay because it's going to have some

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.220 
okay because it's going to have some
hold<00:05:42.700> and<00:05:42.970> you<00:05:43.120> have<00:05:43.270> a<00:05:43.300> backup<00:05:43.540> of<00:05:43.840> the<00:05:43.990> next

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230 
hold and you have a backup of the next

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.870 
hold and you have a backup of the next
crimp<00:05:44.500> that's<00:05:44.800> the<00:05:44.980> other<00:05:45.070> reason<00:05:45.460> to<00:05:45.490> do<00:05:45.700> two

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
crimp that's the other reason to do two

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.880 
crimp that's the other reason to do two
crimps<00:05:46.270> in<00:05:46.390> case<00:05:46.570> one<00:05:46.840> gives<00:05:47.230> you've<00:05:47.590> got<00:05:47.740> the

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:47.890 
crimps in case one gives you've got the

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.500 
crimps in case one gives you've got the
other<00:05:48.010> one<00:05:48.220> as<00:05:48.610> insurance<00:05:49.890> so<00:05:50.890> then<00:05:51.010> I<00:05:51.070> take<00:05:51.220> my

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
other one as insurance so then I take my

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.660 
other one as insurance so then I take my
cutters<00:05:52.510> that<00:05:52.930> are<00:05:53.110> not<00:05:53.440> my<00:05:54.250> ones<00:05:54.460> for

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:54.670 
cutters that are not my ones for

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.640

sterling wire or gold wire they're not
flush<00:05:56.950> cutters<00:05:57.310> they're<00:05:57.730> cutters<00:05:58.060> that<00:05:58.210> I

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
flush cutters they're cutters that I

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.350 
flush cutters they're cutters that I
only<00:05:58.510> use<00:05:58.720> on<00:05:59.530> beading<00:05:59.920> wire<00:06:00.100> because<00:06:01.000> beading

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
only use on beading wire because beading

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.240 
only use on beading wire because beading
wire<00:06:01.510> will<00:06:01.750> chew<00:06:02.110> up<00:06:02.290> your<00:06:02.320> flush<00:06:02.740> cutters<00:06:02.770> for

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.250 
wire will chew up your flush cutters for

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.970 
wire will chew up your flush cutters for
your<00:06:03.340> sterling<00:06:03.580> wire<00:06:03.850> and<00:06:04.120> leave<00:06:04.300> gouges<00:06:04.980> in

your sterling wire and leave gouges in

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.140 
your sterling wire and leave gouges in
here<00:06:06.280> and<00:06:06.400> they<00:06:06.460> won't<00:06:06.610> be<00:06:06.670> flush<00:06:06.910> cutting

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
here and they won't be flush cutting

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.830 
here and they won't be flush cutting
anymore<00:06:07.680> and<00:06:08.790> there<00:06:09.790> it's<00:06:09.940> crimped<00:06:10.420> really

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:34.780 
round part of my crimping pliers and I

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.680 
round part of my crimping pliers and I
swing<00:06:35.780> that<00:06:36.260> bead<00:06:36.919> in<00:06:37.310> over<00:06:37.850> top<00:06:38.060> of<00:06:38.090> the<00:06:38.389> crimp

swing that bead in over top of the crimp

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.610 
swing that bead in over top of the crimp
and<00:06:38.930> I<00:06:39.080> give<00:06:39.290> it<00:06:39.320> a<00:06:39.440> little<00:06:39.470> squeeze<00:06:40.100> and<00:06:41.620> I

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.620 
and I give it a little squeeze and I

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.830 
and I give it a little squeeze and I
turn<00:06:42.949> my<00:06:43.250> pliers<00:06:43.580> a<00:06:43.760> little<00:06:44.090> bit<00:06:44.210> and<00:06:44.419> squeeze

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 
turn my pliers a little bit and squeeze

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.300 
turn my pliers a little bit and squeeze
from<00:06:45.080> a<00:06:45.169> number<00:06:45.380> of<00:06:45.410> different<00:06:45.500> angles<00:06:46.070> until

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.310 
from a number of different angles until

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.939 
from a number of different angles until
that<00:06:46.940> bead<00:06:47.180> looks<00:06:47.720> flush

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:48.949 
that bead looks flush

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:51.129 
that bead looks flush
closed<00:06:49.280> and<00:06:49.699> like<00:06:50.240> a<00:06:50.270> perfect<00:06:50.690> bead<00:06:50.870> and<00:06:51.080> that

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:51.139 
closed and like a perfect bead and that

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:54.670 
closed and like a perfect bead and that
way<00:06:52.040> you<00:06:52.100> can't<00:06:52.430> see<00:06:52.639> the<00:06:52.760> crimp<00:06:53.000> and<00:06:53.530> I'll<00:06:54.530> do

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 
way you can't see the crimp and I'll do

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.950 
way you can't see the crimp and I'll do
it<00:06:54.740> with<00:06:54.830> another<00:06:55.220> to<00:06:56.210> cover<00:06:56.419> the<00:06:56.570> second

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 
it with another to cover the second

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.409 
it with another to cover the second
crimp<00:06:57.229> and<00:06:58.190> then<00:06:58.250> you'll<00:06:58.610> see<00:06:58.850> why<00:06:59.000> I<00:06:59.030> left<00:06:59.270> a

00:06:59.409 --> 00:06:59.419 
crimp and then you'll see why I left a

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.080 
crimp and then you'll see why I left a
space<00:06:59.690> between<00:06:59.930> the<00:07:00.229> two<00:07:00.410> because<00:07:01.340> these<00:07:01.729> will

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.090 
space between the two because these will

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.920 
space between the two because these will
take<00:07:02.330> up<00:07:02.570> room<00:07:03.110> on<00:07:03.760> each<00:07:04.760> inches<00:07:05.270> edges<00:07:05.720> of<00:07:05.840> the

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:05.930 
take up room on each inches edges of the

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.800 
take up room on each inches edges of the
crimp<00:07:06.229> bead<00:07:06.560> and<00:07:07.090> they'll<00:07:08.090> press<00:07:08.330> up<00:07:08.510> against

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:08.810 
crimp bead and they'll press up against

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.030 
crimp bead and they'll press up against
one<00:07:08.960> another<00:07:08.990> and<00:07:09.229> look<00:07:09.530> as<00:07:09.680> if<00:07:09.830> they<00:07:09.979> were

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:10.040 
one another and look as if they were

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.310 
one another and look as if they were
strung<00:07:11.290> straight<00:07:12.290> on<00:07:13.780> to<00:07:14.780> the<00:07:14.810> jewelry<00:07:15.169> wire

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:15.320

strung straight on to the jewelry wire
and<00:07:16.280> that<00:07:16.550> is<00:07:17.000> how<00:07:17.720> I<00:07:17.990> personally<00:07:19.810> crimp<00:07:20.810> my
