00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.430
 at what moment of the vineyard of the cycle of 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.439
 life we ​​are good you see here 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.600
 I do not know if you can perceive it I think that 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.779
 it's almost almost all set like 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.390
 you see we have the cluster and now it's missing 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.449
 wait and mature although there are some that 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.329
 are pending to curdle should you 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.040
 this has to become fruit and 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.260
 then effectively more than in Galicia 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.300
 I would say that in Rías Baixas it is true 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.829
 that the pergola is the conductive system 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.440
 traditional although they are already rehearsing 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.640
 and doing other types of crops and in 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:51.300
 espalier there are several reasons worth for 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.800
 this one good conductive system is by 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.539
 example that you already see that the plant is 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.160
 absolutely vigorous they are made as 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.579
 trees maybe this plant maybe 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.949
 have 15 20 years have no more and can 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.180
 it looks like he's 40 then 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.700
 I do believe that the variety 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.740
 previously to the variety another reason 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.810
 important is that it can not give the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.630
 direct installation on the leaves 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.330
 they would cover enough for the sun to pass 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.820
 The sun reflects on the ground and helps the 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.740
 maturation of the grape other then that here 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.060
 as there is a smallholding you already know that 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.640
 there was mayorazgo with which 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.530
 they transmitted the land among all 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.540
 children and then they said that for 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.250
 take advantage of the land to certain kind of 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.380
 crops that did not need direct sun 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.060
 would be planted below and in the part of 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.650
 above they would have water to become the 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.140
 own wine because here is a zone of 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.290
 much self-consumption the argument that to me 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.170
 I really like it, because it's that 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.750
 really here in during the time of 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.250
 flowering it rains a lot then we lose 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.740
 quite production with bleed that 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.149
 not just transformed into fruit and one 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.430
 of the arguments is that perhaps the 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.860
 foliar film helps protect against 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.130
 the rain and hail and made him lose 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.450
 less production another is good because the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.560
 soil moisture that I think this 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.810
 it has been shown that the soil 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.459
 self-regulate well we have an ark or a 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.200
 pretty small organic layer and below 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.730
 there granite opens a little depended on 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.850
 the area but at the end 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.650
 diluted granite let's say 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.780
 and with which I believe that the soil 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.790
 perfectly regulates or that one of 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.270
 the reasons that people usually say that 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.310
 is that it is to have the grapes on high for 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.610
 that are not in a very humid area that 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.110
 there are no more diseases is almost more a 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.340
 Legend that a reality is not a 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.720
 actually they also thought that I 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.550
 I forgot to comment that effectively 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.870
 It is at high made the air 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.950
 take the mildew that is a disease 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.190
 endemic that we have here of course 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.630
 for the change of humidity and sun because 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.190
 we have many hours of sun despite 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.140
 what rains then does indeed 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.360
 generate certain types of diseases that 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.360
 they believed that with the air being high 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.280
 they left before but this I do not have 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.990
 still enough criterion we are in 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.580
 we have compared four hectares and 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.170
 we have planted half vine and half of 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.360
 espalier so that they are in the 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.180
 same solar direction the same kind of 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.770
 floor to do one thing a little more 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.020
 professional and profound because what yes 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.550
 it is safe to have the vineyard 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.730
 trellis from a point of view of 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.490
 cost is much greater mind to come so much 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.310
 by surface you need land 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.870
 as for the very tasks of which 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.880
 is at the level of treatment and 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.720
 collection and truth indeed already 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.900
 just ride it 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.860
 It is much more expensive than we are in 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.740
 a garden 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.090
 we do not have treaties as princes do not 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.860
 we are used to work like this 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.540
 but effectively 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.940
 for the one that comes from another denomination 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.830
 that is a little used to work 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.910
 in a way your field this what 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.910
 I would find it unthinkable 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.739
 i
