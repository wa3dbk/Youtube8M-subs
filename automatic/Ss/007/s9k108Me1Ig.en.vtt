00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.780 
my hammock I'm hoping with the actual
cord<00:00:26.590> that<00:00:26.829> comes<00:00:27.040> out<00:00:28.169> but<00:00:29.169> I<00:00:29.500> have<00:00:30.430> a<00:00:30.460> drop

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:30.790 
cord that comes out but I have a drop

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.060 
cord that comes out but I have a drop
down<00:00:31.059> it<00:00:31.300> will<00:00:31.390> just<00:00:31.509> run<00:00:31.779> down<00:00:31.960> that<00:00:32.020> if<00:00:32.860> not

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
down it will just run down that if not

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.660 
down it will just run down that if not
we<00:00:33.250> can<00:00:33.280> work<00:00:33.610> around<00:00:33.730> it<00:00:35.219> let's<00:00:36.219> see<00:00:36.430> what<00:00:36.610> do

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
we can work around it let's see what do

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.639 
we can work around it let's see what do
I<00:00:36.760> like<00:00:37.000> about<00:00:37.030> the<00:00:37.390> whoopee<00:00:37.660> sling<00:00:37.930> so<00:00:38.170> far<00:00:38.440> is

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
I like about the whoopee sling so far is

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.390 
I like about the whoopee sling so far is
the<00:00:39.580> fact<00:00:39.820> it's<00:00:40.060> easier<00:00:40.480> to<00:00:40.960> adjust<00:00:41.320> than<00:00:42.190> the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
the fact it's easier to adjust than the

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.290 
the fact it's easier to adjust than the
straps<00:00:42.730> what<00:00:43.480> I<00:00:43.510> mean<00:00:43.840> by<00:00:43.900> that<00:00:44.080> is<00:00:44.620> that<00:00:45.300> it

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
straps what I mean by that is that it

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.030 
straps what I mean by that is that it
seemed<00:00:46.570> like<00:00:46.720> the<00:00:46.840> strap<00:00:47.110> buckle<00:00:47.530> always<00:00:47.860> got

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
seemed like the strap buckle always got

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.980 
seemed like the strap buckle always got
too<00:00:48.280> tight<00:00:48.520> even<00:00:49.090> before<00:00:49.180> I<00:00:49.360> even<00:00:49.480> laid<00:00:49.780> in<00:00:49.960> it

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:49.990 
too tight even before I even laid in it

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.040 
too tight even before I even laid in it
and<00:00:50.260> I<00:00:51.100> was<00:00:51.340> there<00:00:51.579> fussing<00:00:52.060> with<00:00:52.210> it<00:00:52.239> loosen

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
and I was there fussing with it loosen

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.410 
and I was there fussing with it loosen
it<00:00:53.140> up<00:00:53.260> maybe<00:00:53.829> after<00:00:54.310> a<00:00:54.340> couple<00:00:54.430> times<00:00:55.000> using

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
it up maybe after a couple times using

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.000 
it up maybe after a couple times using
it<00:00:55.600> more<00:00:55.750> probably<00:00:56.230> with<00:00:56.350> loosen<00:00:56.680> up<00:00:56.800> a<00:00:56.890> little

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
it more probably with loosen up a little

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.520 
it more probably with loosen up a little
bit<00:00:57.190> more<00:00:57.370> I<00:00:57.880> might<00:00:58.420> have<00:00:58.540> found<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:01.750> little

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
bit more I might have found a little

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.679 
bit more I might have found a little
technique<00:01:03.370> to<00:01:03.520> doing<00:01:03.760> a<00:01:03.820> little<00:01:03.970> easier<00:01:04.269> but<00:01:04.449> I

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:04.689 
technique to doing a little easier but I

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:06.569 
technique to doing a little easier but I
like<00:01:05.500> the<00:01:05.530> fact<00:01:05.799> these<00:01:06.009> won't<00:01:06.220> be<00:01:06.310> Selene's

00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:06.579 
like the fact these won't be Selene's

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:09.300 
like the fact these won't be Selene's
take<00:01:06.790> up<00:01:06.939> less<00:01:07.149> space<00:01:07.180> and<00:01:07.829> they're<00:01:08.829> a<00:01:08.860> little

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
take up less space and they're a little

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.859 
take up less space and they're a little
lighter<00:01:11.100> he<00:01:12.100> took<00:01:12.520> my<00:01:12.700> I<00:01:12.729> said<00:01:13.240> eat<00:01:13.359> my<00:01:13.539> opinion

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
lighter he took my I said eat my opinion

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.279 
lighter he took my I said eat my opinion
easier<00:01:14.139> to<00:01:14.289> adjust<00:01:14.439> and<00:01:15.899> now<00:01:16.899> I<00:01:16.929> have<00:01:17.079> a<00:01:17.139> little

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
easier to adjust and now I have a little

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.849 
easier to adjust and now I have a little
more<00:01:17.499> room<00:01:17.740> in<00:01:17.950> my<00:01:19.079> pouch<00:01:20.079> it's<00:01:20.350> behind<00:01:20.649> me

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:20.859 
more room in my pouch it's behind me

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:24.419 
more room in my pouch it's behind me
here<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:22.240> way<00:01:22.389> I<00:01:22.420> can<00:01:22.619> actually<00:01:23.619> probably

00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:24.429 
here that way I can actually probably

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:26.660 
here that way I can actually probably
store<00:01:24.850> my<00:01:25.030> bug<00:01:25.240> netting<00:01:25.509> and<00:01:25.719> air<00:01:25.929> to<00:01:26.139> with<00:01:26.350> my

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
store my bug netting and air to with my

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.340 
store my bug netting and air to with my
panic<00:01:27.670> in<00:01:27.880> the<00:01:27.939> summer<00:01:28.719> months<00:01:28.959> and<00:01:29.259> the

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
to readjust the whoopee sling at least

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.059 
to readjust the whoopee sling at least
on<00:01:39.520> this<00:01:39.670> end<00:01:39.909> right<00:01:40.029> now<00:01:40.090> I<00:01:40.270> can<00:01:40.539> see<00:01:44.069> because

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:45.069 
on this end right now I can see because

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:48.120 
on this end right now I can see because
I<00:01:45.340> got<00:01:45.490> so<00:01:46.029> much<00:01:46.240> material<00:01:46.450> it's<00:01:47.200> on<00:01:47.439> what<00:01:48.100> I

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
I got so much material it's on what I

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.830 
I got so much material it's on what I
got<00:01:48.399> more<00:01:48.579> material<00:01:48.939> on<00:01:48.999> one<00:01:49.209> side<00:01:49.479> and<00:01:49.509> I<00:01:49.659> have

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
got more material on one side and I have

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.510 
got more material on one side and I have
on<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.139> other<00:01:50.259> right<00:01:50.829> now<00:01:50.859> so<00:01:51.189> it's<00:01:51.369> not

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
on the other right now so it's not

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.599 
on the other right now so it's not
centered<00:01:51.999> with<00:01:52.719> the<00:01:52.749> hammock<00:01:53.259> itself<00:01:53.709> I'd

00:01:54.599 --> 00:01:54.609 
centered with the hammock itself I'd

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:56.339 
centered with the hammock itself I'd
naturally<00:01:55.119> feel<00:01:55.299> that<00:01:55.509> in<00:01:55.630> my<00:01:55.719> shoulders<00:01:56.170> if

00:01:56.339 --> 00:01:56.349 
naturally feel that in my shoulders if

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:59.279 
naturally feel that in my shoulders if
you<00:01:56.529> understand<00:01:56.889> what<00:01:56.979> I<00:01:57.069> mean<00:01:57.099> I<00:01:58.139> feel<00:01:59.139> more

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
you understand what I mean I feel more

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.170 
you understand what I mean I feel more
lopsided<00:02:00.240> so

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
lopsided so

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:12.210 
lopsided so
but<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:06.369> oh<00:02:09.630> why<00:02:10.630> did<00:02:10.959> I<00:02:11.050> even<00:02:11.080> think<00:02:11.830> about<00:02:12.010> not

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
but it oh why did I even think about not

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.120 
but it oh why did I even think about not
even<00:02:12.700> trying<00:02:13.209> hammocks<00:02:13.780> for<00:02:13.989> a<00:02:14.050> while<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.620> was

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
even trying hammocks for a while I was

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.620 
even trying hammocks for a while I was
so<00:02:17.040> reluctant<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.430> try<00:02:18.760> you<00:02:19.150> know<00:02:19.269> I<00:02:19.300> thought

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
so reluctant to try you know I thought

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.180 
so reluctant to try you know I thought
it<00:02:19.780> would<00:02:19.900> be<00:02:19.989> more<00:02:20.200> of<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.410> pain<00:02:20.680> in<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:20.890> butt

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
it would be more of a pain in the butt
