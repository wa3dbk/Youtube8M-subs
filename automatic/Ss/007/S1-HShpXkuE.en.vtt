are partially hidden let me show you but

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.089 
are partially hidden let me show you but
see<00:00:09.389> that's<00:00:10.290> where<00:00:10.469> they<00:00:10.559> go<00:00:10.710> they<00:00:10.889> go<00:00:10.920> in

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
see that's where they go they go in

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.259 
see that's where they go they go in
there<00:00:11.280> okay<00:00:11.670> anyhow<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:12.870> then<00:00:13.049> over<00:00:13.679> here<00:00:13.710> is

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:14.269 
there okay anyhow and then over here is

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.620 
there okay anyhow and then over here is
another<00:00:15.269> battery<00:00:15.690> compartment<00:00:16.260> where<00:00:16.560> the

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
another battery compartment where the

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.840 
another battery compartment where the
positive<00:00:18.630> terminal<00:00:19.130> right<00:00:20.130> here<00:00:20.369> along<00:00:20.820> with

metal completing the circuit opposite
the<00:00:27.599> other<00:00:27.840> end<00:00:28.109> here<00:00:28.500> which<00:00:28.740> has<00:00:29.130> an

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
the other end here which has an

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.939 
the other end here which has an
individual<00:00:29.970> circuit<00:00:30.390> meaning<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.679> first

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
individual circuit meaning the the first

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.200 
individual circuit meaning the the first
the<00:00:32.130> spring<00:00:32.399> there<00:00:32.640> what<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:32.910> see<00:00:33.059> is<00:00:33.180> a

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
the spring there what you see is a

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.080 
the spring there what you see is a
negative<00:00:33.450> side<00:00:33.870> versus<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.670> in<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.910> back

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
negative side versus the in the back

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.610 
negative side versus the in the back
there<00:00:36.300> that's<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.600> positive<00:00:36.809> side<00:00:37.290> okay<00:00:37.559> so

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
there that's the positive side okay so

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.860 
there that's the positive side okay so
this<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:38.040> where<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:39.149> would<00:00:39.239> have<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.480> radio

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
this is where you would have a radio

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.200 
this is where you would have a radio
where<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.920> one<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.219> court<00:00:41.520> goes<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.120> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
where the this one the court goes in the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.779 
where the this one the court goes in the
back<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:43.680> would<00:00:43.860> be<00:00:43.890> four<00:00:44.190> batteries<00:00:44.550> in

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
back and this would be four batteries in

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.420 
back and this would be four batteries in
here<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.329> giving<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.200> approximately<00:00:46.890> six

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
here and giving you approximately six

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.709 
here and giving you approximately six
volts<00:00:47.789> okay<00:00:48.649> if<00:00:49.649> you're<00:00:49.829> using<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.480> standard<00:00:51.480> d

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719

sometimes<00:02:10.260> this<00:02:10.590> little<00:02:10.950> switch<00:02:11.190> will<00:02:11.730> get

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
sometimes this little switch will get

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.710 
sometimes this little switch will get
stuck<00:02:12.990> and<00:02:13.460> once<00:02:14.460> you<00:02:14.670> release<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.210> plug<00:02:15.480> it

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
stuck and once you release the plug it

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.420 
stuck and once you release the plug it
will<00:02:15.840> stay<00:02:16.080> in<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.290> down<00:02:16.440> position<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:17.310> you

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
will stay in the down position and you

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.310 
will stay in the down position and you
may<00:02:17.580> need<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.910> get<00:02:18.120> in<00:02:18.270> there<00:02:18.990> with<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.140> little

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
may need to get in there with a little

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.950 
may need to get in there with a little
tiny<00:02:19.560> screwdriver<00:02:20.070> and<00:02:20.340> pry<00:02:20.660> this<00:02:21.660> will

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
tiny screwdriver and pry this will

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.380 
tiny screwdriver and pry this will
switch<00:02:22.230> out<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:23.250> engage<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.760> better<00:02:23.910> circuit

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
switch out to engage the better circuit

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.140 
switch out to engage the better circuit
so<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.540> may<00:02:24.840> be<00:02:24.900> an<00:02:25.080> issue<00:02:25.260> for<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:26.150> but

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
so that may be an issue for you but

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.940 
so that may be an issue for you but
that's<00:02:27.240> just<00:02:27.750> showing<00:02:27.990> you<00:02:28.140> how<00:02:28.350> that<00:02:28.530> would

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
that's just showing you how that would

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.270 
that's just showing you how that would
work<00:02:30.170> ok<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:31.230> anyway<00:02:31.440> so<00:02:31.650> now<00:02:31.860> we<00:02:31.920> have<00:02:31.980> this

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
work ok so anyway so now we have this

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.750 
work ok so anyway so now we have this
unit<00:02:32.610> here<00:02:32.850> now<00:02:33.860> when<00:02:34.860> inserting<00:02:35.340> batteries

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
unit here now when inserting batteries

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.550 
unit here now when inserting batteries
into<00:02:37.280> bat<00:02:38.280> boom<00:02:39.000> boxes<00:02:39.390> here<00:02:39.660> you<00:02:40.230> may<00:02:40.350> come

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
into bat boom boxes here you may come

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.110 
into bat boom boxes here you may come
across<00:02:40.590> a<00:02:40.890> battery<00:02:41.220> compartment<00:02:41.850> is<00:02:41.940> like

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
across a battery compartment is like

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.650 
across a battery compartment is like
this<00:02:42.590> which<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:44.520> batteries<00:02:44.880> go<00:02:45.060> in<00:02:45.270> this<00:02:45.600> side

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
this which the batteries go in this side

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.710 
this which the batteries go in this side
it<00:02:46.350> takes<00:02:46.620> six<00:02:46.890> batteries<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.550> there<00:02:48.300> is<00:02:48.420> one

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
it takes six batteries and there is one

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.320 
it takes six batteries and there is one
showing<00:02:49.020> here<00:02:49.350> but<00:02:49.500> it's<00:02:49.620> hidden<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:50.280> if<00:02:51.120> you

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
showing here but it's hidden and if you

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.140 
showing here but it's hidden and if you
look<00:02:51.570> did<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:52.620> see<00:02:52.680> or<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.550> goes<00:02:53.670> down<00:02:53.880> here

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
look did you see or it goes down here

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.850 
look did you see or it goes down here
this<00:02:54.360> side<00:02:54.600> so<00:02:54.810> what<00:02:54.930> you<00:02:55.020> mean<00:02:55.170> is<00:02:55.230> made<00:02:55.680> you

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
this side so what you mean is made you

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.300 
this side so what you mean is made you
do<00:02:56.130> it<00:02:56.400> simply<00:02:57.180> take<00:02:57.570> your<00:02:58.880> take<00:02:59.880> your<00:03:01.310> find

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
do it simply take your take your find

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.080 
do it simply take your take your find
yourself<00:03:02.670> a<00:03:03.140> regular<00:03:04.140> pencil<00:03:04.820> that<00:03:05.820> has<00:03:06.060> a

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
yourself a regular pencil that has a

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.980 
yourself a regular pencil that has a
pencil<00:03:06.840> eraser<00:03:06.930> on<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.830> end<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.820> red<00:03:09.000> one<00:03:09.240> you

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
pencil eraser on the end the red one you

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:12.620 
pencil eraser on the end the red one you
can<00:03:10.170> use<00:03:10.380> that<00:03:10.620> but<00:03:10.920> it<00:03:11.090> it<00:03:12.090> tends<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.450> wear

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
can use that but it it tends to wear

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.710 
can use that but it it tends to wear
away<00:03:12.780> rather<00:03:13.080> quickly<00:03:13.940> and<00:03:14.940> maybe<00:03:15.360> leave<00:03:15.690> a

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
away rather quickly and maybe leave a

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.810 
away rather quickly and maybe leave a
little<00:03:16.080> pieces<00:03:16.470> of<00:03:16.620> rubber<00:03:16.770> inside<00:03:17.220> or<00:03:17.550> if<00:03:17.700> you

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
little pieces of rubber inside or if you

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.090 
little pieces of rubber inside or if you
can<00:03:17.970> find<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.570> white<00:03:19.050> I<00:03:19.290> don't<00:03:19.500> have<00:03:19.650> one<00:03:19.830> here

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
can find the white I don't have one here

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.490 
can find the white I don't have one here
but<00:03:20.340> this<00:03:21.209> was<00:03:21.510> white<00:03:21.840> but<00:03:22.550> get<00:03:23.550> a<00:03:23.580> white

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
but this was white but get a white

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.770 
but this was white but get a white
pencil<00:03:25.500> eraser<00:03:25.950> which<00:03:26.220> is<00:03:26.400> used<00:03:26.850> for<00:03:27.060> erasing

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
pencil eraser which is used for erasing

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.560 
pencil eraser which is used for erasing
ink<00:03:28.320> and<00:03:28.680> therefore<00:03:29.670> it<00:03:29.730> is<00:03:29.820> more<00:03:30.000> durable<00:03:30.300> and

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570 
ink and therefore it is more durable and

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.540 
ink and therefore it is more durable and
does<00:03:30.750> not<00:03:30.900> erase<00:03:31.230> away<00:03:31.440> or<00:03:32.100> does<00:03:32.220> not<00:03:32.370> wear

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
does not erase away or does not wear

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.670 
does not erase away or does not wear
away<00:03:32.670> as<00:03:32.940> fast<00:03:33.300> as<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.660> red<00:03:34.200> rubber<00:03:34.380> but

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
away as fast as the red rubber but

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.699 
away as fast as the red rubber but
anyways<00:03:34.890> use<00:03:35.580> that<00:03:35.820> to<00:03:36.030> clean<00:03:36.330> your<00:03:37.260> battery

throw away as soon as I come but this is

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.460 
throw away as soon as I come but this is
what<00:04:06.209> you<00:04:06.360> would<00:04:06.450> do<00:04:06.600> is<00:04:06.750> you<00:04:06.780> would<00:04:06.900> these

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
what you would do is you would these

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.870 
what you would do is you would these
would<00:04:07.709> leak<00:04:07.920> at<00:04:08.070> the<00:04:08.100> end<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:10.489> this<00:04:11.489> wouldn't

would leak at the end and this wouldn't

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.550 
would leak at the end and this wouldn't
anyway<00:04:12.180> but<00:04:12.600> they<00:04:12.900> would<00:04:13.050> leak<00:04:13.260> and<00:04:13.470> they

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.110 
anyway but they would leak and they
would<00:04:13.800> corrode<00:04:14.070> this<00:04:14.370> and<00:04:14.550> they<00:04:14.610> would<00:04:14.730> have<00:04:15.090> a

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
would corrode this and they would have a

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.610 
would corrode this and they would have a
bad<00:04:15.360> connection<00:04:15.600> still<00:04:16.109> there<00:04:16.230> for<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:16.530> would

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
bad connection still there for you would

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.360 
bad connection still there for you would
need<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:16.859> clean<00:04:17.100> that

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
need to clean that

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.180 
need to clean that
then<00:04:18.940> over<00:04:19.479> here<00:04:19.510> is<00:04:19.959> another<00:04:20.229> battery

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
then over here is another battery

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.010 
then over here is another battery
compartment<00:04:21.820> where<00:04:22.000> it<00:04:22.419> doesn't<00:04:22.900> necessarily

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
compartment where it doesn't necessarily

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.920 
compartment where it doesn't necessarily
show<00:04:23.590> but<00:04:24.190> this<00:04:24.850> would<00:04:25.030> be<00:04:25.060> the<00:04:25.270> positive<00:04:25.449> side

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
show but this would be the positive side

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.950 
show but this would be the positive side
or<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:27.430> side<00:04:27.639> that<00:04:27.850> you<00:04:27.970> would<00:04:28.120> put<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.570> top

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
or the side that you would put the top

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.110 
or the side that you would put the top
of<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.169> battery<00:04:29.470> to<00:04:29.800> like<00:04:30.550> this<00:04:30.760> and<00:04:31.060> this

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
of the battery to like this and this

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.600 
of the battery to like this and this
would<00:04:31.330> be<00:04:31.360> the<00:04:31.720> negative<00:04:32.470> side<00:04:32.889> or<00:04:33.220> with<00:04:33.580> a

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
would be the negative side or with a

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.640 
would be the negative side or with a
flat<00:04:33.910> side<00:04:34.180> where<00:04:34.389> you<00:04:34.479> put<00:04:34.720> the<00:04:34.870> the<00:04:35.410> flat

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
flat side where you put the the flat

flat side where you put the the flat
bottom<00:04:35.949> against<00:04:36.460> the<00:04:36.520> spring<00:04:36.790> that's

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389 
bottom against the spring that's

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:39.420 
bottom against the spring that's

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
well let's see going back to the first

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.040 
well let's see going back to the first
radio<00:04:45.790> here<00:04:46.030> that<00:04:46.180> I<00:04:46.240> showed<00:04:46.479> you<00:04:46.600> that<00:04:46.840> had

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
radio here that I showed you that had

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.860 
radio here that I showed you that had
just<00:04:47.380> a<00:04:47.880> sec<00:04:48.880> let<00:04:49.060> me<00:04:49.120> throw<00:04:49.360> this<00:04:49.479> back<00:04:49.690> up

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
just a sec let me throw this back up

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.390 
just a sec let me throw this back up
here<00:04:50.050> this<00:04:50.680> one<00:04:50.919> here<00:04:50.949> which<00:04:51.340> has<00:04:51.550> a<00:04:51.900> flat

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
here this one here which has a flat

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.560 
here this one here which has a flat
doesn't<00:04:54.400> have<00:04:54.610> a<00:04:54.639> spring<00:04:54.910> and<00:04:55.090> actually<00:04:55.360> just

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
doesn't have a spring and actually just

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.540 
doesn't have a spring and actually just
a<00:04:55.660> sprung<00:04:56.110> piece<00:04:56.530> of<00:04:56.710> flat<00:04:57.010> metal<00:04:57.220> you<00:04:57.430> may

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
a sprung piece of flat metal you may

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.020 
a sprung piece of flat metal you may
want<00:04:57.729> to<00:04:57.760> use<00:04:57.820> that<00:04:57.940> or<00:04:58.360> that's<00:04:59.260> anyway<00:04:59.919> so<00:05:00.760> and

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
want to use that or that's anyway so and

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.060 
want to use that or that's anyway so and
then<00:05:01.210> you<00:05:01.360> may<00:05:01.479> also<00:05:01.660> come<00:05:01.870> across<00:05:02.110> a<00:05:02.470> battery

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
then you may also come across a battery

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.090 
then you may also come across a battery
compartment<00:05:03.669> where<00:05:03.960> the<00:05:04.960> one<00:05:05.560> there's<00:05:06.039> one

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
compartment where the one there's one

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.060 
compartment where the one there's one
battery<00:05:06.610> hidden<00:05:07.000> one<00:05:07.240> level<00:05:07.720> down<00:05:07.960> as<00:05:08.770> you<00:05:09.010> can

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
battery hidden one level down as you can

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.620 
battery hidden one level down as you can
see<00:05:09.220> this<00:05:09.430> one<00:05:09.580> here<00:05:09.610> just<00:05:09.910> takes<00:05:10.090> one<00:05:10.300> battery

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
see this one here just takes one battery

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.520 
see this one here just takes one battery
down<00:05:11.320> level<00:05:11.770> and<00:05:11.979> then<00:05:12.610> it<00:05:12.729> takes<00:05:13.320> then<00:05:14.320> the

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
down level and then it takes then the

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.520 
down level and then it takes then the
other<00:05:14.650> battery<00:05:15.010> is<00:05:15.220> hidden<00:05:16.150> down<00:05:16.810> and<00:05:17.289> in

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
other battery is hidden down and in

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.980 
other battery is hidden down and in
there<00:05:17.979> can<00:05:18.160> you<00:05:18.220> see<00:05:18.370> that<00:05:18.520> okay<00:05:19.120> so<00:05:19.780> then<00:05:19.900> we

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
there can you see that okay so then we

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.390 
there can you see that okay so then we
have<00:05:20.110> like<00:05:20.260> that<00:05:20.470> and<00:05:20.830> then<00:05:22.229> there's<00:05:23.229> another

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
have like that and then there's another

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.820 
have like that and then there's another
battery<00:05:24.400> compartment<00:05:25.000> on<00:05:25.260> another<00:05:26.260> boom<00:05:26.590> box

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
battery compartment on another boom box

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.180 
battery compartment on another boom box
where<00:05:27.160> the<00:05:27.820> batteries<00:05:28.090> are<00:05:28.270> hidden<00:05:28.479> see<00:05:28.960> they

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
where the batteries are hidden see they

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.020 
where the batteries are hidden see they
actually<00:05:30.190> have<00:05:30.310> the<00:05:30.400> power<00:05:30.610> cord<00:05:30.910> in<00:05:31.000> there

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030 
actually have the power cord in there

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.890 
actually have the power cord in there
but<00:05:32.010> those<00:05:33.010> terminals<00:05:33.490> may<00:05:33.700> become<00:05:34.090> dirty<00:05:34.750> at

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
but those terminals may become dirty at

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.779 
but those terminals may become dirty at
one<00:05:35.110> point<00:05:35.349> and<00:05:35.710> you<00:05:35.800> may<00:05:35.919> need<00:05:36.070> to<00:05:36.250> clean<00:05:36.520> them

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:36.789 
one point and you may need to clean them

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:39.570 
one point and you may need to clean them
as<00:05:36.940> well<00:05:37.120> and<00:05:37.479> then<00:05:38.410> lastly<00:05:38.860> I<00:05:38.979> guess<00:05:39.310> when

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
as well and then lastly I guess when

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.680 
as well and then lastly I guess when
purchasing<00:05:40.389> batteries<00:05:41.550> try<00:05:42.550> to<00:05:42.610> not<00:05:43.120> purchase

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
purchasing batteries try to not purchase

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.260 
purchasing batteries try to not purchase
batteries<00:05:44.380> that<00:05:44.650> come<00:05:44.919> in<00:05:45.370> a<00:05:45.490> blister<00:05:46.030> packs

that is half plastic and cardboard as

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.540 
that is half plastic and cardboard as
these<00:05:49.960> tend<00:05:50.410> to<00:05:50.710> not<00:05:51.130> last<00:05:51.520> as<00:05:51.970> long<00:05:52.229> as

these tend to not last as long as
batteries<00:05:54.550> you<00:05:54.789> may<00:05:54.910> find<00:05:55.240> in<00:05:55.599> a<00:05:57.030> complete

plaque these tend to last a lot longer

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:08.159 
plaque these tend to last a lot longer
because<00:06:05.680> there<00:06:06.010> are<00:06:06.130> more<00:06:06.160> airtight<00:06:06.990> than<00:06:07.990> the

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.169 
because there are more airtight than the

because there are more airtight than the
other<00:06:08.320> packages<00:06:08.830> so<00:06:09.729> that's<00:06:09.970> about<00:06:10.150> all<00:06:10.180> I<00:06:10.360> can

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:10.389 
other packages so that's about all I can
