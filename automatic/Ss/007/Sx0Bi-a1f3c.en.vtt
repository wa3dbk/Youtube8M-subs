00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
so this concert could not be more

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.330

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.609 

I<00:01:35.850> think<00:01:36.850> using<00:01:37.150> shenandoah<00:01:37.840> on<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.079> 9/11

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.289 
I think using shenandoah on the 9/11
memorial<00:01:39.009> concert<00:01:39.250> was<00:01:39.579> so<00:01:39.759> appropriate

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
memorial concert was so appropriate

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.170 
memorial concert was so appropriate
because<00:01:40.420> it<00:01:40.840> speaks<00:01:41.200> to<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.890> warm<00:01:42.490> reach<00:01:43.000> of

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
because it speaks to the warm reach of

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.260 
because it speaks to the warm reach of
our<00:01:43.329> history<00:01:43.840> and<00:01:44.320> it<00:01:44.920> speaks<00:01:45.189> also<00:01:45.490> to<00:01:46.060> the

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
our history and it speaks also to the

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.690 
our history and it speaks also to the
heart<00:01:46.540> of<00:01:46.600> America<00:01:47.140> that's<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:48.040> language<00:01:48.280> of
