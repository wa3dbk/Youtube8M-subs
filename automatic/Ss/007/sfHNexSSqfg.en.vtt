first what we're gonna do to do between

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.929 
first what we're gonna do to do between
is<00:00:23.820> we<00:00:24.359> start<00:00:24.630> out<00:00:24.779> with<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.019> blank<00:00:25.380> top<00:00:25.590> with<00:00:25.830> a

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
is we start out with a blank top with a

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.029 
is we start out with a blank top with a
whatever<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.269> wanted<00:00:27.539> between<00:00:27.779> I'll<00:00:28.710> just

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
whatever you wanted between I'll just

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:38.340 
whatever you wanted between I'll just
make<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:30.859> stick<00:00:31.859> person

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.660 

okay<00:00:39.070> and<00:00:39.820> a<00:00:40.000> lot<00:00:40.210> of<00:00:40.920> flash<00:00:41.920> is<00:00:42.250> made<00:00:42.460> with

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
okay and a lot of flash is made with

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.200 
okay and a lot of flash is made with
tweening<00:00:43.590> because<00:00:44.590> it's<00:00:44.980> makes<00:00:45.880> the<00:00:46.000> file

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
tweening because it's makes the file

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.210 
tweening because it's makes the file
size<00:00:46.510> smaller<00:00:46.960> if<00:00:47.230> your<00:00:47.350> Flash<00:00:47.559> document<00:00:48.040> says

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
size smaller if your Flash document says

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.440 
size smaller if your Flash document says
and<00:00:48.520> it's<00:00:48.760> really<00:00:49.000> easy

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.450

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.749 
to be moved from here to here without
looking<00:01:28.119> choppy<00:01:28.720> from<00:01:29.200> animation<00:01:29.649> so<00:01:30.580> what

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
looking choppy from animation so what

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.850 
looking choppy from animation so what
we're<00:01:30.850> gonna<00:01:30.910> do<00:01:31.180> is<00:01:31.539> I<00:01:31.930> wanted<00:01:32.259> to<00:01:32.320> do<00:01:32.590> it<00:01:32.740> in

we're gonna do is I wanted to do it in
let's<00:01:33.190> say<00:01:33.310> one<00:01:33.550> second<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:35.470> it's<00:01:35.890> about<00:01:36.039> 12

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
let's say one second so it's about 12

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:38.960 
let's say one second so it's about 12
frames<00:01:36.640> per<00:01:36.970> second<00:01:37.390> so<00:01:37.600> if<00:01:38.259> we<00:01:38.380> go<00:01:38.500> to<00:01:38.530> frame

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
frames per second so if we go to frame

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:46.609 
frames per second so if we go to frame
12<00:01:40.740> that'll<00:01:41.740> be<00:01:41.860> about<00:01:42.160> a<00:01:42.340> second<00:01:42.939> I<00:01:43.030> go<00:01:43.900> to<00:01:43.960> 10

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.399 

insert<00:01:47.619> keyframe<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:49.270> now<00:01:49.479> on<00:01:49.720> this<00:01:49.900> key<00:01:50.140> for

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
insert keyframe and now on this key for

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:51.890 
insert keyframe and now on this key for
him<00:01:50.500> you're<00:01:51.040> going<00:01:51.189> to<00:01:51.250> move<00:01:51.400> your<00:01:51.580> character

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
go I want mine to go right here so then

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.810 
go I want mine to go right here so then
we're<00:01:58.240> gonna<00:01:58.329> highlight<00:01:58.659> the<00:01:59.590> first<00:01:59.829> part<00:02:00.700> of

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
it and then that one keyframe at the end

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.469 
it and then that one keyframe at the end
right<00:02:04.299> click<00:02:04.750> create<00:02:05.530> motion<00:02:05.860> tween<00:02:06.100> so<00:02:06.759> now

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
right click create motion tween so now

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.020 
right click create motion tween so now
when<00:02:07.600> we<00:02:07.630> press<00:02:07.869> ENTER<00:02:09.660> he<00:02:10.660> slides<00:02:10.989> over<00:02:11.230> there

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
so now let's make him rotate so this

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.400 
so now let's make him rotate so this
last<00:02:16.140> um<00:02:17.400> frame<00:02:18.400> selected<00:02:18.940> gonna<00:02:19.810> rotate<00:02:19.989> him

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
last um frame selected gonna rotate him

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.030 
last um frame selected gonna rotate him
like<00:02:20.590> this<00:02:21.329> now<00:02:22.329> we<00:02:22.390> press<00:02:22.690> Enter<00:02:23.079> he<00:02:23.590> rotates

slides nicely without choppy animation

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.290 
slides nicely without choppy animation
it'll<00:02:55.370> might<00:02:55.519> look<00:02:55.700> choppy<00:02:55.940> when<00:02:56.180> you're

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
it'll might look choppy when you're

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.619 
the way over to there I'll make a
keyframe<00:03:06.379> about<00:03:06.830> two<00:03:07.040> frames<00:03:07.340> away<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:08.450> last

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
keyframe about two frames away the last

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.640 
keyframe about two frames away the last
frame<00:03:08.900> I'll<00:03:09.019> move<00:03:09.230> him<00:03:10.030> rotate<00:03:11.030> him<00:03:11.560> here<00:03:12.560> we

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.080 
frame I'll move him rotate him here we
go<00:03:13.840> and<00:03:15.069> it's<00:03:16.069> that<00:03:16.250> simple<00:03:16.459> and<00:03:16.879> then<00:03:16.970> when

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
go and it's that simple and then when

regular animation right click remove

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.740 
regular animation right click remove
tween<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:23.840> then<00:03:24.230> you<00:03:24.319> could<00:03:24.470> just<00:03:24.650> do<00:03:25.750> press

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
tween and then you could just do press

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.530 
tween and then you could just do press
f6<00:03:27.200> or<00:03:27.440> f7<00:03:27.950> make<00:03:28.160> a<00:03:28.190> regular<00:03:28.400> flick<00:03:28.880> frame<00:03:29.239> and

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
f6 or f7 make a regular flick frame and

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:37.780 
f6 or f7 make a regular flick frame and
it<00:03:29.989> tween<00:03:30.950> will<00:03:31.160> be<00:03:31.250> off<00:03:32.590> easy<00:03:33.590> as<00:03:33.799> that<00:03:36.790> so

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
it tween will be off easy as that so

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.580 
it tween will be off easy as that so
here's<00:03:38.360> what<00:03:38.510> I<00:03:38.599> got<00:03:38.750> I<00:03:38.810> have<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.290> tweening

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
here's what I got I have the tweening

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.000 
here's what I got I have the tweening
here<00:03:40.480> rotating<00:03:41.480> it<00:03:41.569> to<00:03:41.660> the<00:03:41.780> middle<00:03:42.010> between

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
here rotating it to the middle between

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.699 
here rotating it to the middle between
there<00:03:43.459> and<00:03:43.489> then<00:03:43.819> this<00:03:43.910> is<00:03:44.060> without<00:03:44.180> tween

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
there and then this is without tween

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.680 
there and then this is without tween
like<00:03:45.709> what<00:03:45.890> you<00:03:45.980> just<00:03:46.010> saw<00:03:46.450> alright<00:03:47.450> well
