00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.560
 of a more or less as well 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.450

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.950
 plastic and it seems that according to take 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.380
 students pretty now if you do not 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.660

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.880
 before, like they are the ones that are right now 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.500
 and this award that I did not give my son in 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.210
 cells I was using it would be called me 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.070
 I had one of those when it was more and I 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.990
 like they 're going right now it's yellow 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.850
 then like they are generally 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.799
 cute teachers and they are very comfortable and 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.620
 they have all the colors in this case 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.989
 are you to call transparent and cas and with 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.990
 shines as I hope you can detail 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.150
 there sometimes are quite simple 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.360
 employ a very peculiar light touch and that 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.400
 nothing more 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.400
 and with classic style 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:08.649
 equally number 4 we have 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:12.479
 today is the running shoes 

00:05:08.649 --> 00:05:12.479
 without shoes 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:21.429
 but you do not want you to use the love of 

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:24.099
 they are really beautiful and remember 

00:05:21.429 --> 00:05:27.129
 that is not the piece but that it is the world 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:29.409
 in total with the very simple thing and you 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:32.610
 it is only but then says as 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:32.610
 that when he hides it 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:45.520
 at the tip angle as quite 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:49.710
 this class 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.710

 that I showed that open person does not 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:41.500

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.500
 four but if I have to do 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:51.410
