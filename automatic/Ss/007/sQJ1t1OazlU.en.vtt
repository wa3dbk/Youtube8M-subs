the fingers if you don't really know

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.569 
the fingers if you don't really know
these<00:00:34.230> chords<00:00:34.530> are<00:00:34.620> having<00:00:34.980> trouble<00:00:35.399> still

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
these chords are having trouble still

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.299 
these chords are having trouble still
making<00:00:35.880> some<00:00:36.000> of<00:00:36.059> your<00:00:36.270> court<00:00:36.480> switches<00:00:37.309> look

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
making some of your court switches look

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.100 
making some of your court switches look
through<00:00:38.520> my<00:00:38.640> channel<00:00:38.850> there's<00:00:39.180> some<00:00:39.390> good

exercises and lessons for just working
on<00:00:42.300> some<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.750> these<00:00:43.230> switches<00:00:43.829> for<00:00:44.070> an<00:00:44.160> F

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
on some of the these switches for an F

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.700 
on some of the these switches for an F
chord<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.879> minor<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.390> C<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.690> stuff<00:00:45.930> okay

chord and a minor and C and stuff okay

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.190 
chord and a minor and C and stuff okay
so<00:00:46.860> first<00:00:47.070> let's<00:00:47.280> go<00:00:47.370> take<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> look<00:00:47.760> at<00:00:48.200> the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
so first let's go take a look at the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.840 
so first let's go take a look at the
right<00:00:49.410> hand<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.920> if<00:00:50.430> we<00:00:50.579> were<00:00:50.700> going<00:00:50.789> to

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
right hand and if we were going to

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.160 
right hand and if we were going to
finger<00:00:51.180> pick<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.449> we're<00:00:51.600> basically<00:00:51.870> going<00:00:52.110> to

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
finger pick it we're basically going to

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.900 
finger pick it we're basically going to
do<00:00:52.289> each<00:00:52.440> chord<00:00:52.770> that's<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.190> same<00:00:53.430> way<00:00:53.640> for

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
do each chord that's the same way for

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.189 
do each chord that's the same way for
the<00:00:53.969> most<00:00:54.149> part<00:00:54.390> we'll<00:00:54.539> take<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> minor

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
the most part we'll take the a minor

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.110 
the most part we'll take the a minor
chord<00:00:55.410> first<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.280> we're<00:00:56.399> going<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.579> go<00:00:56.730> thumb

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
chord first and we're going to go thumb

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.000 
chord first and we're going to go thumb
on<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.329> fifth<00:00:57.570> string<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.109> thumb<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.829> then

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
on the fifth string the thumb is then

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.500 
on the fifth string the thumb is then
going<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.250> move<00:00:59.460> back<00:00:59.699> down<00:00:59.730> to<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.239> fourth

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
going to move back down to the fourth

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.830 
going to move back down to the fourth
string<00:01:00.809> then<00:01:01.500> we're<00:01:01.649> going<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:01.800> go<00:01:01.980> index<00:01:02.460> on

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
string then we're going to go index on

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.020 
string then we're going to go index on
the<00:01:03.840> third<00:01:04.080> middle<00:01:04.680> on<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.860> second<00:01:05.309> ring<00:01:05.850> on

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
the third middle on the second ring on

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.670 
the third middle on the second ring on
the<00:01:06.390> first<00:01:06.750> string<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.170> then<00:01:07.380> we're<00:01:07.500> going<00:01:07.590> to

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
the first string and then we're going to

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.039 
the first string and then we're going to
come<00:01:07.830> back<00:01:07.860> it's<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.790> 6/8<00:01:09.330> time<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.930> we're

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
come back it's in 6/8 time and we're

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.840 
come back it's in 6/8 time and we're
almost<00:01:10.229> playing<00:01:10.710> just<00:01:11.010> eighth<00:01:11.189> notes<00:01:11.460> except

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
almost playing just eighth notes except

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.490 
almost playing just eighth notes except
there'll<00:01:12.060> be<00:01:12.090> two<00:01:12.360> sixteenth<00:01:12.960> notes<00:01:13.229> on<00:01:13.439> beat

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
there'll be two sixteenth notes on beat

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.070 
there'll be two sixteenth notes on beat
two<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.070> we're<00:01:14.189> going<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.369> go<00:01:14.490> one<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.119> A<00:01:15.900> three

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
two so we're going to go one and A three

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.120 
two so we're going to go one and A three
one<00:01:16.590> two<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:19.290> bit<00:01:19.500> string<00:01:19.740> will<00:01:20.009> be

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
one two and so a that bit string will be

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.760 
one two and so a that bit string will be
beat<00:01:20.340> one<00:01:20.549> two<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.810> N<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.229> two<00:01:22.380> sixteenth

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
beat one two and the N the two sixteenth

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.560 
beat one two and the N the two sixteenth
notes<00:01:23.009> will<00:01:23.189> be<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.790> fourth<00:01:24.060> string<00:01:24.360> with

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
notes will be the fourth string with

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.660 
notes will be the fourth string with
your<00:01:24.600> thumb<00:01:24.750> again<00:01:25.200> then<00:01:25.740> your<00:01:25.979> index<00:01:26.310> playing

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
your thumb again then your index playing

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.070 
your thumb again then your index playing
the<00:01:26.820> third<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.570> we're<00:01:27.659> going<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.840> go<00:01:27.930> one<00:01:28.229> two

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
the third so we're going to go one two

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.380 
the third so we're going to go one two
and<00:01:29.530> then<00:01:30.100> b3<00:01:30.580> will<00:01:30.760> just<00:01:30.970> be<00:01:31.090> your<00:01:31.240> middle

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
and then b3 will just be your middle

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.450 
and then b3 will just be your middle
finger<00:01:31.690> on<00:01:31.720> the<00:01:31.870> second<00:01:32.200> string<00:01:32.230> b4<00:01:33.160> will<00:01:33.340> be

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
finger on the second string b4 will be

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.340 
finger on the second string b4 will be
your<00:01:33.700> ring<00:01:33.910> finger<00:01:34.300> on<00:01:34.480> the<00:01:34.540> first<00:01:35.260> string

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
your ring finger on the first string

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.620 
your ring finger on the first string
then<00:01:36.040> you'll<00:01:36.250> come<00:01:36.430> back<00:01:36.460> for<00:01:36.640> b5<00:01:37.210> to<00:01:37.510> the

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
then you'll come back for b5 to the

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.300 
then you'll come back for b5 to the
second<00:01:37.960> string<00:01:38.080> with<00:01:38.290> the<00:01:38.380> middle<00:01:38.620> and<00:01:38.770> then

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
second string with the middle and then

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.410 
second string with the middle and then
index<00:01:39.790> on<00:01:40.390> the<00:01:41.080> third<00:01:41.110> for<00:01:41.500> b6<00:01:41.860> so<00:01:42.010> we<00:01:42.130> have<00:01:42.310> 1<00:01:42.880> 2

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
index on the third for b6 so we have 1 2

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.790 

so<00:01:50.930> we're<00:01:51.050> just<00:01:51.080> going<00:01:51.320> 5<00:01:51.980> 4<00:01:52.580> 3<00:01:52.820> 2<00:01:53.150> 1<00:01:53.570> 2<00:01:54.050> 3<00:01:54.530> that

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.570 
so we're just going 5 4 3 2 1 2 3 that

would be the strings 5 4 3 2 1 2 3 and

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.550 
would be the strings 5 4 3 2 1 2 3 and
our<00:01:58.970> thumb<00:01:59.180> is<00:01:59.360> playing<00:01:59.540> both<00:01:59.900> the<00:02:00.080> 5<00:02:00.290> and<00:02:00.500> the

our thumb is playing both the 5 and the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.130 
our thumb is playing both the 5 and the
4<00:02:00.590> then<00:02:01.430> the<00:02:01.640> index<00:02:01.970> has<00:02:02.150> a<00:02:02.180> third<00:02:02.450> middle<00:02:02.990> has

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.790 
4 then the index has a third middle has
a<00:02:03.170> second<00:02:03.680> ring<00:02:04.400> has<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.700> first

a second ring has the first

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.120 
a second ring has the first
then<00:02:07.370> we<00:02:07.490> go<00:02:07.610> to<00:02:07.640> our<00:02:07.760> C<00:02:08.090> chord<00:02:08.620> so<00:02:09.620> again<00:02:09.890> there

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
then we go to our C chord so again there

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.980 
then we go to our C chord so again there
was<00:02:10.280> our<00:02:10.400> a<00:02:10.430> minor<00:02:10.850> and<00:02:11.210> our<00:02:11.300> C<00:02:11.570> we<00:02:11.720> move<00:02:11.870> the

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
was our a minor and our C we move the

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.170 
was our a minor and our C we move the
third<00:02:12.170> finger<00:02:12.410> up<00:02:12.710> all<00:02:13.160> right<00:02:13.280> we'll<00:02:13.820> play<00:02:13.970> the

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
third finger up all right we'll play the

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.610 
third finger up all right we'll play the
exact<00:02:14.600> same

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
exact same

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.510

pattern<00:02:17.370> when<00:02:18.300> we<00:02:18.420> move<00:02:18.599> to<00:02:18.629> our<00:02:18.930> décor

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
pattern when we move to our décor

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.370 
pattern when we move to our décor
the<00:02:21.150> pattern<00:02:21.480> will<00:02:21.570> change<00:02:21.600> is<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.080> little

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
the pattern will change is the little

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.780 
the pattern will change is the little
tiny<00:02:22.560> bit<00:02:22.770> let's<00:02:22.950> actually<00:02:23.070> the<00:02:23.250> same<00:02:23.430> pattern

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
tiny bit let's actually the same pattern

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.920 
tiny bit let's actually the same pattern
but<00:02:23.820> because<00:02:24.330> there<00:02:24.450> are<00:02:24.480> thumbs<00:02:24.720> going<00:02:24.840> to

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
but because there are thumbs going to

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.120 
but because there are thumbs going to
move<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.290> D<00:02:25.500> string<00:02:25.560> we're<00:02:25.860> going<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:26.040> play

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
move to the D string we're going to play

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.850 
move to the D string we're going to play
the<00:02:26.250> D<00:02:26.430> twice<00:02:26.850> so<00:02:27.630> we're<00:02:27.750> going<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:27.930> go<00:02:28.020> one<00:02:28.350> two

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
the D twice so we're going to go one two

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.610 
the D twice so we're going to go one two
and<00:02:28.890> three<00:02:29.460> four<00:02:29.820> five<00:02:30.180> six<00:02:30.510> so<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.350> thumb<00:02:31.530> is

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
and three four five six so the thumb is

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.470 
and three four five six so the thumb is
going<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:31.800> play<00:02:31.920> D<00:02:32.160> twice<00:02:32.490> then<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.030> index<00:02:33.330> is

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
going to play D twice then the index is

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.820 
going to play D twice then the index is
still<00:02:33.570> looking<00:02:33.930> after<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.290> third<00:02:34.500> middle

still has the second ring still has the

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.140 
still has the second ring still has the
first

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.600 

all<00:02:39.720> right<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.080> then<00:02:40.290> for<00:02:40.530> our<00:02:40.590> big<00:02:40.980> barred<00:02:41.280> F

all right and then for our big barred F

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.970 
all right and then for our big barred F
chord<00:02:43.459> our<00:02:44.459> thumb<00:02:44.819> will<00:02:44.970> come<00:02:45.150> back<00:02:45.299> to<00:02:45.540> six

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
chord our thumb will come back to six

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.949 
chord our thumb will come back to six
the<00:02:46.980> thumb<00:02:47.190> will<00:02:47.340> look<00:02:47.489> after<00:02:47.610> six<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.360> four

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
the thumb will look after six and four

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.330 
the thumb will look after six and four
we're<00:02:49.170> going<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.349> have<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.470> bit<00:02:49.620> of<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.830> jump

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
we're going to have a bit of a jump

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.949 
we're going to have a bit of a jump
there<00:02:50.549> a<00:02:50.580> string<00:02:50.909> skin<00:02:51.209> we're<00:02:51.629> going<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.810> leave

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
there a string skin we're going to leave

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.539 
there a string skin we're going to leave
out<00:02:52.170> five<00:02:52.470> and<00:02:52.799> then<00:02:53.010> everything<00:02:53.310> else<00:02:53.400> would

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
out five and then everything else would

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.819 
out five and then everything else would
be<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.760> same<00:02:54.239> so<00:02:54.450> we'll<00:02:54.540> go<00:02:54.690> thumb<00:02:54.959> from<00:02:55.500> six

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
be the same so we'll go thumb from six

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.130 
be the same so we'll go thumb from six
to<00:02:56.040> more<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.670> then<00:02:56.879> index<00:02:57.239> place<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.840> three

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
to more and then index place the three

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.740 
to more and then index place the three
middle<00:02:58.739> plays<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.310> two<00:02:59.489> again<00:02:59.819> ring<00:03:00.450> plays

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
middle plays the two again ring plays

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.470 
middle plays the two again ring plays
the<00:03:00.959> one<00:03:01.110> so<00:03:01.319> we<00:03:01.440> have<00:03:04.730> so<00:03:05.730> that<00:03:05.879> first<00:03:06.120> line<00:03:06.329> is

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
the one so we have so that first line is

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.920 
the one so we have so that first line is
a<00:03:06.599> minor

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
a minor

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.920 
a minor
the

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
the

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.080 
the
d<00:03:11.760> we<00:03:12.760> hit<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.090> D<00:03:13.269> twice<00:03:13.599> f<00:03:14.849> then<00:03:15.849> we're<00:03:15.970> going

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
d we hit the D twice f then we're going

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.729 
d we hit the D twice f then we're going

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
to go back to a minor C and then e 7

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:37.229 
to go back to a minor C and then e 7
twice<00:03:20.980> and<00:03:21.280> E<00:03:32.310> 754<00:03:34.379> 6<00:03:35.379> 2<00:03:35.500> 4<00:03:35.769> then<00:03:36.430> again<00:03:36.760> index

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
twice and E 754 6 2 4 then again index

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.490

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
on three middle on two ring on one so

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.899 
on three middle on two ring on one so
the<00:03:41.620> exact<00:03:41.920> same<00:03:41.950> way<00:03:42.310> you'll<00:03:42.459> actually<00:03:42.609> do

the exact same way you'll actually do

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:48.180 
the exact same way you'll actually do
that<00:03:43.060> measure<00:03:43.299> twice<00:03:44.819> and<00:03:46.620> then<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.650> next

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
that measure twice and then the next

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.680 
that measure twice and then the next
line<00:03:48.340> is<00:03:48.579> the<00:03:48.670> same<00:03:48.819> as<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.000> first<00:03:49.180> line<00:03:49.450> a
