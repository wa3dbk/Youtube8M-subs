00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.500
 with FC Twente and Heerenveen for the competition and FC Utrecht for the cup 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.500
 an important and tough week is coming for the FC 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:13.459
 the groningers resumed the second half of the season last Tuesday at the 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:16.899
 difficult but important 3 2 victory over the amateurs of genes 

00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:17.640
 but the 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.009
 also finds defender maikel kieftenbelt 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.739
 until the army in the leading group, but then you get the ritual worthwhile 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:25.130
 I discovered it from him 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.579
 yes it might come to essent yes then it should not be worth it 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.269
 and because of that it turned out to be a bit difficult but thinks in particular 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.270
 NestlÃ© just wants well played 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.630
 fc groningen therefore plays against reigning Dutch champion on Sunday afternoon in the Euroborg 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.840
 FC Twente 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.840
 the tukkers are in place two and three points and before the fc 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.380
 the first encounter this season ended in a 4 2 victory for FC 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.530
 twente 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.550
 jamaica won the competition but yes 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.100
 then also felt because this year we just have a good team where we do that art 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.370
 und there can still be a surprise 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.170
 year an hour of playing at home so think it turned out to be a big advantage from it 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.170
 season 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.830
 yes everyone is very confident that we are there now too 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.450
 on three points 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.790
 trainer pieter huistra certainly sees opportunities against twente on Sunday 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.880
 years from dordrecht said after that match I was satisfied with it 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.650
 a new gained football we also just were an equal I thought 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.730
 and twente the goals with a lot of times with the gave up but have 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.940
 show that they can compete with the current national champion 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.120
 playing football after gives a lot of confidence and this team 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.780
 and that means I have a lot of faith for Sunday too 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.810
 fc groningen will play at fc utrecht this wednesday to the quarterfinals of 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.730
 the cup 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.730
 and next Sunday the away game against sc heerenveen will follow 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.990
 important matches 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.870
 that is clear that his twenthe utrecht for the cup and heerenveen 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:54.300
 those are the three games again the rest of the season after a little can 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.660
 sit down 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.750
 verbeek it is clear the test is about a competition that you have to win 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.270
 and for the competition its own have six points to score against direct 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.070
 competitors so yes important 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.070
 The first purchase for next season has already arrived for FC Groningen 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.909
 matias jones comes for 750,000 euros from the electorate they now bio there 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:19.049
 jones will be coming to the euroborg in the summer of 2011 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.529
 But FC Emmen also has a possibility of a possible this 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:24.479
 transfer period 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:25.959
 yes it is one 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.190
 then fall that have for the coming weeks, the right side but on 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:32.349
 I can also play at the overall umbrella party position 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.139
 restaur the players a fast player it is still a young boy 19 years 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:38.909
 and thus 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.309
 in it is a player who will also need some time if we forget 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:44.189
 not coming 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:46.779
 enough reason other side of the world 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:50.599
 but they understand that we also got him for a five year moody period 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:55.249
 and they let him have some time to get involved 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:57.249
 to fit here am in the Netherlands 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:02:59.129
 henry the spire groningen 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.819
 the rumors about a possible departure from Davis and Matavz are 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.179
 present 

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:07.249
 the transfer period officially runs until January 31 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.489
 expected hans nijland director there were still transfers 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.189
 so says concrete 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:17.450
 Something that is serious about it is that is not being discussed at the moment 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:19.299
 can hardly be any different 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:22.420
 it is also unclear for pieter huistra whether there will still be players 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:23.389
 sold 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:27.489
 but I still hope that there will be no transfers in the future 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:31.839
 yes of course you never know what kind of clubs with what for 

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:35.169
 bottom bids and are they coming 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:39.169
 so it is still exciting until the deadline for the transfer window 

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:43.499
 kapanook fc groningen is playing on Sunday with kan fisker karma 

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:46.239
 fits the basis against FC Twente 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.669
 tim sparv is still suspended 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:51.479
 the match starts at half past two and is led by the referee 

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:52.279
 jan away
