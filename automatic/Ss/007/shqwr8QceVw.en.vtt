00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:43.749
 to need the mashed potatoes that 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:46.929
 sold in cans all year round in the 

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:50.139
 very economic supermarket we are going to 

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:55.179
 need cinnamon powder milk 

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:57.510
 evaporated and condensed milk the most 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:01:01.239
 little one you meet and not two 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.750
 eggs and of course a base for 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.820
 do 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.460
 to do all this not the cookie and 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.460
 is that everyone known in this 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.050
 container let's put our two 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.530
 eggs 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:19.479
 it seems that operate two new eggs there 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.820
 is an egg two eggs and the best of 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:26.170
 all this is feels that we do not need 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:30.040
 not even one of a blender's 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.600
 those devices that help us beat 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.780
 all that no no no no no we do it here 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.030
 all by hand for a teaspoon not 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.390
 we need nothing so do not worry 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:43.570
 If you do not have that for her hand gift 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.149
 daughter gorder and so easy in this 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.840
 container we are going to pour all the 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.950
 contents of the tin can pumpkin 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.590
 mashed potatoes 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.850
 and here is this is very nice people and 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.969
 it will be much better since it is 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.600
 prepared is a dessert that practically 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:06.399
 in an hour you do not have ready in an hour 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:13.209
 including the time it will be in 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:16.180
 the egg is almost here 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.330
 to mix very well a little and that 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.700
 mix this 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.670
 as I say there is no need for 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.010
 let's have an electric mixer for 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.870
 nothing if you want to use it much better 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.900
 I do not like to use it because then 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.900
 I really do not need to use it 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:43.350
 then let's put 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:47.910
 the evaporated milk can all 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.910
 also mix 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.329
 if you have the consistency left 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.069
 totally well liquid then yes 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.709
 you're going to have to use a blender 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.719
 electric in your blender do not you want 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.989
 if you do not follow the advice that I am 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:05.120
 giving you do not use absolutely anything 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.599
 because a few minutes here 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.599
 mediating 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.569
 to be then let's put a 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.569
 teaspoon net 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:23.299
 cinnamon powder one the two not me 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.879
 quite like cinnamon two to this 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:31.159
 now I tell them enough people use 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:33.469
 sugar they put about a cup 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:37.219
 of sugar I do not put a cup of 

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:41.239
 sugar because because the puree of the mash 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:43.579
 of the pumpkin has milk sugar 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.290
 evaporated here in some sugar and the 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.180
 condensed milk has a lot of 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.609
 sugar so if you do not want to use 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.040
 condensed milk you do not have for some 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:56.120
 reason then one or a half is used 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:59.980
 sugar cup you put it there and everything 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.980
 ready because now 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.140
 all right 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.840
 this is optional you can still put 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:13.430
 a little more maybe a quarter cup 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:16.310
 Half a cup of milk milk forgiveness 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.829
 normal says it takes and you milk is 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.620
 I only put if you want 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.330
 putting it on is ideal if there is not you 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.580
 here this is optional 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.500
 then since we have this here then 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:32.479
 little by little we will be putting the milk 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:35.810
 condensed but it is the one that gives the sweet 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:38.900
 with this it will be super sweet our 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.789
 country 'of need new pumpkin 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.750
 to put more sugar because with this 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:47.110
 It's going to be enough too sweet 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.090
 I would say 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.560
 from time to time the candy to me 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.560
 I love I love I love it 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.240
 we have to have a little patience 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:03.470
 with condensed milk because it costs a 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:06.500
 little in leaving his kitten but everything goes 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.660
 they can all be put on it if they want 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.310
 if not then 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.920
 I 'm not going to put everything because for me 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.920
 it's too sweet so this one 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:23.170
 everything ready 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:23.170
 we already mix very well then 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.110
 all right 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.950
 what we are going to do is this mixture 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.790
 let's warn her in it 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:41.130
 in the mold to make the bread you know 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.470
 what is a big cookie here what 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.540
 we will put everything we have left everything 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:49.640
 how can you see the consistency that 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.640
 where as well as very very liquid 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.400
 here I have mixture to make two 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.520
 countries so here I stay for 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:02.259
 prepare another one, we have it ready 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:05.590
 Now we're going to put it in the oven for 450 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:07.870
 degrees fahrenheit for 15 minutes after 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:12.759
 of those 15 minutes we're going to download our 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:16.229
 oven at 350 degrees for 45 minutes and 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:16.229
 then we will see how it was 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:26.090
 after one hour and 15 minutes 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:29.930
 approximately in the oven at 450 degrees 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:33.740
 the first 15 minutes and 350 the 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:35.810
 last one hour approximately here 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:39.380
 we have the final product a pack of 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:42.710
 pumpkin that smells exquisite it 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:45.350
 they will ask why does this have this 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.060
 these brands here is because also a 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:49.730
 method that I use to know if I already 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.800
 is ready is I put a knife or a 

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:54.050
 fork in the middle of the country and the knife 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.230
 and the fork come out completely clean 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.790
 that indicates that it is already cooked 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.590
 perfectly this country of this is not 

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.750

 with your fingers and with great care and 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:07.520
 those screams are going to close 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:10.760
 completely they are left completely 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.500
