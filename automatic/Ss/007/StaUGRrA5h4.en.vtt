00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.469
 Alexander I would like to talk today 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.330
 on sand that annoys you stand 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.670
 at the traffic lights you start to get under way 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.520
 and then there is a squeak you do not understand 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.570
 you or your neighbor nevertheless many 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.160
 drivers have heard this squeak what it is 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.619
 why does it occur and how much is it 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.570
 seriously but arises but at the moment 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.240
 swearing a car on a mechanical 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.750
 squeeze gearboxes 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.670
 clutch squeeze and when it moves 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.829
 car you miss him a little 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.370
 in order to move naturally release 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:45.100
 the bearing with the order is in contact with 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.500
 twisting elements of the kit itself 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.230
 clutch baskets themselves and at this moment 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.829
 if there is a huge wear that is 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.110
 or shimming a special bearing 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.000
 the bearing itself does not rotate 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.010
 stops the basket continues on 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.129
 motor rotates naturally occurs 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.770
 this one sleeps squeak if you have this one 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.299
 squeal when shifting the 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.890
 there is a moment of squeezing the clutch 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:13.430
 says that 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.229
 Pro starts wear itself already a lot 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.540
 bearing or in some moments 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.729
 even wedging itself is already a lot 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.920
 Bearing quite a large number 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.940
 drivers when there is such 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.830
 squeak and screech 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.259
 still continues to drive its 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.940
 car and delay repair time 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.710
 how serious is it 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.930
 to panic when there is such 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.700
 the problem is definitely worth panicking 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.590
 for the simple reason that the release case 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.110
 bearing finally jam 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:45.440
 it can damage the clutch basket and 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.720
 happens in the worst cases it breaks down with 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.420
 the seat bursts can 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.820
 damage as the case box as 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.530
 primary shaft box guide 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.539
 primary shaft that is, but with such 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.820
 moments better not to tighten better 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:02.320
 play it safe in advance 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.369
 experts so that they listened checked 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.940
 We made sure it did not 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.009
 problem 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.090
 the question naturally arises drivers 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.330
 who are facing such a problem 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.640
 for the first time how quickly this one is solved 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.769
 problem is a problem when we address 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.110
 on that first speed 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.810
 such a repair plan it all depends on 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.350
 car brand's presence of these 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.010
 parts by runtime 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.590
 work performed but 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.489
 maximally maximize this day there 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.290
 as much as possible everything depends on 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.970
 car brand on some 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.459
 cars this issue is solved by 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.739
 working there for three to four hours and 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.200
 the car left already in good condition 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.420
 state of replacement there let's say something already 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.120
 the entire clutch kit on 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.370
 some cars 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.980
 account for some details just 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.690
 ordering something not for all cars 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.750
 there is this presence happens that 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.879
 maximum time a couple of days a day 2 then 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.640
 There is this in principle and we solve it 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:04.129
 very quickly questions we conclude if 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.230
 you had a squeal during that 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:09.079
 when you squeeze the clutch then this 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.670
 the problem does not need to be delayed for a long time 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:13.040
 it is necessary to solve this problem because 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.129
 bearing replacement after all is a lot of it 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.409
 much cheaper than quite right well 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:21.109
 how else can you disprove this 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:24.109
 release bearing factor 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:26.000
 wears out usually somewhere on average 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.829
 cars at that moment when already 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.829
 suitable replacement of the kit itself 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:33.950
 clutch somewhere order roughly speaking 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:36.530
 plus or minus about 100 thousand mileage as 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:40.220
 to dismantle the box volume of work does not 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.680
 small and as if finances are already on 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.019
 some cars are not cheap thing i 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.340
 I recommend to change in this repair 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:50.090
 full clutch kit 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.980

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.780

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.519
 zig no this is a difficult repair and 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:01.220
 restoration of the car body after 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.049
