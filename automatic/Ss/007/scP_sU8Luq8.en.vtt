electro-voice Indy 457 a there's a
little<00:00:08.970> screw<00:00:09.210> down<00:00:09.389> here<00:00:09.599> next<00:00:09.719> to<00:00:09.929> the

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
little screw down here next to the

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.459 
little screw down here next to the
bottom<00:00:11.780> and<00:00:12.780> I<00:00:12.870> took<00:00:12.960> this<00:00:13.259> little

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
bottom and I took this little

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.770 
bottom and I took this little
screwdriver<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.429> ground<00:00:15.030> it<00:00:15.179> on<00:00:15.299> each<00:00:15.450> side

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
screwdriver and I ground it on each side

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.529 
screwdriver and I ground it on each side
so<00:00:16.440> it<00:00:16.560> fits<00:00:16.770> in<00:00:16.949> here<00:00:17.720> you<00:00:18.720> turn<00:00:18.960> it

so it fits in here you turn it

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:24.980 
so it fits in here you turn it
counterclockwise<00:00:21.539> just<00:00:23.689> like<00:00:24.689> you're<00:00:24.840> taking

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
counterclockwise just like you're taking

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.580 
counterclockwise just like you're taking
out<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.289> screw

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.220 

take<00:00:32.590> needlenose<00:00:32.980> you<00:00:33.370> pull<00:00:33.610> this<00:00:33.700> out

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.360 

careful<00:00:38.230> it<00:00:38.290> don't<00:00:38.410> jerk<00:00:38.739> the<00:00:38.890> wires<00:00:39.100> and

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
careful it don't jerk the wires and

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.979 
careful it don't jerk the wires and
there's<00:00:39.520> the<00:00:39.670> wires<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:43.059> this<00:00:43.210> screw<00:00:43.600> right

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
there's the wires and this screw right

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.350 
there's the wires and this screw right
there's<00:00:44.950> a<00:00:45.070> screw<00:00:45.370> and<00:00:45.550> it's<00:00:45.700> got<00:00:45.850> a<00:00:45.880> left<00:00:46.120> hand

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
there's a screw and it's got a left hand

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.119 
there's a screw and it's got a left hand
thread<00:00:46.660> so<00:00:47.309> when<00:00:48.309> you<00:00:48.430> turn<00:00:48.670> it<00:00:49.440> out<00:00:50.440> it<00:00:50.890> really

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
thread so when you turn it out it really

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.040 
thread so when you turn it out it really
screws<00:00:51.309> in<00:00:51.640> and<00:00:51.850> when<00:00:51.940> you<00:00:52.030> screw<00:00:52.270> it<00:00:52.420> what<00:00:52.930> you

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
screws in and when you screw it what you

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.630 
screws in and when you screw it what you
normally<00:00:53.350> think<00:00:53.379> of<00:00:53.590> in<00:00:53.770> it<00:00:53.949> comes<00:00:54.160> out<00:00:54.400> and

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
normally think of in it comes out and

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.060 
normally think of in it comes out and

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
wedges against the inside of the thing

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.790 
wedges against the inside of the thing
I'm<00:00:57.879> not<00:00:57.940> gonna<00:00:58.239> pull<00:00:58.420> it<00:00:58.570> out<00:00:58.720> but<00:00:58.960> I'm<00:00:59.739> not

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
I'm not gonna pull it out but I'm not

sheet metal brass ring there's the other
end<00:02:44.540> of<00:02:44.600> our<00:02:44.750> wires

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.250 

one<00:02:52.150> wire<00:02:52.420> hooks<00:02:54.450> right<00:02:55.450> there<00:02:55.510> you<00:02:55.959> see<00:02:56.110> the

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
one wire hooks right there you see the

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.449 
one wire hooks right there you see the

this<00:03:00.580> needs<00:03:00.849> to<00:03:01.030> be<00:03:01.799> repaired<00:03:02.799> that's<00:03:03.159> my<00:03:03.310> kid

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
this needs to be repaired that's my kid

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.440 
this needs to be repaired that's my kid
I<00:03:03.549> think<00:03:03.849> a<00:03:03.970> rough<00:03:04.209> life<00:03:04.450> at<00:03:04.569> a<00:03:04.599> band<00:03:06.450> this

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
I think a rough life at a band this

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.589 
I think a rough life at a band this
looks<00:03:07.810> to<00:03:07.989> me<00:03:08.140> like<00:03:09.840> weather<00:03:10.840> stripping<00:03:12.599> and

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
looks to me like weather stripping and

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.759 
looks to me like weather stripping and
then<00:03:13.900> it's<00:03:14.019> glued<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.379> that<00:03:14.410> brass<00:03:14.769> ring<00:03:16.769> and

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
then it's glued to that brass ring and

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.170 
then it's glued to that brass ring and
with<00:03:17.920> some<00:03:18.160> other<00:03:18.340> kind<00:03:18.549> of<00:03:18.640> glue<00:03:18.819> they<00:03:18.970> had

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
with some other kind of glue they had

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:33.050 
with some other kind of glue they had
there<00:03:19.450> and<00:03:19.629> it's<00:03:19.750> all<00:03:19.870> dried<00:03:20.110> up<00:03:20.140> I<00:03:21.629> don't<00:03:22.629> know

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:53.840 

so<00:03:33.810> that's<00:03:34.020> the<00:03:34.200> inside<00:03:34.560> of<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.800> mic<00:03:52.670> this<00:03:53.670> is

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
so that's the inside of the mic this is

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.490 
so that's the inside of the mic this is
the<00:03:53.970> handle<00:03:55.130> that<00:03:56.130> slips<00:03:56.489> up<00:03:56.670> on<00:03:56.880> it<00:03:57.170> but<00:03:58.170> this

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
the handle that slips up on it but this

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.000 
the handle that slips up on it but this
is<00:03:58.739> all<00:03:59.010> just<00:03:59.690> the<00:04:00.690> it's<00:04:00.930> all<00:04:01.080> competences<00:04:01.800> I

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
is all just the it's all competences I

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.400 
is all just the it's all competences I
think<00:04:02.910> you<00:04:02.970> can<00:04:03.090> get<00:04:03.180> a<00:04:03.209> new<00:04:03.390> HAMP<00:04:03.630> handle<00:04:04.110> from

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
think you can get a new HAMP handle from

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.650 
think you can get a new HAMP handle from
the<00:04:06.590> place<00:04:07.590> called<00:04:07.860> full<00:04:08.160> compass<00:04:08.580> because<00:04:09.420> I

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
the place called full compass because I

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.210 
the place called full compass because I
think<00:04:09.720> this<00:04:09.989> is<00:04:10.170> still<00:04:10.290> a<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.590> current<00:04:10.800> handle

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
think this is still a the current handle

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.870 
think this is still a the current handle
even<00:04:11.400> though<00:04:11.580> this<00:04:11.700> is<00:04:11.880> an<00:04:12.000> old<00:04:13.130> microphone<00:04:14.130> so

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
even though this is an old microphone so

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.560 
even though this is an old microphone so
that's<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.150> nd<00:04:15.450> 457<00:04:16.410> a
