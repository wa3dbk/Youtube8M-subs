this car now this is a full function
remote<00:00:30.289> control<00:00:31.289> car<00:00:31.669> so<00:00:32.669> that's<00:00:32.820> forward

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
remote control car so that's forward

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.170 
remote control car so that's forward
backward<00:00:33.390> left<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.750> right<00:00:34.730> so<00:00:35.730> let's<00:00:35.850> open<00:00:35.969> it

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
road cones which I thought was pretty

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:47.580 
road cones which I thought was pretty
fun<00:01:40.479> idea<00:01:42.929> so<00:01:43.929> let's<00:01:44.079> give<00:01:44.229> it<00:01:44.259> a<00:01:44.350> run<00:01:46.590> just

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
fun idea so let's give it a run just

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.050 
fun idea so let's give it a run just
give<00:01:47.770> you<00:01:47.829> a<00:01:47.890> little<00:01:48.039> demonstration<00:01:48.429> of<00:01:48.939> how

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
give you a little demonstration of how

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.199 
give you a little demonstration of how
it<00:01:49.090> works<00:01:50.130> now<00:01:51.130> this<00:01:51.459> does<00:01:51.700> have<00:01:51.880> a<00:01:51.909> trim<00:01:52.179> on

00:01:52.199 --> 00:01:52.209 
it works now this does have a trim on

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:55.889 
it works now this does have a trim on
the<00:01:52.390> bottom<00:01:52.679> so<00:01:54.299> when<00:01:55.299> you<00:01:55.329> get<00:01:55.539> it<00:01:55.630> just<00:01:55.659> right

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
the bottom so when you get it just right

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.199 
the bottom so when you get it just right
this<00:01:56.289> thing<00:01:56.500> will<00:01:56.649> drive<00:01:56.890> perfectly<00:01:57.610> straight

00:01:58.199 --> 00:01:58.209 
this thing will drive perfectly straight

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:00.089 
this thing will drive perfectly straight
and<00:01:58.450> it<00:01:59.049> recovers<00:01:59.439> from<00:01:59.560> my<00:01:59.709> turn<00:01:59.890> very

00:02:00.089 --> 00:02:00.099
