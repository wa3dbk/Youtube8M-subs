00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:17.360 
the easy RFID model one except for it's

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.420 
the easy RFID model one except for it's
got<00:00:17.480> an<00:00:17.660> onboard<00:00:18.110> eeprom<00:00:18.560> on<00:00:18.800> it<00:00:18.920> save<00:00:19.280> your

card data off to after power off as well

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.600 
card data off to after power off as well
it<00:00:22.100> requires<00:00:22.220> a<00:00:23.770> sequential<00:00:24.770> code<00:00:25.130> sequence

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 
it requires a sequential code sequence

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.850 
it requires a sequential code sequence
to<00:00:25.760> enter<00:00:26.060> into<00:00:26.180> program<00:00:26.660> mode<00:00:26.690> so<00:00:27.530> that<00:00:27.560> no

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:27.860 
to enter into program mode so that no

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.410 
to enter into program mode so that no
normal<00:00:28.160> person<00:00:28.370> can<00:00:28.730> just<00:00:28.910> say<00:00:29.000> well<00:00:29.240> i'm

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
normal person can just say well i'm

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.770 
normal person can just say well i'm
going<00:00:29.540> to<00:00:29.630> program<00:00:29.960> in<00:00:30.140> four<00:00:30.380> new<00:00:30.530> cards<00:00:30.920> so

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:31.780 
going to program in four new cards so

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.709 
going to program in four new cards so
each<00:00:32.780> card<00:00:33.170> corresponds<00:00:33.829> to<00:00:34.070> an<00:00:34.190> output<00:00:34.309> relay

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:34.719 
each card corresponds to an output relay

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:38.349 
each card corresponds to an output relay
you've<00:00:35.719> programmed<00:00:36.050> them<00:00:36.440> in<00:00:36.680> separately<00:00:37.359> it

00:00:38.349 --> 00:00:38.359 
you've programmed them in separately it

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:39.849 
you've programmed them in separately it
comes<00:00:38.629> with<00:00:38.719> four<00:00:39.050> cards<00:00:39.379> but<00:00:39.469> you<00:00:39.559> can<00:00:39.710> use

00:00:39.849 --> 00:00:39.859 
comes with four cards but you can use

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:42.069 
comes with four cards but you can use
your<00:00:40.010> own<00:00:40.070> as<00:00:40.370> long<00:00:40.579> as<00:00:40.760> they're<00:00:40.999> 25<00:00:41.719> kilohertz

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
your own as long as they're 25 kilohertz

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.160 
your own as long as they're 25 kilohertz
cards<00:00:42.649> or<00:00:42.829> 125<00:00:43.370> kilohertz<00:00:43.789> cards<00:00:44.269> so<00:00:44.839> what<00:00:45.109> I'm

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
cards or 125 kilohertz cards so what I'm

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.340 
cards or 125 kilohertz cards so what I'm
going<00:00:45.260> to<00:00:45.320> do<00:00:45.440> is<00:00:45.589> I'll<00:00:45.739> show<00:00:46.010> you<00:00:47.079> I've<00:00:48.079> got

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
going to do is I'll show you I've got

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.910 
going to do is I'll show you I've got
the<00:00:48.670> outputs<00:00:49.670> hooked<00:00:49.850> up<00:00:49.999> to<00:00:50.120> LEDs<00:00:50.480> right<00:00:50.719> now

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
the outputs hooked up to LEDs right now

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.799 
the outputs hooked up to LEDs right now
you<00:00:51.920> know<00:00:52.039> what<00:00:52.129> happens<00:00:52.519> is<00:00:52.670> in<00:00:52.879> order<00:00:53.539> to<00:00:53.690> get

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
you know what happens is in order to get

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:55.989 
you know what happens is in order to get
it<00:00:53.899> right<00:00:54.199> now<00:00:54.379> it's<00:00:54.530> in<00:00:54.589> scanning<00:00:54.920> mode<00:00:55.190> so<00:00:55.819> in

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:55.999 
it right now it's in scanning mode so in

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:57.790 
it right now it's in scanning mode so in
order<00:00:56.179> to<00:00:56.300> get<00:00:56.420> into<00:00:56.629> program<00:00:57.019> mode<00:00:57.050> you<00:00:57.769> have

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
order to get into program mode you have

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.959 
order to get into program mode you have
to<00:00:58.249> press<00:00:58.699> the<00:00:58.879> buttons<00:00:59.179> 3422<00:01:00.170> 431<00:01:01.100> now<00:01:01.909> the

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
to press the buttons 3422 431 now the

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.990 
to press the buttons 3422 431 now the
buttons<00:01:02.449> are<00:01:02.629> labeled<00:01:03.019> down<00:01:03.409> here<00:01:04.010> so<00:01:04.820> let's

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
buttons are labeled down here so let's

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.240 
buttons are labeled down here so let's
enter<00:01:05.269> it<00:01:05.360> in<00:01:08.200> and<00:01:09.200> once<00:01:09.590> you<00:01:09.710> enter<00:01:10.009> in<00:01:10.100> that

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
enter it in and once you enter in that

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.950 
enter it in and once you enter in that
code<00:01:10.490> again<00:01:10.939> I'll<00:01:11.299> list<00:01:11.750> all<00:01:11.899> the

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
code again I'll list all the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.429 
code again I'll list all the

now<00:01:15.439> it's<00:01:15.619> a<00:01:15.710> programming<00:01:16.100> mode<00:01:16.340> now<00:01:16.939> this<00:01:17.119> is

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
now it's a programming mode now this is

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.010 
now it's a programming mode now this is
switch<00:01:17.509> three<00:01:17.869> four<00:01:18.829> two<00:01:19.369> and<00:01:19.610> one<00:01:19.909> so<00:01:20.719> again

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
switch three four two and one so again

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.179 
switch three four two and one so again
the<00:01:21.170> code<00:01:21.380> is<00:01:21.619> 3<00:01:22.610> 42<00:01:23.570> to<00:01:23.750> 43<00:01:24.079> one<00:01:24.380> that<00:01:25.100> will

you power the solenoid with one of the

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.030 
you power the solenoid with one of the
relays<00:03:26.060> solenoid<00:03:26.840> opens<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.680> door<00:03:27.830> and

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
relays solenoid opens the door and
