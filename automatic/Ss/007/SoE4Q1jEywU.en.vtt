00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.569 
post I don't think that those are
visible<00:03:57.230> in<00:03:57.319> any<00:03:57.530> of<00:03:57.680> those<00:03:57.799> devices<00:03:58.130> either

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
visible in any of those devices either

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.699 
visible in any of those devices either
so<00:03:59.180> you'll<00:03:59.450> probably<00:03:59.720> have<00:04:00.109> to<00:04:00.139> make<00:04:00.440> your<00:04:00.530> way

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
so you'll probably have to make your way

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.220 
so you'll probably have to make your way
to<00:04:00.769> your<00:04:01.010> laptop<00:04:01.250> or<00:04:01.579> your<00:04:01.639> desktop<00:04:02.180> to<00:04:02.930> see

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
to your laptop or your desktop to see

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.099 
to your laptop or your desktop to see
these<00:04:03.410> hang<00:04:03.739> out<00:04:03.970> reminders<00:04:04.970> so<00:04:05.540> I<00:04:05.840> think

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.109 
these hang out reminders so I think

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.220 
these hang out reminders so I think
