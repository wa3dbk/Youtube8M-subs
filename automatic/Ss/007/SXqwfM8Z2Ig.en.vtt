00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
blackberries since birds don't like

blackberries since birds don't like
shiny<00:00:06.660> objects<00:00:07.140> that<00:00:07.290> move<00:00:07.589> I<00:00:07.980> cut<00:00:08.580> some<00:00:08.760> mylar

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
shiny objects that move I cut some mylar

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.720 
shiny objects that move I cut some mylar
bags<00:00:09.389> into<00:00:09.719> strips<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.469> I<00:00:10.889> clip<00:00:11.219> them<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.610> the

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
bags into strips and I clip them to the

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.240 
bags into strips and I clip them to the
vines<00:00:11.969> with<00:00:12.330> some<00:00:12.360> clothes<00:00:12.809> pins<00:00:13.170> if<00:00:13.710> you

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
vines with some clothes pins if you

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.460 
vines with some clothes pins if you
don't<00:00:14.429> have<00:00:14.670> any<00:00:14.880> mylar<00:00:15.360> bags<00:00:15.690> I'm<00:00:16.049> sure<00:00:16.260> that

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
don't have any mylar bags I'm sure that

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.599 
don't have any mylar bags I'm sure that
you<00:00:16.590> could<00:00:16.740> cut<00:00:16.920> up<00:00:17.070> something<00:00:17.430> like<00:00:17.460> a

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
you could cut up something like a

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.970 
you could cut up something like a
Doritos<00:00:18.119> bag<00:00:18.510> they<00:00:18.900> have<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.289> mylar<00:00:19.650> on<00:00:19.859> the

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
Doritos bag they have the mylar on the

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.010 
Doritos bag they have the mylar on the
inside<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:21.210> should<00:00:21.449> work<00:00:21.480> just<00:00:21.660> fine

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
inside and that should work just fine

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.429 
inside and that should work just fine
people<00:00:22.980> used<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.400> hang<00:00:23.810> aluminum<00:00:24.810> pie<00:00:25.019> pans

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
people used to hang aluminum pie pans

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.259 
people used to hang aluminum pie pans
out<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.130> their<00:00:26.250> gardens<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.880> all<00:00:27.000> but<00:00:27.150> that

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
out and their gardens and all but that

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.609 
out and their gardens and all but that
just<00:00:27.420> doesn't<00:00:27.660> seem<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.019> work<00:00:28.140> on<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.410> birds

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
just doesn't seem to work on the birds

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.220 
just doesn't seem to work on the birds
anymore<00:00:28.949> for<00:00:29.310> some<00:00:29.490> reason<00:00:29.939> these<00:00:30.750> my<00:00:30.960> large

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
anymore for some reason these my large

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.650 
anymore for some reason these my large
strips<00:00:31.590> might<00:00:31.890> look<00:00:32.160> like<00:00:32.329> metallic<00:00:33.329> snakes

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
strips might look like metallic snakes

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.120 
strips might look like metallic snakes
to<00:00:33.870> them<00:00:34.020> or<00:00:34.170> something<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.620> don't<00:00:34.800> know<00:00:34.890> but<00:00:34.920> it

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
to them or something I don't know but it

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.459 
to them or something I don't know but it
has<00:00:35.160> sure<00:00:35.520> done<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.910> job<00:00:36.149> if<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:37.020> don't<00:00:37.230> have

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
has sure done the job if you don't have

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.560 
has sure done the job if you don't have
any<00:00:37.739> blackberry<00:00:38.219> vines<00:00:38.489> these<00:00:39.000> multiply

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
any blackberry vines these multiply

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.290 
any blackberry vines these multiply
rapidly<00:00:39.870> if<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.500> only<00:00:40.649> bought<00:00:40.950> one<00:00:41.120> you'd<00:00:42.120> get

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
rapidly if you only bought one you'd get

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.180 
rapidly if you only bought one you'd get
probably<00:00:42.780> six<00:00:43.140> coming<00:00:43.500> off<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.950> roots

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
probably six coming off of the roots

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.310 
probably six coming off of the roots
within<00:00:44.460> one<00:00:44.760> season<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.480> everywhere<00:00:46.289> that

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
within one season and everywhere that

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.950 
within one season and everywhere that
the<00:00:46.890> vine<00:00:47.190> touches<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.789> ground<00:00:48.059> it'll<00:00:48.780> take

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
the vine touches the ground it'll take

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.720 
the vine touches the ground it'll take
root<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.260> give<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.620> another<00:00:49.860> plant<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.579> no

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
root and give you another plant and no

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.100 
root and give you another plant and no
time<00:00:50.940> at<00:00:51.090> all<00:00:51.180> you'd<00:00:51.449> have<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.629> whole<00:00:51.870> lot<00:00:52.079> of

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
time at all you'd have a whole lot of

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.380 
time at all you'd have a whole lot of
vines<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:52.680> your<00:00:52.860> hands<00:00:53.219> if<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.850> don't<00:00:54.090> want

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
vines on your hands if you don't want

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.619 
vines on your hands if you don't want
them<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:55.140> multiply<00:00:56.129> like<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.670> then<00:00:57.239> you

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
them to multiply like that then you

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.330 
them to multiply like that then you
would<00:00:57.780> need<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.960> trellis<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.559> up<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.039> keep<00:00:59.160> them

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
would need a trellis it up and keep them

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.290 
would need a trellis it up and keep them
off<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.730> ground

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
off of the ground

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.900 
off of the ground
these<00:01:01.079> are<00:01:01.350> thornless<00:01:01.859> blackberries<00:01:02.640> and

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
these are thornless blackberries and

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.759 
these are thornless blackberries and
that's<00:01:03.390> nice<00:01:03.629> because<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:04.379> don't<00:01:04.470> have<00:01:04.619> to

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
that's nice because you don't have to

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.230 
that's nice because you don't have to
worry<00:01:04.920> about<00:01:05.040> getting<00:01:05.250> all<00:01:05.519> cut<00:01:05.880> up<00:01:05.909> when

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
worry about getting all cut up when

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.940 
worry about getting all cut up when
you're<00:01:06.390> in<00:01:06.510> there<00:01:06.689> picking<00:01:07.170> them<00:01:07.320> or<00:01:07.530> working

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
you're in there picking them or working

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.580 
you're in there picking them or working
on<00:01:08.130> them<00:01:08.450> the<00:01:09.450> berries<00:01:09.900> are<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.080> lot<00:01:10.350> bigger

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
on them the berries are a lot bigger

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.990 
on them the berries are a lot bigger
than<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.010> ones<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.549> get<00:01:11.640> out<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
than the ones that you get out of the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.760 
than the ones that you get out of the
wild<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.540> they<00:01:12.720> have<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.900> real<00:01:13.110> good<00:01:13.140> taste<00:01:13.560> to

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
wild and they have a real good taste to

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.730 
wild and they have a real good taste to
them<00:01:13.920> too<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.780> somebody<00:01:15.780> told<00:01:16.020> me<00:01:16.140> today<00:01:16.290> that

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740
