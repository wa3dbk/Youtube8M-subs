 after all, trifrukta perfectly match and 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.730
 It turns out very tasty in general for 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:02.060
 cake and used two large bananas 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:08.370
 4 kiwis and about 300 grams of strawberries 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:12.540
 I put the completion as the last part 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:16.320
 cream and smeared with cream on top and 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:21.090

 that one is covered with cream both on top and on the sides 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:31.860
 for decoration i use mastic but for 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.720
 It is necessary that our cream and hardened and 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.340
 because of this, the cake goes to 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:44.630
 refrigerator how to make mastic take 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:50.250
 the so-called shawl mark it 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:51.000
 microwaves finally melted our 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.120
 mastic 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.480
 add to it 100 grams of softened 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.700
 butter 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.790
 form mastic for this we need 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.620
 powdered sugar 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:10.580
 which I already sifted responsibly 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:12.600

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.600
 soak up icing sugar 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:20.989
 to live did not stick to somehow 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.989
 differently and form our arrays 

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:29.590
 to make mastic easier 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:31.199
 It is better to brush your hands with oil 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.490
 on the face 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:36.419
 formed a jump and now we will 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.419
 roll found 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.350
 3 bets 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:07.379
 oporto 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:13.949
 surplus 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:37.740
 and now billions bark 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:51.930
 add top gloss paint 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:53.870
 grease with oil for 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.330
 decor 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:06:06.270
 pink color told us to check and 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:08.660
 a heart has fallen I will indicate begin with 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.660
