minutes<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.859> game<00:00:25.890> now<00:00:26.849> you're<00:00:27.090> probably

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
minutes of the game now you're probably

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.970 
minutes of the game now you're probably
wondering<00:00:27.420> why<00:00:27.869> there's<00:00:28.140> no<00:00:28.320> sound<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.890> the

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
wondering why there's no sound to the

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.769 
wondering why there's no sound to the
game<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.490> because<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.849> used<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.390> ps4

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
game that is because I used the ps4

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.350 
game that is because I used the ps4
recording<00:00:31.740> feature<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.940> recording

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
recording feature and the recording

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.510 
recording feature and the recording
feature<00:00:33.480> does<00:00:33.960> not<00:00:33.989> have<00:00:34.500> any<00:00:34.800> sound<00:00:35.130> for

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
feature does not have any sound for

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.959 
feature does not have any sound for
whatever<00:00:35.700> reason<00:00:36.239> on<00:00:36.390> NBA<00:00:36.690> 2k14<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.950> this<00:00:38.820> is

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
whatever reason on NBA 2k14 and this is

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.639 
whatever reason on NBA 2k14 and this is
the<00:00:39.090> only<00:00:39.210> game<00:00:39.540> right<00:00:39.780> now<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:40.200> doesn't

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
the only game right now that doesn't

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:41.389 
the only game right now that doesn't
have<00:00:40.800> any<00:00:40.980> sound

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
have any sound

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.190 
have any sound
battlefield<00:00:42.000> 4<00:00:42.059> didn't<00:00:42.690> have<00:00:42.809> any<00:00:42.989> sound

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
battlefield 4 didn't have any sound

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.590 
battlefield 4 didn't have any sound
either<00:00:43.440> but<00:00:43.860> they<00:00:44.010> patched<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.579> they<00:00:45.059> fixed<00:00:45.510> it

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
either but they patched it they fixed it

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.880 
either but they patched it they fixed it
I<00:00:45.750> don't<00:00:45.930> know<00:00:46.020> if<00:00:46.110> they're<00:00:46.230> gonna<00:00:46.350> fix<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.770> for

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
I don't know if they're gonna fix it for

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.250 
I don't know if they're gonna fix it for
this<00:00:47.010> game<00:00:47.719> maybe<00:00:48.719> they<00:00:48.870> did<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.140> on<00:00:49.200> purpose

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
this game maybe they did it on purpose

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.860 
this game maybe they did it on purpose
I'm<00:00:49.980> guessing<00:00:50.520> because<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.180> music<00:00:51.480> on<00:00:51.780> the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
I'm guessing because of the music on the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.170 
I'm guessing because of the music on the
main<00:00:52.020> menu<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.649> know<00:00:53.070> they<00:00:53.250> have<00:00:53.430> copyrighted

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
main menu you know they have copyrighted

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.840 
main menu you know they have copyrighted
music<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:55.170> instead<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.590> talking<00:00:56.039> over<00:00:56.280> silence

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
music so instead of talking over silence

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.330 
music so instead of talking over silence
I<00:00:57.059> add<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.390> my<00:00:57.510> own<00:00:57.629> music<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.260> video<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:59.250> it

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
I add in my own music to the video so it

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.010 
I add in my own music to the video so it
wouldn't<00:00:59.579> be<00:00:59.670> boring<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.570> hope<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.870> don't

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
wouldn't be boring so I hope you don't

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.979 
wouldn't be boring so I hope you don't
mind<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.469> now<00:01:02.399> back<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.059> game

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
actually say his name differently every

actually say his name differently every
once<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.060> while<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.479> he'll<00:01:18.659> make<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.869> dunk

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
once in a while like he'll make a dunk

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.440 
once in a while like he'll make a dunk
and<00:01:19.350> they'll<00:01:19.500> be<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:19.770> Jonas<00:01:20.189> Valanciunas

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
and they'll be like Jonas Valanciunas

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.969 
and they'll be like Jonas Valanciunas
and<00:01:21.450> then<00:01:21.540> he'll<00:01:21.900> make<00:01:22.259> another<00:01:22.530> dunk<00:01:22.770> and

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.550 
and then he'll make another dunk and
you'll<00:01:23.070> say<00:01:23.250> valancy<00:01:23.820> Onis<00:01:24.180> i<00:01:24.420> don't<00:01:25.380> know<00:01:25.439> how

to<00:01:25.619> pronounce<00:01:25.920> his<00:01:26.100> name<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:26.970> guess<00:01:27.330> it's

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
to pronounce his name so I guess it's

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.840
