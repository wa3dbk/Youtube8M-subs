00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.400 
these I think I don't know there's
always<00:04:34.270> like<00:04:34.450> a<00:04:34.510> hidden<00:04:34.780> one<00:04:34.930> there's<00:04:35.350> like

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
always like a hidden one there's like

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.200 
always like a hidden one there's like
really<00:04:35.710> yeah<00:04:36.400> I<00:04:36.430> think<00:04:36.610> there's<00:04:36.790> like<00:04:36.850> four

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
really yeah I think there's like four

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.030 
really yeah I think there's like four
was<00:04:37.540> like<00:04:37.660> four<00:04:37.900> obvious<00:04:38.320> ones<00:04:38.590> and<00:04:38.860> I<00:04:38.950> was

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
was like four obvious ones and I was

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.080 
was like four obvious ones and I was
like<00:04:39.160> a<00:04:39.190> hidden<00:04:39.580> one<00:04:41.370> and<00:04:42.370> you<00:04:42.700> just<00:04:42.730> got<00:04:43.000> to

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
like a hidden one and you just got to

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.060

they're<00:04:45.370> purple<00:04:45.730> on<00:04:45.850> the<00:04:46.030> map<00:04:49.020> so<00:04:50.020> that's

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
they're purple on the map so that's

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:51.510 
they're purple on the map so that's
basically<00:04:50.290> it<00:04:50.590> and<00:04:50.889> then<00:04:51.040> you<00:04:51.190> come<00:04:51.340> across

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
like that I had to start from the

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.170 
like that I had to start from the
beginning<00:05:49.600> which<00:05:49.780> is<00:05:49.930> right<00:05:50.140> here<00:05:50.310> and<00:05:51.310> then

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
beginning which is right here and then

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.800 
beginning which is right here and then
pull<00:05:52.900> back<00:05:52.930> on<00:05:53.500> the<00:05:54.300> analog<00:05:55.300> stick<00:05:55.330> and<00:05:56.160> you

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
pull back on the analog stick and you

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.090 
pull back on the analog stick and you
won't<00:05:58.810> go<00:05:58.960> too<00:05:59.020> fast<00:05:59.350> like<00:05:59.710> right<00:05:59.889> there<00:06:00.039> I

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
won't go too fast like right there I

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.969 
won't go too fast like right there I
think<00:06:00.370> I'm<00:06:00.430> this<00:06:00.580> one<00:06:01.470> so<00:06:02.470> I'm<00:06:02.530> going<00:06:02.830> back

think I'm this one so I'm going back
just<00:06:05.979> got<00:06:06.100> to<00:06:06.190> be<00:06:06.250> really<00:06:06.370> careful<00:06:06.490> you<00:06:06.970> can

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
just got to be really careful you can
