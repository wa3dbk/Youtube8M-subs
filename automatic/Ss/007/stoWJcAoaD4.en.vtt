camps oh you're going down bitch see the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.219 
camps oh you're going down bitch see the
reason<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:48.030> find<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.600> cool<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:49.079> because

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
reason I find this so cool is because

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.469 
reason I find this so cool is because
the<00:01:49.500> East<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.009> West<00:01:50.070> have<00:01:50.579> always<00:01:50.939> been<00:01:51.119> so

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
the East and West have always been so

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.030 
the East and West have always been so
different<00:01:51.840> from<00:01:52.140> each<00:01:52.320> other<00:01:52.470> right<00:01:52.829> you

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
different from each other right you

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.410 
different from each other right you
compare<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.430> differences<00:01:53.850> between<00:01:53.909> North

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
compare the differences between North

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.880 
compare the differences between North
America<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:54.960> South<00:01:55.110> America<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.619> somewhere

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
America and South America to somewhere

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.980 
America and South America to somewhere
like<00:01:55.950> Europe<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:57.119> know<00:01:57.240> our<00:01:57.509> culture's

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
like Europe and you know our culture's

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.569 
like Europe and you know our culture's
are<00:01:58.110> super<00:01:58.439> similar<00:01:58.829> whatever<00:01:59.100> differences

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
are super similar whatever differences

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.370 
are super similar whatever differences
there<00:01:59.790> are<00:01:59.820> have<00:02:00.509> been<00:02:00.780> made<00:02:00.960> up<00:02:01.110> over<00:02:01.290> the

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
there are have been made up over the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.380 
there are have been made up over the
past<00:02:01.590> few<00:02:01.860> hundred<00:02:01.920> years<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.850> even<00:02:03.000> then<00:02:03.240> our

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
past few hundred years and even then our

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.789 
past few hundred years and even then our
culture's<00:02:03.780> are<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.079> similar<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.560> if

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
culture's are so similar that if

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.889 
culture's are so similar that if
something<00:02:05.040> like<00:02:05.430> gets<00:02:05.700> popular<00:02:06.270> in<00:02:06.450> one<00:02:06.659> area

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
something like gets popular in one area

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.510 
something like gets popular in one area
then<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.259> can<00:02:07.469> very<00:02:07.680> easily<00:02:07.740> spread<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.489> the

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
then it can very easily spread to the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.100 
then it can very easily spread to the
other<00:02:08.640> like<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.390> african-american

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
other like the african-american

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.320
