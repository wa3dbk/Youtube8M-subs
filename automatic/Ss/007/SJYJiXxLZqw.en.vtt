00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
butter in that order you will to have

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.410 
butter in that order you will to have
this<00:03:00.200> shine<00:03:00.590> so<00:03:01.519> this<00:03:01.850> is<00:03:02.000> just<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.239> curl

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
this shine so this is just the curl

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.990 
this shine so this is just the curl
definition<00:03:02.570> I<00:03:03.079> only<00:03:03.350> split<00:03:03.590> them<00:03:03.860> each<00:03:04.519> one

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
definition I only split them each one

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.060 
definition I only split them each one
twice<00:03:05.630> so<00:03:06.410> let's<00:03:06.590> just<00:03:06.739> say<00:03:06.829> for<00:03:06.860> instance

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
twice so let's just say for instance

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.310 
twice so let's just say for instance
this<00:03:07.730> was<00:03:07.970> these<00:03:08.180> two<00:03:08.690> work<00:03:08.840> together<00:03:09.049> and

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
this was these two work together and

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.949 
this was these two work together and
it's<00:03:09.440> wrist<00:03:09.650> I<00:03:09.890> separated<00:03:10.489> them<00:03:10.940> that<00:03:11.630> was<00:03:11.810> it

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
it's wrist I separated them that was it

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.289 
it's wrist I separated them that was it
and<00:03:12.110> then<00:03:12.470> in<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.709> back<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:13.280> did<00:03:13.910> a<00:03:13.940> little<00:03:14.060> bit

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
and then in the back I did a little bit

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.390 
and then in the back I did a little bit
more<00:03:14.480> so<00:03:15.470> it<00:03:15.650> could<00:03:15.799> be<00:03:15.829> a<00:03:15.920> little<00:03:16.070> bit<00:03:16.250> more

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
more so it could be a little bit more

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.050 
more so it could be a little bit more
