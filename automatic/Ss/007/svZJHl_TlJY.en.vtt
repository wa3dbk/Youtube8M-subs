 one level and this is the second one you have 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.760
 now with a copy that brings great 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.610
 fame comes from winning the classic simón 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.290
 bolívar completely solid and 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.010
 not well back to determine 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.479
 important strong and clear what is 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.560
 the name that this copy is going to be one 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.030
 of the main ones in the classic the 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.619
 Caribbean that makes you feel that's going 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.330
 on one of the horses with 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.840
 great opportunity to win these 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.320
 practices yes good the horse is very 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.210
 good has great opportunity too 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.770
 I have to highlight you the other 2 fell 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.150
 injured also has opportunity not 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.520
 I know here have told me that 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.619
 It also has great quality and good 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.570
 career and like all the majority of the 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.060
 race you have to run to win it and 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.430
 it's difficult in a classic like this at 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.680
 better is horse 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:47.270
 you have to wait for the result if you do not 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.610
 You can say that the predictability of 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.740
 horse did what we expected 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.990
 from poto 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.570

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.790

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.680
 before that race with a good second 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.020

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.590
 good second and there showed self and fell 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.170

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.870

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.910
