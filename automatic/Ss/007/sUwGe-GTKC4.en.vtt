build of the v19 torrent we've seen this

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.349 
build of the v19 torrent we've seen this
a<00:04:13.680> few<00:04:13.799> times<00:04:14.010> in<00:04:14.519> different<00:04:14.549> sets<00:04:15.030> and<00:04:15.209> this

a few times in different sets and this

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.930 
a few times in different sets and this
is<00:04:15.600> not<00:04:16.109> quite<00:04:16.440> its<00:04:16.950> we've<00:04:17.459> seen<00:04:17.669> a<00:04:17.700> little

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
is not quite its we've seen a little

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.969 
is not quite its we've seen a little
smaller<00:04:18.389> I<00:04:18.510> think<00:04:18.630> they're<00:04:19.169> probably<00:04:19.440> smaller

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
smaller I think they're probably smaller

micro builds than this

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.820 
micro builds than this
there's<00:04:21.930> kind<00:04:22.140> of<00:04:22.230> a<00:04:22.380> mini<00:04:22.620> build<00:04:24.830> obviously

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
there's kind of a mini build obviously

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.410 
there's kind of a mini build obviously
not<00:04:26.310> minifigure<00:04:27.180> scale<00:04:28.730> which<00:04:29.730> in<00:04:30.060> the<00:04:30.240> book

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.650 
not minifigure scale which in the book
it<00:04:30.900> basically<00:04:31.890> tells<00:04:32.280> a<00:04:32.490> story<00:04:32.730> as<00:04:33.090> you<00:04:33.480> go

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
it basically tells a story as you go

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.450 
it basically tells a story as you go
through<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:34.020> instructions<00:04:34.320> and<00:04:35.100> you<00:04:35.250> build

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
through the instructions and you build

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.100 
through the instructions and you build
it<00:04:37.040> and<00:04:38.040> here<00:04:38.340> is<00:04:38.520> the<00:04:38.760> separatists<00:04:39.330> cannon

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
it and here is the separatists cannon

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.660 
it and here is the separatists cannon
which<00:04:40.290> is<00:04:40.440> pretty<00:04:40.650> cool<00:04:40.860> actually<00:04:41.100> scan<00:04:41.580> these

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
which is pretty cool actually scan these

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.600 
which is pretty cool actually scan these
little<00:04:41.940> legs<00:04:42.090> so<00:04:42.360> it<00:04:42.510> walks<00:04:42.750> just<00:04:43.260> look<00:04:43.680> at<00:04:44.490> the

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
little legs so it walks just look at the

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.670 
little legs so it walks just look at the
big<00:04:44.850> cannon<00:04:45.300> there<00:04:45.480> so<00:04:45.750> I<00:04:46.110> think<00:04:46.350> it's<00:04:46.530> on<00:04:46.650> a

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
big cannon there so I think it's on a

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.560 
big cannon there so I think it's on a
different<00:04:46.860> scale<00:04:47.370> than<00:04:47.820> the<00:04:49.820> v19<00:04:50.820> torrent

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
different scale than the v19 torrent

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.890 
different scale than the v19 torrent
they<00:04:52.500> still<00:04:52.770> meet<00:04:52.980> a<00:04:53.010> little<00:04:53.520> Walker<00:04:53.900> legs

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
they still meet a little Walker legs

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:01.280 
they still meet a little Walker legs
move<00:04:57.920> but<00:04:58.920> that<00:04:59.160> is<00:04:59.370> the<00:04:59.780> cannon<00:05:00.780> separatist

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.550 
move but that is the cannon separatist
cannon<00:05:02.540> so<00:05:03.540> that<00:05:03.690> is<00:05:03.780> the<00:05:03.900> brick<00:05:04.110> master

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560

you<00:05:42.330> can<00:05:42.480> build<00:05:42.690> like<00:05:43.590> that<00:05:43.740> almost<00:05:44.340> like<00:05:44.460> a<00:05:44.490> 4

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790 
you can build like that almost like a 4

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.750 
you can build like that almost like a 4
in<00:05:44.940> 1<00:05:44.970> or<00:05:45.180> 3<00:05:45.570> in<00:05:45.690> 1<00:05:45.840> or<00:05:45.870> whatever<00:05:46.430> you<00:05:47.430> take<00:05:47.610> you

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
in 1 or 3 in 1 or whatever you take you

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.220 
in 1 or 3 in 1 or whatever you take you
can<00:05:47.820> see<00:05:48.000> on<00:05:48.150> the<00:05:48.240> cover<00:05:48.420> there<00:05:48.780> it's<00:05:49.110> a

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
can see on the cover there it's a

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.470 
can see on the cover there it's a
different<00:05:49.620> model<00:05:49.770> than<00:05:50.160> what<00:05:50.910> we<00:05:51.180> built<00:05:51.420> here

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:51.480 
different model than what we built here

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.050 
different model than what we built here
but<00:05:52.170> this<00:05:52.290> is<00:05:52.500> the<00:05:52.680> main<00:05:52.830> model<00:05:53.070> it<00:05:53.280> uses<00:05:53.640> all

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
but this is the main model it uses all

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.460 
but this is the main model it uses all
the<00:05:54.240> pieces<00:05:54.450> except<00:05:54.960> for<00:05:55.140> your<00:05:55.260> typical

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
the pieces except for your typical

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:01.100 
the pieces except for your typical
extras<00:05:56.250> that<00:05:56.430> you<00:05:56.490> get<00:05:57.980> so<00:05:59.330> it's<00:06:00.330> a<00:06:00.450> 33<00:06:00.780> dollar

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
extras that you get so it's a 33 dollar

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.310 
extras that you get so it's a 33 dollar
retail<00:06:01.410> price<00:06:01.890> I<00:06:02.550> think<00:06:03.060> even<00:06:03.210> at<00:06:03.360> $20<00:06:04.050> it's

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
retail price I think even at $20 it's

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:09.470 
retail price I think even at $20 it's
kind<00:06:04.560> of<00:06:04.620> steep<00:06:07.100> because<00:06:08.100> basically<00:06:08.730> the<00:06:09.210> bag

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:09.480 
kind of steep because basically the bag

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.950 
kind of steep because basically the bag
you<00:06:09.780> get<00:06:09.960> this<00:06:10.230> living<00:06:10.650> 9:05<00:06:11.520> 189<00:06:12.270> pieces<00:06:12.750> you

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
you get this living 9:05 189 pieces you

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.150 
you get this living 9:05 189 pieces you
know<00:06:13.110> you're<00:06:13.230> talking<00:06:13.560> about<00:06:13.650> a<00:06:14.060> 10<00:06:15.380> to<00:06:16.380> 13

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.160 
know you're talking about a 10 to 13

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.820 
know you're talking about a 10 to 13
dollar<00:06:17.780> probably<00:06:18.780> is<00:06:18.990> what<00:06:19.170> it<00:06:19.290> should<00:06:19.470> be<00:06:19.500> but

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
dollar probably is what it should be but

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.630 
dollar probably is what it should be but
that's<00:06:20.010> a<00:06:20.130> lot<00:06:20.220> of<00:06:20.280> pieces<00:06:20.520> 189<00:06:21.330> so<00:06:21.570> even<00:06:21.810> 15

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:22.640 
that's a lot of pieces 189 so even 15

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.310 
that's a lot of pieces 189 so even 15
but<00:06:23.640> you're<00:06:24.060> paying<00:06:24.240> for<00:06:24.510> this<00:06:24.630> book<00:06:24.930> is<00:06:25.170> what

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
but you're paying for this book is what

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.270 
but you're paying for this book is what
you're<00:06:25.500> paying<00:06:25.650> that's<00:06:25.860> why<00:06:26.010> it's<00:06:26.160> so

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
you're paying that's why it's so

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.210 
you're paying that's why it's so
expensive<00:06:26.520> so<00:06:27.380> not<00:06:28.380> the<00:06:28.500> best<00:06:28.710> deal<00:06:28.950> in<00:06:29.010> the
