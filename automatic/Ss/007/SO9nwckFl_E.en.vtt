00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.450
 on the dashboard there is such a small 

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:03.680
 finally 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:04.890
 why is that 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.260
 contains only red color 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.560
 in its design and all the figures of the emery 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.269
 is mining 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:12.119
 all information is presented exactly 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:13.989
 red color honestly tell you banks 

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:15.479
 So 

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:16.340
 do you agree 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.039
 alarming and here 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:19.730
 also demolish on the dashboard at 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.730
 me 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.469
 out of eleven 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.469
 feel like you can say 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.240
 all as usual the child can be judged 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.610
 three head restraints 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.440
 supporters go down to athletics 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.010
 in this case, probably you know everything 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.910
 did not let go 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.640
 the pharmacy turns out 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.500
 from the population 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.370
 second part of ideas 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.280
 here come 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.750
 so to speak 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.150
 if you see the three argue some more 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.020
 then bulky 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.230
 but according to a similar roof 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.110
 which is protected from all these all 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.110
 opens very 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.560
 opened but caprio basic configuration 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.250
 not going 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.640
 However 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.640
 complements let's say 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.690
 steven harper apt 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.540
 liter turbodiesel 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.130
 engine 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.759
 behaves very well 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.210
 manual transmission 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.409
 going one on one 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.969
 you know there are those who are to blame for the interceptor 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:41.640
 the car 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.000
 it may even 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.130
 sure the author 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.409
 but of course it was a little bit hard for them 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.110
 but nonetheless 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.080
 first day 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.690
 in six positions adjustable seat 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:51.620
 everything is as usual 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.790
 but nonetheless electronic 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.310
 adjustment 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.260
 also 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.530
 here are these pens 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.200
 who need to twist 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.590
 to rebuild the back for themselves 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.590
 you and I will no longer be 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.579
 cleaning horned European system 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:15.209
 so far received aaa overall rating 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.969
 security 5 stars 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:19.189
 it concerns driver protection and 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:21.930
 passengers and there is still say so separate 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.359
 article on child protection 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:25.839
 child safety besides kondopoga 4 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:28.839
 stars and spare pedestrians 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:37.459
 quite spacious and how you see ag 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.109
 n front seats honest country 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:39.749
 to substitute 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:41.189
 I was driving 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:43.790
 that is, a place here at centimeter 20 here 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.769
 there is for sure 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.239
 need anything else to keep here if 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:48.700
 need to 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.040
 and if neighbors allow even bastards 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.760
 share may fall prey to basis 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.530
 rival 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.230
 and it will be necessary to move a little to the west 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.410
 but I don't think this will lead to anyone 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.440
 discomfort from compiled 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.039
 but for passengers 

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:03.529
 here is the notorious rosettes 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:04.650
 that is, here 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.129
 imagine what a whale 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:09.129
 if you work with a laptop 

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:14.589
 difficult 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:21.669
 I would say that on the center console 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:22.769
 honestly 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.769
 granddaughter a lot 

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:29.519
 virtually no credit 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.479
 cards with them can be said 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:34.239
 repeated will be possible panel 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.879
 that's how it is very difficult for me now a couple 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:38.889
 now occurs to residents as it were 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:41.229
 was on old age these tvs remember 

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:44.439
 Elena Spiridovich at gunpoint there 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:46.649
 can buy 

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:49.649
 here, too, only switch 

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:53.259
 nostalgia german mannheim 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:59.680
 I just told you how here 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.019
 all is well and he suddenly realized that 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.279
 there is something to complain about yet 

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:06.459
 there is 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.689
 I certainly can not see 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:10.389
 but let's say the doctors are notching suddenly 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:11.469
 wanted water 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:13.399
 him periodically please go home 

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:15.019

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:20.289
 operational points 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:22.189
 and where to go 

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:25.009
 nothing at all anywhere 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:28.059
 finally who will lead 24 meters 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:40.030
 as Alexey urin says well there 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.300
 where do you have them 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.580
