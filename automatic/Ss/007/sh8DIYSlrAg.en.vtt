my soapbox for just a couple minutes and
I<00:00:05.240> kind<00:00:05.570> of<00:00:05.630> feel<00:00:05.810> it's<00:00:05.990> important<00:00:06.470> to<00:00:07.029> make

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:08.029 
I kind of feel it's important to make

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.820 
I kind of feel it's important to make
this<00:00:08.210> video<00:00:10.930> and<00:00:11.930> I<00:00:11.990> think<00:00:12.260> everybody<00:00:12.650> knows

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
this video and I think everybody knows

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.070 
this video and I think everybody knows
what's<00:00:13.160> been<00:00:13.309> going<00:00:13.580> on<00:00:13.670> with<00:00:13.880> Tom<00:00:14.120> and<00:00:14.840> I

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
what's been going on with Tom and I

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.390 
what's been going on with Tom and I
don't<00:00:15.260> want<00:00:15.410> to<00:00:15.470> belabor<00:00:15.680> it<00:00:15.889> and<00:00:16.129> I<00:00:16.160> want<00:00:16.340> to

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
don't want to belabor it and I want to

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.480 
don't want to belabor it and I want to
beat<00:00:16.550> anybody<00:00:16.789> up<00:00:17.179> over<00:00:17.539> it<00:00:18.369> because<00:00:19.369> that's

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
beat anybody up over it because that's

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.720 
beat anybody up over it because that's
not<00:00:19.759> what<00:00:20.060> I<00:00:20.089> do<00:00:20.289> I<00:00:21.289> try<00:00:22.189> and<00:00:22.249> keep<00:00:22.429> things

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
not what I do I try and keep things

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.479 
not what I do I try and keep things
positive<00:00:22.970> and<00:00:23.619> I<00:00:24.619> think<00:00:24.650> there's<00:00:25.220> some

00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:25.489 
positive and I think there's some

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.649 
positive and I think there's some
positive<00:00:25.970> lessons<00:00:26.380> with<00:00:27.380> what's<00:00:27.679> going<00:00:28.189> on

the first thing that I want to touch on

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
is how you interpret rules how you

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.180 
is how you interpret rules how you
educate<00:00:40.640> yourself<00:00:40.789> about<00:00:41.179> rules<00:00:41.660> and<00:00:42.190> all

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
rule is and how to apply it on my

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.710 
rule is and how to apply it on my
project<00:01:42.820> they<00:01:43.820> may<00:01:44.000> think<00:01:44.060> they<00:01:44.390> know<00:01:44.570> the

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
project they may think they know the

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.550 
project they may think they know the
rule<00:01:45.370> they<00:01:46.370> may<00:01:46.880> really<00:01:47.270> believe<00:01:47.750> that<00:01:48.140> what

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
rule they may really believe that what

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.560 
rule they may really believe that what
they're<00:01:48.740> telling<00:01:48.920> me<00:01:49.070> is<00:01:49.190> true<00:01:49.310> but<00:01:50.240> they<00:01:50.390> may

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
they're telling me is true but they may

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.780 
they're telling me is true but they may
not<00:01:50.750> understand<00:01:51.320> my<00:01:51.470> situation<00:01:51.710> where<00:01:52.670> they

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
not understand my situation where they

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.320 
not understand my situation where they
may<00:01:52.940> not<00:01:53.150> understand<00:01:53.660> the<00:01:53.810> rule<00:01:54.020> and<00:01:54.380> so<00:01:55.370> my

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
may not understand the rule and so my

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.390 
may not understand the rule and so my
personal<00:01:56.660> the<00:01:57.320> way<00:01:57.440> I<00:01:57.470> deal<00:01:57.770> with<00:01:57.800> that<00:01:58.130> is<00:01:58.280> if

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
personal the way I deal with that is if

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.700 
personal the way I deal with that is if
I<00:01:58.490> do<00:01:58.550> ask<00:01:58.880> somebody<00:01:59.300> I<00:01:59.510> always<00:01:59.990> go<00:02:00.290> look<00:02:00.500> it<00:02:00.620> up

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
I do ask somebody I always go look it up

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.980 
I do ask somebody I always go look it up
afterwards<00:02:01.310> so<00:02:01.820> whatever<00:02:02.210> they<00:02:02.390> tell<00:02:02.660> me<00:02:02.690> is

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
afterwards so whatever they tell me is

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.300 
afterwards so whatever they tell me is
is<00:02:03.980> generally<00:02:04.550> correct<00:02:05.170> but<00:02:06.170> I<00:02:06.200> look<00:02:06.470> it<00:02:06.590> up<00:02:06.710> at

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
is generally correct but I look it up at

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.639 
is generally correct but I look it up at
that<00:02:07.640> point<00:02:07.940> I<00:02:08.209> own<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.599> information<00:02:08.750> I<00:02:09.350> own

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
that point I own the information I own

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.480 
that point I own the information I own
it<00:02:09.800> I've<00:02:09.979> looked<00:02:10.490> at<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:10.700> I<00:02:11.000> own<00:02:11.510> it<00:02:12.250> until<00:02:13.250> that

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
it I've looked at it I own it until that

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.110 
it I've looked at it I own it until that
happens

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
happens

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.910

enclosed<00:04:17.780> and<00:04:18.079> draw<00:04:18.289> air<00:04:18.500> through<00:04:18.530> it<00:04:18.919> and

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
enclosed and draw air through it and

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:22.089 
enclosed and draw air through it and
some<00:04:19.340> other<00:04:19.519> little<00:04:19.699> things<00:04:20.060> like<00:04:20.239> that<00:04:21.099> but

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.099 
some other little things like that but

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:26.020 
some other little things like that but
from<00:04:22.340> what<00:04:22.520> I<00:04:22.550> can<00:04:22.729> tell<00:04:22.909> a<00:04:24.070> barn<00:04:25.070> can<00:04:25.849> be<00:04:26.000> a

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
from what I can tell a barn can be a

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.969 
from what I can tell a barn can be a
booth

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
booth

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:29.520 
booth
doesn't<00:04:27.639> have<00:04:28.090> to<00:04:28.120> be<00:04:28.330> out<00:04:28.840> of<00:04:29.050> a<00:04:29.110> catalog

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
doesn't have to be out of a catalog

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.429 
doesn't have to be out of a catalog
could<00:04:30.129> be<00:04:30.280> wrong<00:04:31.080> but<00:04:32.080> that's<00:04:32.199> how<00:04:32.409> I

00:04:32.429 --> 00:04:32.439 
could be wrong but that's how I

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:34.200 
could be wrong but that's how I
interpret<00:04:33.009> the<00:04:33.129> rules<00:04:33.310> based<00:04:33.669> on<00:04:33.849> what<00:04:34.060> I've

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
interpret the rules based on what I've

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.839 
interpret the rules based on what I've
read<00:04:34.449> so<00:04:36.060> as<00:04:37.169> long<00:04:38.169> as<00:04:38.439> the<00:04:38.979> the<00:04:39.340> biggest<00:04:39.669> rule

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:39.849 
read so as long as the the biggest rule

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:44.520 
read so as long as the the biggest rule
is<00:04:40.090> 98%<00:04:41.969> filters<00:04:42.969> on<00:04:43.180> the<00:04:43.990> air<00:04:44.139> that's<00:04:44.439> going

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
is 98% filters on the air that's going

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.950 
is 98% filters on the air that's going
out<00:04:44.860> of<00:04:44.949> the<00:04:45.039> building<00:04:45.340> and<00:04:45.759> I<00:04:46.479> think<00:04:46.509> you<00:04:46.780> can

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
out of the building and I think you can

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.209 
out of the building and I think you can
just<00:04:47.139> go<00:04:47.289> buy<00:04:47.469> those<00:04:47.710> so<00:04:49.050> if<00:04:50.050> you<00:04:50.259> have<00:04:50.830> a<00:04:50.860> barn

00:04:51.209 --> 00:04:51.219 
just go buy those so if you have a barn

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:55.290 
just go buy those so if you have a barn
or<00:04:51.580> an<00:04:52.449> outbuilding<00:04:53.289> and<00:04:53.740> you're<00:04:54.729> exhausting

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
or an outbuilding and you're exhausting

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.649 
or an outbuilding and you're exhausting
air<00:04:55.479> through<00:04:55.930> a<00:04:55.960> 98%<00:04:56.740> filter<00:04:57.610> and<00:04:57.849> you've<00:04:58.360> got

00:04:58.649 --> 00:04:58.659 
air through a 98% filter and you've got

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:00.959 
air through a 98% filter and you've got
things<00:04:59.110> cocked<00:04:59.560> and<00:04:59.830> sealed

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:00.969 
things cocked and sealed

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:02.339 
things cocked and sealed
there's<00:05:01.419> a<00:05:01.479> pretty<00:05:01.659> good<00:05:01.810> chance<00:05:01.870> that<00:05:02.229> you're

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:02.349 
there's a pretty good chance that you're

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:04.950 
there's a pretty good chance that you're
compliant<00:05:03.210> that's<00:05:04.210> just<00:05:04.569> me

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
compliant that's just me

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.629 
compliant that's just me
interpreting<00:05:05.860> the<00:05:05.949> rules<00:05:07.110> so<00:05:08.110> you<00:05:08.409> know<00:05:09.370> I

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
interpreting the rules so you know I

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.260 
interpreting the rules so you know I
think<00:05:10.090> the<00:05:10.449> important<00:05:10.930> thing<00:05:10.960> is<00:05:12.150> you<00:05:13.150> know

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
think the important thing is you know

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.860 
think the important thing is you know
we're<00:05:13.599> all<00:05:13.949> doing<00:05:14.949> these<00:05:15.099> things<00:05:15.370> and<00:05:15.870> trying

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
we're all doing these things and trying

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.019 
we're all doing these things and trying
to<00:05:16.930> help<00:05:17.050> each<00:05:17.229> other<00:05:17.469> out<00:05:17.680> and<00:05:17.979> do<00:05:18.129> things<00:05:18.430> for

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:19.029 
to help each other out and do things for

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:22.050 
to help each other out and do things for
ourselves<00:05:19.150> and<00:05:19.810> the<00:05:20.219> the<00:05:21.219> fact<00:05:21.490> is<00:05:21.729> if<00:05:21.939> you

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
ourselves and the the fact is if you

you'd<00:05:28.389> never<00:05:28.599> get<00:05:28.900> it<00:05:29.020> done<00:05:29.430> because<00:05:30.430> most<00:05:30.879> of

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
you'd never get it done because most of

big difference is in my world failure is

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.559 
big difference is in my world failure is
not<00:06:05.289> an<00:06:05.529> option<00:06:05.759> that<00:06:06.759> doesn't<00:06:07.240> mean<00:06:07.479> you
