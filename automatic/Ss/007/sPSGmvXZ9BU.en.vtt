00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 greet comrades tankers today 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.020
 for you will broadcast and warrior playing 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.480
 format 754 as part of the voice command i 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.610
 felt that a lot of players are calling in 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.650
 this mode is absolutely not understood as 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.150
 it is necessary to conduct battles how to command correctly 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.340
 Because of this, I decided to start 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.199
 record a video line with tactics 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.119
 team battle under not quite 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.789
 the original name is the path to victory 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.189
 Immediately I say that we will consider 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.500
 priority tactics for easy setups 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.720
 consisting mainly of n. 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.880
 they will be quite universal and if your 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.010
 The composition does not quite coincide with the fact that 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.290
 We have, you can replace the standard 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.820
 machines on each other 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.250
 positions also before we 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.649
 let's get you four main 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.899
 rules of this mode namely shoot 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.700
 on focus, finish off 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.219
 opponents focus enemy 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.230
 drum tank and cardboard and let's not 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.949
 Opponent kill your van shot 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.379
 allies 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.690
 namely, close on them the chamber so 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.910
 today on the agenda we have a card 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.180
 Prohorovka namely df first 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.210
 Consider the setup we have 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.159
 t32 a mx 50,100 of 3 and 4 lt m 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.680
 I did not reinvent the wheel and 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.229
 sent from 332 to tank from the tower on 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.210
 the center of the map is squared and e 5 and 6 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.700
 from here there is a chamber literally over all 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.549
 sectors we need to protect 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.100
 first of all it is the alley and the center of the map 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.840
 also our tyazh can enlighten the village 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.090
 through which can also pass 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.030
 opponent 1 bulldog we send on 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.220
 primary light on the center after which 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.380
 he can either continue to study 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.829
 light on the center either join 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.619
 groupings lt from two 13 90 1 bulldog 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.990
 on the alley squared a one b1 those 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.979
 positions also have lumbago 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.720
 card center 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.930
 which allows us to cover up our heavy 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.149
 tanks on amx 50100 put our df punch 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.549
 from a6 for lumen second base and 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.140
 cover our tank teams in case 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.670
 breakthrough 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.070
 now consider the battle in which already 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.380
 there is a primary departure our bulldog 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.759
 on the center highlights the enemy striae 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.590
 running over pour 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.000
 which may mean exactly there 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.009
 there will be a breakthrough since we are in the DEF to us 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.380
 what not to do except sit 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.450
 on occupied positions and you should not wait 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.730
 forget that time works for us and 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.500
 the enemy will in any case have to 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.110
 attack us a few minutes later 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.110
 the enemy finally decides to attack along the avenue 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.790
 its and IS-3 and immediately falls into the light 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.620
 and accordingly begins to take damage 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.840
 from lt located on the alley 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.660
 at this moment two enemy weave also 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.850
 fall out on center start shooting 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.280
 by our weight which is about 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.230
 I repeat that it is very important to keep 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.810
 priority is enemy drums and 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.060
 destroy them without letting them run out 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.520
 our tanks than I begin to do for 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.590
 This is my square on oshay here already 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.720
 there comes a time pulled the rock salt and 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.560
 because they are about to fall into the light and 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.720
 will begin to die 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.820
 overtighten as much as possible 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.190
 stitched including a summary which already 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.650
 discharged in tanks at the center less 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.750
 Mobile tanks such as IS-3 T32 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.850
 being at the center in such a case 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.570
 better leaves about the same 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.730
 positions 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.620
 namely, squared d5 in order 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.480
 protect them from lumbling salts 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.060
 but it is provided that they remain 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.220
 alive further the enemy takes an attempt 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.049
 capture base and for his downing necessary 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.000
 take positions giving us the opportunity 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.850
 crossfire 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.730
 this position is a knife for el 6 and the center of the map 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.650
 after all these simple manipulations 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.480
 calmly we finish the enemy on it all 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.610
