pipe and this one is actually inch and a
half<00:00:21.310> I<00:00:21.640> wish<00:00:21.789> it<00:00:21.910> was<00:00:22.000> a<00:00:22.030> little<00:00:22.240> bit<00:00:22.360> smaller

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
got to square it off at the end as I

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.800 
got to square it off at the end as I
could<00:00:26.610> and<00:00:27.610> I'm<00:00:27.730> gonna<00:00:27.820> use<00:00:28.029> that<00:00:28.060> to<00:00:28.330> tap<00:00:28.510> it<00:00:28.690> I

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
could and I'm gonna use that to tap it I

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:29.939 
could and I'm gonna use that to tap it I

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:29.949 
probably won't be able to keep the

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.729 
probably won't be able to keep the
camera<00:00:30.190> here<00:00:31.020> because<00:00:32.020> I<00:00:32.320> don't<00:00:32.469> want<00:00:32.590> to<00:00:32.649> hit

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
camera here because I don't want to hit

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.090 
camera here because I don't want to hit

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.540 
be back okay you can see I have the seal
installed<00:00:43.739> in<00:00:44.739> the<00:00:44.890> process<00:00:45.280> we<00:00:45.430> discovered

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
installed in the process we discovered

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.270 
installed in the process we discovered
that<00:00:46.000> the<00:00:46.780> transmission<00:00:47.620> case<00:00:47.800> actually<00:00:48.010> had

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
that the transmission case actually had

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.220 
that the transmission case actually had
a<00:00:48.340> crack<00:00:48.579> in<00:00:48.610> it<00:00:48.850> we<00:00:48.940> use<00:00:49.090> some<00:00:49.239> jb<00:00:49.600> weld<00:00:49.809> and

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
a crack in it we use some jb weld and

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.290 
a crack in it we use some jb weld and
then<00:00:51.010> we<00:00:51.100> cover<00:00:51.309> that<00:00:51.460> up<00:00:51.520> with<00:00:51.640> some<00:00:51.850> silicone

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
then we cover that up with some silicone

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.440 
then we cover that up with some silicone
so<00:00:53.430> we're<00:00:54.430> ready<00:00:54.579> to<00:00:54.670> go<00:00:54.850> it's<00:00:55.180> time<00:00:55.300> to
