that yeah I think tells us a little bit

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.680 
that yeah I think tells us a little bit
about<00:01:55.370> the<00:01:55.490> story<00:01:55.760> he<00:01:55.940> basically<00:01:56.090> is<00:01:56.510> talking

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
about all the advances in military

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.160 
about all the advances in military
technology<00:01:58.400> there<00:01:59.150> are<00:01:59.270> robots<00:01:59.570> there<00:02:00.080> are

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
technology there are robots there are

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.140 
technology there are robots there are
robots<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:00.860> he<00:02:00.920> says<00:02:01.100> that<00:02:01.460> yeah<00:02:01.820> that's<00:02:01.970> all

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
robots and he says that yeah that's all

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.180 
robots and he says that yeah that's all
well<00:02:02.330> and<00:02:02.360> good<00:02:02.510> except<00:02:03.290> when<00:02:03.620> the<00:02:03.860> enemy

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
well and good except when the enemy

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.250 
well and good except when the enemy
finds<00:02:04.520> out<00:02:04.730> how<00:02:05.210> to<00:02:05.270> make<00:02:05.450> them<00:02:05.630> turn<00:02:05.810> on<00:02:06.050> you

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
finds out how to make them turn on you

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.180 
finds out how to make them turn on you
yeah<00:02:06.410> and<00:02:07.149> the<00:02:08.149> humans<00:02:08.540> to<00:02:08.929> kill<00:02:09.649> them<00:02:09.800> that's

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
yeah and the humans to kill them that's

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.710 
yeah and the humans to kill them that's
the<00:02:10.310> premise<00:02:10.490> I<00:02:10.729> think<00:02:11.000> that's<00:02:11.150> that's<00:02:11.450> pretty

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
the premise I think that's that's pretty

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.620 
the premise I think that's that's pretty
much<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:11.870> only<00:02:12.910> other<00:02:13.910> stuff<00:02:14.210> that<00:02:14.240> we<00:02:14.450> saw<00:02:14.600> in

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
much the only other stuff that we saw in

talking about and that is of course
playable<00:02:37.850> in<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.150> game<00:02:38.300> big<00:02:38.600> surprise<00:02:38.989> and<00:02:39.380> we

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
actually got to look at the kind of a

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.699 
actually got to look at the kind of a
cockpit<00:02:41.000> view<00:02:41.510> by<00:02:41.750> you<00:02:41.810> can<00:02:42.020> control<00:02:42.530> this

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
cockpit view by you can control this

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.260 
cockpit view by you can control this
thing<00:02:42.890> yeah<00:02:43.160> so<00:02:43.340> I<00:02:43.370> have<00:02:43.520> these<00:02:43.610> weird<00:02:43.910> for

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
thing yeah so I have these weird for

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.250 
thing yeah so I have these weird for
controls<00:02:44.600> that<00:02:44.660> we<00:02:44.750> couldn't<00:02:44.930> really<00:02:45.080> figure

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
controls that we couldn't really figure

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.740 
controls that we couldn't really figure
out<00:02:45.410> that<00:02:45.770> you<00:02:45.800> use<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.489> d-pad<00:02:46.640> with<00:02:47.090> yeah<00:02:47.510> but

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
out that you use the d-pad with yeah but

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.750 
out that you use the d-pad with yeah but
also<00:02:47.870> you<00:02:48.050> just<00:02:48.260> either<00:02:48.860> squad<00:02:49.280> follow<00:02:49.550> or

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
also you just either squad follow or

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.220 
also you just either squad follow or
follow<00:02:49.940> everybody<00:02:50.239> so<00:02:50.570> it's<00:02:50.720> kind<00:02:50.959> of<00:02:51.050> like

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
follow everybody so it's kind of like

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.960 
follow everybody so it's kind of like
the<00:02:51.410> recon<00:02:51.830> drone<00:02:52.190> sort<00:02:52.430> of<00:02:52.580> for<00:02:52.730> modern

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
the recon drone sort of for modern

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.449 
the recon drone sort of for modern
warfare<00:02:53.090> 3<00:02:53.239> yeah<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.230> we<00:02:54.470> see<00:02:54.920> a<00:02:54.950> lot<00:02:55.220> of<00:02:55.250> these

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
warfare 3 yeah and we see a lot of these

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.310 
warfare 3 yeah and we see a lot of these
quadrotors<00:02:55.970> so<00:02:56.090> I<00:02:56.120> think<00:02:56.299> the<00:02:56.540> squad<00:02:56.870> commands

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
quadrotors so I think the squad commands

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.020 
quadrotors so I think the squad commands
actually<00:02:57.739> applies<00:02:57.980> two<00:02:58.220> squads<00:02:58.700> of

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
actually applies two squads of

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.850 
actually applies two squads of
quadrotors<00:03:00.019> so<00:03:00.230> I<00:03:00.260> think<00:03:00.410> that<00:03:00.560> you'll<00:03:00.739> be

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
quadrotors so I think that you'll be

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.650 
quadrotors so I think that you'll be
able<00:03:00.950> to<00:03:01.160> control<00:03:01.610> like<00:03:01.910> massive<00:03:02.299> groups<00:03:02.480> of

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
able to control like massive groups of

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.210 
able to control like massive groups of
these<00:03:02.780> guys<00:03:02.989> yeah<00:03:03.410> obviously<00:03:03.709> have<00:03:03.920> a<00:03:03.950> machine

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
these guys yeah obviously have a machine

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.770 
these guys yeah obviously have a machine
gun<00:03:04.400> and<00:03:04.580> right<00:03:04.970> along<00:03:05.209> the<00:03:05.330> bottom<00:03:05.480> you<00:03:05.750> see

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
gun and right along the bottom you see

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.479 
gun and right along the bottom you see
different<00:03:06.260> kind<00:03:06.410> of<00:03:06.440> deep<00:03:06.590> at<00:03:06.769> commands<00:03:07.160> so<00:03:07.459> I

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
different kind of deep at commands so I

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.280 
different kind of deep at commands so I
think<00:03:07.610> those<00:03:07.850> are<00:03:07.880> different<00:03:08.390> ammo<00:03:08.720> types<00:03:08.930> and

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
think those are different ammo types and

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.690 
think those are different ammo types and
stuff<00:03:09.500> yeah<00:03:09.620> you<00:03:09.680> have<00:03:09.860> like<00:03:09.890> a<00:03:10.190> mo<00:03:10.370> and

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
stuff yeah you have like a mo and

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.789 
stuff yeah you have like a mo and
elevation<00:03:11.420> or<00:03:11.510> something<00:03:11.900> well<00:03:12.200> obviously

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
elevation or something well obviously

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.740 
elevation or something well obviously
we're<00:03:13.250> not<00:03:13.340> sure<00:03:13.580> but<00:03:13.850> yeah<00:03:14.060> other<00:03:14.269> stuff

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
we're not sure but yeah other stuff

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.390 
we're not sure but yeah other stuff
