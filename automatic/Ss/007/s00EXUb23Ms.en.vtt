00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.069
 maybe a little hard to talk about 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.450
 motivation of the saints does not have more chance 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.210
 in the brazilian championship 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.219
 Not yet out of the Brazil Cup, but you? 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.109
 maybe the players have more 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.940
 motivation here because it needs to show 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.130
 service to continue next year 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.160
 How is this final stretch for you? 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.779
 think about it or just think about playing ball and 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.820
 leave it aside 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.230
 I believe that in matters of motivation 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.460
 and it's not only for me that it touched my 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.440
 end of the line contract 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.750
 I think all the players that 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.690
 wear the Saints shirt already has to be 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.200
 feel motivated right so I think 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.739
 what motivation is everyone has and 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:51.600
 now in my case is so trying to give the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.280
 my best with every game to show is that 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.670
 I have conditions to stay 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.719
 but how is a political year for the club? 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:04.320
 will depend a lot on that of the new board 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.229
 so I'll try to honor the shirt of the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.380
 santos in the last 5 games available 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:15.000
 there's the river still on top of that I wanted 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.850
 know what your desire is and stayed 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.770
 very close to being the hero of the 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.770
 classification of the saints she had 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.720
 brought against cruise and I do not 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.720
 use a parallel example at the end of 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.540
 week had classic inter cream and 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.770
 alan ruiz is very very close to 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.960
 leaving the club was having few 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.729
 opportunities, but in a classic against 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.259
 inter was scored twice 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.420
 the staff there in the school stopped thinking 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.159
 so suddenly this guy here and there 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.890
 still have a chance of getting 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.479
 The Saints take the cruise still gets the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.149
 São Paulo still holds important teams 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.280
 think a good performance a game 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.170
 important as these can serve to 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.229
 convince staff 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.590
 I think it's the last five 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.659
 games is an opportunity for me and I'm 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.840
 happy to have made a great game against 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.280
 the cruise but also is no good 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.860
 Nothing because we can not get our 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.270
 which was the classification 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.819
 but as I said, now we will 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.950
 think about these next five games 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.810
 and I'm sure everyone is very 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.159
 focused because we have to respect very 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.999
 the saints shirt 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:22.859
 the hilton is independent of the results in 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:24.599
 the difference between the behavior of the 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:26.310
 time in the game against the cruise in the game 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.780
 against corinthians and cruise 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.810
 theoretically an opponent is more 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.719
 difficult the saints got to play 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.870
 more goals and three goals 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:39.030
 Corinthians the team looked like they were already there 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.780
 if you talk about it, how it was not 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.639
 had time to digest the elimination 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.469
 It was all very fast, do you think 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:47.400
 Time Felt did not arrive prepared for 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:51.060
 this classic 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.090
 I believe that you do not want either. 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.129
 say that this is an excuse but it is the 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.620
 the people played on Wednesday is the 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:02.669
 Corinthians rested all week, right? 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.560
 our already had is had not even much time 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:07.260
 to train because I had to rest 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.319
 the players we had are played we did 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:13.199
 more a regenerative and few things 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.810
 the teacher succeeded in doing so 

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:18.509
 I believe that this difficulty of a wolf 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.780
 it is close to the other, it has made it difficult 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:23.370
 that 's what the saints have to do 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.579
 to stay with you in definitive who 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:30.269
 belongs the ideas contest rights 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:35.280
 so in these businesses I leave mine 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:37.859
 businessmen is is divided between the bridge 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.409
 and the businessman then my thinking is 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:43.799
 in these five games of making good 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:44.609
 games for who knows, I'm staying here at 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.099
 saints 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:49.259
 or else it is also if I do not stay too 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:53.970
 I really have to thank this club 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:58.739
 Who opened the doors for me and it's a ball. 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:00.239
 forward is the sound the cbf has now confirmed 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.519
 that the classic against Sao Paulo goes 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.519
 being in the wetland arena is how 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:09.030
 players see this has no more chances 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:10.859
 to reach the liberators arrive at last 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.329
 they understand that it's good for the club 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.519
 for the money that the saints conquered 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:19.039
 others preferred to play in the village 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:21.719
 us is an employee of the club is where 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:25.680
 they choose to play we have 

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:27.240
 that going is as I said with the greatest respect 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.280
 and with the greatest desire is to dress the 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:33.419
 saints shirt if it's here in the village it 's 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:37.289
 of course our our fan is here 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:39.630
 is is come to support more here in the village is more 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:41.780
 close but anywhere put here 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.699
 people to play, people are going to play 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.770
 independent of pleasing the current management 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.300
 next to the address try praised 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.910
 people know that the saints live 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.800
 difficult financial reality and perhaps 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.289
 need more than usually show 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.850
 Your soccer to have money even for 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:58.860
 Pay the bridge already thought of this 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.349
 possibility if the saints can not 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.690
 buy what you do you back to the 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:07.320
 bridge is thought to be negotiated 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.930
 so I believe that back to the bridge 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:14.009
 black and it's going to be very difficult right? 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:15.810
 Of course, what if I go back is 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:18.599
 I respect a lot the black bridge is a club 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.490
 who has a great affection but how 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:22.050
 I 've talked to the businessman he 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.849
 said that if it does not work here 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.220
 Saints it will be very difficult to return to 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:30.030
 the bridge then I leave them in their hands 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:33.210
 That's why the noise wanted to know if 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:35.760
 You play against the cruise in the 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.560
 Sunday if you have any special value 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.500
 fact that it was the team that it eliminated 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.750
 You in the Copa do Brasil and wanted to 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.820
 you also make an assessment of a 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.729
 General way of your year as you 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.289
 Rate your passage here in the saints 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:52.860
 and self-criticism and said 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:56.039
 How do you rate your year here ? 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:58.620
 I think it's an important game, it's a 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:01.500
 a great team that 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:06.349
 is fighting for the title right? 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:11.159
 we can interfere directly is 

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:13.710
 to hurt is they not to win the 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:16.889
 We have a direct confrontation with the 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:20.159
 cruise and with São Paulo and self-criticism 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:22.169
 I think as always all the 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:23.880
 interviews I give I think I 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:27.449
 I have to perfect my finalization. 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:30.270
 it's perfecting that's make great games 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:34.590
 here in the saints mainly in games 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:36.940
 which it was decisive against it was in 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:39.760
 São Paulo championship 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.740
 is and now against the cruise then as 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.070
 I said 'oh I leave it in the hands of 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:47.590
 This is why the permanence is all 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:50.370
 everyone knows that I want to stay here more 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.370
 it's not up to me
