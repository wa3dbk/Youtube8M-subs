00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
really big deal in Gears because it's

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.099 
really big deal in Gears because it's
the<00:00:29.250> locust<00:00:29.939> they're<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.179> main<00:00:30.330> faction<00:00:30.929> in

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
Gears of War 1 2 and 3 that the COG have

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.459

been<00:00:34.590> fighting<00:00:35.270> and<00:00:36.270> it's<00:00:36.870> not<00:00:37.050> like<00:00:37.200> it's

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
been fighting and it's not like it's

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.799 
been fighting and it's not like it's
it's<00:00:38.100> just<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.489> faction<00:00:38.879> being<00:00:39.059> removed<00:00:39.480> like

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
it's just a faction being removed like

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.080 
it's just a faction being removed like
in<00:00:40.110> most<00:00:40.410> multiplayer<00:00:41.129> games<00:00:41.370> like<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.969> know

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
in most multiplayer games like you know

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.790 
in most multiplayer games like you know
like<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.660> could<00:00:42.840> remove<00:00:43.079> like<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.410> Russian

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
like you could remove like the Russian

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.260 
like you could remove like the Russian
army<00:00:44.040> or<00:00:44.280> something<00:00:44.309> like<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.090> there

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
army or something like that and there

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.569 
army or something like that and there
wouldn't<00:00:45.420> be<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.629> big<00:00:45.840> deal<00:00:46.070> but<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.190> locust

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
wouldn't be a big deal but the locust

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.990 
wouldn't be a big deal but the locust
are<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:48.680> you<00:00:49.680> know<00:00:49.770> symbolic<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.579> Gears<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.879> War

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
are so you know symbolic in Gears of War

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.150 
are so you know symbolic in Gears of War
that<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.570> really<00:00:51.840> big<00:00:52.079> deal<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:52.920> what

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
that it is really big deal so what

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.729 
that it is really big deal so what
they're<00:00:53.430> coming<00:00:54.390> up<00:00:54.629> with<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.260> replace<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
they're coming up with to replace the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.729 
they're coming up with to replace the
locust<00:00:56.100> they're<00:00:56.250> gonna<00:00:56.430> replace<00:00:56.670> them<00:00:57.120> with

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
locust they're gonna replace them with

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.920 
locust they're gonna replace them with
red<00:00:58.739> cogs<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.520> so<00:01:00.149> basically<00:01:00.239> it's<00:01:00.690> going<00:01:00.840> to

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
red cogs and so basically it's going to

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.750 
red cogs and so basically it's going to
be<00:01:00.989> red<00:01:01.199> vs<00:01:01.590> blue<00:01:01.620> multiplayer<00:01:02.309> kind<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.640> like

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
be red vs blue multiplayer kind of like

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.179 
be red vs blue multiplayer kind of like
halo<00:01:04.040> which<00:01:05.540> it<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.140> really<00:01:07.530> big<00:01:07.710> change<00:01:08.070> but

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
halo which it is a really big change but

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.420 
halo which it is a really big change but
what<00:01:08.490> I'm<00:01:08.610> thinking<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.180> myself<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.840> that

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
what I'm thinking to myself is that

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.649 
what I'm thinking to myself is that
functionally<00:01:11.430> it's<00:01:11.670> gonna<00:01:11.970> work<00:01:12.210> out<00:01:12.420> better

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
functionally it's gonna work out better

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.170 
functionally it's gonna work out better
because<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.830> COG<00:01:14.070> have<00:01:14.369> way<00:01:14.640> better<00:01:14.850> hit

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
because the COG have way better hit

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.700 
because the COG have way better hit
boxes<00:01:15.600> than<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.869> locust<00:01:16.200> have<00:01:16.350> there'll<00:01:16.680> be

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
boxes than the locust have there'll be

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.499 
boxes than the locust have there'll be
no<00:01:16.860> more<00:01:16.890> problems<00:01:17.400> with<00:01:17.520> Candice<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.180> savage

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
no more problems with Candice and savage

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.420 
no more problems with Candice and savage
campus<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.170> all<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.409> kind<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.650> thing<00:01:19.860> so

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
campus and all that kind of thing so

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.210 
campus and all that kind of thing so
that's<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.820> positive<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.680> but<00:01:22.680> something

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
that's a positive of it but something

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.560 
that's a positive of it but something
that<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.369> came<00:01:23.640> up<00:01:23.759> with<00:01:23.790> instead<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.330> having

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
that I came up with instead of having

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.140 
that I came up with instead of having
red<00:01:24.900> vs<00:01:25.350> blue<00:01:25.380> cog<00:01:26.250> which<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.729> really<00:01:26.970> really

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
red vs blue cog which is really really

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.499 
red vs blue cog which is really really
strange<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.810> was<00:01:28.290> thinking<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.770> maybe<00:01:29.509> the

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
strange I was thinking that maybe the

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.230 
strange I was thinking that maybe the
COG<00:01:30.990> could<00:01:31.290> face<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.590> UI<00:01:31.950> or<00:01:32.250> which<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.729> you

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
COG could face the UI or which is a you

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.830 
COG could face the UI or which is a you
know<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.630> rival<00:01:34.320> army<00:01:34.650> in<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:35.040> on<00:01:35.340> Sarah<00:01:36.180> if<00:01:36.509> you

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
know the rival army in a on Sarah if you

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.149

humans that the COG we're fighting but

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.660 
humans that the COG we're fighting but
what<00:01:49.649> do<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.799> guys<00:01:49.920> think<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.280> this<00:01:50.399> do<00:01:50.640> you

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
what do you guys think of this do you

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.670 
what do you guys think of this do you
think<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.240> really<00:01:51.540> big<00:01:51.750> deal<00:01:53.479> you<00:01:54.479> know

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
think it's a really big deal you know

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.730 
think it's a really big deal you know
cosmetically<00:01:55.680> it's<00:01:56.040> it's<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.520> big<00:01:56.700> change<00:01:57.030> but

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
cosmetically it's it's a big change but

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.899 
cosmetically it's it's a big change but
functionally<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.770> think<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.310> will<00:01:59.490> work<00:01:59.520> out

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
functionally I think it will work out

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.060 
functionally I think it will work out
better<00:02:00.149> but<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:01.229> know<00:02:01.259> leave<00:02:01.740> your<00:02:01.860> thoughts
