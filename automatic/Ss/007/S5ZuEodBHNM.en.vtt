reflection<00:00:32.289> in<00:00:32.379> the<00:00:32.469> eye<00:00:32.500> perhaps<00:00:33.010> you<00:00:33.129> could

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
reflection in the eye perhaps you could

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.529 
reflection in the eye perhaps you could
just<00:00:33.370> demonstrate<00:00:33.879> it<00:00:33.969> on<00:00:34.059> my<00:00:34.210> colleague

00:00:34.529 --> 00:00:34.539 
just demonstrate it on my colleague

Joyce here sure if we if we look now how

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:39.389 
Joyce here sure if we if we look now how
the<00:00:38.140> light<00:00:38.379> is<00:00:38.409> working<00:00:38.800> on<00:00:38.859> Joyce<00:00:39.100> you<00:00:39.280> get

00:00:39.389 --> 00:00:39.399 
the light is working on Joyce you get

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:40.410 
the light is working on Joyce you get
the<00:00:39.489> beautiful<00:00:39.760> little<00:00:40.089> ring<00:00:40.239> light

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
the beautiful little ring light

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.450 
the beautiful little ring light
reflection<00:00:40.989> you<00:00:41.379> notice<00:00:41.649> the<00:00:41.829> super<00:00:42.249> soft

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
reflection you notice the super soft

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.520 
reflection you notice the super soft
shadowing<00:00:42.999> now<00:00:43.569> the<00:00:43.629> light<00:00:43.989> at<00:00:44.170> the<00:00:44.229> moment<00:00:44.289> is

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
shadowing now the light at the moment is

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.160 
shadowing now the light at the moment is
calibrated<00:00:45.100> to<00:00:45.190> 5600<00:00:46.059> Kelvin<00:00:46.089> I'm<00:00:46.899> going<00:00:47.109> to

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
calibrated to 5600 Kelvin I'm going to

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.200 
calibrated to 5600 Kelvin I'm going to
add<00:00:47.260> a<00:00:47.289> second<00:00:47.829> light<00:00:48.039> from<00:00:48.429> the<00:00:48.579> site<00:00:48.819> to<00:00:49.089> give

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
add a second light from the site to give

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.819 
add a second light from the site to give
us<00:00:49.300> that<00:00:49.449> instant<00:00:49.839> fashion<00:00:50.170> photography<00:00:50.679> look

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
us that instant fashion photography look

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.610 
us that instant fashion photography look
so<00:00:51.370> side<00:00:51.639> fill<00:00:52.030> quarter<00:00:53.019> fill<00:00:53.229> we<00:00:53.469> could

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
so side fill quarter fill we could

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.559 
so side fill quarter fill we could
bounce<00:00:53.769> it<00:00:54.039> from<00:00:54.219> above<00:00:54.460> off<00:00:54.639> Joyce's<00:00:55.420> hair

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:55.569 
bounce it from above off Joyce's hair

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:57.180 
bounce it from above off Joyce's hair
there<00:00:55.780> or<00:00:56.260> we<00:00:56.319> could<00:00:56.469> go<00:00:56.559> all<00:00:56.769> the<00:00:56.920> way<00:00:56.949> behind

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
there or we could go all the way behind

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.399 
there or we could go all the way behind
and<00:00:57.519> give<00:00:57.639> you<00:00:57.699> that<00:00:57.850> nice<00:00:58.030> little<00:00:58.409> instant

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
and give you that nice little instant

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:00.899 
and give you that nice little instant
through<00:00:59.739> the<00:00:59.979> through<00:01:00.339> the<00:01:00.429> hair<00:01:00.609> look<00:01:00.789> like

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:00.909 
through the through the hair look like

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:02.699 
through the through the hair look like
that<00:01:01.179> which<00:01:01.329> is<00:01:01.449> very<00:01:01.479> nice<00:01:01.719> okay<00:01:02.139> the<00:01:02.530> great

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:02.709 
that which is very nice okay the great

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:04.799 
that which is very nice okay the great
thing<00:01:02.920> with<00:01:03.039> the<00:01:03.190> kit<00:01:03.399> is<00:01:03.609> that<00:01:03.850> you<00:01:04.089> you<00:01:04.600> get

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
thing with the kit is that you you get

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.710 
thing with the kit is that you you get
inside<00:01:05.379> each<00:01:05.530> light<00:01:06.299> calibration<00:01:07.299> filters

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
inside each light calibration filters

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.200 
inside each light calibration filters
which<00:01:08.590> drop<00:01:08.920> into<00:01:09.250> the<00:01:09.400> filter<00:01:09.790> holder<00:01:10.030> here

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
which drop into the filter holder here

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.090 
which drop into the filter holder here
the<00:01:10.780> filters<00:01:11.170> allow<00:01:11.410> us<00:01:11.560> to<00:01:11.680> change<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:12.070> color

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
the filters allow us to change the color

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.010 
the filters allow us to change the color
temperature<00:01:12.520> from<00:01:12.940> bright<00:01:13.300> blue<00:01:13.570> daylight

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
temperature from bright blue daylight

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.840 
temperature from bright blue daylight
through<00:01:14.590> calibrated<00:01:15.160> studio<00:01:15.400> daylight<00:01:15.730> all

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
through calibrated studio daylight all

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.310 
through calibrated studio daylight all
the<00:01:16.000> way<00:01:16.090> down<00:01:16.240> to<00:01:16.360> tungsten<00:01:16.600> like<00:01:16.990> this<00:01:17.170> one

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
the way down to tungsten like this one

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.490 
the way down to tungsten like this one
we<00:01:18.160> include<00:01:18.430> ND<00:01:19.060> filters<00:01:19.450> for<00:01:19.570> dimming<00:01:19.780> it<00:01:20.020> at

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
we include ND filters for dimming it at

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.560 
we include ND filters for dimming it at
to<00:01:20.710> 1:6<00:01:21.070> diffuser<00:01:21.430> for<00:01:21.640> diffusing<00:01:22.090> and<00:01:22.270> also

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
to 1:6 diffuser for diffusing and also

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.330 
to 1:6 diffuser for diffusing and also
magenta<00:01:22.990> control<00:01:23.320> for<00:01:23.470> the<00:01:23.530> cinematographers

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
magenta control for the cinematographers

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.430 
magenta control for the cinematographers
all<00:01:24.880> the<00:01:25.090> filters<00:01:25.420> are<00:01:25.570> stored<00:01:25.810> inside<00:01:26.020> the

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
all the filters are stored inside the

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.200 
all the filters are stored inside the
light<00:01:26.590> nice<00:01:27.010> each<00:01:27.370> one<00:01:27.640> is<00:01:27.730> numbered<00:01:27.760> so<00:01:28.090> you

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
light nice each one is numbered so you

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.310 
light nice each one is numbered so you
can<00:01:28.360> see<00:01:28.510> exactly<00:01:28.780> what<00:01:29.050> it<00:01:29.170> is

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
can see exactly what it is

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.620 
can see exactly what it is
so<00:01:29.500> Elliot<00:01:30.010> proved<00:01:30.310> it<00:01:30.670> well<00:01:31.030> a<00:01:31.210> relatively

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
so Elliot proved it well a relatively

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.310 
so Elliot proved it well a relatively
idiot-proof

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
idiot-proof

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.380 
idiot-proof
and<00:01:32.410> also<00:01:32.890> it<00:01:33.400> runs<00:01:33.640> on<00:01:33.790> three<00:01:34.090> double<00:01:34.300> A

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
and also it runs on three double A

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.420 
and also it runs on three double A
batteries<00:01:34.420> you<00:01:35.020> get<00:01:35.140> four<00:01:35.440> hours<00:01:35.800> runtime

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
batteries you get four hours runtime

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.640 
batteries you get four hours runtime
from<00:01:36.790> three<00:01:37.600> double-a<00:01:37.930> lithium

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650

three-and-a-half from three double a
alkaline<00:01:40.660> so<00:01:41.200> really<00:01:41.650> really<00:01:41.800> good<00:01:41.950> battery

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
alkaline so really really good battery

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.440 
alkaline so really really good battery
life<00:01:42.370> and<00:01:42.610> great<00:01:42.820> things<00:01:42.970> batteries<00:01:43.330> are

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450
