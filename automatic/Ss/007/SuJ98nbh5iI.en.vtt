00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.410
 as 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.930
 6 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.670
 we will see one of the most common major problems 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.469
 I have students who for the backhand in one hand 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.029
 that is to say of preparation 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.029
 very late 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.320
 which prevents any speed for players to develop a movement 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.830
 rebel 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.330
 sufficiently resume to have power 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:31.839
 more than fifty German chains kick the ball in front of him 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.770
 so we see that the player also predict directly late to 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.170
 the horizontal to not miss stop 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.460
 at the end of preparation 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.550
 before heading back to the bar 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.970
 the player is practically obliged to rely on the speed of the ball 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.870
 further communicated 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.460
 sailing speed from a stopped start last 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.690
 m 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.820
 the place a fragile truce slightly 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.210
 up but practically his record is ready to start from the good 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.340
 foot 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.340
 on the other hand not bad 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.870
 ap 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.540
 sprawling on his grave hurt when the short ball it does not necessarily cost a 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.570
 handicap 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.910
 ap 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.720
 on the other hand anything of the role more and more the player is often 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.070
 caught up the bullet hit the front line career 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.350
 so I have nice player the provincial champion is here 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.480
 from the preparation the beginning of the preparation of the treatment what allows 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:46.069
 at the racket it went very far backwards eberle 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.070
 philippe ouakrat who was far above the shoulder she takes the 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.100
 curve speed of swaps 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.060
 send by SMS the word above the shoulder she waits 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.999
 she accelerated in December to hit the ball 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.179
 m 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:08.349
 so we have a large squad 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.129
 which allows to change that we will ask the players to position their 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.769
 snowshoe over his shoulder make contact with his buddy for 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.329
 leave the sensation 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.409
 all on snowshoes 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.389
 as soon as possible, that is, as soon as the opponent hits the ball 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:26.519
 further east 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.969
 place his racket so above his shoulder 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:33.999
 once he's here he'll wait for philippe the right moment to hit himself 

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:34.799
 the ball 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.769
 in front of 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.509
 m 

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:43.009
 then the fact of arms prepared by the fact that looked at it without moufter 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:46.259
 gaining speed is like the beginning has already been done the player 

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:49.259
 did not take speed by the oms 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:53.749
 finally I respect a lot more 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:56.399
 and shoulders are also turned 

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:59.159
 a bit more 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:06.299
 so after a few repetitions two players to naturally integrate the 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.179
 moment 

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:12.359
 yes little by little we think he's quite in the head about 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:13.069
 shoulders 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.159
 but the movement will have been corrected the player will not leave at best to turn 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.159
 shoulders shoulders early enough 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:24.409
 a town 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.409
 as for the order of players 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:31.359
 gauthier is apparently too salty 

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:38.760
 then the comparison between the proactive sale and after so we can see the 

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:43.239
 difference in the form of the preparation in the first case the 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.839
 principality directly the pope in the second quarter and provoked by 

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:49.839
 red mud does not stop it's speeding downhill 

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:57.739
 then another example for the same defect in this player there who premium this 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.739
 little speed in preparation for betting is very direct 

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:07.349
 do you see russie twenty-four stops the ramparts he lost a lot of 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.359
 time the initiative could have had this year 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.359
 I had gone after having done work 

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:18.470
 with the same idea the fix always what is avoided by bangkok 

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:22.560
 different species that allows to play high balls agglo 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.379
 without much difficulty 

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:29.459
 taken by the project on that ball the player prepared whose base is 

00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:30.409
 very very good 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:35.339
 another difficult target but as he prepared well he is not embarrassed him 

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:37.279
 through dialogue 

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:40.279
 without much difficulty 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.610
 by comparison the guangxi before and after the encounter the player prepares 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.789
 a lot more always right 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:53.319
 same rink at the same time 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:58.129
 I'm glad to see him I think it's still possible 

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:03.999
 his racket gaining momentum at first he is taken speed 

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:06.999
 in the accursed temple put speed 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.580
