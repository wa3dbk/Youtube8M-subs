00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:09.490
 we will review despatch pocher house very 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.240
 very simple a few spices a little bit 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.099
 syrup dispatch 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.920
 there just that we will start with 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.600
 world and the peaches you make a second 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.970
 more than 1 6 days are three as we 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.160
 wants there again that will allow that 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.080
 heat makes first in so at 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.340
 boiling 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.500
 so we left the boiling water 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.119
 no turenne room on the no 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.769
 water broth 3 0 water take him 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.539
 over twelve seconds 12 seconds 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:35.200
 boiling scene a principle that the atom 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:39.050
 is very convenient 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.640
 let's go let's go 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.100
 12 seconds I am the master of time 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.750
 cemac chronometer that's twelve 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.960
 second we are going to exist only now at 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.540
 so he immediately said us in 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.670
 earnings 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.519
 alas his specs alone but what 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.720
 is very important that we do not have 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.850
 all expensive on the skin and we look 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.019
 really the beautiful aspect of fishing 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.329
 a cold water has undergone some 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.610
 ice cubes do not hesitate to really 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.690
 stop cooking 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.600
 it's exactly the same as tomatoes 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.800
 in fact in this sense but it's all alone 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.220
 a quarter of the lions did well here 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.600
 like that it's nickel turned alone 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.860
 the peaches are shown we will go to 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.020
 the realization of the syrup now 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:26.740
 let's go there it's up to you then to 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:29.330
 sugar water 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:36.970
 we will scrape the vanilla pod but 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:41.780
 we put all we will put and note also 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:43.849
 writer or revulsion starts I 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.360
 will put a little bit of zest 

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:48.770
 of lemon for that which can be perfumed 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.130
 a little bit of control as we hurt 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.509
 if too much orange hibiscus a little stick 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.160
 of licorice really you put the 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.840
 spices you like Let's 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.610
 perfectly really your site I 'm going 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.500
 put a little lemon 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.660
 it will allow fisheries to 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.880
 do not oxidize we have the zest the juice the 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:08.810
 vanilla a little cinnamon stick the hour 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.800
 we stick ourselves pepper and now 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.780
 we let it boil 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.560
 important she will go up to an audition 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.560
 just ambition 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.970
 here are two first demolition for 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.980
 that the spices the spices at one this 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.810
 that conceives a small post had syrup 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.340
 a little bit reduced now 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.270
 we will put the peaches but small 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.830
 detail that is important 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.000
 we will lower the fire so that it shudders 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.209
 without boiling so as not to shock 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.370
 does not preclude that so have delicately we 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.020
 puts the Jordanian peaches the number of 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.000
 fishing that's what's important 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.890
 it is to have a container to adapt its 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.880
 followers if you put a peach there 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.470
 will be a lot a lot of syrup and 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.060
 so you 're diluted what is 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.690
 important is to find the right 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.209
 balanced 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:54.440
 see pear tree just tall on the 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:56.780
 fisheries and it would have been good here we are we 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.100
 is one is at height and on age 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.890
 slightly but it's not very serious 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.760
 alas this little trick we will put 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.350
 a small rag in clean 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.940
 does it will fill up with water it goes 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.250
 maintain moisture on each phase 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.480
 of our fisheries 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.040
 it's going to keep steaming it's going to keep 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.140
 the humidity our peaches are good 81 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.239
 points worship there christophe time cooking 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.780
 15 20 minutes to small 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.870
 stirrings 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.860
 so there no cutlery we go there this ifa 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.860
 the ismans by a 15 minutes
