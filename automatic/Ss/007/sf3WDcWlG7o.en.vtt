did that a lot for a long time um and

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.540 
did that a lot for a long time um and
that<00:02:15.180> still<00:02:15.810> didn't<00:02:16.110> even<00:02:16.260> really<00:02:16.710> fix<00:02:17.100> it<00:02:17.310> it

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550

more than half

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.790 
more than half
but<00:02:21.330> obviously<00:02:21.570> that's<00:02:22.290> something<00:02:22.350> that's

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
but obviously that's something that's

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.400

it's<00:03:07.200> going<00:03:07.740> to<00:03:07.830> be<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:07.950> similar<00:03:08.310> price

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
it's going to be a similar price

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.580 
it's going to be a similar price

that it still feels better than it looks
I<00:05:00.570> think<00:05:00.900> that<00:05:01.170> unfortunately<00:05:01.950> because<00:05:02.340> of

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
I think that unfortunately because of

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.670 
I think that unfortunately because of
the<00:05:02.580> tone<00:05:02.790> of<00:05:02.820> my<00:05:03.150> skin<00:05:03.180> it<00:05:03.750> will<00:05:04.260> always

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
the tone of my skin it will always

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.160 
the tone of my skin it will always
because<00:05:05.130> I'm<00:05:05.250> so<00:05:05.520> fair<00:05:05.910> the<00:05:06.510> redness<00:05:06.960> and

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
because I'm so fair the redness and

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.030 
because I'm so fair the redness and
irritation<00:05:07.410> and<00:05:08.130> possibly<00:05:08.610> even<00:05:08.700> scarring<00:05:09.540> is

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
irritation and possibly even scarring is

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.980 
irritation and possibly even scarring is
what's<00:05:11.040> left<00:05:11.250> over<00:05:11.460> so<00:05:11.940> yes<00:05:12.570> I<00:05:12.780> do<00:05:12.840> think

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
what's left over so yes I do think

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.420 
what's left over so yes I do think
that's<00:05:13.410> improved<00:05:13.770> it<00:05:13.890> doesn't<00:05:14.100> look<00:05:14.220> as

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:38.009 
and that's if I had to describe it in

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:39.920

some way it's not unpleasant at all in

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.290 
some way it's not unpleasant at all in
my<00:06:40.470> opinion<00:06:40.500> in<00:06:41.159> fact<00:06:41.460> they<00:06:41.669> consider<00:06:42.060> it<00:06:42.180> to

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 
my opinion in fact they consider it to

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.529 
my opinion in fact they consider it to
be<00:06:42.330> fragrance<00:06:42.930> free<00:06:43.259> and<00:06:44.030> I<00:06:45.030> would<00:06:45.210> say<00:06:45.360> yes

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:45.539 
be fragrance free and I would say yes

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:47.330 
be fragrance free and I would say yes
that's<00:06:45.840> that's<00:06:46.199> basically<00:06:46.439> fragrance<00:06:47.129> free

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 
that's that's basically fragrance free

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.610 
that's that's basically fragrance free
especially<00:06:47.699> once<00:06:48.150> you've<00:06:48.300> put<00:06:48.539> it<00:06:48.629> on<00:06:48.780> the

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620 
especially once you've put it on the

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.339 
especially once you've put it on the
formula<00:06:50.129> is<00:06:50.280> wonderful<00:06:50.879> you<00:06:51.419> want<00:06:51.659> to<00:06:51.870> use

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:52.349 
formula is wonderful you want to use

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:55.279 
formula is wonderful you want to use
less<00:06:52.650> than<00:06:52.949> maybe<00:06:53.099> you<00:06:53.340> would<00:06:53.490> be<00:06:54.080> inclined<00:06:55.080> to

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:55.289 
less than maybe you would be inclined to

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:57.830 
less than maybe you would be inclined to
because<00:06:56.009> if<00:06:56.280> you<00:06:56.370> put<00:06:56.550> too<00:06:56.699> much<00:06:56.729> on<00:06:57.120> it<00:06:57.569> has

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 
because if you put too much on it has

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.719 
because if you put too much on it has
trouble<00:06:58.229> drying<00:06:58.500> and<00:06:58.949> it<00:06:59.250> doesn't<00:06:59.610> become

00:06:59.719 --> 00:06:59.729 
trouble drying and it doesn't become

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:03.020 
trouble drying and it doesn't become
greasy<00:07:00.560> but<00:07:01.560> it<00:07:01.680> is<00:07:01.860> a<00:07:01.889> little<00:07:02.219> bit<00:07:02.340> sticky<00:07:02.729> so

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:03.030 
greasy but it is a little bit sticky so

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:04.399 
greasy but it is a little bit sticky so
your<00:07:03.300> arms<00:07:03.569> will<00:07:03.810> look<00:07:03.930> stick<00:07:04.169> to<00:07:04.289> your

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:04.409 
your arms will look stick to your

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:07.219 
your arms will look stick to your
clothing<00:07:05.060> but<00:07:06.060> that's<00:07:06.240> only<00:07:06.389> if<00:07:06.629> you<00:07:06.780> go<00:07:06.960> way

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:07.229 
clothing but that's only if you go way

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:09.680 
clothing but that's only if you go way
overboard<00:07:07.590> and<00:07:07.949> put<00:07:08.099> too<00:07:08.250> much<00:07:08.430> on<00:07:08.699> I<00:07:09.090> think

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:09.690 
overboard and put too much on I think

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.330 
overboard and put too much on I think
you've<00:07:09.810> got<00:07:09.960> to<00:07:09.990> kind<00:07:10.229> of<00:07:10.379> really<00:07:10.680> really<00:07:11.219> go

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:11.340 
you've got to kind of really really go

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.369 
you've got to kind of really really go
