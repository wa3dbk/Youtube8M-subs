00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.630
 Friday 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:17.670
 excellent this week I'm more than 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.289
 happy for two very important reasons the 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.660
 first of them is because today is 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.210
 Friday today is Friday and it means that 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.789
 there are fashion videos and the second is for 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.789
 the more than 100 subscribers that I have 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.610
 we do with the theme of the week 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.280
 to a concert we meet with 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.940
 different types of people obviously 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.280
 those dance for factors like the artist 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.520
 the gender and the place where it is 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:56.330
 holding on to get but these 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.220
 are the most common sound about 60 and 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.420
 something 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.420
 usually this happens to me 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.850
 and then nothing and if we are in the middle of 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.610
 the people who push us that the person 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.340
 to face us be a woman and 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.710
 every time you skip spring which 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.899
 we had the face is the worst 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.780
 is talking with the backs a 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.429
 hairy a city about five miles 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.759
 men do not take off their shirts in a 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:40.880
 no concert and there is also that 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:46.060
 person where are we 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.060
 super good and the stick 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.590
 what other kind of people do we 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.030
 we find in a concert are those that 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.030
 they're stuck on the phone 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:07.049
 we are always pretty good 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.049
 arranged and we finished like this 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.209
 and you end up with a sweat that does not even 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.790
 is yours and ends up coming to my council 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.459
 that was the video of the extra week 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.959
 I liked the little hand up and leave it in 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.209
 the comments that another kind of 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.239
 people we can find in considering 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.310
 and in the face of expansion before I leave the 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.560
 link my first video more if I do not 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.810
 have you seen and also social networks 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.810
 like facebook or facebook 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.569
 a profession 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.700
 many kisses bye 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.239
 how to say is saying 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.239

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.530
