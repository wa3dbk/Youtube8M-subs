00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
what that allows you to do of course is

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.420 
what that allows you to do of course is
the<00:03:21.299> cooldown<00:03:21.690> reduction<00:03:21.840> but<00:03:22.739> you<00:03:22.890> times<00:03:23.160> out

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
the cooldown reduction but you times out

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.160 
the cooldown reduction but you times out
with<00:03:23.670> your<00:03:23.790> blinding<00:03:24.239> flash<00:03:24.510> that<00:03:25.049> will

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
with your blinding flash that will

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.110 
with your blinding flash that will
reduce<00:03:25.320> its<00:03:25.620> cool<00:03:25.859> down<00:03:26.100> on<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.730> other<00:03:26.850> side

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
reduce its cool down on the other side

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.990 
reduce its cool down on the other side
my<00:03:28.049> main<00:03:28.260> damage<00:03:28.530> dealing<00:03:28.890> move<00:03:29.519> i'm<00:03:29.790> not

or<00:03:34.590> triple<00:03:35.190> s<00:03:35.310> i<00:03:35.459> would<00:03:35.549> like<00:03:35.700> to<00:03:35.820> call<00:03:36.000> it<00:03:36.260> so

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
or triple s i would like to call it so

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.620 
or triple s i would like to call it so
its<00:03:37.680> cooldown<00:03:38.070> is<00:03:38.130> already<00:03:38.579> reduced<00:03:38.910> to<00:03:39.060> 23

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
its cooldown is already reduced to 23

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.870 
its cooldown is already reduced to 23
and<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:40.200> twenty<00:03:40.500> percent<00:03:40.769> more<00:03:41.010> reduction<00:03:41.519> from

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.729 
them from my passive my passive skill
would<00:03:44.579> allow<00:03:44.820> me<00:03:44.850> to<00:03:45.180> well<00:03:45.390> spam<00:03:46.290> it<00:03:46.470> is<00:03:46.590> as

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
secrets of this bill one thing we all

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.759 
secrets of this bill one thing we all
need<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:50.970> understand<00:03:51.420> on<00:03:51.570> ubers<00:03:51.989> is<00:03:52.170> they<00:03:52.620> all

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
need to understand on ubers is they all

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.410 
need to understand on ubers is they all
have<00:03:53.040> an<00:03:53.160> ability<00:03:53.400> to<00:03:53.609> do<00:03:53.820> a<00:03:53.850> massive<00:03:54.150> attack

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
have an ability to do a massive attack

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.809 
have an ability to do a massive attack
and<00:03:54.870> attack<00:03:55.230> that<00:03:55.470> is<00:03:55.799> of<00:03:55.920> course<00:03:56.100> has<00:03:56.489> a<00:03:56.519> cool

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
and attack that is of course has a cool

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.370 
and attack that is of course has a cool
down<00:03:57.030> i<00:03:57.060> believe<00:03:57.480> on<00:03:57.569> base<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:58.019> on<00:03:58.170> them

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
down i believe on base and on them

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.440 
down i believe on base and on them
somehow<00:03:58.650> so<00:03:59.190> they<00:03:59.280> can<00:03:59.430> only<00:03:59.579> do<00:03:59.819> it<00:03:59.850> once<00:04:00.180> in<00:04:00.359> a

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
somehow so they can only do it once in a

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.390 
somehow so they can only do it once in a
while<00:04:00.630> like<00:04:01.290> you<00:04:01.560> know<00:04:01.680> siege<00:04:01.950> breakers

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
while like you know siege breakers

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.759 
while like you know siege breakers
three-pronged<00:04:02.940> attack<00:04:03.090> and<00:04:03.510> this<00:04:03.959> guy<00:04:04.200> right

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
three-pronged attack and this guy right

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.890 
three-pronged attack and this guy right
well<00:04:05.069> rakha<00:04:05.310> not<00:04:05.549> his<00:04:05.790> spinning<00:04:06.180> attack<00:04:06.480> or<00:04:06.660> is

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
well rakha not his spinning attack or is

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.990 
well rakha not his spinning attack or is
you<00:04:06.989> know<00:04:07.109> teleport<00:04:07.560> attack<00:04:07.799> on<00:04:07.980> you<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.400> the

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
you know teleport attack on you and the

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.120 
you know teleport attack on you and the
way<00:04:09.150> that<00:04:09.329> would<00:04:09.690> this<00:04:09.810> build<00:04:10.109> works<00:04:10.380> is<00:04:10.650> I<00:04:10.829> try

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
way that would this build works is I try

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.740 
way that would this build works is I try
and<00:04:11.190> avoid<00:04:11.489> these<00:04:11.700> attacks<00:04:12.060> even<00:04:12.239> happen<00:04:12.630> in

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
and avoid these attacks even happen in

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.770 
and avoid these attacks even happen in
so<00:04:13.350> the<00:04:13.859> way<00:04:14.010> I<00:04:14.040> achieved<00:04:14.489> that<00:04:14.579> is<00:04:14.910> every<00:04:15.540> time

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
so the way I achieved that is every time

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.300 
so the way I achieved that is every time
he's<00:04:15.930> doing<00:04:16.109> something<00:04:16.470> spinny<00:04:16.739> or<00:04:16.859> not<00:04:17.130> I

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
he's doing something spinny or not I

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.640 
he's doing something spinny or not I
will<00:04:17.459> cast<00:04:17.910> blinding<00:04:18.419> blinding<00:04:18.870> strike<00:04:19.350> on<00:04:19.530> in

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
will cast blinding blinding strike on in

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.620 
will cast blinding blinding strike on in
war<00:04:19.829> yeah<00:04:20.310> I<00:04:20.519> will<00:04:20.940> try<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.209> blind<00:04:21.479> him

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
war yeah I will try and blind him

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.990 
war yeah I will try and blind him
basically<00:04:22.049> and<00:04:22.380> when<00:04:22.950> am<00:04:23.070> I<00:04:23.190> blind<00:04:23.370> is<00:04:23.669> on<00:04:23.789> on<00:04:23.970> a

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
basically and when am I blind is on on a

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000 
basically and when am I blind is on on a
cool<00:04:24.270> down<00:04:24.510> I<00:04:24.750> will<00:04:25.140> cast<00:04:25.349> a<00:04:25.530> seven<00:04:25.800> sided

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
cool down I will cast a seven sided

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.140 
cool down I will cast a seven sided
strike<00:04:26.460> of<00:04:26.669> course

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
strike of course

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.820 
strike of course
blinding<00:04:27.600> is<00:04:27.720> going<00:04:27.900> to<00:04:27.960> my<00:04:28.290> blinding<00:04:28.650> flash

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
blinding is going to my blinding flash

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.379 
blinding is going to my blinding flash
is<00:04:28.979> going<00:04:29.070> to<00:04:29.160> refresh<00:04:29.460> a<00:04:29.580> lot<00:04:29.759> of<00:04:29.820> faster<00:04:30.210> than

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
is going to refresh a lot of faster than

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:33.320 
is going to refresh a lot of faster than
well<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.710> seven<00:04:31.979> sided<00:04:32.190> strike<00:04:32.610> but<00:04:33.060> still

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
well the seven sided strike but still

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.850 
well the seven sided strike but still
the<00:04:33.540> balance<00:04:33.870> would<00:04:33.990> always<00:04:34.350> be<00:04:34.530> to<00:04:34.680> have

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
the balance would always be to have

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.830 
the balance would always be to have
these<00:04:35.100> two<00:04:35.340> skills<00:04:35.669> running<00:04:36.060> up<00:04:36.210> one<00:04:36.660> after

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
these two skills running up one after

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.110 
these two skills running up one after
the<00:04:37.110> other<00:04:37.139> I<00:04:37.590> always<00:04:38.190> keep<00:04:38.370> my<00:04:38.430> heels<00:04:38.820> kill

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
the other I always keep my heels kill
