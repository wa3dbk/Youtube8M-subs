 just the today's game that will see the 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.449
 two teams involved in the 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.449
 cup 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.240
 lennon 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.360
 shot intercepted by the defender 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.730
 shot 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.730
 speaks in game 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.970
 it seemed corner will be just remittance wants 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.970
 bad 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.320
 cross is easy they can start again 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.760
 count you have eaten the goal 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.380
 concluding to the side at the end of one 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.660
 lethal restart 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.410
 the rush to have to finish q3 right-handed 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.410
 expensive rib 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.990
 the opponent retrieves the ball 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.920
 look for the goal the ball slams on the post and 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.920
 return to the field 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.000
 de jong 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.939
 illuminating lance goes forward 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.770
 pedro 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.090
 but surprise goalkeeper 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.560
 we see the shooting attention 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.659
 the mass where no goalkeeper could 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.659
 arrive 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.849
 be nice 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.480
 risk 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.500
 de jong can hurt on the break 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.430
 there is grossa de jong il 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:48.930
 he blocked it with big step reflections 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.930
 the ball this time I would not think about it 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.920
 disk 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.659
 this is the data relating to the number of 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.650
 shots on goal 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:05.650
 advancing towards the area 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.860
 enter the ball clean 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.860
 attention it was a penalty kick 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.040
 but it seemed like a foul to me live 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.750
 net is actually now also replay 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.370
 confirms my first impression is 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.349
 hard to blame the players for 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.879
 a foul but in this case his 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:27.879
 impropriety bags 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.190
 won the challenge with the goalkeeper 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.840
 realizing from the diskette 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.980
 his legs are not shaken and he is 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.980
 managed to goalkeeper facts 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.650
 there are just some of the ball 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.190
 broke nation with a gel e 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.020
 the referee says that the former can suffice 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.060
 45 minutes of play close on 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.650
 score of 1 to 1 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.900
 and as expected this first fraction 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.590
 ended in a tie, there were two 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.590
 teams that are the same 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.750
 we are ready for the beginning of the second 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.750
 time 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.909
 raised forward 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.290
 closes the triangle 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.700
 beautiful 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.390
 attention from there the ball arrives 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.390
 they come into play 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.670
 it goes forward 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.190
 there is a big one 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.979
 prevented opponents from passing 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.229
 in advantage with an excellent intervention 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:02.729
 the game is still open tried to 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.199
 break free but failed to hold the 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.590
 ball in the field 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:06.590
 younis 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.300
 now a game has hit the side 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.300
 crosspiece 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.950
 try to catch on the ball 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:31.180
 on the occasion 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.180
 and the ball he managed to intercept 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.960
 the really is a great parade under 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.210
 goalkeeper was good not to be 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.920
 overcome by such a powerful throw parade 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.270
 which can be fundamental keeps the 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.860
 draw result still in the balance 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.690
 when the end of the 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.830
 match 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.830
 great opportunity for him 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.430
 the goalkeeper 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.430
 at the end 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:05.519
 break the balance with this 

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:08.869
 Calvary in advantage of the direction ci 

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:08.869
 reproposes the goal from another angle 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.240
 father catch the goalkeeper 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:29.160
 about term and I'm always ahead of 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.160
 a net a brightness 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.950
 and this attempt is to want to thank 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.960
 the pole 

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:45.060
 a wasted opportunity has room for 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.060
 act attention network 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.250
 day to surrender the goalkeeper is not the 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.530
 first goal he suffers today and could 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.630
 don't even be the last to judge 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.340
 from how he is playing, the comrades seek 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.710
 it is not easy to cheer him up 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:09.270
 concentrate in these situations but say 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.270
