has<00:00:22.680> not<00:00:22.890> been<00:00:23.130> giving<00:00:23.430> me<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.869> intensity

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
has not been giving me the intensity

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.859 
has not been giving me the intensity
that<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:26.010> used<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.400> give<00:00:26.609> me<00:00:26.820> when<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.630> first

things that's in it it's gotten nitric

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.920 
things that's in it it's gotten nitric
oxide<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.720> says<00:01:16.049> training<00:01:16.950> intensity<00:01:17.930> driving

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
oxide it says training intensity driving

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.710 
oxide it says training intensity driving
rock<00:01:19.500> hard<00:01:19.860> muscle<00:01:20.610> gains<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.450> all<00:01:21.540> that

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.440 
other stuff so that kind of sounds like
no<00:01:24.420> Xplode<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.200> they've<00:01:25.770> also<00:01:26.070> got<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:27.210> one

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
no Xplode and they've also got this one

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.289 
no Xplode and they've also got this one
called<00:01:27.810> refine<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:29.340> one<00:01:29.520> sounds<00:01:30.000> like<00:01:30.060> this

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.399 

one<00:01:33.299> sounds<00:01:33.689> like<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.869> No

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.160 

this<00:01:38.039> one<00:01:38.249> I<00:01:38.280> think<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.909> kind<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.179> like<00:01:39.359> axis<00:01:39.929> HT

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
this one I think is kind of like axis HT

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.200 
this one I think is kind of like axis HT
this<00:01:41.210> this<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.359> probably<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:43.640> hormone<00:01:44.640> booster

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210
