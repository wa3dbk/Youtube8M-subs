lucrative it's a better basically it's a

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.500 
lucrative it's a better basically it's a
better<00:00:47.219> rate<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.610> does<00:00:47.760> it's<00:00:47.969> not<00:00:48.149> saying<00:00:48.420> that

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
better rate it does it's not saying that

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.900 
better rate it does it's not saying that
it<00:00:48.629> makes<00:00:48.780> more<00:00:49.140> money<00:00:49.500> for<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.579> actual

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
it makes more money for the actual

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.299 
it makes more money for the actual
countries<00:00:51.570> versus<00:00:52.140> their<00:00:52.350> cash<00:00:52.530> crops<00:00:52.829> what

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
countries versus their cash crops what

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.830 
countries versus their cash crops what
it<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.520> it's<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:53.789> higher<00:00:53.969> retention<00:00:54.329> rate<00:00:54.660> so

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
it is it's a higher retention rate so

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.619 
it is it's a higher retention rate so
for<00:00:55.050> every<00:00:55.260> dollar<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.680> comes<00:00:55.860> in<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.969> think

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
for every dollar that comes in I think

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.139 
for every dollar that comes in I think
they<00:00:57.690> said<00:00:57.870> 98<00:00:58.620> 98<00:00:59.309> or<00:00:59.550> ninety-five<00:00:59.969> percent

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
they said 98 98 or ninety-five percent

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.389 
they said 98 98 or ninety-five percent
of<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.600> dollar<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.410> 98<00:01:01.800> cents<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.309> dollar

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
of that dollar so 98 cents on the dollar

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.810 
of that dollar so 98 cents on the dollar
stays<00:01:03.300> within<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.719> country<00:01:04.309> as<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.460> get<00:01:05.610> cash

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
stays within the country as you get cash

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.490 
stays within the country as you get cash
crops<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.360> then<00:01:06.810> for<00:01:07.049> every<00:01:07.110> dollar<00:01:07.350> that

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
crops and then for every dollar that

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.560 
crops and then for every dollar that
comes<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.950> some<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.820> money<00:01:08.970> goes

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
comes in some of that money goes

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.350 
comes in some of that money goes
elsewhere<00:01:10.020> outside<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.040> country<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.580> when

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
elsewhere outside of the country so when

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.690 
elsewhere outside of the country so when
you've<00:01:12.540> got<00:01:12.780> virtual<00:01:13.650> farming<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.369> money

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
you've got virtual farming that money

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.280 
you've got virtual farming that money
stays<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.030> there<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.479> these<00:01:15.630> video<00:01:15.960> games<00:01:16.020> that

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
stays in there so these video games that

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.649 
stays in there so these video games that
