pick<00:02:52.860> 10<00:02:53.860> names<00:02:54.130> for<00:02:54.850> my<00:02:54.880> subscriber<00:02:55.390> list<00:02:55.660> and

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
pick 10 names for my subscriber list and

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.100 
pick 10 names for my subscriber list and
two<00:02:56.740> names<00:02:57.010> from<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:58.540> comments<00:02:58.960> down

two names from the the comments down

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.930 
two names from the the comments down
below<00:02:59.290> and<00:02:59.620> the<00:03:00.250> reason<00:03:00.520> is<00:03:00.640> such<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:00.790> big

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
below and the reason is such a big

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.460 
below and the reason is such a big
difference<00:03:00.970> is<00:03:01.390> because<00:03:01.660> if<00:03:01.780> I<00:03:01.900> pick<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.260> same

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
difference is because if I pick the same

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.800 
difference is because if I pick the same
amount<00:03:02.590> people<00:03:02.980> are<00:03:03.340> not<00:03:03.550> going<00:03:04.240> to<00:03:04.360> do<00:03:04.450> one<00:03:04.690> or

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
amount people are not going to do one or

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.920 
amount people are not going to do one or
the<00:03:04.840> other<00:03:04.930> and<00:03:05.200> I<00:03:05.290> want<00:03:05.530> both<00:03:06.130> to<00:03:06.550> be<00:03:07.000> just<00:03:07.780> as

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
the other and I want both to be just as

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.600 
the other and I want both to be just as
important<00:03:08.260> as<00:03:08.320> the<00:03:08.410> other<00:03:08.530> one<00:03:08.710> and<00:03:09.160> if<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:09.430> make

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
important as the other one and if I make

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.340 
important as the other one and if I make
10<00:03:09.910> from<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.210> subscriber<00:03:10.660> list<00:03:10.900> I<00:03:11.050> think
