00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.859
 everyone knows maury is so 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.990
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.870
 prey carrot candies 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.980
 for shows so that's why we 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:18.390
 will need a carrot of flour from 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:21.750
 any brand was good and of 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.630
 water mainly after we can 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.210
 add wheat germs or herbs 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.280
 of Provence 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.940
 it all depends on what your horse m 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:41.880
 my body to start we will cut the 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:43.910
 carrot it must be cut in very small 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.910
 parts 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.810
 so 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.170
 so that gives about that 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.320
 So here we take the whole carrot is 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.320
 put in a bowl 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.210
 and we continue 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.330
 so we can also do with 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:01.760
 apple bananas like today 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:06.020
 after all depends on your horses so there 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:09.400
 I do with carrot because the 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.400
 horse loves the 40 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.510
 we 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.410
 good 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:51.590
 so then after you cut for me 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.140
 generally I put a little more than one 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:58.010
 half carrots that's not enough what I have 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.840
 already done before after if you have 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.490
 not at all better put a card 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:07.070
 whole to have more common sense 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.430
 cut off the fingers it would be nice if 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.430
 it's possible 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.579
 so I know some will say ah 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:24.960
 but it's easier to give the 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:27.600
 carrot directly or good it's fun if 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:32.220
 it makes time pass and then it's 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:36.630
 pay attention to your horse so good I 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:39.840
 prefer to do like that it's also in 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:45.810
 the more it keeps better than a carrot 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:48.590
 like that during bag so that's it 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.590
 as interesting 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.630
 the 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.020
 I would now like to think of a 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:04.319
 passing do not hesitate to let go 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.750
 comments or send a picture if 

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:09.930
 is your preparation 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:13.129
 something wrong or whatever it is 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.129
 can not hesitate 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:23.260
 that here I put a little thumb if 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:28.780
 you like or do not like 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:34.800
 by the way so here's to do 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:38.550
 then the slope 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.550
 we take the flour 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:47.270
 y'en in antwerp 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:07.930
 necessary and we add water must 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:07.930
 go small not the messiah for so 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.880
 then have to go with my hands so 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.880
 do not hesitate 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.639
 search the Francos 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:31.909
 it's a bit the same principle as the 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.909
 salt dough 

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:38.359
 those who know 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:46.620
 so I add the herbs of 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.620
 provence now
