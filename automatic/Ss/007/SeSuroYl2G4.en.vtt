00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
I'm using this atomic amp it's a power

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.890 
I'm using this atomic amp it's a power
amp<00:00:13.620> and<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:13.920> use<00:00:14.099> it<00:00:14.130> with<00:00:14.460> my<00:00:14.490> ax<00:00:15.240> effects<00:00:15.690> -

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
sounds great and I use two of these

power<00:00:19.109> dams<00:00:19.439> so<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:19.980> get<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.279> stereo

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
power dams so that I get the stereo

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.580 
power dams so that I get the stereo

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
worse if I tap in the back of it a

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.709 
worse if I tap in the back of it a
little<00:00:42.690> bit<00:00:46.789> sometimes<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.940> stops<00:00:48.149> sometimes

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
little bit sometimes it stops sometimes

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.010 
little bit sometimes it stops sometimes
it<00:00:48.870> comes<00:00:48.989> back<00:00:49.289> there's<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.770> vent<00:00:50.309> here<00:00:50.760> and

problem<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.070> don't<00:00:59.129> know<00:00:59.309> if<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.430> check<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.730> out

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
problem I don't know if I check it out

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.460 
problem I don't know if I check it out
riots<00:01:00.149> happen<00:01:02.420> and<00:01:03.420> if<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.629> tap<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.019> pen<00:01:04.229> on<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
riots happen and if I tap the pen on the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.789 
riots happen and if I tap the pen on the
side<00:01:05.630> sometimes<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.930> stops<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.470> don't<00:01:07.680> know

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
side sometimes it stops so I don't know

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.649 
side sometimes it stops so I don't know
I<00:01:08.070> have<00:01:08.220> no<00:01:08.400> idea<00:01:08.670> what<00:01:08.880> I'm<00:01:08.970> gonna<00:01:09.180> do<00:01:09.390> here

but I'm gonna open it up and we'll see

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.030 
but I'm gonna open it up and we'll see
maybe<00:01:11.760> it's<00:01:11.939> loose<00:01:12.210> connection<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:12.990> don't<00:01:13.950> even

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
maybe it's loose connection I don't even

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.649 
maybe it's loose connection I don't even
know<00:01:14.250> why<00:01:14.549> I'm<00:01:14.700> shooting<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.180> video<00:01:15.330> this

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
know why I'm shooting this video this

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.270 
know why I'm shooting this video this
video<00:01:15.869> might<00:01:16.229> never<00:01:16.409> make<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.890> YouTube

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
video might never make it to YouTube

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.149 
video might never make it to YouTube
since<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.759> decided<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.240> do<00:01:18.360> one<00:01:18.540> video<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.900> day

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
since I decided to do one video a day

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.380 
since I decided to do one video a day
some<00:01:20.159> days<00:01:20.310> you're<00:01:20.460> gonna<00:01:20.580> get<00:01:20.759> random<00:01:21.090> videos

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
some days you're gonna get random videos

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.999 
some days you're gonna get random videos
like<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.810> maybe<00:01:22.110> I'll<00:01:22.290> get<00:01:22.409> electrocuted

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
like that maybe I'll get electrocuted

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.660 
like that maybe I'll get electrocuted
and<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.580> gonna<00:01:23.729> go<00:01:23.939> viral<00:01:25.280> see<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.430> tubes

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
and this is gonna go viral see the tubes

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.050 
and this is gonna go viral see the tubes
inside<00:01:27.650> think<00:01:28.650> I'm<00:01:28.770> gonna<00:01:28.920> open<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.880> other

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
inside think I'm gonna open the other

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.090 
inside think I'm gonna open the other
side<00:01:30.360> -<00:01:30.600> just<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:31.110> case<00:01:31.140> -<00:01:31.380> see<00:01:31.740> if<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:31.920> can

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
side - just in case - see if I can

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.490 
side - just in case - see if I can
access<00:01:32.340> better<00:01:32.790> here<00:01:33.210> maybe<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.900> just<00:01:34.079> need<00:01:34.259> to

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
access better here maybe I just need to

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.109 
access better here maybe I just need to
be<00:01:34.590> cleaned<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.009> little<00:01:35.220> bit<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:37.880> just<00:01:38.880> kind<00:01:39.060> of

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
be cleaned a little bit I just kind of

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.649 
be cleaned a little bit I just kind of
moved<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.570> panel<00:01:39.990> around<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.409> little<00:01:40.590> bit<00:01:40.799> and

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
moved the panel around a little bit and

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.660 
moved the panel around a little bit and
tapped<00:01:42.659> on<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.710> tubes<00:01:44.009> inside<00:01:44.430> there's

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
tapped on the the tubes inside there's

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.090 
tapped on the the tubes inside there's
there's<00:01:45.000> two<00:01:45.180> tubes<00:01:45.420> in<00:01:45.659> there<00:01:45.869> I'm<00:01:46.710> not<00:01:46.860> sure

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
there's two tubes in there I'm not sure

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.740 
there's two tubes in there I'm not sure
if<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.369> should<00:01:47.640> have<00:01:47.729> done<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.060> but<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.360> seems

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
if I should have done it but it seems

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.660 
if I should have done it but it seems
that<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.079> stopped<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.130> noise<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.520> not

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
that it stopped so the noise is not

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.920 
that it stopped so the noise is not
there<00:01:50.880> anymore<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.240> don't<00:01:51.570> know<00:01:51.659> if<00:01:51.780> it's

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
there anymore I don't know if it's

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.080 
there anymore I don't know if it's
coincidence<00:01:52.680> I'm<00:01:53.310> gonna<00:01:53.490> leave<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:53.820> on<00:01:54.060> for
