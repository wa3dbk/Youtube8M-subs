 Malanje went well 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:02.930
 simone is unbelievable so much that this 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.540
 boy sings how much he really is 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.590
 a turn for God in that beautiful voice that 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.720
 you have 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.520
 And, look, I'll tell you what, I stayed. 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.230
 very excited, I will not cry because 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.930
 Every time I cry, people are not me anymore. 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:20.180
 crying here more, congratulations 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:22.940
 galindo made a choice a very music 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.680
 difficult the logical way too difficult 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.080
 a complicated metric a harmony 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.850
 complicated is a very large extension 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.580
 proved that you have a vocal range 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.440
 very very nice had a few 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.960
 small starts at the beginning 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.640
 serious but it's natural you're 13 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.860
 What's going on here is years? 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.810
 by a change of voice but it is very 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:46.360
 It has a well tuned placed one vibrato 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.360
 perfect statement, congratulations, my 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.560
 it's awesome to set one thing down 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.240
 so difficult to see a candidate so 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.580
 tuned as you are 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.250
 Your presentation was great but my 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.110
 personal opinion I much prefer when 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.480
 you sing a little more serious the voice 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.360
 looks much prettier but not that your 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:08.710
 Say it anyway, it's worse, not you. 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.710
 sing very well, congratulations 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:19.590
 I called the queue however you can speak the 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:22.379
 celso tadeu by celso tadeu is good 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:26.009
 juninho is really not in terms of 

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:32.479
 up to the current performance of today 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:36.960
 Beira the impeccable but more but more 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:39.870
 I live well and sing well does not just mean 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:43.639
 be very attuned to understanding 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:47.430
 You need to understand the following bug is 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:49.680
 Beware of histrionics 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:53.220
 comes at the moment of the song that you 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.970
 starts to scream a lot and the song does not ask 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.030
 that 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:07:00.180
 You are up in the water as you climbed in 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:03.240
 some extent in the middle of the song there to there 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:05.430
 after that you had not play 11 hours 

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:08.069
 It was now, baby, it does not matter. 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:10.039
 that music is 5 is important is 

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:12.479
 important that he wanted him to have 

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:14.659
 personality of putting the interpretation 

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:15.810
 of him I found that in terms of 

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:17.280
 availability 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:26.370
 You exaggerated a little bit now. 

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:28.580
 was almost closed the account is not 

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:31.319
 that's what I wanted the muqui uncles 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:33.120
 What is histrionismo is that even that 

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:35.969
 too much exaggerated interpretation 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:38.219
 warrior the first time you 

00:07:35.969 --> 00:07:40.650
 This is what this jury is saying here. 

00:07:38.219 --> 00:07:43.259
 histrionismo and it is since the bce is in the 

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:46.199
 My project that unites not premiered 

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:48.569
 I have not talked to rodrigo yet, he's a spiritist. 

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:51.180
 which is why I chose not wheezing sÃ© 

00:07:48.569 --> 00:07:54.840
 You're making something up for 

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:57.500
 say that there he is not very rich there goes 

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.500
 go Go
