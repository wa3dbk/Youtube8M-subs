00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
unfortunately it doesn't have a pump so

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.109 
unfortunately it doesn't have a pump so
when<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.100> do<00:01:05.250> try<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.519> pour<00:01:05.790> out<00:01:05.909> the

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
when you do try to pour out the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.149 
when you do try to pour out the
foundation<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.810> kind<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.229> always<00:01:07.830> pour<00:01:08.130> a

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
foundation you kind of always pour a

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.130 
foundation you kind of always pour a
little<00:01:08.369> bit<00:01:08.580> too<00:01:08.850> much<00:01:09.060> so<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:09.840> don't<00:01:09.900> really

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
little bit too much so I don't really

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.990 
little bit too much so I don't really
like<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:10.619> for<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.549> L'Oreal

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
foundation comes in a squeezy tube so

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.679 
foundation comes in a squeezy tube so
it's<00:01:14.220> really<00:01:14.400> easy<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.820> control<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.479> amount

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
however unlike the Loreal foundation

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.100 
however unlike the Loreal foundation
this<00:04:32.860> does<00:04:33.129> not<00:04:33.370> last<00:04:33.759> on<00:04:34.029> me<00:04:34.270> for<00:04:34.539> very<00:04:34.689> long

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
this does not last on me for very long

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.950 
this does not last on me for very long
the<00:04:35.740> coverage<00:04:36.159> last<00:04:36.460> but<00:04:36.879> not<00:04:37.029> the<00:04:37.090> madness<00:04:37.810> I

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
the coverage last but not the madness I

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.649 
the coverage last but not the madness I
do<00:04:38.080> get<00:04:38.740> oily<00:04:39.249> throughout<00:04:39.580> the<00:04:39.729> day<00:04:39.909> so<00:04:40.509> this

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:40.659 
do get oily throughout the day so this

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:43.170 
do get oily throughout the day so this
isn't<00:04:40.960> a<00:04:41.379> long<00:04:41.770> wearing<00:04:42.189> Matt<00:04:42.550> foundation

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
isn't a long wearing Matt foundation

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.330 
isn't a long wearing Matt foundation
both<00:04:43.419> of<00:04:43.569> these<00:04:43.629> foundations<00:04:44.349> have<00:04:44.800> a<00:04:44.830> medium

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
both of these foundations have a medium

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.640 
both of these foundations have a medium
coverage<00:04:45.789> but<00:04:46.090> it<00:04:46.240> is<00:04:46.270> buildable<00:04:47.020> which<00:04:47.379> I<00:04:47.529> do

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
coverage but it is buildable which I do

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.950 
coverage but it is buildable which I do
not<00:04:47.860> recommend<00:04:48.520> you<00:04:48.819> building<00:04:49.389> up<00:04:49.569> with<00:04:49.779> this

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
not recommend you building up with this

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.320 
not recommend you building up with this
foundation<00:04:50.169> because<00:04:50.560> it<00:04:50.979> does<00:04:51.159> look<00:04:51.330> quite

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
foundation because it does look quite

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.559 
foundation because it does look quite
heavy<00:04:52.689> after<00:04:52.990> two<00:04:53.529> layers<00:04:54.279> or<00:04:54.759> for<00:04:55.150> the<00:04:55.240> fit<00:04:55.419> me

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:55.569 
heavy after two layers or for the fit me

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:57.600 
heavy after two layers or for the fit me
foundation<00:04:55.719> you<00:04:56.199> can<00:04:56.349> actually<00:04:56.529> layer<00:04:57.129> it<00:04:57.430> if

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
foundation you can actually layer it if

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.909 
foundation you can actually layer it if
you<00:04:58.120> use<00:04:58.810> a<00:04:59.050> light<00:04:59.319> hand

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
you use a light hand

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:01.469 
you use a light hand
so<00:05:00.099> which<00:05:00.310> foundation<00:05:00.819> do<00:05:00.909> you<00:05:01.000> think<00:05:01.330> I

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
so which foundation do you think I

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.779 
so which foundation do you think I
prefer<00:05:02.199> over<00:05:03.099> the<00:05:03.279> other

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:03.789 
prefer over the other

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:07.040 
prefer over the other

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
I'll give you maybe two seconds to guess

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.689

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
you are absolutely correct the reason

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.300 
you are absolutely correct the reason
why<00:05:13.270> I<00:05:13.300> like<00:05:13.599> this<00:05:13.810> more<00:05:14.080> is<00:05:14.349> not<00:05:14.949> because<00:05:15.279> of

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
why I like this more is not because of

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.550 
why I like this more is not because of
the<00:05:15.430> price<00:05:15.699> point<00:05:15.729> if<00:05:16.270> this<00:05:16.419> was<00:05:16.629> $12.99<00:05:17.349> I

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
the price point if this was $12.99 I

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.490 
the price point if this was $12.99 I
would<00:05:17.979> still<00:05:18.339> repurchase<00:05:18.969> this<00:05:19.150> I<00:05:19.360> like<00:05:20.289> this

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500
