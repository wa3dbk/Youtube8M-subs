into a room and let's say right here
here's<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.480> room<00:00:12.960> going<00:00:13.139> off<00:00:13.290> if<00:00:13.440> I<00:00:13.530> come<00:00:13.710> in

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
here's a room going off if I come in

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.499 
here's a room going off if I come in
here<00:00:13.980> in<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.160> morning<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:15.150> want<00:00:15.330> sort<00:00:15.420> of

here in the morning and I want sort of
light<00:00:15.660> on<00:00:15.809> first<00:00:16.049> thing<00:00:16.199> but<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:16.529> walk<00:00:16.859> in<00:00:17.010> here

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
light on first thing but I walk in here

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.210 
light on first thing but I walk in here
and<00:00:17.400> I<00:00:17.460> do<00:00:17.520> this<00:00:17.880> action<00:00:18.390> here<00:00:18.660> so<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:19.439> walk<00:00:19.949> on

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
and I do this action here so I walk on

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.330 
and I do this action here so I walk on
in<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:20.880> say<00:00:21.390> okay<00:00:22.380> turn<00:00:22.650> on<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.830> light<00:00:23.039> but

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
in and I say okay turn on the light but

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.640 
in and I say okay turn on the light but
it's<00:00:23.490> not<00:00:23.670> there<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:24.930> have<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.199> stumble<00:00:25.439> over

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
it's not there so I have to stumble over

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.500 
it's not there so I have to stumble over
the<00:00:25.980> dark<00:00:26.220> to<00:00:26.460> cross<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.849> room<00:00:27.029> where<00:00:27.240> someone

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
the dark to cross the room where someone

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.759 
the dark to cross the room where someone
assigned<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.990> light<00:00:28.140> switch<00:00:28.289> all<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.710> way

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
assigned to the light switch all the way

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.220 
assigned to the light switch all the way
across<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.310> room<00:00:29.539> this<00:00:30.539> would<00:00:30.779> solve<00:00:31.019> that

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
across the room this would solve that

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.590 
across the room this would solve that
problem<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:31.740> all<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.189> do<00:00:32.399> it's<00:00:32.940> sticky<00:00:33.420> on<00:00:33.510> the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
problem so all you do it's sticky on the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.780 
problem so all you do it's sticky on the
back<00:00:33.780> or<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.079> can<00:00:34.500> use<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.860> mounted<00:00:35.250> the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
back or you can use the mounted the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.580 
back or you can use the mounted the
little<00:00:36.000> mount<00:00:36.180> Hardware<00:00:36.510> there<00:00:36.719> all<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.559> have

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
little mount Hardware there all you have

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.770 
little mount Hardware there all you have
to<00:00:37.829> do<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.309> peel<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.969> back<00:00:39.120> stick<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.480> put<00:00:39.510> it

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
to do is peel the back stick you put it

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.600 
to do is peel the back stick you put it
exactly<00:00:39.870> where<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.320> want<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.800> just<00:00:41.399> like

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
exactly where you want that just like

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.030 
exactly where you want that just like
that<00:00:41.850> walk<00:00:42.540> into<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.840> room<00:00:43.079> flip<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.530> switch<00:00:43.620> like

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
that walk into a room flip a switch like

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.400 
that walk into a room flip a switch like
any<00:00:44.280> other<00:00:44.460> normal<00:00:44.670> reaction<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.300> boom<00:00:45.660> there

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
any other normal reaction and boom there

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.319 
any other normal reaction and boom there
you<00:00:46.440> go<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.980> got<00:00:47.100> light<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.879> blue<00:00:48.030> make<00:00:48.210> the

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
you go you got light to blue make the

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.940 
you go you got light to blue make the
whole<00:00:48.510> room<00:00:48.539> it's<00:00:49.020> also<00:00:49.170> already<00:00:49.469> bright<00:00:49.829> in

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
whole room it's also already bright in

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.529 
whole room it's also already bright in
here<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.370> can<00:00:50.520> tell<00:00:50.760> but<00:00:50.969> this<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.239> putting

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
here so you can tell but this is putting

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.299 
here so you can tell but this is putting
up<00:00:51.629> quite<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.140> bit<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.469> light<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:52.829> much<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.129> can

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
up quite a bit of light so much you can

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.560 
up quite a bit of light so much you can
no<00:00:53.370> longer<00:00:53.430> see<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.850> switch<00:00:54.120> here<00:00:54.360> right

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
no longer see the switch here right

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.020 
no longer see the switch here right
because<00:00:55.079> it's<00:00:55.350> casting<00:00:55.680> too<00:00:55.890> much<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.760> it

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
because it's casting too much so it

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.580 
because it's casting too much so it
actually<00:00:57.149> L<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.629> pretty<00:00:57.899> good<00:00:58.079> hold<00:00:58.379> there

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
actually L is pretty good hold there

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.860 
actually L is pretty good hold there
really<00:00:58.800> good<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.100> piece<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.879> backing<00:01:00.270> or<00:01:00.539> if<00:01:00.780> you

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
really good a piece of backing or if you

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:01.849 
really good a piece of backing or if you
wanted<00:01:01.050> like<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> permanent<00:01:01.710> permanent

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
wanted like a permanent permanent

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.860 
wanted like a permanent permanent
permanent<00:01:02.219> solution<00:01:02.789> just<00:01:03.510> mount<00:01:03.719> it

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
permanent solution just mount it

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.450 
permanent solution just mount it
anywhere<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.320> want<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.619> but<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.189> is

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
anywhere you want it but this is

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.160 
anywhere you want it but this is
ingenious<00:01:05.880> when<00:01:06.210> we<00:01:06.299> saw<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.659> we<00:01:06.869> knew<00:01:07.020> you

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
ingenious when we saw this we knew you

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.840 
ingenious when we saw this we knew you
guys<00:01:07.320> we're<00:01:07.590> going<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.770> love<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.130> because<00:01:08.310> it

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
guys we're going to love it because it

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.870 
guys we're going to love it because it
solves<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.740> everyday<00:01:10.740> problem<00:01:11.280> in<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.640> very

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
solves a everyday problem in a very

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.499 
solves a everyday problem in a very
unique<00:01:12.330> way<00:01:12.570> but<00:01:13.320> um<00:01:13.530> runs<00:01:14.250> on<00:01:14.430> batteries<00:01:14.850> 100

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
unique way but um runs on batteries 100

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.170 
unique way but um runs on batteries 100
thousand<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.869> hundred<00:01:16.229> thousand<00:01:16.619> our<00:01:16.740> LEDs<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
thousand a hundred thousand our LEDs the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.179 
thousand a hundred thousand our LEDs the
means<00:01:18.360> LED<00:01:19.110> bulbs<00:01:19.439> are<00:01:19.500> never<00:01:19.740> going<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.040> burn

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
means LED bulbs are never going to burn

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.520 
means LED bulbs are never going to burn
out<00:01:20.369> there's<00:01:20.670> eight<00:01:20.939> LEDs<00:01:21.119> all<00:01:21.630> surrounded

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
out there's eight LEDs all surrounded

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.630 
out there's eight LEDs all surrounded
maybe<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.920> can<00:01:23.100> see<00:01:23.310> it

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
maybe you can see it

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.580 
maybe you can see it
probably<00:01:24.600> not<00:01:24.750> but<00:01:24.930> not<00:01:25.080> too<00:01:25.229> much<00:01:25.350> like

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
probably not but not too much like

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.960 
probably not but not too much like
there's<00:01:25.799> eight<00:01:25.950> individual<00:01:26.400> LEDs<00:01:26.759> here

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
there's eight individual LEDs here

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.300 
there's eight individual LEDs here
surrounded<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.869> it's<00:01:28.500> also<00:01:28.680> really<00:01:28.829> good<00:01:29.250> for

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
surrounded and it's also really good for

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.330 
surrounded and it's also really good for
kids<00:01:30.060> because<00:01:30.780> they<00:01:31.350> don't<00:01:31.470> necessarily<00:01:31.590> know

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
kids because they don't necessarily know

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.890

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
switches and stuff like that but they

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.069 
switches and stuff like that but they
learn<00:01:35.430> this<00:01:35.640> very<00:01:35.909> easily<00:01:36.240> right<00:01:36.720> because
