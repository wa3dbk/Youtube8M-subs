game it manages to stick out to do a few
differences<00:00:57.680> the<00:00:58.680> most<00:00:58.890> obvious<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.460> these<00:00:59.640> is

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
differences the most obvious of these is

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.340 
differences the most obvious of these is
the<00:01:00.120> puzzle<00:01:00.359> elements<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.109> have<00:01:01.230> been

puzzles<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:06.030> Animaniacs<00:01:06.720> puts<00:01:07.049> almost<00:01:07.350> as

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
puzzles but Animaniacs puts almost as

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.170 
puzzles but Animaniacs puts almost as
much<00:01:07.650> emphasis<00:01:07.860> on<00:01:08.250> these<00:01:08.490> as<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:09.030> doesn't

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
much emphasis on these as it doesn't

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
dot to make it run away not sure why it

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.320 
dot to make it run away not sure why it
would<00:01:16.380> run<00:01:16.530> way<00:01:16.740> but<00:01:17.040> whatever<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:18.180> nice

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
would run way but whatever the nice

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.850 
would run way but whatever the nice
thing<00:01:18.600> about<00:01:18.630> these<00:01:18.960> puzzles<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.770> they

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
thing about these puzzles is that they

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.800 
thing about these puzzles is that they
never<00:01:20.070> really<00:01:20.159> feel<00:01:20.520> frustrating<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.360> fact

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
never really feel frustrating in fact

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.940 
never really feel frustrating in fact
they're<00:01:22.020> actually<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.439> best<00:01:22.619> part<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.860> the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
they're actually the best part of the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.219 
they're actually the best part of the
game<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.400> addition<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.420> game<00:01:24.570> uses<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:25.049> few

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
game in addition the game uses a few

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.870 
game in addition the game uses a few
text-based<00:01:25.680> cutscenes<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.369> add<00:01:26.460> some<00:01:26.640> humor

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.399 

that's<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:32.060> premise<00:01:32.270> of<00:01:32.479> the<00:01:32.600> game<00:01:32.810> that's

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
that's the premise of the game that's

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.120 
that's the premise of the game that's
awesome

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.170 

well<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.220> puzzles<00:01:37.610> in<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:37.789> game<00:01:37.939> aren't

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
well the puzzles in the game aren't

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.090 
well the puzzles in the game aren't
frustrating<00:01:38.869> the<00:01:38.990> rest<00:01:39.200> of<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:39.409> game<00:01:39.560> can<00:01:39.829> be

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
frustrating the rest of the game can be

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.889 
frustrating the rest of the game can be
there<00:01:40.700> aren't<00:01:40.880> any<00:01:41.030> glitches<00:01:41.299> or<00:01:41.570> bugs<00:01:41.750> or

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
there aren't any glitches or bugs or

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:43.149 
there aren't any glitches or bugs or
anything<00:01:42.140> like<00:01:42.320> that<00:01:42.380> but<00:01:42.860> the<00:01:42.979> game's

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
anything like that but the game's

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.639 
anything like that but the game's
difficulty<00:01:43.640> is<00:01:43.939> absolutely<00:01:44.810> relentless<00:01:45.200> I

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
difficulty is absolutely relentless I

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.219 
difficulty is absolutely relentless I
probably<00:01:46.399> died<00:01:46.610> 25<00:01:47.179> times<00:01:47.479> trying<00:01:47.869> to<00:01:47.899> make<00:01:48.110> it

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
probably died 25 times trying to make it

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.809 
probably died 25 times trying to make it
to<00:01:48.350> the<00:01:48.439> end<00:01:48.560> of<00:01:48.679> the<00:01:48.740> second<00:01:49.069> level<00:01:49.189> and<00:01:49.490> that

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
a few that look very similar that are

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:09.820 
a few that look very similar that are
just<00:02:08.000> part<00:02:08.149> of<00:02:08.239> the<00:02:08.299> background<00:02:08.539> I<00:02:09.019> really

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
just part of the background I really

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.229 
just part of the background I really
don't<00:02:09.979> know<00:02:10.039> why<00:02:10.190> they<00:02:10.340> did<00:02:10.519> this<00:02:10.640> I<00:02:10.849> think

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
don't know why they did this I think

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:12.670 
don't know why they did this I think
it's<00:02:11.510> just<00:02:11.599> how<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.810> developers<00:02:12.349> got<00:02:12.500> their

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
it's just how the developers got their

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.589 
it's just how the developers got their
sick<00:02:12.890> kicks

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.600 

Animaniacs<00:02:17.599> is<00:02:18.049> not<00:02:18.319> a<00:02:18.349> very<00:02:18.650> long<00:02:18.890> game<00:02:19.160> even

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
for its time a skilled player should be

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.050 
for its time a skilled player should be
able<00:02:21.500> to<00:02:21.560> beat<00:02:21.709> it<00:02:21.739> in<00:02:21.950> only<00:02:22.130> a<00:02:22.220> few<00:02:22.430> hours<00:02:22.549> but
