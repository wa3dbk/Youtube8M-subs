 It's an app What does this app do? 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:33.430
 For example while operating the screen of iphone 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.730
 a 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:42.250
 I'm taking pictures with iphone now 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:44.500
 iphone iphone I can control my own iphone operation as it is 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:49.579
 There is an app called 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.760
 Record the video you are operating at the meeting 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.530
 this 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:01:00.390
 It is a way to edit up with imov with iphone 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:04.350
 Anyway, for example 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:09.900
 It is for shooting iphone using iphone 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:13.560
 It is an application recommended by all means to those who are investigating but want to put out rice 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.580
 Well then that cloud player 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.060
 While operating 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:22.040
 I would like to explain because little what Apurika 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:27.260
 That's it, please 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:29.810
 It is in the er yes little that you can here of cloud player 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.290
 I think that I want to describe 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.290
 First of all 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.130
 It is photograph It is cute to hit photograph 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:45.230
 Yes I think it is flowing like this 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.370
 Yes example then 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.370
 I wonder what what is good 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:58.800
 Whether you can play a game that everyone cares about 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.800
 I think I want to do this 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.010
 Yes the book of adventure like this 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.340
 Well N ace 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.050
 Still here 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.740
 Yes, but 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.490
 8 is what 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.960
 I think I'm going pretty well 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.960
 It's just the beginning 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:37.900
 In basic 1 story Nakano, this seems to be only white after this 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.519
 The truth of beginners maintenance 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.519
 There wasn't something like that 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.780
 Well this side is only slime another 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.319
 Sato 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.990
 You can also the game play-by-play at Yes Well with such feeling 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:57.120
 Another one 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.120
 I want to try it when this reversal 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.260
 I will try to work this a little 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.150
 Hey-2 colors resume 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.740
 So what do you think so maybe it will be side view 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:33.850
 For example, the one who is seen from this as it is is only on the fourth day 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.890
 I think that maybe the reverse trial also works normally 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.750
 Yes 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:42.180
 And so in the later administration there are many movements 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:46.370
 rpg etc 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.370
 Yeah, isn't the screen so dark? 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.970
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.930
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:57.180
 I'm moving now 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.180
 Only a very sound of the mound is flowing 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:17.700
 Yeah Well, with respect to the operation there are many games in relation to games in such a feeling 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:17.700
 I think that it will be a form that can not be recorded at the same time as the game quite 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:24.669
 I want to be worried about the red in to try whether the music is heard in the music Music 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.970
 I think 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.970
 Yes 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:34.580
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.110
 Hard while we 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.110
 I wonder if it's a canal 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:49.000
 It's almost like this, I think from now on that iphone 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:54.810
 If you want to explain the saucer 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:58.139
 That 's the case, that's where you used to edit using Macs 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.220
 I think I projected the screen of iphone like this , but I need such 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:04.020
 lose 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:06.510
 Only iphone will be able to edit using imob from now on 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.660
 I think more than yes 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:13.770
 What was the latest sharp of cloud player? 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.800
 Euro out the iphone screen of ThatLookLikeThis 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.190
 If you can explain 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:23.570
 you say, for example , if it is a small game, the game is ready 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:25.230
 It was an app cloud player by all means from now on 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:30.840
 It is on youtube 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:33.420
 It is for those who want to show the contents of the game live condition and one's own iphone 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:38.020
 I think it is an app 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:44.860
 It's basically it's this app cloud player though 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:51.909
 You can download it for free You can only record for 10 seconds with the free version 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:56.449
 But it means that the 300 yen can record an unlimited number and are added I paid 300 yen 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:59.930
 You have to be recorded with unlimited Te 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:02.990
 Yes Well it is if that it is the one to be in this app care 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:06.979
 I will put a link on the lower side 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:11.650
 Please see by all means more than this time cloud player 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:11.650
 It's the tried to introduce an app that Ã—
