00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 Hello friends and in this video I want 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:10.290
 show you how to improve 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:15.299
 back lights on your model and i'll show 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:19.320
 for example Volga gas-21 as you see on 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:22.560
 This model lights are made of 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:29.160
 clear plastic painted red 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:31.019
 color and looks pretty simple but 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.780
 no less can you improve 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:39.600
 liquid what did i shoot it red 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.320
 paint this model and painted again 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.559
 headlamp data 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.010
 Now I will show the example of the second such 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:55.890
 same models and as you can see this model is already 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:57.980
 has headlights in colored form and i think 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.640
 that the model looks better overall 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:05.930
 rather than just red farms and what do you 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.430
 have to do is remove the headlight lamp itself 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.549
 secure precisely with the help of small 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.049
 body pins you need to disassemble the model 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:19.409
 s neo bottoms and thin screwdriver 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.790
 squeeze this headlamp paint from the headlamp I 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.670
 rented with the help of 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.860
 nail washes it does not spoil the layer 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.390
 plastic and this paint is very easy 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.880
 removed and you have just 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:37.680
 transparent plastic headlamp and then when 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:41.570
 help paint to paint your spotlight but 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:45.060
 as you can see I painted a small edge 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.640
 silver paint and the spotlight itself is red 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.640
 color reverse lights they painted 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.670
 since the plastic itself was transparent for years 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:58.229
 It turned out such a transparent rear 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.979
 move and thank you for your attention see you 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.979
