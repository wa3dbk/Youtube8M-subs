00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.149 
condition it a lot and I'm sayin with
that<00:01:15.869> way<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.350> can<00:01:16.500> do<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.830> way<00:01:16.950> to

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
that way and you can do it that way to

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.890 
that way and you can do it that way to
in<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.460> it's<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.330> little<00:01:18.479> easier<00:01:19.070> but<00:01:20.630> your<00:01:21.630> hair

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
in it it's a little easier but your hair

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
is more delicate what it's like and so

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.580 
is more delicate what it's like and so
it<00:01:26.820> can<00:01:26.970> break<00:01:27.150> pretty<00:01:27.810> easily<00:01:27.900> can<00:01:28.439> pretty

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
it can break pretty easily can pretty

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.149 
it can break pretty easily can pretty
easily<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:29.070> way<00:01:29.220> but

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
easily the way but

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.690
