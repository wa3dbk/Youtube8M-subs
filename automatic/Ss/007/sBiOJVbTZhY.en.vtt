00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.930
 ideal bathing temperatures in the siberia 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.880

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.060
 in the simplest conditions without 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.810
 running water and often without 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.880
 electricity 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.710

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.810
 people here in the dead of winter 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.550
 river water will rise

 to cash in the province of Shah 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.810
 from there we have 500 km through the 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.700
 Siberian solitude drivers on the way 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.680
 We stop in the small town of Cora 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.510
 dino there we meet wladimir nikolski 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.520

 Sports clubs of the city 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.970

 and the purse 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.690
 the children have to swim in the ice water 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.460
 to strengthen your immune system 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.470
 otherwise they will get sick quickly and doctors 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.240
 are expensive my children are very rare 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.190
 Ill only have a slight cold 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.259
 Children on the rocks the Siberian 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.060
 At midday at twelve o'clock we accompany the way 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.910
 Vladimir and his family therefore to 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.130
 flow outside temperature minus eleven degrees 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.899
 celsius Vladimir suggests another 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.899
 free so nobody gets hurt 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.350
 the water water temperature is zero degrees 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.780
 Celsius 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.729
 even with fantastic weather keeps it 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.869
 our reporter for tormenting children in 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.289
 to send the water 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.970
 but the locals just laugh 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.410
 softened the westler then show 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.780
 she is a real Russian to us 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.410
 the kids go with great joy in the 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.410
 river crisis 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.880
 that's not dangerous it's just 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.370
 a question of psychology 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.500
 you have to be ready to do that 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.300
 Children are careful at the beginning and we are 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.660
 make sure that they do it voluntarily 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.220
 stress to much bad heart but 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.390
 once the children started with it 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.040
 love ice swimming like this 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.440
 brutal methods are being used in siberia 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.160
 rejected no the children should be self 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.769
 decide 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.840
 a boy falls on us while we are fat 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.310
 wrapped up on beckenrand are he goes 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.299
 already for the sixth time into the water 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.860
 we think crazy 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:57.430
 or we ask the boy if he is in the 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:03:00.470
 I'm not used to water 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.930
 For example, his air colder is minus 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.790
 20 degrees 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.799
 that's much nicer you're good 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.549
 a real Siberian one can notice 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:11.299
 we almost like the little kids there 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.799
 can easily 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:15.230
 That should be synonymous for a German 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.420
 be feasible or so decides 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.810
 reporters in the cold floods bisky very much 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:24.670
 to rise 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.670
 without a hitch I know already 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:40.690
 So that cold the respective team 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.510
 That then pressed the lungs 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.220
 move a bit 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:53.540
 you think you do not feel the wines 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:54.019
 more is here you do not have to 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.459
 move 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:04:09.890
 that sounds like the whole body 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:12.620
 burn I think here they freeze 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.319
 will not believe it but the minus 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.450
 eleven degrees cold air is more pleasant than 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.609
 the cold water 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.859
 Nevertheless, our reporter hastens and 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.460
 He goes to the sauna there 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.710
 better 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.580
 The Russians laugh and while he is 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.800
 warms up 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.680
 Always climb in the cold 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.260
 flow or roll in snow all over 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.260
 normal siberian beach life 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:40.030
 you have to be born here 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.030
 to enjoy this bathing weather 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.880
 yes and thus to germany and to 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.550
 a phenomenon that we have until recently 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.410
 from america edges namely humans the 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.980
 not a job but the same 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.980
 three or three
