00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.490
 and more 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.710
 I do not know walsh 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.710
 the cleaning species 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.539
 two 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.650
 Hello everyone ready for man 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.630
 spider 2 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.940
 I will sleep a day before outside 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.190
 film to be the first in line xd 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.720
 Well, today I bring you some information 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.000
 and most of marvel 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.800
 so let's start then for me it's 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.380
 a rather bad news instead of good 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.120
 a few days ago I saw en face ads 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.910
 that we will see more of marvel in the cinema 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.040
 for the next 14 years, that's it 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.070
 it was confirmed that marvel studios will continue 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.229
 releasing movies until 2028 he had 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.780
 said that the marvel delegate would reach 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.119
 until 2021 ending with the 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.130
 Avengers 3 and other movies for 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.560
 many the news was good but for 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.720
 others including me is too much and this 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.340
 it smells like Disney exploiting a lot 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.520
 marvel brand in the cinema 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.649
 they imagine since 1998 until today 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.590
 15 years marvel of having conquered the 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:30.080
 cinema now with another 14 years imagine 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.360
 now another point are the actors they 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.460
 they will not have that youth always robert 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.740
 downey junior hugh jackman and others 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.229
 important icons that have given life to 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.780
 the characters including how can the 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.409
 great stanley endure so many at 90 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.420
 years 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.819
 age to be within their works in 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.829
 the cinema because in this confirmation that 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:51.229
 we will see for a while more the heroes 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.479
 marvel marvel is already considering the 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.490
 fourth delivery of iron man just yet 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.799
 it's not a fact because Robert signed his 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.899
 contract for six films and they would have 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.240
 to negotiate with Robert for this fourth 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.280
 delivery and then after is such great news 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.409
 from marvel studios kevin spoke that no 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.450
 only they will be more time within the 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.789
 cinema talked that in the same way with their 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.920
 partners fox and sony will also continue with 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.260
 the rights to use their characters and 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.090
 that their license has not yet expired 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.069
 this notice the first to answer and 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.500
 put more cards on the table was fox 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.569
 confirmed three more films apart from 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.030
 those already confirmed and fox will launch 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.370
 spin-off of the x-men and already confirmed three 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.560
 that will be mystique gambito and the most 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.510
 Expected of expelled a couple of hours ago 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.790
 Fox gave an announcement that the actor channing 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.829
 tatum is being considered for 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.140
 interpret a new gambit for the 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.970
 new solo movie by part of 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.709
 sony just talked that he already has director 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.840
 for the six sinister was drew 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.530
 Goddard himself who will also work 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.810
 with marvel to direct dare de bing 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.640
 on verón it was rumored that the candidate 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.860
 to be the enemy must not misery 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.900
 karmas and that there would be references in the 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.730
 prospe lícula of the spiderman and he 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.190
 confirmed the appearance of the black cat 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.260
 in future deliveries of the kevin arachnid 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.510
 had an interview about daredevil for 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.190
 netflix and that would be considering to 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.350
 mike oldfield to play at 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.420
 fattest lawyer and he was mentioned 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.340
 that if we would see Kim end because it is a 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.930
 important character within the area 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.540
 weak but that is also a character 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.459
 of the spiderman and kevin stated that 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.590
 both have the rights to use the 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.720
 character as with mercury and the witch 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.519
 scarlet with fox we already saw the 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.709
 consequences that the captain left 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.630
 america 2 the winter soldier for 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.550
 SHIELD agents that transmit it 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.440
 what will happen to the agents and colson in 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.170
 the series as well left consequences 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.120
 for the avengers 2 throne era the 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.500
 next movie of the guardians of the 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.769
 galaxy will also have consequences 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.750
 but for the avengers 3 possibly 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.090
 let's see tanos with ronan the accuser and 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.010
 the collector toby kebbell confirmed 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.530
 by foxx to play the villain of 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.870
 'the fantastic 4' doctor doom and here 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.120
 I bring you the mega dessert I think and for me 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.010
 it is the best news 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.900
 now a couple of hours ago a 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.489
 rumor on all the internet that at 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.920
 look like the scene after the 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.110
 spider-man 2 credits will be something 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.390
 referring to x-men days of the future past 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.700
 as you see they say that this may be 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.739
 true because the rumor sounded very strong that 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.810
 many news pages published it 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:15.030
 but despite this foxx may be 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.829
 coming to an association with zombie 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.959
 to join because they are and has had 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.120
 problems with disney to join and that 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.310
 the spiderman is part of it 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.470
 universe of the avengers but with this 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.330
 mysterious statement may be that the 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.430
 Spiderman is also inside the 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.770
 same universe of the x-men and 'the 4 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.389
 fantastic 'remember that the director 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.729
 marc webb clear that there would be a surprise 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.889
 in the movie good until soon and 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:41.389
 I hope you go see the spider man 2 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:41.389
 until the next video
