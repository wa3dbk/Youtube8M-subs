00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:13.150
 Hi there, I drove about 1000 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.390
 so we light 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:19.630
 I installed the video there are previous 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.210
 look at my videos, but I promised 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.340
 leave reviews 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.980
 what did I feel what difference did 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.380
 difference or not so here I take it off 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.960
 video about this 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.890
 so Iâ€™ll say right away, as you can see, I left 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.629
 food on those wires that stood at 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.150
 me at contact ignition 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:42.879
 although I have silicone wires with 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.339
 Great resistance but for now I'm going to 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:49.360
 these twist nothing happens to them 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:52.210
 not flashing them means candles brisk 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.100
 I, too, stand the same standing on 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.239
 contact ignition with a minimum 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.280
 resistance without resistor what 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:04.839
 say the machine is working no yet 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:07.830
 no complaints means I still got 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:11.860
 set in that period when in the morning 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.409
 wet slush moisture i liked 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:18.610
 and this I noticed a more stable job 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:20.070
 when warming up, I start driving on gas in 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.930
 the garage 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.950
 I drive out into the yard while I close the gate 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:29.290
 the garage I open the exit gate to the street 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.050
 in contact ignition, I kind of heard 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.590
 Smell everything probably who knows on gas 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.950
 unburned not to burning gas also 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.740
 who turns on gasoline when warming up 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.610
 there is a smell of unburned not to 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.100
 burning gasoline but in the case of 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.909
 contactless ignition probably in the light 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:55.150
 due to the fact that the spark is more powerful but i'm on 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.400
 I ca n't hear this smell as such 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.409
 a little bit of something but not that 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.310
 swamp stink like here before 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.909
 eg 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.890
 although I did not charge gas I drive that gas 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:09.009
 on which still us on the contact 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.110
 Ignition went so the quality of the gas 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.319
 it does not affect one hundred percent 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.340
 you can see that as if on warming up 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:21.040
 the engine is more stable candles 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.680
 burn well fuel may not 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.480
 good as I would like but fuel 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.280
 burns out cheer this 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.180
 unlike the contact system 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:35.379
 Ignition means up more stable 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:38.980
 warming up you know for some reason I did not notice 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:41.739
 Here is this symptom for swallowing the engine 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.760
 when warming up in wet weather I don't know 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.950
 maybe so it was but now I catch it now 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.010
 already more or less dry weather but such 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.920
 there is no symptom as often occurs 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.790
 many know works running starts 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.930
 fart in the pipe and stalls 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.930
 this does not seem to mean 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:08.470
 work has become an engine like more 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:12.519
 smooth in all ranges at small 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:15.010
 speed turns if you go there on small 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.590
 rpm include second gear in 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.349
 in general, then I have it and so ok 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.739
 worked well here, as if not felt 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:26.410
 I know well, I try not to inspire myself 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:31.560
 of this but a little something is noticeable 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:35.500
 eat means at high speeds 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.400
 as if the difference as such is not noticeable 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:42.030
 I will say that the car flew 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:45.790
 flooded like a rocket there under the hood 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.560
 there are no such horses on 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.769
 rpm in general and on the contact 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.410
 Ignition system perla well give on 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:56.310
 it and on contactless that is leads 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:00.010
 yourself about the same for fuel consumption 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.069
 can't tell you anything since i'm on 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.889
 This business in general that 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.500
 fucked up because zadolbalsya measure 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:12.010
 this expense to twist 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:15.539
 the whole thing reconfigure in 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:18.579
 in the end, just you understand what are you 

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:21.940
 being cheated on gas refueling or 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:25.030
 gas quality is yes and measure consumption 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:28.660
 in city mode, I'll tell you what, but 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:32.110
 like a thankless job in the city well, 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.479
 how would you not like but will consumption 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.590
 elevated more than much more 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.780
 highway and even more so on gas 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.570
 So 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:44.270
 I do not notice this to be less than 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.870
 on a contract ignition system or 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.870
 more 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:52.660
 about all the same with regards to 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:56.980
 fuel consumption but what else did u like 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:58.840
 I think of many when on the cold engine 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.930
 remove choke 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.790
 the machine is unstable working as it were 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:08.840
 trying to stall but it's understandable it 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:12.530
 ok well here if you compare it exactly 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:15.110
 my case is my contact system 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:18.290
 ignition stood and now contactless 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.300
 then with a small company with her short 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:25.010
 engine warming up 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:27.650
 more stable turns and when moving 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:31.040
 when driving on a cold engine without 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:33.800
 suction with recessed suction that is 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.440
 less than these jerking failures and 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:40.310
 everything else can when touching there 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:43.310
 little there then went to stretch and 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.250
 loads ie all these failures as 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.620
 it would be smaller but also since i 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:51.740
 old distributor took out how to install 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.600
 this new non-contact so i don't 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.880
 touched no way did I 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:59.150
 twisted did not rotate that is how 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:01.550
 Because I put it in general 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.220
 everything suits the car works fine 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.820
 but of course the ignition will need 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.610
 to set 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.370
 look or strobe at or without 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:14.300
 he will be seen 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:17.300
 the following videos will raise this topic well and 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.460
 I think the most important plus is important 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:23.390
 what I do not regret that I installed 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:27.080
 contactless ignition system, as it were 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:31.460
 I advise everyone but again this is yours 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:35.810
 discretion it all depends on the completeness of your 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:41.000
 pockets for contact ignition system 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:43.250
 I left my reviews to watch the video 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.570
 about this today everything in general 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:48.800
 that's all I wanted to say about this 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:52.310
 subscribe to my channel group
