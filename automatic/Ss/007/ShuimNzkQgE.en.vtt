have<00:00:21.420> played<00:00:21.539> anybody<00:00:21.960> in<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.140> finals<00:00:22.529> if<00:00:22.769> you

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
have played anybody in the finals if you

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.070

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
look at the last five years how we

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.519 
look at the last five years how we
struggled<00:00:25.650> we<00:00:26.460> had<00:00:26.640> first-round<00:00:27.269> exits<00:00:27.529> once

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
struggled we had first-round exits once

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.189 
struggled we had first-round exits once
a<00:00:28.800> crown<00:00:29.070> exited<00:00:29.670> it's<00:00:30.240> been<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:30.630> hard<00:00:30.869> just<00:00:31.080> to

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
a crown exited it's been so hard just to

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.889 
a crown exited it's been so hard just to
get<00:00:31.410> back<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:31.800> stage<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.910> would<00:00:33.780> have

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
get back to that stage that I would have

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.770 
get back to that stage that I would have
played<00:00:34.020> anybody<00:00:34.500> wherever<00:00:35.340> at<00:00:36.030> this<00:00:36.239> point<00:00:36.510> so

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
played anybody wherever at this point so

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.340 
played anybody wherever at this point so
it<00:00:36.899> happens<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.320> be<00:00:37.380> Miami<00:00:37.800> again<00:00:38.360> and<00:00:39.360> and

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
it happens to be Miami again and and

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.560 
it happens to be Miami again and and
we'll<00:00:40.559> take<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.129> we<00:00:41.850> got<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.120> beat<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> very

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
we'll take it and we got to beat a very

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.930 
we'll take it and we got to beat a very
very<00:00:42.840> good<00:00:42.989> team<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:43.559> that's<00:00:44.280> where<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.640> stand

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
very good team so that's where I stand

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.670 
very good team so that's where I stand
but<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.390> whole<00:00:45.539> Miami<00:00:45.960> thing<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.350> me<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.559> a

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
but the whole Miami thing to me is a

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.220 
but the whole Miami thing to me is a
little<00:00:46.950> overblown<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.730> have<00:00:48.539> never<00:00:48.809> watched

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
little overblown I have never watched

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.910 
little overblown I have never watched
one<00:00:49.440> game<00:00:49.890> over<00:00:50.610> because<00:00:50.760> it's<00:00:51.329> just<00:00:51.770> it<00:00:52.770> would

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
one game over because it's just it would

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.970 
one game over because it's just it would
just<00:00:53.360> make<00:00:54.360> me<00:00:54.539> throw<00:00:54.809> up<00:00:54.840> probably<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.500> don't
