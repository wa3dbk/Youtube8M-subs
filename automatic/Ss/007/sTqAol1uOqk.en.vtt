00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.870
 i 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.300
 hello friends welcome to the area 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.520
 training I will be 0 and in this 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.610
 occasion we will analyze from the bowels 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.400
 the 4-4-2 formation this is one of my 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.530
 preferred formations I think I have 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.840
 two or three formations which 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.240
 I always play and this is definitely 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.160
 one of them so here we will analyze 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.240
 every aspect of it from the players 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.790
 until its pros and cons in defense to 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.580
 I like to put to one side 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.350
 that is not as offensive as the other in 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.360
 this arbeloa case is not so offensive 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.969
 like marcelo then he always goes to 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.350
 stay a little behind what marcelo 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.940
 it's not going to be because doing it almost always 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.039
 the attack is delivered 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.199
 pepe sergio bouquets are great defenses and 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.629
 they are tall they also help for 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.739
 centers to defend the headers the 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.199
 guerrillas always have to be 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.820
 fast so that it occupies a gareth bale that 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.800
 He is hit by someone from the right as well as 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.289
 left then as he says there is a shooter 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.969
 can also be pushed towards the 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.350
 goal and give a good shot to 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.860
 score a goal 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.259
 occupies xabi alonso already disc or in his 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.350
 due to modric because because xabi 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:14.250
 Alonso is a defensive artist 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.830
 then he will always be left behind 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.180
 a little and forward has to another 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.130
 midfielder who is more offensive in 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.690
 this case disk that is going to be more for 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.830
 attack but already wine is going to go so 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.289
 forward as to discover the 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.869
 ronaldo Christian midfield that's 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:29.460
 well what can I say is is the best 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.680
 this game I love which cursen 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.530
 the real ones are a delight here what 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.240
 I have in the lane because he runs 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.250
 very much very fast and it hits very hard 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.180
 with his right leg and he is also very 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.390
 good to center 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.100
 occupy here this from chavito to morata 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.710
 it still seems that it is possible to leave the 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.050
 prepa because it is very high its by very high 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.600
 which is good for auctions and in this 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.370
 training is very very very good to play with 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.380
 the lanes then we start see 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.500
 here after a corner kick I have a 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.200
 ronaldo totally alone totally alone 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.410
 by its lane it is free here it is given 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.119
 benzema and of course it's super fast no one what 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.070
 is going to reach he got on the bike he 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.050
 He got on the bike and of course he is 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.239
 counterattack reaches benzema just scores 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.340
 of the goal this is part of what is 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.400
 incredible in this training is to play by 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.760
 the lanes and as you can see is a 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.830
 quite standard training since 4 4 2 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.020
 and 5 are going to be aligned almost always 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.630
 it's a little bit about the game of this 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.640
 training since in a backlash to 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.890
 times so big too bad to see 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.040
 like everything to be forward attacking all 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.239
 everyone here I'm watching 3 against 3 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.880
 we can practically not remove in the 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.520
 ball and they make us a goal there was no 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.790
 nothing to do squares nothing happened the 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.790
 he got 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.519
 well as I say it is a training that 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.170
 is position that gives you a lot of position in 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.670
 the midfield since they have many 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.430
 midfielders 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.200
 there then I want to show you here how 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.230
 we are passing the ball opening 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.120
 spaces opening spaces there is no hurry 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.400
 here I have isco disco he spends 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.640
 ronaldo already down and down 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.230
 and marcelo that what I tell you there is only 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.790
 the space and we send the center everything 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.400
 started in the midfield 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.260
 that is the skeleton of this formation the 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.879
 midfield there is to spend great control 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.329
 part of the party and also in the 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.859
 defense here we retrieve a ball but 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.540
 I would say the same thing was we are pushing 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:27.329
 with many people in midfield 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.340
 we managed to recover the already running 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.739
 is running free free gary baker 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.060
 very fast and I can give you a play of 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.620
 a lot of danger 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.940
 here as you mentioned we have a lot 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.069
 People midfield so it is 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.569
 also very good to defend then 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:44.599
 we got between 2 and we took the ball 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:47.299
 ronaldo here has it for steam to 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.560
 through his lane he despairs tantito abra 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:49.999
 space so much to the people that we have 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.129
 a midfield and what I'm talking about 

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:54.049
 it's a very parent training for outside 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:56.810
 of the midfield here is not open 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.819
 he returns it to benzema and we have a goal 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.409
 so what I mean with this 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.659
 training is that it will be at a very 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:04.790
 down the lanes almost all the time with 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:06.260
 these people very fast the stern sway 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.719
 that's a great team for this 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.329
 training here another example equal 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:13.730
 ronaldo totally only just from 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:15.889
 his right midfield gives a great pass 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.019
 for disco here he starts dancing 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:20.930
 little they put a song puts the 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.300
 of age there has it there and that's not 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.460
 It was a goal but we play again by miracle 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.009
 by the bands by the sleeves again 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.110
 here also comes a backlash 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:33.750
 gray that is very fast nobody reaches it 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.300
 come free again free here can you 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.099
 decide to get rid of to enter in order here 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.889
 I was doing an exquisite thing of 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:42.750
 sixth year that did not fall in goal because the 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.210
 island life is very big life is very 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.880
 big gentlemen here another example for 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.680
 example we are defending with much 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.840
 people in the midfield then that happens 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.479
 or if you decide to cry press it off 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.630
 is one is one is a pose is one 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:59.789
 very good training to defend here 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.979
 another example of how 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:03.750
 bugs are very quick if 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.520
 they have fast lanes almost always go 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.150
 to get the free to send the 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:12.120
 center when the other one because 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.220
 Attacking is excellent excellent for 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.590
 play for the bands the minister dance 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.830
 pito is a great team here again queen 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:23.460
 ronaldo just only only and his soul 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.870
 here we do a dribble and golf hello I am 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.699
 another one that has fernando can double 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.289
 can do what he wants he can give 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:32.289
 pause can have the ball is strong 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:35.169
 you have excellent humor then good is the 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:35.770
 4-4-2 formation that was excellent for 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.990
 the bands 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.360
 there is a great control the midfield is 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.270
 Excellent excellent for kickback 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.460
 that you have with a lot of men but 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.499
 it's risks when attacking because as they attack 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.960
 Many can also beat you 

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:51.639
 in a brutal way it is also excellent 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.770
 talks to you when they have high forwards 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:56.319
 because it culminated with by the lanes for 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:59.349
 send many centers and this is 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:01.449
 key if you do not have fast lanes go 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:03.939
 to be a training that I think is not 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:05.379
 the best for you because part of the 

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:08.469
 magic of this formation and its strength 

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:10.419
 is playing by the lanes and good friends 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:12.309
 I hope you liked this this 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:17.099
 explanation of the 4-4-2 formation 

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:17.099
 I will be 0 and remember fifa life
