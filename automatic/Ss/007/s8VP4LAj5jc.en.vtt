00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.870
 tell me the stool 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:14.990
 reading club in which good ten 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.509
 fifteen twenty students we meet each 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.580
 week in a cafeteria to comment a 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:21.619
 book that we have read in common but what 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.990
 happens to me it is very gratifying that the 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.419
 people tell me go many thanks 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.050
 because it is that if not for this group 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.630
 Reading 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.059
 I think I would stop reading during the 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.489
 career or such and after all the 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.620
 fact of having an obligation of all 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.440
 On Wednesdays I meet with these 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.570
 people to comment on such a book makes you 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.850
 read you was alone maybe you would say 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.600
 well I'm leaving let me read it in 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:50.260
 summer and if we do not help each other 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.260
 others 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.340
 that is what I like said of another 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.340
 way is that 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.830
 so at the time of writing by 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.890
 example to take pictures you need 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.510
 your team this is your camera to 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.430
 compose a song you're always going to 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.610
 need instruments however 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.670
 when you write, it 's like you're with 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.070
 the paper and a modeling is already and a 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.020
 paper and a pen at the end is that no 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.880
 it's nothing important but what of 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.160
 truth is relevant is what you have 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.550
 here who is able to imagine what 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.550
 what have you observed 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.710
 besides that the university threw me 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.660
 investigate much more read many more 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.630
 things before they might not have 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.659
 taken by myself so I've done 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.549
 to open up much more 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.249
 that is, the things that I write that the 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.899
 read the people and let people help me 

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:53.899
 They tell me that they liked more less 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.160
 I find it a pleasure 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.940
 and what only you with your 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.979
 mind 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.539
 you can create a world you know you can 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.280
 create a world 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.280
 and you have that
