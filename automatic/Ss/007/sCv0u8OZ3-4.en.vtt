00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.960
 it is disputed that everyone dances on the stage 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.500

 blood goes all right. come here I am 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.800
 I saw a broad perspective in Joan's house 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.520
 not deep enough may be too 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.670
 a lot of drama is not strange that we are with 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.080
 near him for so long already 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:57.060
 my friend doesn't understand what the theater is 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:59.250
 good not bad good but then it 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:09.480
 covers the absence of those to him dark lord 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:12.570
 of this is the essence of Andrei as I do not know everything 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:16.400
 Dostoevsky's heroes in you this one 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.400

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.500
 With my amazing plasticity, I separately 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.979
 I want to say about the look where you look 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.610

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:37.440
 somewhere in infinity here in this 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.800
 I have not seen this season yet 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.960
 and only a hundred years of us receive only people in 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:48.350
 which we never doubt 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.350
 and you are one of them 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.360
