check out if you've been following the
anime<00:06:23.700> version<00:06:23.880> but<00:06:24.480> let's<00:06:24.630> get<00:06:24.780> excited<00:06:25.200> guys

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
anime version but let's get excited guys

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.630 
anime version but let's get excited guys
we<00:06:25.470> got<00:06:25.590> to<00:06:25.680> realize<00:06:25.920> we're<00:06:26.160> getting<00:06:26.340> close<00:06:26.520> to

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:26.640 
we got to realize we're getting close to

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.190 
we got to realize we're getting close to
the<00:06:26.730> halfway<00:06:26.880> point<00:06:27.060> of<00:06:27.450> the<00:06:27.600> series<00:06:27.840> and

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:28.200 
the halfway point of the series and

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.420 
the halfway point of the series and
hopefully<00:06:28.650> this<00:06:28.800> means<00:06:28.920> we'll<00:06:29.100> get<00:06:29.160> some<00:06:29.340> more

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:29.430
