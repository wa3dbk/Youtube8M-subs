attention<00:02:07.170> as<00:02:07.260> well<00:02:07.440> right<00:02:07.710> here<00:02:07.740> actually

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
attention as well right here actually

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.330 
attention as well right here actually
this<00:02:08.850> is<00:02:09.030> based<00:02:09.330> on<00:02:09.540> it<00:02:09.750> benchmark<00:02:10.590> against

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
this is based on it benchmark against

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.490 
this is based on it benchmark against
the<00:02:11.430> pentam<00:02:11.850> it<00:02:12.350> on<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:13.470> same<00:02:13.970> so<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.260> so<00:02:16.260> cool

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
the pentam it on the same so I so cool

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.470 
the pentam it on the same so I so cool
good<00:02:17.010> idea<00:02:17.130> says<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.790> side<00:02:18.030> fine<00:02:18.270> doesn't

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
good idea says the side fine doesn't

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.210 
good idea says the side fine doesn't
interfere<00:02:18.780> with<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.230> height<00:02:19.560> of<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.920> cpu

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
interfere with the height of the cpu

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.070 
interfere with the height of the cpu
cooler<00:02:20.490> have<00:02:20.730> is<00:02:20.910> good<00:02:21.120> yeah<00:02:21.390> that's<00:02:21.960> exactly

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
cooler have is good yeah that's exactly

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.000 
cooler have is good yeah that's exactly
oh<00:02:22.590> yeah<00:02:22.860> it's<00:02:23.250> great<00:02:23.400> thing<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:24.560> inside<00:02:25.560> no

90 you've got for hard drives right here
that<00:02:35.580> was<00:02:35.700> special<00:02:35.940> about<00:02:36.150> this<00:02:36.360> designs<00:02:36.750> got

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
that was special about this designs got

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.800 
that was special about this designs got
inside<00:02:37.320> we<00:02:37.410> have<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.590> pitiful<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.970> stand

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
inside we have a pitiful to stand

around yeah turn around and then that

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.910 
around yeah turn around and then that
redirects<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.319> air<00:02:50.410> for<00:02:50.590> that<00:02:50.739> condition

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
redirects the air for that condition

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.750 
redirects the air for that condition
yeah<00:02:51.569> the<00:02:52.569> heat<00:02:52.720> out<00:02:52.870> for<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.170> CPU<00:02:53.590> so<00:02:53.860> that<00:02:54.550> is

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
yeah the heat out for the CPU so that is

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.690 
yeah the heat out for the CPU so that is
a<00:02:55.440> community<00:02:56.440> that<00:02:56.650> I<00:02:56.860> probably<00:02:57.280> help<00:02:57.550> with

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
a community that I probably help with

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.580 
a community that I probably help with
those<00:02:57.819> new<00:02:58.090> extreme<00:02:58.569> systems<00:02:59.140> because<00:02:59.440> you

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
those new extreme systems because you

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.589 
those new extreme systems because you
they<00:03:00.069> want<00:03:00.280> you<00:03:00.400> to<00:03:00.940> flip<00:03:01.269> the<00:03:01.420> fan

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
they want you to flip the fan

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.440 
they want you to flip the fan
right<00:03:02.050> right<00:03:02.530> yeah<00:03:02.800> and<00:03:03.190> you<00:03:03.310> got<00:03:03.459> home<00:03:03.910> you<00:03:04.060> 25

when<00:04:01.510> you<00:04:01.660> have<00:04:01.690> to<00:04:02.109> swap<00:04:02.410> out<00:04:02.560> your<00:04:02.739> hard

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
when you have to swap out your hard

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.130 
when you have to swap out your hard
drive<00:04:03.160> you<00:04:03.850> don't<00:04:03.970> have<00:04:04.060> to<00:04:04.209> open<00:04:04.540> this<00:04:04.630> end<00:04:04.840> we

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
drive you don't have to open this end we

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.840 
drive you don't have to open this end we
just<00:04:05.319> open<00:04:05.530> one<00:04:05.560> panel<00:04:05.980> yeah<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:06.519> lawyers

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850
