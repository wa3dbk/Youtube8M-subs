more<00:00:00.659> often<00:00:00.900> than<00:00:01.350> not<00:00:01.410> when<00:00:01.829> I<00:00:01.890> have<00:00:02.250> to

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
more often than not when I have to

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.670 
more often than not when I have to
replace<00:00:02.790> a<00:00:02.850> six<00:00:03.300> liter<00:00:03.600> engines<00:00:04.080> because<00:00:04.440> of<00:00:04.589> a

replace a six liter engines because of a

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.870 
replace a six liter engines because of a
catastrophic<00:00:05.069> failure<00:00:06.799> about<00:00:07.799> 95<00:00:08.429> percent<00:00:08.820> of

catastrophic failure about 95 percent of
the<00:00:09.000> time<00:00:09.030> this<00:00:09.540> is<00:00:09.719> avoidable<00:00:10.320> and<00:00:10.650> I'm<00:00:11.610> going

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
the time this is avoidable and I'm going

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.370 
the time this is avoidable and I'm going
to<00:00:11.790> show<00:00:11.940> you<00:00:12.000> how<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.240> avoid<00:00:12.420> this<00:00:12.840> but<00:00:12.900> first

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
to show you how to avoid this but first

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.419 
to show you how to avoid this but first
I<00:00:13.559> want<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.799> show<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:13.980> what<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.190> true

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
I want to show you what a true

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.240 
I want to show you what a true
catastrophic<00:00:15.420> failure<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:16.500> how<00:00:17.039> there's

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
catastrophic failure is and how there's

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.720 
catastrophic failure is and how there's
a<00:00:17.310> cascade<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:18.000> events<00:00:18.920> initially<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.369> engine

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
a cascade of events initially the engine

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.779 
a cascade of events initially the engine
is<00:00:20.850> run<00:00:21.060> hot<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.980> then<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.100> head<00:00:23.310> gaskets

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
is run hot and then the head gaskets

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.390 
is run hot and then the head gaskets
start<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.210> fail<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.779> then<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.710> head<00:00:25.890> gaskets

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
start to fail and then the head gaskets

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.910 
start to fail and then the head gaskets
fail<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.939> then<00:00:27.090> there<00:00:27.240> becomes<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.890> series<00:00:28.890> of

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
fail and then there becomes a series of

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.790 
fail and then there becomes a series of
things<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.640> happen<00:00:30.150> when<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.199> push<00:00:31.529> this

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
things that happen when you push this

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.889 
things that happen when you push this
engine<00:00:32.279> with<00:00:32.700> blown<00:00:32.910> head<00:00:33.149> gasket<00:00:33.180> that's<00:00:33.780> why

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
engine with blown head gasket that's why

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.840 
engine with blown head gasket that's why
it's<00:00:34.050> real<00:00:34.290> important<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:35.219> diagnose<00:00:35.700> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
it's real important to diagnose the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.400 
it's real important to diagnose the
blown<00:00:36.059> head<00:00:36.300> gasket<00:00:36.329> as<00:00:36.899> early<00:00:37.230> as<00:00:37.320> possible

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
blown head gasket as early as possible

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.060 
blown head gasket as early as possible
it's<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.820> can<00:00:38.969> fix<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.510> move<00:00:39.750> on

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
it's so that you can fix it and move on

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.380 
it's so that you can fix it and move on
over<00:00:41.070> here<00:00:41.219> on<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.460> engine<00:00:41.730> stand<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.149> have<00:00:42.300> an

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
over here on the engine stand I have an

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.779 
over here on the engine stand I have an
engine<00:00:42.690> that's<00:00:42.840> torn<00:00:43.170> down<00:00:43.410> after<00:00:44.399> a

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
engine that's torn down after a

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.090 
engine that's torn down after a
catastrophic<00:00:45.149> failure<00:00:46.020> we're<00:00:46.770> going<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.980> go

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
catastrophic failure we're going to go

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.680 
catastrophic failure we're going to go
through<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.520> take<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.730> look<00:00:47.940> at<00:00:48.090> what<00:00:48.239> happens

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
through and take a look at what happens

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.709 
through and take a look at what happens
to<00:00:48.840> these<00:00:48.960> engines<00:00:49.379> when<00:00:49.920> they<00:00:50.100> fail

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
to these engines when they fail

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.360 
to these engines when they fail
initially<00:00:51.719> what<00:00:52.199> happened<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:52.860> engine

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
initially what happened to this engine

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.150 
initially what happened to this engine
was<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.329> got<00:00:54.510> overheated<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
was is that it got overheated and the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.430 
was is that it got overheated and the
head<00:00:56.399> gasket<00:00:56.940> failed<00:00:57.210> on<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.629> passenger<00:00:58.199> side

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
head gasket failed on the passenger side

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.889 
head gasket failed on the passenger side
of<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.680> engine<00:00:59.390> when<00:01:00.390> we<00:01:00.480> went<00:01:00.690> back<00:01:00.750> over

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
of the engine when we went back over

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.439 
of the engine when we went back over
here<00:01:01.590> on<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.399> driver's<00:01:02.850> side<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.300> engine

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
here on the driver's side of the engine

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.570 
here on the driver's side of the engine
the<00:01:03.750> head<00:01:03.960> gasket<00:01:04.500> was<00:01:04.650> pretty<00:01:04.890> strained<00:01:05.369> but

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
the head gasket was pretty strained but

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.030 
the head gasket was pretty strained but
it<00:01:05.700> still<00:01:05.970> hadn't<00:01:06.360> blown<00:01:06.600> all<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.900> way<00:01:07.110> so<00:01:07.740> all

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
it still hadn't blown all the way so all

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.649 
it still hadn't blown all the way so all
the<00:01:08.280> carnage<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.729> I'm<00:01:08.939> about<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.270> show<00:01:09.600> you

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
the carnage that I'm about to show you

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.080 
the carnage that I'm about to show you
that<00:01:09.960> happen<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.409> this<00:01:10.530> engine<00:01:10.920> happened<00:01:11.760> just

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
that happen to this engine happened just

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.910 
that happen to this engine happened just
from<00:01:12.930> one<00:01:13.710> head<00:01:13.979> gasket<00:01:14.549> being<00:01:14.820> fully<00:01:15.240> blown

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
from one head gasket being fully blown

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.620 
from one head gasket being fully blown
now<00:01:16.920> what<00:01:17.490> happens<00:01:17.820> when<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:17.970> head<00:01:18.119> guys<00:01:18.330> get

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
now what happens when the head guys get

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.590 
now what happens when the head guys get
blows<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.259> that<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.979> compression<00:01:20.430> inside<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
blows is that the compression inside the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.850 
blows is that the compression inside the
piston<00:01:21.810> goes<00:01:22.080> into<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.520> water<00:01:23.759> jackets<00:01:24.420> and

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
piston goes into the water jackets and

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.260 
piston goes into the water jackets and
conversely<00:01:25.860> once<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.369> engine<00:01:26.640> shut<00:01:26.909> off<00:01:26.939> you

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
conversely once the engine shut off you

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.999 
conversely once the engine shut off you
get<00:01:27.390> water<00:01:27.659> into<00:01:28.049> one<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.380> or<00:01:28.530> more<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
get water into one of the or more of the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.190 
get water into one of the or more of the
Pistons<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:30.180> will<00:01:30.299> cause<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.540> hydro<00:01:31.020> lock

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
Pistons and it will cause a hydro lock

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.819 
Pistons and it will cause a hydro lock
situation<00:01:32.750> now<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:33.930> particular<00:01:34.259> engine<00:01:34.560> was

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
situation now this particular engine was

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.649 
situation now this particular engine was
pushed<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.430> then<00:01:35.549> what<00:01:35.759> happens<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.630> that

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
pushed and then what happens is is that

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.160 
pushed and then what happens is is that
it<00:01:36.930> gets<00:01:37.110> real<00:01:37.500> hot<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.909> would<00:01:39.090> blow<00:01:39.329> the

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
it gets real hot and it would blow the

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.319 
it gets real hot and it would blow the
oil<00:01:40.380> cooler<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.490> water<00:01:41.759> from<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.150> oil

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
oil cooler and the water from the oil

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.069 
oil cooler and the water from the oil
cooler<00:01:42.720> will<00:01:43.320> go<00:01:43.500> down<00:01:43.710> into<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.700> oil<00:01:44.729> pan<00:01:45.079> so

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
cooler will go down into the oil pan so

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.780 
cooler will go down into the oil pan so
now<00:01:46.350> you're<00:01:46.740> pushing<00:01:47.070> oil<00:01:47.549> that's

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
now you're pushing oil that's

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.429 
now you're pushing oil that's
contaminated<00:01:48.570> with<00:01:48.630> water<00:01:48.960> through<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
contaminated with water through the

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.310 
contaminated with water through the
engine<00:01:49.860> as<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:51.390> engine<00:01:51.750> gets<00:01:51.930> hotter<00:01:52.170> and

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
engine as the engine gets hotter and

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.069 
engine as the engine gets hotter and
hotter<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:53.340> EGR<00:01:53.729> cooler<00:01:54.000> will<00:01:54.420> tear<00:01:54.659> out<00:01:54.689> and

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
hotter the EGR cooler will tear out and

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.870 
hotter the EGR cooler will tear out and
then<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.740> will<00:01:55.860> push<00:01:56.070> water<00:01:56.340> out<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.820> the

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
then you will push water out of the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.420 
then you will push water out of the
tailpipe<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.600> then<00:01:58.350> as<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.979> engine<00:01:59.280> gets

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
tailpipe and then as the engine gets

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.670 
tailpipe and then as the engine gets
really<00:01:59.790> hot<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.270> will<00:02:00.630> start<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.110> melt<00:02:01.380> down

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
really hot it will start to melt down

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.060 
really hot it will start to melt down
inside<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:03.149> oil<00:02:03.390> filter<00:02:03.869> now<00:02:04.710> one<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.009> the

inside the oil filter now one of the

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.649 
inside the oil filter now one of the
things<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.579> happens<00:02:06.030> when<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.270> get<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.540> this

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
things that happens when you get to this

out by my office by the front door it's
just<00:02:22.430> terrible<00:02:22.970> you<00:02:23.330> can't<00:02:23.600> get<00:02:23.750> away<00:02:23.840> from<00:02:24.200> it

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
after you start to meltdown up here by

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.200 
after you start to meltdown up here by
the<00:02:27.530> oil<00:02:27.860> filter<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:28.460> the<00:02:28.700> oil<00:02:28.850> filter

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
the oil filter and the oil filter

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.460 
the oil filter and the oil filter
housing<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:29.930> whatnot

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
housing and whatnot

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.430 
housing and whatnot
it's<00:02:31.100> send<00:02:31.430> shrapnel<00:02:31.670> down<00:02:32.660> into<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.110> oil<00:02:33.320> pan

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
it's send shrapnel down into the oil pan

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.070 
it's send shrapnel down into the oil pan
and<00:02:34.010> then<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.850> shrapnel<00:02:35.480> that's<00:02:35.600> down<00:02:35.840> here

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
and then the shrapnel that's down here

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.130 
and then the shrapnel that's down here
in<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.230> oil<00:02:36.440> pan<00:02:37.180> ends<00:02:38.180> up<00:02:38.330> in<00:02:38.570> the<00:02:38.660> oil<00:02:38.720> pickup

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
in the oil pan ends up in the oil pickup

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.540 
in the oil pan ends up in the oil pickup
now<00:02:39.440> I've<00:02:39.530> rotated<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.040> engine<00:02:40.250> a<00:02:40.280> little<00:02:40.430> bit

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
now I've rotated the engine a little bit

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.610 
now I've rotated the engine a little bit
so<00:02:40.670> you<00:02:40.760> can<00:02:40.790> see<00:02:41.020> what<00:02:42.020> it<00:02:42.110> looks<00:02:42.290> like<00:02:42.350> on<00:02:42.560> the

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
so you can see what it looks like on the

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.080 
so you can see what it looks like on the
bottom<00:02:42.830> and<00:02:43.160> then<00:02:43.250> it<00:02:43.400> goes<00:02:43.610> into<00:02:43.820> the<00:02:43.940> oil

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
bottom and then it goes into the oil

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.480 
bottom and then it goes into the oil
pickup<00:02:44.690> which<00:02:45.170> then<00:02:45.470> clogs<00:02:45.800> which<00:02:46.070> means<00:02:46.340> that

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
pickup which then clogs which means that

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.940 
pickup which then clogs which means that
no<00:02:46.670> coolant<00:02:47.150> gets<00:02:47.210> into<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.020> bearings<00:02:48.500> inside

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
no coolant gets into the bearings inside

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.430 
no coolant gets into the bearings inside
the<00:02:49.130> block<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:49.670> it<00:02:50.300> just<00:02:50.720> burns<00:02:50.990> the<00:02:51.230> damn

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
the block and it just burns the damn

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.100 
the block and it just burns the damn
engine<00:02:51.830> up<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.130> engine<00:02:52.580> is<00:02:52.790> screwed<00:02:53.360> okay

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
engine up the engine is screwed okay

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.440 
engine up the engine is screwed okay
the<00:02:54.650> heads<00:02:54.950> are<00:02:55.160> probably<00:02:55.580> cracked<00:02:56.000> at<00:02:56.240> this

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
the heads are probably cracked at this

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.380 
the heads are probably cracked at this
point<00:02:57.040> unusable<00:02:58.040> if<00:02:58.220> they're<00:02:58.790> not<00:02:58.910> cracked

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
point unusable if they're not cracked

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.030 
point unusable if they're not cracked
and<00:02:59.660> their<00:02:59.780> work<00:03:00.050> to<00:03:00.290> a<00:03:00.320> point<00:03:00.710> where<00:03:00.920> you

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
and their work to a point where you

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.940 
and their work to a point where you
can't<00:03:01.430> rima<00:03:01.790> seen<00:03:02.030> them<00:03:02.240> the<00:03:02.840> block<00:03:03.170> is<00:03:03.500> toast

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
can't rima seen them the block is toast

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.190 
can't rima seen them the block is toast
because<00:03:04.220> the<00:03:04.670> bores<00:03:04.970> are<00:03:05.210> all<00:03:05.330> eaten<00:03:05.780> up<00:03:05.930> with

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
because the bores are all eaten up with

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.560 
because the bores are all eaten up with
all<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:07.010> scraping<00:03:07.610> and<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.790> rust<00:03:08.060> of<00:03:08.270> all<00:03:08.450> the

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
all the scraping and the rust of all the

all the scraping and the rust of all the
metal<00:03:08.810> particles<00:03:09.260> that<00:03:09.560> are<00:03:09.650> going<00:03:09.830> on<00:03:10.070> inside

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
metal particles that are going on inside

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.580 
metal particles that are going on inside
there<00:03:11.060> but<00:03:11.480> I'm<00:03:11.600> quite<00:03:11.840> sure<00:03:11.900> that<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.320> crank

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
there but I'm quite sure that the crank

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.130 
there but I'm quite sure that the crank
is<00:03:12.770> smoked<00:03:13.130> too<00:03:13.430> not<00:03:14.360> to<00:03:14.510> mention<00:03:14.690> your<00:03:14.900> fuel

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
is smoked too not to mention your fuel

everything<00:03:16.730> else<00:03:16.850> I<00:03:16.970> mean<00:03:17.060> this<00:03:17.209> engine<00:03:17.600> is

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
everything else I mean this engine is

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.750 
everything else I mean this engine is
screwed<00:03:18.200> this<00:03:18.560> situation<00:03:19.250> was<00:03:19.340> entirely

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
screwed this situation was entirely

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.610 
screwed this situation was entirely
avoidable<00:03:20.450> okay<00:03:20.840> it<00:03:20.930> started<00:03:21.320> out<00:03:21.470> with

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
avoidable okay it started out with

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.130 
avoidable okay it started out with
running<00:03:21.920> high<00:03:22.070> eg<00:03:22.580> T's<00:03:22.880> which<00:03:23.600> went<00:03:23.840> into<00:03:23.900> a

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
running high eg T's which went into a

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.710 
running high eg T's which went into a
slightly<00:03:24.920> blown<00:03:25.310> head<00:03:25.550> gasket<00:03:25.580> which<00:03:26.480> got

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
slightly blown head gasket which got

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.449 
slightly blown head gasket which got
worse<00:03:26.930> and<00:03:27.170> worse<00:03:27.230> and<00:03:27.500> worse<00:03:27.560> and<00:03:27.920> then<00:03:28.340> they

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
worse and worse and worse and then they

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.210 
worse and worse and worse and then they
push<00:03:28.820> the<00:03:29.030> damn<00:03:29.209> thing<00:03:29.510> until<00:03:29.990> it<00:03:30.230> became<00:03:30.950> so

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
push the damn thing until it became so
