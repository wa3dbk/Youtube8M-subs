00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
Express and this is what something

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.080 
Express and this is what something
people<00:00:40.590> been<00:00:40.829> asking<00:00:40.980> for<00:00:41.399> for<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.610> long<00:00:41.670> time

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
people been asking for for a long time

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.119 
people been asking for for a long time
if<00:00:42.329> you're<00:00:42.780> not<00:00:42.930> aware<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.530> haven't<00:00:43.860> seen<00:00:44.010> it

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
if you're not aware you haven't seen it

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.799 
if you're not aware you haven't seen it
yet<00:00:44.280> basically<00:00:45.180> it's<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.450> playlist<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:46.640> is<00:00:47.809> is

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
yet basically it's a playlist that is is

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.630 
yet basically it's a playlist that is is
I<00:00:49.379> think<00:00:49.680> if<00:00:49.829> there's<00:00:50.010> four<00:00:50.219> different<00:00:50.250> game

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
I think if there's four different game

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.380 
I think if there's four different game
types<00:00:50.670> there's<00:00:51.300> domination<00:00:51.960> team<00:00:52.289> deathmatch

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
types there's domination team deathmatch

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.400 
types there's domination team deathmatch
headquarters<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:56.300> forgetting<00:00:57.300> one<00:00:57.480> capture

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
headquarters and forgetting one capture

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.740 
headquarters and forgetting one capture
the<00:00:58.500> flag<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:59.000> so<00:01:00.000> it's<00:01:00.149> four<00:01:00.359> different<00:01:00.600> game

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
the flag and so it's four different game

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.439 
the flag and so it's four different game
modes<00:01:00.780> sort<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.350> like<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> mosh<00:01:01.710> pit<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.449> it's

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
modes sort of like a mosh pit and it's

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.600 
modes sort of like a mosh pit and it's
just<00:01:04.409> like<00:01:04.470> your<00:01:04.739> normal<00:01:04.890> game<00:01:05.189> except

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
just like your normal game except

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.490 
just like your normal game except
there's<00:01:05.760> no<00:01:05.820> ghost<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.540> no<00:01:06.869> second<00:01:07.260> chance

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
there's no ghost and no second chance

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.250 
there's no ghost and no second chance
which<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.700> think<00:01:09.119> most<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.720> community<00:01:10.140> at

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
which I think most of the community at

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.539 
which I think most of the community at
least<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.560> competitive<00:01:11.040> community<00:01:11.430> been

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
least the competitive community been

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.460 
least the competitive community been
complaining<00:01:12.030> about<00:01:12.090> for<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> while<00:01:12.570> those

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
complaining about for a while those

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.370 
complaining about for a while those
perks<00:01:13.799> seem<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.189> be<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.670> ones<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.600> don't

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
perks seem to be the ones that I don't

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.690 
perks seem to be the ones that I don't
know<00:01:16.470> if<00:01:16.530> they're<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:17.250> know<00:01:17.280> everybody<00:01:17.640> says

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.039

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
they're overpowered they're cheap

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.460 
they're overpowered they're cheap
they're<00:01:19.380> things<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:21.090> know<00:01:21.470> really

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
they're things that you know really

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.730

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
most of the time I think things like

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.749 
most of the time I think things like
that<00:01:27.180> are<00:01:27.390> put<00:01:27.570> into<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.840> game<00:01:28.020> for<00:01:28.439> like<00:01:29.310> I

everybody<00:04:10.920> and<00:04:11.160> I<00:04:11.519> just<00:04:11.760> stayed<00:04:11.940> in<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.120> back

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
everybody and I just stayed in the back

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.420 
everybody and I just stayed in the back
I'd<00:04:12.540> get<00:04:12.750> my<00:04:12.900> Sam<00:04:13.350> turret<00:04:13.620> and<00:04:13.799> just<00:04:14.010> protect

I'd get my Sam turret and just protect

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.159 
I'd get my Sam turret and just protect
that<00:04:14.640> so<00:04:15.209> that<00:04:15.360> they<00:04:15.480> couldn't<00:04:15.720> take<00:04:15.870> it<00:04:15.930> out

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
that so that they couldn't take it out

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.870 
that so that they couldn't take it out
basically<00:04:17.040> what<00:04:17.190> ends<00:04:17.340> up<00:04:17.400> happening<00:04:17.459> in<00:04:17.820> that

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
basically what ends up happening in that

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.599 
basically what ends up happening in that
situation<00:04:18.239> is<00:04:18.739> you<00:04:19.739> can<00:04:19.919> see<00:04:20.130> the<00:04:20.250> whole<00:04:20.370> game

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
situation is you can see the whole game

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.039 
situation is you can see the whole game
because<00:04:20.910> you<00:04:21.000> got<00:04:21.120> a<00:04:21.150> spy<00:04:21.359> plane<00:04:21.390> up<00:04:21.720> most<00:04:21.930> of

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
because you got a spy plane up most of

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.620 
because you got a spy plane up most of
the<00:04:22.140> game<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:22.610> they<00:04:23.610> never<00:04:23.820> do<00:04:24.150> because<00:04:24.390> you

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
the game and they never do because you

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.240 
the game and they never do because you
got<00:04:24.750> that<00:04:24.870> Sam<00:04:25.110> turret<00:04:25.320> just<00:04:25.620> blasting<00:04:26.100> it<00:04:26.160> out

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
got that Sam turret just blasting it out

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.629 
got that Sam turret just blasting it out
of<00:04:26.340> the<00:04:26.400> air<00:04:26.520> every<00:04:26.669> time<00:04:26.910> it<00:04:27.030> comes<00:04:27.120> up

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
of the air every time it comes up

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.730 
of the air every time it comes up
which<00:04:27.939> was<00:04:28.120> pretty<00:04:28.240> cool<00:04:28.379> what<00:04:29.379> that<00:04:29.530> led<00:04:29.710> to

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
which was pretty cool what that led to

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.679 
which was pretty cool what that led to
though<00:04:30.099> was<00:04:30.370> we<00:04:30.580> never<00:04:30.759> had<00:04:31.030> an<00:04:31.150> enemy<00:04:31.449> team

00:04:31.679 --> 00:04:31.689 
though was we never had an enemy team

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:33.749 
though was we never had an enemy team
complete<00:04:32.169> a<00:04:32.199> game<00:04:32.469> with<00:04:32.680> us<00:04:32.860> the<00:04:33.099> entire<00:04:33.400> time

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:36.659 
complete a game with us the entire time
we<00:04:34.270> played<00:04:34.509> every<00:04:35.110> single<00:04:35.469> game<00:04:35.680> the<00:04:36.430> team

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
we played every single game the team

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.200 
we played every single game the team
almost<00:04:37.569> the<00:04:37.749> entire<00:04:37.990> team<00:04:38.229> would<00:04:38.439> back<00:04:38.590> out<00:04:39.210> so

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
almost the entire team would back out so

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.779 
almost the entire team would back out so
we<00:04:40.360> end<00:04:40.719> up<00:04:40.779> finishing<00:04:40.990> these<00:04:41.259> games<00:04:41.560> like<00:04:41.919> six

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
we end up finishing these games like six

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:45.600 
we end up finishing these games like six
on<00:04:42.909> three<00:04:43.210> or<00:04:43.539> six<00:04:44.439> on<00:04:44.650> two<00:04:44.860> or<00:04:45.249> well<00:04:45.460> you<00:04:45.520> know

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
it's the way my brain works I guess but

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.929 
it's the way my brain works I guess but

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.959 
killstreaks this game i know i guess
that<00:05:11.830> i<00:05:11.860> was<00:05:12.069> i<00:05:12.250> was<00:05:12.490> running<00:05:12.669> that<00:05:12.849> other

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:12.969 
that i was i was running that other

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:15.089 
that i was i was running that other
strategy<00:05:13.449> most<00:05:13.659> of<00:05:13.810> the<00:05:13.870> night<00:05:14.050> and<00:05:14.259> then<00:05:14.409> I

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
strategy most of the night and then I

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:16.679 
strategy most of the night and then I
kind<00:05:15.699> of<00:05:15.759> got<00:05:15.879> bored<00:05:16.090> of<00:05:16.180> doing<00:05:16.300> that<00:05:16.509> because

00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:16.689 
kind of got bored of doing that because

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:18.390 
kind of got bored of doing that because
I<00:05:16.779> wasn't<00:05:17.020> getting<00:05:17.229> very<00:05:17.560> good<00:05:17.710> game<00:05:17.919> plays<00:05:18.159> so

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
I wasn't getting very good game plays so

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.409 
I wasn't getting very good game plays so
I<00:05:18.430> figured<00:05:18.759> I<00:05:18.819> tried<00:05:19.060> and<00:05:19.120> run<00:05:19.240> the<00:05:19.330> high

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
I figured I tried and run the high

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:20.610 
I figured I tried and run the high
killstreaks<00:05:19.659> and<00:05:20.080> it<00:05:20.139> worked<00:05:20.319> out<00:05:20.409> pretty

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
killstreaks and it worked out pretty

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.519 
killstreaks and it worked out pretty
well<00:05:20.770> for<00:05:20.889> me<00:05:21.129> this<00:05:21.250> game<00:05:21.460> but<00:05:22.210> um<00:05:22.449> oh<00:05:22.689> here

00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:23.529 
well for me this game but um oh here

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:25.499 
well for me this game but um oh here
this<00:05:24.460> little<00:05:24.580> knife<00:05:24.909> fight<00:05:25.120> again<00:05:25.360> and

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:25.509 
this little knife fight again and

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:27.089 
this little knife fight again and
actually<00:05:25.779> when<00:05:26.349> you<00:05:26.379> pull<00:05:26.589> out<00:05:26.680> the<00:05:26.800> Strela

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:27.099 
actually when you pull out the Strela

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:29.189 
actually when you pull out the Strela
you're<00:05:27.430> basically<00:05:27.879> defenseless<00:05:28.749> for<00:05:28.990> a<00:05:29.020> while

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 
you're basically defenseless for a while

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:30.689 
you're basically defenseless for a while
and<00:05:29.349> I<00:05:29.409> ran<00:05:29.589> out<00:05:29.710> of<00:05:29.740> ammo<00:05:29.979> right<00:05:30.219> there<00:05:30.430> so<00:05:30.610> it

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:30.699 
and I ran out of ammo right there so it

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:33.209 
and I ran out of ammo right there so it
started<00:05:30.939> to<00:05:31.029> pull<00:05:31.419> out<00:05:31.509> the<00:05:31.560> Strela<00:05:32.560> and<00:05:32.830> i

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:33.219 
started to pull out the Strela and i

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:34.709 
started to pull out the Strela and i
would<00:05:33.370> say<00:05:33.610> ninety<00:05:34.089> nine<00:05:34.240> percent<00:05:34.419> of<00:05:34.659> the

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:34.719 
would say ninety nine percent of the

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:35.850 
would say ninety nine percent of the
time<00:05:34.870> i'm<00:05:35.050> going<00:05:35.169> to<00:05:35.229> die<00:05:35.319> in<00:05:35.500> that<00:05:35.560> situation

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
time i'm going to die in that situation

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.189 
time i'm going to die in that situation
but<00:05:36.189> I<00:05:36.250> got<00:05:36.370> a<00:05:36.400> little<00:05:36.460> bit<00:05:36.669> lucky<00:05:36.939> there<00:05:37.120> so<00:05:37.870> um

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 
but I got a little bit lucky there so um

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:40.019 
but I got a little bit lucky there so um

thoughts on the playlist I do like it
I'm<00:05:41.650> having<00:05:41.889> fun<00:05:42.039> with<00:05:42.219> it<00:05:42.370> we've<00:05:42.580> been<00:05:42.729> doing

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:43.089 
I'm having fun with it we've been doing

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:45.809 
I'm having fun with it we've been doing
really<00:05:43.330> really<00:05:43.449> well<00:05:43.719> in<00:05:44.080> it<00:05:44.199> and<00:05:44.379> you<00:05:45.279> know

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:45.819 
really really well in it and you know

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:47.070 
really really well in it and you know
there<00:05:46.089> are<00:05:46.120> some<00:05:46.389> things<00:05:46.569> that<00:05:46.719> we<00:05:46.870> would<00:05:46.990> like

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
there are some things that we would like

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.450 
there are some things that we would like
to<00:05:47.199> see<00:05:47.319> a<00:05:47.349> little<00:05:47.469> bit<00:05:47.589> different<00:05:48.009> but<00:05:48.189> for

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
to see a little bit different but for

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.800 
to see a little bit different but for
for<00:05:48.909> the<00:05:48.969> most<00:05:49.149> part<00:05:49.270> it's<00:05:49.479> better<00:05:49.659> it's

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
for the most part it's better it's

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.290 
for the most part it's better it's
faster<00:05:50.319> i<00:05:50.349> mean<00:05:50.620> this<00:05:50.710> game<00:05:50.919> is<00:05:51.189> over<00:05:51.399> in<00:05:51.699> you

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
faster i mean this game is over in you

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.360 
faster i mean this game is over in you
know<00:05:52.419> under<00:05:52.750> seven<00:05:53.080> minutes<00:05:53.110> and<00:05:53.620> granted<00:05:54.250> we

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
know under seven minutes and granted we

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.820 
know under seven minutes and granted we
are<00:05:54.490> dominating<00:05:55.000> them<00:05:55.120> the<00:05:55.240> whole<00:05:55.360> time<00:05:55.539> but

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
are dominating them the whole time but

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.350 
are dominating them the whole time but
it's<00:05:56.830> just<00:05:57.009> a<00:05:57.099> faster-paced<00:05:57.580> gameplay<00:05:58.300> you

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
it's just a faster-paced gameplay you

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.939 
it's just a faster-paced gameplay you
know<00:05:58.539> we<00:05:58.810> when<00:05:59.050> you<00:05:59.139> when<00:05:59.439> we<00:05:59.560> always<00:05:59.830> know

00:05:59.939 --> 00:05:59.949 
know we when you when we always know

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:01.559 
know we when you when we always know
where<00:06:00.099> everybody's<00:06:00.460> at<00:06:00.490> and<00:06:01.060> like<00:06:01.419> i<00:06:01.509> said

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:01.569 
where everybody's at and like i said

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:03.119 
where everybody's at and like i said
it's<00:06:01.839> like<00:06:01.930> having<00:06:02.229> a<00:06:02.319> constant<00:06:02.620> blackboard

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:03.129 
it's like having a constant blackboard

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:05.879 
it's like having a constant blackboard
up<00:06:03.250> so<00:06:04.080> anyway<00:06:05.080> that's<00:06:05.169> my<00:06:05.289> thoughts<00:06:05.560> on<00:06:05.740> it<00:06:05.770> i

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:05.889 
up so anyway that's my thoughts on it i

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:07.709 
up so anyway that's my thoughts on it i
like<00:06:06.069> it<00:06:06.129> check<00:06:06.520> it<00:06:06.550> out<00:06:06.789> if<00:06:07.000> you're<00:06:07.240> if<00:06:07.659> you

00:06:07.709 --> 00:06:07.719 
like it check it out if you're if you

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:08.820 
like it check it out if you're if you
ever<00:06:07.810> get<00:06:07.899> frustrated<00:06:08.349> with<00:06:08.439> ghosts<00:06:08.620> and

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
ever get frustrated with ghosts and

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.480 
ever get frustrated with ghosts and
second<00:06:09.129> chance<00:06:09.509> jump<00:06:10.509> in<00:06:10.629> this<00:06:10.719> game<00:06:10.930> type<00:06:11.169> and

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
second chance jump in this game type and

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.189 
second chance jump in this game type and
by<00:06:12.490> the<00:06:12.550> way<00:06:12.729> it<00:06:12.879> does<00:06:13.060> let<00:06:13.330> you<00:06:13.509> select<00:06:13.930> a

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.199 
by the way it does let you select a

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:15.929 
by the way it does let you select a
class<00:06:14.469> that<00:06:14.740> has<00:06:14.889> ghosts<00:06:15.219> and<00:06:15.430> second<00:06:15.729> chance

00:06:15.929 --> 00:06:15.939 
class that has ghosts and second chance

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:17.490 
class that has ghosts and second chance
on<00:06:16.180> it<00:06:16.210> you'll<00:06:16.479> see<00:06:16.659> a<00:06:16.689> lot<00:06:16.839> of<00:06:16.899> people<00:06:17.169> running

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
on it you'll see a lot of people running

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.950 
on it you'll see a lot of people running
around<00:06:17.589> with<00:06:18.189> what<00:06:19.180> appears<00:06:19.509> to<00:06:19.629> be<00:06:19.659> ghosts

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
around with what appears to be ghosts

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.719 
around with what appears to be ghosts
but<00:06:20.199> it's<00:06:20.319> actually<00:06:20.439> just<00:06:20.949> it<00:06:21.159> lets<00:06:21.310> you<00:06:21.399> do<00:06:21.580> it

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:21.729 
but it's actually just it lets you do it

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:23.760 
but it's actually just it lets you do it
but<00:06:21.909> it<00:06:22.029> doesn't<00:06:22.270> actually<00:06:22.419> equip<00:06:22.839> it<00:06:22.960> so<00:06:23.139> you

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
but it doesn't actually equip it so you

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.139 
but it doesn't actually equip it so you
might<00:06:23.949> be<00:06:23.979> wearing<00:06:24.219> the<00:06:24.490> ghillie<00:06:24.669> suit<00:06:25.000> or

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:25.149 
might be wearing the ghillie suit or

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:26.730
