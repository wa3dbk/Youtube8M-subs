00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.340 
currently locked file locked and if i
try<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.220> access<00:02:05.400> it<00:02:05.700> from<00:02:05.730> here<00:02:06.120> it<00:02:06.810> simply

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
try and access it from here it simply

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.410 
try and access it from here it simply
doesn't<00:02:07.560> do<00:02:07.770> anything<00:02:08.099> open<00:02:08.550> file<00:02:08.789> fails<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:09.390> i

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
doesn't do anything open file fails so i

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.240 
doesn't do anything open file fails so i
can't<00:02:09.690> do<00:02:09.810> anything<00:02:09.989> so<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.770> does<00:02:10.950> lot<00:02:11.160> the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
can't do anything so it does lot the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.720 
can't do anything so it does lot the
file<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.700> doesn't<00:02:12.090> remove<00:02:12.630> it<00:02:12.870> from<00:02:13.730> file

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
file it doesn't remove it from file

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.340 
file it doesn't remove it from file
manager<00:02:15.090> so<00:02:15.330> you<00:02:15.360> can<00:02:15.660> tell<00:02:15.930> that<00:02:15.960> there<00:02:16.200> is<00:02:16.320> a

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
manager so you can tell that there is a

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.940 
manager so you can tell that there is a
locked<00:02:16.590> file

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
locked file

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.520 
locked file
there<00:02:17.270> however<00:02:18.270> if<00:02:18.450> I<00:02:18.569> do<00:02:18.629> go<00:02:18.989> to<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.290> gallery

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
there however if I do go to the gallery

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.199 
there however if I do go to the gallery
we<00:02:22.530> can<00:02:22.709> have<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:22.980> look<00:02:23.340> at<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.730> download

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
we can have a look at the download

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.790 
we can have a look at the download
folder<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.900> we'll<00:02:25.200> see<00:02:25.349> where<00:02:25.500> there's<00:02:25.650> no

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
folder and we'll see where there's no

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.160 
folder and we'll see where there's no
actual<00:02:25.980> presence<00:02:26.790> of<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.209> picture<00:02:27.660> there<00:02:27.870> so

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
actual presence of the picture there so

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.500 
actual presence of the picture there so
it<00:02:28.290> does<00:02:28.650> remove<00:02:29.010> itself<00:02:29.370> from<00:02:29.519> applications

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
it does remove itself from applications

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.880 
it does remove itself from applications
but<00:02:30.690> you<00:02:30.780> can<00:02:30.989> see<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.260> from<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.500> file<00:02:31.680> manager

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
but you can see it from the file manager

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.160 
but you can see it from the file manager
so<00:02:32.670> obviously<00:02:33.000> if<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.209> want<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.450> lock<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:33.959> then<00:02:34.110> I

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
so obviously if I want to lock it then I

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.890 
so obviously if I want to lock it then I
would<00:02:34.319> just<00:02:34.470> go<00:02:34.590> back<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:34.830> firewalker<00:02:35.900> press

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
would just go back to firewalker press

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.020 
would just go back to firewalker press
on<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.200> file<00:02:37.410> its<00:02:37.650> going<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.890> ask<00:02:38.069> me<00:02:38.310> I<00:02:38.519> can

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
on the file its going to ask me I can

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.580 
on the file its going to ask me I can
either<00:02:39.180> unlock<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:39.780> for<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:40.019> short<00:02:40.260> period<00:02:40.290> of

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
either unlock it for a short period of

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.199 
either unlock it for a short period of
time<00:02:40.650> which<00:02:41.459> means<00:02:41.610> that<00:02:41.700> i<00:02:41.790> can<00:02:41.819> lock<00:02:42.090> it

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
time which means that i can lock it

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.940 
time which means that i can lock it
again<00:02:42.300> about<00:02:42.569> using<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.900> password<00:02:43.110> or<00:02:43.530> if<00:02:43.830> i

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
again about using a password or if i

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.199 
again about using a password or if i
want<00:02:44.069> to<00:02:44.130> unlock<00:02:44.340> it<00:02:44.400> permanently<00:02:44.849> i'll<00:02:45.000> just

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
want to unlock it permanently i'll just

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.360 
want to unlock it permanently i'll just
tip<00:02:45.420> that<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:45.810> then<00:02:45.900> put<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.530> password<00:02:46.920> back

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
tip that and then put the password back

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:54.199 
tip that and then put the password back
in<00:02:50.540> that<00:02:51.540> should<00:02:51.959> remove<00:02:52.739> any<00:02:53.010> trace<00:02:53.099> of<00:02:53.640> the

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
in that should remove any trace of the

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.170 
in that should remove any trace of the
fact<00:02:54.480> that<00:02:54.690> it's<00:02:55.079> been<00:02:55.680> unlocked<00:02:56.130> so<00:02:56.940> now<00:02:57.120> we

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
fact that it's been unlocked so now we

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.229 
fact that it's been unlocked so now we
can<00:02:57.360> see<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.540> transformer<00:02:58.940> picture<00:02:59.940> has<00:03:00.060> come

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
can see a transformer picture has come

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.569 
can see a transformer picture has come
back<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:00.750> there<00:03:01.290> you<00:03:01.380> are<00:03:01.410> it's<00:03:01.890> open<00:03:02.280> so<00:03:02.549> I

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
back and there you are it's open so I

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.150 
back and there you are it's open so I
can<00:03:02.760> now<00:03:03.030> use<00:03:03.239> it<00:03:03.360> again<00:03:03.630> so<00:03:04.200> air<00:03:04.500> and<00:03:04.709> need<00:03:05.130> a

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
can now use it again so air and need a

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.259 
can now use it again so air and need a
little<00:03:05.340> device<00:03:05.670> for<00:03:05.880> just<00:03:06.030> locking

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
little device for just locking

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.199 
little device for just locking
individual<00:03:07.170> files<00:03:08.010> rather<00:03:08.430> than<00:03:08.579> lock<00:03:09.090> an

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
individual files rather than lock an

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.479 
individual files rather than lock an
entire<00:03:09.599> application<00:03:09.840> a<00:03:10.470> couple<00:03:10.980> of<00:03:11.069> words<00:03:11.250> of

entire application a couple of words of

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.039 
entire application a couple of words of
warning<00:03:11.730> obviously<00:03:12.269> if<00:03:12.329> you<00:03:12.390> do<00:03:12.599> do<00:03:12.750> this<00:03:12.930> you

warning obviously if you do do this you

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.390 
warning obviously if you do do this you

any files corrupt on me yet but I've not

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.850 
any files corrupt on me yet but I've not
used<00:03:17.430> that<00:03:17.610> much<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:18.410> another<00:03:19.410> thing<00:03:19.530> is<00:03:19.829> that

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
used that much and another thing is that

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.710 
used that much and another thing is that
I<00:03:20.130> believe<00:03:20.280> that<00:03:20.760> you<00:03:20.880> cannot<00:03:21.180> recover<00:03:21.540> your

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
I believe that you cannot recover your

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.180 
I believe that you cannot recover your
password<00:03:21.780> if<00:03:22.260> you<00:03:22.290> forget<00:03:22.380> it<00:03:22.709> so<00:03:22.889> if<00:03:22.950> you<00:03:23.040> do

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
password if you forget it so if you do

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.190 
password if you forget it so if you do
forget<00:03:23.430> it<00:03:23.670> you're<00:03:24.090> absolutely<00:03:24.269> stuck<00:03:24.959> and

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
forget it you're absolutely stuck and

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.410 
forget it you're absolutely stuck and
you<00:03:25.440> basically<00:03:26.160> lost<00:03:26.579> the<00:03:26.730> data<00:03:26.940> so<00:03:27.180> do<00:03:27.389> be

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
you basically lost the data so do be

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.620 
you basically lost the data so do be
careful<00:03:27.720> with<00:03:28.109> it<00:03:28.230> I<00:03:28.380> am<00:03:29.010> aware<00:03:29.519> that<00:03:30.150> on<00:03:30.510> the

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
careful with it I am aware that on the

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.590 
careful with it I am aware that on the
marketplace<00:03:31.019> very<00:03:31.500> is<00:03:31.590> also<00:03:32.069> another<00:03:32.600> program

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
marketplace very is also another program

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.129 
marketplace very is also another program
called<00:03:33.810> hide<00:03:34.650> it<00:03:34.829> pro<00:03:35.160> which<00:03:35.819> has<00:03:36.720> very<00:03:36.810> good

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
called hide it pro which has very good

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.530 
called hide it pro which has very good
ratings<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:37.889> i<00:03:37.950> think<00:03:38.130> is<00:03:38.250> a<00:03:38.280> whoops<00:03:38.970> rumbling

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
ratings and i think is a whoops rumbling

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.390 
ratings and i think is a whoops rumbling
it's<00:03:39.930> a<00:03:40.290> i<00:03:40.470> believe<00:03:40.709> is<00:03:40.799> a<00:03:40.859> very<00:03:41.069> similar

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
it's a i believe is a very similar

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.670 
it's a i believe is a very similar
locking<00:03:42.060> program<00:03:42.510> and<00:03:42.900> i'm<00:03:43.019> going<00:03:43.170> to<00:03:43.290> try<00:03:43.410> out

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
locking program and i'm going to try out

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.900 
locking program and i'm going to try out
in<00:03:43.739> the<00:03:43.799> next<00:03:43.920> couple<00:03:44.069> of<00:03:44.280> days<00:03:44.459> and<00:03:44.700> if<00:03:44.760> it's

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
in the next couple of days and if it's
