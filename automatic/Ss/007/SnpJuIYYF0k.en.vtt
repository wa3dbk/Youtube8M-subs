00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
air intake on that one so I might

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.509 
air intake on that one so I might
consider<00:02:54.340> going<00:02:54.700> back<00:02:54.849> to<00:02:55.269> the<00:02:56.340> canister<00:02:57.340> wat

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
consider going back to the canister wat

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.900 
consider going back to the canister wat
one<00:02:57.790> because<00:02:58.120> finding<00:02:58.959> out<00:02:59.140> that<00:02:59.440> the<00:02:59.980> side

air<00:03:01.359> duct<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:02.109> think<00:03:02.440> it's<00:03:02.560> what<00:03:02.650> they<00:03:02.739> call<00:03:02.769> it

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
air duct I think it's what they call it

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.800 
air duct I think it's what they call it
that<00:03:03.310> sucks<00:03:03.609> actually<00:03:03.850> sucks<00:03:04.269> the<00:03:04.329> area<00:03:04.660> and<00:03:04.720> I

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
that sucks actually sucks the area and I

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.729 
that sucks actually sucks the area and I
guess<00:03:04.989> into<00:03:06.420> building<00:03:07.420> cold<00:03:08.079> air<00:03:08.200> intake<00:03:08.590> that

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
guess into building cold air intake that

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.979 
guess into building cold air intake that
goes<00:03:09.310> that<00:03:09.760> connects<00:03:10.060> right<00:03:10.239> up<00:03:10.420> into<00:03:10.600> the

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
goes that connects right up into the

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.870 
goes that connects right up into the
canister<00:03:11.380> air<00:03:11.709> filters<00:03:12.130> that's<00:03:12.310> pretty<00:03:12.519> cool
