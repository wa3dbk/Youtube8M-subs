00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.020 
settings so in here when you start the
program<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:19.890> have<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.130> option<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.820> setting

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
program you have the option of setting

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.640 
program you have the option of setting
up<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.270> high<00:02:21.390> key<00:02:21.690> which<00:02:21.990> I<00:02:22.140> set<00:02:22.470> it<00:02:22.560> up<00:02:22.590> to

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
up the high key which I set it up to

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.590 
up the high key which I set it up to
controlling<00:02:23.310> space<00:02:23.730> but<00:02:24.060> you<00:02:24.330> have<00:02:24.420> some

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
controlling space but you have some

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.880 
controlling space but you have some
other<00:02:24.720> options<00:02:26.510> so<00:02:27.510> that's<00:02:27.690> pretty<00:02:27.930> cool

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
other options so that's pretty cool

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.830 
other options so that's pretty cool
I'm<00:02:29.220> not<00:02:29.400> really<00:02:29.520> sure<00:02:29.670> what<00:02:29.820> this<00:02:29.970> is<00:02:30.030> system

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
I'm not really sure what this is system

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.729 
I'm not really sure what this is system
high<00:02:31.020> key<00:02:31.320> and<00:02:32.840> if<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:33.989> want<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.200> skins<00:02:34.530> they

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
high key and if you want to skins they

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.140 
high key and if you want to skins they
don't<00:02:34.920> have<00:02:35.010> right<00:02:35.190> now<00:02:35.250> this<00:02:35.489> one<00:02:35.640> is<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.760> beta

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
don't have right now this one is a beta

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.720 
don't have right now this one is a beta
so<00:02:36.600> don't<00:02:37.140> expect<00:02:37.230> much<00:02:37.709> right<00:02:37.920> now<00:02:37.980> but<00:02:38.340> they

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
so don't expect much right now but they

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.490 
so don't expect much right now but they
have<00:02:38.850> some<00:02:39.030> available<00:02:39.600> plugins<00:02:39.900> here<00:02:40.170> the

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
have some available plugins here the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.530 
have some available plugins here the
first<00:02:40.890> one<00:02:41.040> I<00:02:41.070> like<00:02:41.580> is<00:02:41.610> that<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:42.000> calculator

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
and a web search that's pretty much it

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.780 
and a web search that's pretty much it
that<00:02:45.150> I<00:02:45.390> think<00:02:45.600> it<00:02:45.840> was<00:02:45.900> cool<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:47.400> web<00:02:47.550> search
