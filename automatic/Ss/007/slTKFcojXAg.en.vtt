00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
of these concerns that people have I

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.070 
of these concerns that people have I
mean<00:00:26.580> something<00:00:26.789> like<00:00:26.910> polygamy<00:00:27.300> for<00:00:27.689> example

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
mean something like polygamy for example

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.500 
mean something like polygamy for example
has<00:00:28.170> been<00:00:28.289> outlawed<00:00:28.529> since<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.550> believe<00:00:29.760> 1890

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
has been outlawed since I believe 1890

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.759 
has been outlawed since I believe 1890
are<00:00:30.599> there<00:00:30.750> abouts<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.289> P<00:00:31.410> it's<00:00:31.560> still

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
are there abouts and P it's still

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.530 
are there abouts and P it's still
probably<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.340> most<00:00:32.460> associated<00:00:33.059> thing<00:00:33.360> with

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
probably the most associated thing with

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.410 
probably the most associated thing with
with<00:00:33.930> Mormonism<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.920> know<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.130> 2007<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.090> it's

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
with Mormonism you know in 2007 so it's

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.060 
with Mormonism you know in 2007 so it's
a<00:00:36.510> challenge<00:00:36.540> for<00:00:36.960> him<00:00:37.230> but<00:00:37.469> it's<00:00:37.920> certainly

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
a challenge for him but it's certainly

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.950 
a challenge for him but it's certainly
something<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.610> he<00:00:38.790> can<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.450> know<00:00:39.540> overcome

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
something that he can you know overcome

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.360 
something that he can you know overcome
yeah<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.350> think<00:00:40.710> it's<00:00:40.890> important<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.219> note<00:00:41.340> that

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
yeah I think it's important to note that

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.889 
yeah I think it's important to note that
it's<00:00:41.610> not<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.850> sanctioned<00:00:42.300> by<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.600> Mormon

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
it's not a sanctioned by the Mormon

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:43.970 
it's not a sanctioned by the Mormon
Church<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.440> reason<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.739> stills

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
Church and the reason it stills

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.830 
Church and the reason it stills
associated<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.700> because<00:00:45.030> there<00:00:45.210> are<00:00:45.329> splinter

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
associated is because there are splinter

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.690 
associated is because there are splinter
groups<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.289> still<00:00:46.500> practice<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.579> know

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
groups that still practice it you know

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.029 
groups that still practice it you know
even<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:48.210> parts<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.539> Utah<00:00:48.840> but<00:00:49.079> bringing<00:00:49.829> you

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
even in parts of Utah but bringing you

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.899 
force to be reckoned with and what's
really<00:01:41.070> important<00:01:41.430> about<00:01:41.460> something<00:01:41.820> like

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
really important about something like

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.670 
really important about something like
tonight's<00:01:42.240> interview<00:01:42.509> on<00:01:42.750> 60<00:01:43.079> minutes<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.560> it

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
tonight's interview on 60 minutes is it

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.080 
tonight's interview on 60 minutes is it
isn't<00:01:43.950> even<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.220> much<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.759> Mormon

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
isn't even so much the the Mormon

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.060 
isn't even so much the the Mormon
question<00:01:45.450> it's<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.049> exposure<00:01:46.530> question

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
question it's the exposure question

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.710 
question it's the exposure question
because<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.820> know<00:01:47.909> Mitt<00:01:48.060> Romney<00:01:48.360> he's

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
because you know Mitt Romney he's

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.940 
because you know Mitt Romney he's
raising<00:01:48.930> more<00:01:49.140> money<00:01:49.200> than<00:01:49.500> everyone<00:01:49.770> else

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
raising more money than everyone else

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.990 
raising more money than everyone else
but<00:01:50.100> he<00:01:50.189> still<00:01:50.340> can't<00:01:50.610> get<00:01:50.700> out<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:50.939> those

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
but he still can't get out of those

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.370 
but he still can't get out of those
single-digit<00:01:51.630> polling<00:01:51.930> numbers<00:01:51.960> it's

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
single-digit polling numbers it's

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.569 
single-digit polling numbers it's
because<00:01:52.619> most<00:01:52.829> people<00:01:53.070> don't<00:01:53.100> know<00:01:53.340> much

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
because most people don't know much

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.100 
because most people don't know much
about<00:01:53.610> him<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.149> he<00:01:54.479> needs<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.689> get<00:01:54.810> out<00:01:54.869> there

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
about him and he needs to get out there

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.660 
about him and he needs to get out there
and<00:01:55.200> engage<00:01:55.470> with<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.770> American<00:01:56.130> public<00:01:56.430> and

if that's true Doug how much does the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.510 
if that's true Doug how much does the
prospect<00:01:59.729> of<00:02:00.030> having<00:02:00.180> Mitt<00:02:00.540> Romney<00:02:01.159> scare<00:02:02.159> you

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
I don't think that Mitt Romney's

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.830 
I don't think that Mitt Romney's
religion<00:02:09.440> scares<00:02:10.440> people<00:02:10.709> i<00:02:11.069> think<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.550> what

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
religion scares people i think that what

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.930 
religion scares people i think that what
troubles

troubles

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.370 
troubles
about<00:02:13.330> Romney<00:02:13.750> is<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:14.050> that<00:02:14.230> he's

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
about Romney is it that he's

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.410 
about Romney is it that he's
flip-flopped<00:02:15.310> on<00:02:15.490> a<00:02:15.550> lot<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:15.880> issues<00:02:16.000> like

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
flip-flopped on a lot of issues like

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.910 
flip-flopped on a lot of issues like
stem<00:02:16.840> cell<00:02:17.190> guns<00:02:18.420> abortion<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:20.500> I<00:02:20.680> think

stem cell guns abortion and I think

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.500

think i'm looking back at on the MSNBC

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.190 
think i'm looking back at on the MSNBC
debate<00:03:27.220> on<00:03:27.430> that<00:03:27.640> we<00:03:27.760> saw<00:03:27.910> at<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:28.810> Reagan

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
debate on that we saw at the Reagan

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.350 
debate on that we saw at the Reagan
Library<00:03:29.320> last<00:03:29.920> week<00:03:30.130> or<00:03:30.760> two<00:03:30.910> weeks<00:03:31.030> ago<00:03:31.180> now

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
Library last week or two weeks ago now

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.960 
Library last week or two weeks ago now
he<00:03:31.420> he<00:03:32.140> looked<00:03:32.560> pretty<00:03:32.770> darn<00:03:32.920> charismatic<00:03:33.730> and

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
he he looked pretty darn charismatic and

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.400 
he he looked pretty darn charismatic and
I<00:03:34.270> think<00:03:34.480> that<00:03:34.600> you<00:03:34.660> can't<00:03:34.870> under<00:03:35.140> you<00:03:35.380> know

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
I think that you can't under you know

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.990 
I think that you can't under you know
you<00:03:35.739> can't<00:03:35.920> underscore<00:03:36.250> like<00:03:36.489> how<00:03:36.610> important

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
you can't underscore like how important

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.370 
you can't underscore like how important
that<00:03:37.060> isn't<00:03:37.420> isn't<00:03:37.630> in<00:03:37.810> a<00:03:37.900> presidential

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
that isn't isn't in a presidential

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.320 
that isn't isn't in a presidential
campaign<00:03:38.530> so<00:03:38.950> I<00:03:38.980> think<00:03:39.100> that<00:03:39.370> it's<00:03:40.060> to<00:03:40.209> his

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
campaign so I think that it's to his

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.910 
campaign so I think that it's to his
benefit<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.840> more<00:03:40.989> he<00:03:41.110> can<00:03:41.200> get<00:03:41.380> out<00:03:41.500> there<00:03:41.680> on

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
benefit the more he can get out there on

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.460 
benefit the more he can get out there on
TV<00:03:42.370> out<00:03:42.670> in<00:03:42.820> front<00:03:43.000> of<00:03:43.120> voters<00:03:43.390> you<00:03:44.200> know<00:03:44.290> he's

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
TV out in front of voters you know he's

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.810 
TV out in front of voters you know he's
certainly<00:03:44.739> more<00:03:44.950> charismatic<00:03:45.280> than<00:03:45.610> some

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
certainly more charismatic than some

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:47.009 
certainly more charismatic than some
other<00:03:45.970> candidates<00:03:46.390> and<00:03:46.510> that<00:03:46.600> that<00:03:46.810> plays

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
other candidates and that that plays

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.090 
other candidates and that that plays
into<00:03:47.200> his<00:03:47.350> strong<00:03:47.560> suit<00:03:47.800> you<00:03:47.830> know<00:03:47.920> other

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
into his strong suit you know other

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.890 
into his strong suit you know other
people<00:03:48.310> have<00:03:48.430> more<00:03:48.640> experience<00:03:49.150> you<00:03:49.330> know<00:03:49.720> he

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
people have more experience you know he

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.420 
people have more experience you know he
seems<00:03:50.110> to<00:03:50.290> have<00:03:50.320> the<00:03:50.590> charisma<00:03:50.800> so<00:03:51.160> that's<00:03:51.340> you

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
seems to have the charisma so that's you

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.250 
seems to have the charisma so that's you
know<00:03:51.519> that's<00:03:51.550> his<00:03:51.790> strong<00:03:52.060> point<00:03:52.480> Doug<00:03:52.930> does

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
know that's his strong point Doug does

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.660 
know that's his strong point Doug does
Mitt<00:03:53.410> Romney<00:03:53.769> possess<00:03:54.100> presidential

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
Mitt Romney possess presidential

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.460 
Mitt Romney possess presidential
charisma<00:03:55.060> I<00:03:55.209> mean<00:03:55.450> Alison's<00:03:55.900> right<00:03:56.110> he<00:03:56.290> did

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
charisma I mean Alison's right he did

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.580 
charisma I mean Alison's right he did
very<00:03:56.590> well<00:03:56.709> in<00:03:56.890> the<00:03:57.160> Republican<00:03:57.790> debate<00:03:58.060> on

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
very well in the Republican debate on

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.020 
very well in the Republican debate on
MSNBC<00:03:59.590> I<00:03:59.620> think<00:04:00.010> he<00:04:00.190> certainly<00:04:00.700> looks

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
MSNBC I think he certainly looks

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.699 
MSNBC I think he certainly looks
presidential<00:04:01.810> whether<00:04:02.230> he<00:04:02.350> has<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.590> right

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
presidential whether he has the right

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.530 
presidential whether he has the right
kind<00:04:02.980> of<00:04:03.040> experience<00:04:03.610> time<00:04:03.880> will<00:04:04.090> tell<00:04:04.300> but

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
kind of experience time will tell but

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.570 
kind of experience time will tell but
Allison's<00:04:05.410> also<00:04:05.709> right<00:04:05.890> he<00:04:06.040> needs<00:04:06.250> to<00:04:06.430> get<00:04:06.519> out

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.430 
Allison's also right he needs to get out
there<00:04:06.910> and<00:04:07.030> get<00:04:07.180> known<00:04:07.480> he's<00:04:07.959> got<00:04:08.170> a<00:04:08.200> lot<00:04:08.380> of
