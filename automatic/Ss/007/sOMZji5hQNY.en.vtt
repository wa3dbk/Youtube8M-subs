00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.400
 the kingdom hearts 2 for playstation 2 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.879
 but in the playstation 2 dweller of 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.760
 pc processiond good hd and I'm 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:46.480
 talking to a friend calls two hours 6 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.809
 645 and well this person what he does is 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.670
 that makes patches for homeless 2 of 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.100
 playstation 2 and good what is 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.890
 doing currently is a patch for 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.800
 play homeless 2 fine mix or be the 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.989
 Japanese version that is with all 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.210
 cut issues coming out American 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.550
 in Spanish so this solution is a 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.320
 Japanese version of the complete game in 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.330
 Spanish and how can you see the screen 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.550
 are watching a demonstration of how it 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.770
 can see 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.320
 is playing us good is basically 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.750
 translate the audio of the characters 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.890
 texts the sword flames to which 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.460
 bone blades 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.830
 and it's good to basically translate the game 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.140
 in Spanish using the size of the 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.970
 Spanish version of the game that came out in 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.070
 europe and also the translation that 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.500
 it just comes out of version 2.5 for the 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.810
 playstation 3 so it's like a mix 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.700
 of the original Spanish version and the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.720
 newly updated version in hd 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.920
 that for those who do not have a plan 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.170
 are 3 if you want to play this game 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.670
 do it in Spanish so that people 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.100
 understands what you can understand if you do not know 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.260
 English this game is very important for 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.210
 the saga and many people who do not know English 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.520
 will not be able to experiment because they have 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.720
 had to search on youtube for a 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.700
 person who has had to explain and 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.880
 he could not play the experience of playing 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.080
 this good game can already have the 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.940

 he did that he could get him into the game he 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.590
 exchanged the Japanese for the in 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.050
 Spanish and good is seen in hd basically 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.630

 game is not going to erase its other version as well 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.910
 that will duplicate the game that are 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.280
 four days usually so they're going to be 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.320
 another game of 4 gigs but that version 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.880

 they keep their jewel translated well this 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.720
 is an alternative so they do not have a 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.900
 process in three if they want to play the 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.330
 version in hd to 2.5 which is in itself the 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.830
 final match version but in English and in 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.500
 Spanish if I have a European version 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.169
 depreciation 3 but do not have a process 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.220

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.200

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.990

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.910
 version 2.5 that arrived in this country 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.410
 in English and good as you do not have 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.420
 playstation3 and who plays this game 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.760
 you can play the spanish version and 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.280
 because you just started doing this that 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.050
 is the mode in Spanish so like I said 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.940
 counted this seconds now the contacts 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.500
 even in the video management and you go in 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.480
 the screen that is usually your twitter 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.070
 and your search just have to tell you that 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.080

 the contacts will not go the others 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.600
 that they know how to speak in Spanish 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.730
 good little because they understand more English 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.470
 that nothing but understands more or less in 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.810
 Spanish is defending at least the 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.840
 translator so they resurfaced better than 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.250
 at least they speak a little in English and they 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.530
 try a little to get them 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.570
 understand but it's basically telling you that 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:53.810

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:57.320

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:17.150
 you want what you need is going to 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:22.300
