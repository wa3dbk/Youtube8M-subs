just some angles to show you guys
exactly<00:01:39.180> what<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.689> mean<00:01:39.900> he<00:01:40.020> turns<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.470> corner

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
exactly what I mean he turns the corner

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.710 
exactly what I mean he turns the corner
doesn't<00:01:41.340> even<00:01:41.430> get<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.670> chance<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:42.150> shoot<00:01:42.509> and

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
doesn't even get a chance to shoot and

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.200 
doesn't even get a chance to shoot and
then<00:01:43.110> just<00:01:43.229> gets<00:01:43.500> completely<00:01:44.070> dominated<00:01:44.880> by

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
then just gets completely dominated by

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.510 
then just gets completely dominated by
my<00:01:45.420> teammates<00:01:45.960> it's<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.009> mean<00:01:47.369> it's

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
my teammates it's on I mean it's

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.190 
my teammates it's on I mean it's
sometimes<00:01:47.820> become<00:01:48.180> really<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.509> parent<00:01:48.899> for<00:01:48.930> me

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
sometimes become really a parent for me

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.380 
sometimes become really a parent for me
even<00:01:49.590> though<00:01:49.860> in<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.369> oddball<00:01:50.790> playlist<00:01:51.270> you
