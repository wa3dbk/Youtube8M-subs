00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 hi everyone these ten 69 then 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.319
 today we find ourselves for my all 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.629
 first video on my new channel 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.040
 so this video will be a tutorial that will 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.139
 to interest more than one so that will be 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.030
 how to finally win know how 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.790
 gain a lot of experience with 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.410
 the plane on battlefield 3 so his 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.820
 buddies it's really not complicated you 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.850
 can do it you have to do it in 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.260
 multiplayer you can should if 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.510
 possible to do it with friends because 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.859
 that all alone is pretty complicated good 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.510
 I'll do it in an empty server 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.130
 to show you the example that the 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.619
 video is offline because I have not 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.329
 had the opportunity to record my voice in 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.980
 same time as I film and so you 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.300
 go multiplayer so that's it 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.649
 then you go to navigation of 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.360
 servers you go in filter is 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.160
 deactivated finally you put all the 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.379
 game modes and you put the card there 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.670
 wake 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.710
 because in this map there is an agent who 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.329
 is called the f 35 which finally allows you 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.879
 this plane has a big advantage is that it 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.610
 allows to hover in the air so I 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.690
 believe he's on the American side or 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.609
 Russian finally from elsewhere it is that these 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.359
 two there but I do not know any more I 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.530
 believe that these Americans 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.270
 finally anyway we start on the 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.350
 door so had these Americans so 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.640
 so this is the mode this conquers a 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.619
 assault on i wake so here i took a 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.140
 empty server to show you so I 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.820
 will not win xp so puts in actually the 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.830
 goal 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.060
 you'll see good by cons it's from 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.619
 spawn and very very fast in an airplane 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.030
 because it's a bit of a war for 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.640
 have planes everybody all the 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.869
 world wants we see the little time of 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.700
 loading so here is so you wait 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.619
 that the spawn plane put yourself besides 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.659
 an engineer if possible and you take 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.400
 a f 35 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.020
 you press the l2 key to 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.520
 can hover with the plane so on 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.980
 xbox i do not know what it's like 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.900
 touch on pc i still know 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.190
 it's not good at all 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.890
 so after the goal is to go to a 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.500
 flag so it must be complicated so 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.900
 the goal of your teammates it will be 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.690
 follow you on the ground so as 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.670
 something like that and you cover 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.210
 in fact since the goal you have the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.890
 goal 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.720
 the mission you are going to have landed 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.340
 by plane on the flag in order to capture 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.050
 the flag with the plane what you 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.820
 will have up to 60 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.040
 it's 4 without taking give us 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.820
 400 points 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.470
 I think that's it I think it's 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.790
 400 chickens fed with the plane of which 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.770
 400 points that already allows you the 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.950
 block the very first accessory that 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.209
 are theirs to faro of cross and the 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.190
 second it is the missionaries by 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.480
 uche is really the thing that can 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.280
 unlock on the area what with his 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.810
 iron hand in a game glove 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.400
 massacre with the coming or not made very 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.680
 well the landing and is actually 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.760
 the gold there I did anything here 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.810
 that's why you need to 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.180
 teammates since then there you are 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.830
 really super vulnerable dollars a 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.480
 tariff or shells ended or 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.920
 four caravans that advance blue pokemon 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.420
 have time in front of you who you 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.810
 so help after I'm going to try to 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.610
 repositioned so as you also see 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.290
 the video I have not a 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.849
 too much considering that I think it's going to be 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.770
 set I already have a background and a 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.970
 logo but these are the backgrounds and 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.860
 the ogbl my old chain so I 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.870
 looking for people who would like 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.520
 do the same do a ferry giang 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.930
 and a logo that would be super nice 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.430
 here you capture flag that makes you 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.110
