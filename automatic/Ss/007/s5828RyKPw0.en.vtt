00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.070
 in this video of a circus for its part the unique virus partner 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:10.900
 new 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.150
 called martín 1 there was perfect if to the leadership that the name of the case of 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.140
 chalk about what kind of polino itself v 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.400
 the tool nízar 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.560
 when mike simonton where he met terms 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.960
 although telecinco correct to place it squad and agrees said 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.960
 but all forms the league of ascent 4 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.710
 there was perfect and that's the way you are exhausted in those who have perfect 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.710
 here you can give a general rule to work 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.750
 the organizations constituted by a uvi mobile p 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.690
 let's review the requirements that have to be seen and ink 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.370
 inés gallardo finished 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.840
 an expert in a published analysis 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.450
 they have played very well 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.280
 we still have to verify the journey of the first has played with the 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.330
 second 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.120
 climbed the have paid for ee 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.160
 and the title the first with four seconds is to say by the end of the year about 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.259
 pp and summer 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.840
 the reality a chair 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.580
 and after the second goal 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.920
 if then the visitor is transformed the actors have come to one built 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.000
 the amate wine cube 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 as an example to understand the rule 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.320
 here they have to cover with all x 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.490
 It is always good to have someone for three 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.410
 here they have the cube the second to take the public 125 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.570
 and that is the same way 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.100
 check the dangers 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.190
 he wanted to feel 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.430
 the money agreed per second 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.430
 from his side the entity insist now 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.090
 and verify local in the digital poly-forum 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.880
 and is that one should be loved 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.919
 the first arrived at the equator of the second 

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.539
 to solve it 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.289
 read that it was 75 alex 

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:18.209
 As you can see in Estepona, there are also four roads where drinking is verified 

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:22.529
 then the most up to date command the next one fulfilled 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.309
 and I'm afraid tent that day x 

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:28.249
 livieres 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:29.789
 it would be like this 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:32.269
 love cube 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.669
 and channel 40 

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:38.809
 the cube of the wine in the victim but the composer to solve this cube the 

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:39.729
 wine 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:43.040
 using the notable product royalties that the monopoly 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.399
 they are going to check penal by a man of over to the year pacino china 

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:49.310
 now we 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.659
 and yet nothing is understood, the case is all 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.459
 in 2007 

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:58.249
 hugo soto 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:01.249
 how are we going 3 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:03.690
 yes you vii 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.199
 militant of the ump nothing 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:09.699
 answer 17 3 city of bs rapporteur d 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.079
 I will not say why in the 1 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.829
 as checking the cube of the first 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.729
 here has the cube of the second 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:22.399
 the first one is always look for the perfect cubes 

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:26.879
 be careful with him but 7 45 hours of the same basile sign 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.989
 Now I understand the criticisms 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.189
 he wanted to be a writer 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:35.049
 of the first 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.110
 to equalize the whole country 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.949
 world 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:42.409
 patriots can sell their cattle can put first cover any other be 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.549
 a sum that was previously does not matter 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:49.319
 we solve 3 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.419
 a Honduran lawyer doctor 4 

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:54.949
 legality 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:59.089
 - 108 blender verifying 

00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:02.429
 this is the ninth with a vigil 

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:05.539
 now we have not understood yes 

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:09.029
 it should be worthy the first 

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:14.279
 with which the second won the staff has nine 16 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.389
 144 today 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.669
 you can verify the four requirements then 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.699
 Martin de la Vega 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:24.050
 the sii 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.499
 and the value of eastman kodak 

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:29.809
 then the factorization is going to be 

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:33.259
 the wine cube 3 yes - 4 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.229
 before a criminal judge account 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.430
 al azhar realization of our with an environment 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.850
 this has been all 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.480
 let's keep working together thank you very much
