00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
units that were running and it's a very

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.740 
units that were running and it's a very
physical<00:01:34.760> shoot<00:01:34.940> from<00:01:35.150> the<00:01:35.210> beginning<00:01:35.600> from

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
physical shoot from the beginning from

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.120 
physical shoot from the beginning from
the<00:01:35.840> training<00:01:36.170> right<00:01:36.440> through<00:01:36.680> to<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:36.920> six

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
the training right through to the six

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.220 
the training right through to the six
months<00:01:37.430> of<00:01:37.520> student<00:01:37.760> on<00:01:37.820> the<00:01:37.910> ground<00:01:38.180> all<00:01:39.170> the

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 
months of student on the ground all the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.840 
months of student on the ground all the
vehicles<00:01:39.800> were<00:01:39.920> moving<00:01:40.040> at<00:01:40.250> any<00:01:40.310> one<00:01:40.520> time<00:01:40.550> all

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
vehicles were moving at any one time all

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.040 
vehicles were moving at any one time all
the<00:01:40.940> flights<00:01:41.180> were<00:01:41.300> happening<00:01:41.540> every<00:01:42.020> day

the flights were happening every day

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.290 
the flights were happening every day
systemically<00:01:42.860> so<00:01:43.010> you<00:01:43.070> were<00:01:43.520> physically

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
systemically so you were physically

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.170 
systemically so you were physically
active<00:01:44.510> all<00:01:44.990> day<00:01:45.050> every<00:01:45.440> day<00:01:45.470> and<00:01:45.770> very<00:01:46.670> much

active all day every day and very much
the<00:01:47.300> acting<00:01:47.690> sort<00:01:47.900> of<00:01:48.020> was<00:01:48.650> probably<00:01:49.130> about<00:01:49.460> a

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
the acting sort of was probably about a

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.490 
the acting sort of was probably about a
third<00:01:49.880> of<00:01:50.180> the<00:01:50.330> shoot<00:01:50.570> the<00:01:50.840> rest<00:01:51.050> of<00:01:51.170> it<00:01:51.290> was

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
third of the shoot the rest of it was

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.410 
third of the shoot the rest of it was
driving<00:01:52.210> explosions

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
driving explosions

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.080 
driving explosions
physical<00:01:54.260> action<00:01:54.560> physical<00:01:54.770> life<00:01:55.130> so<00:01:55.790> all<00:01:55.970> of

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
physical action physical life so all of

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.610 
physical action physical life so all of
us<00:01:56.210> had<00:01:56.390> to<00:01:56.480> maintain<00:01:56.630> a<00:01:56.900> certain<00:01:57.200> level<00:01:57.350> of

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
us had to maintain a certain level of

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.590 
us had to maintain a certain level of
physical<00:01:58.550> fitness<00:01:58.670> but<00:01:58.880> then<00:01:59.210> also<00:01:59.390> the
