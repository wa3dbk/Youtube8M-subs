00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
3d mode looks really cool unfortunately

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.140 
3d mode looks really cool unfortunately
the<00:06:16.440> whole<00:06:16.590> world<00:06:16.889> does<00:06:17.130> not<00:06:17.250> have<00:06:17.490> this<00:06:17.669> 3d

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
the whole world does not have this 3d

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.089 
the whole world does not have this 3d
view<00:06:18.419> right<00:06:18.599> now<00:06:18.720> I<00:06:18.960> guess<00:06:19.349> Apple<00:06:19.560> will<00:06:19.860> try<00:06:20.039> to

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:20.099 
view right now I guess Apple will try to

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:22.219 
view right now I guess Apple will try to
implement<00:06:20.430> it<00:06:20.699> by<00:06:20.820> the<00:06:20.880> time<00:06:21.150> iOS<00:06:21.630> 6<00:06:21.870> comes<00:06:22.080> out

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:22.229 
implement it by the time iOS 6 comes out

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:23.839 
implement it by the time iOS 6 comes out
but<00:06:22.500> it<00:06:22.590> does<00:06:22.710> work<00:06:22.919> in<00:06:23.190> you<00:06:23.490> know<00:06:23.580> a<00:06:23.610> lot<00:06:23.820> of

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:23.849 
but it does work in you know a lot of

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:25.820 
but it does work in you know a lot of
places<00:06:24.030> in<00:06:24.330> California<00:06:24.510> there's<00:06:25.470> actually

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
places in California there's actually

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.950 
places in California there's actually
turn<00:06:26.070> by<00:06:26.220> turn<00:06:26.250> navigation<00:06:26.729> in<00:06:27.389> this<00:06:27.750> new

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
turn by turn navigation in this new

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.260 
turn by turn navigation in this new
Apple<00:06:28.410> maps<00:06:28.590> you<00:06:29.340> guys<00:06:29.520> can<00:06:29.789> see<00:06:29.940> this<00:06:30.120> right

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
Apple maps you guys can see this right

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.000 
Apple maps you guys can see this right
here<00:06:30.330> so<00:06:30.750> current<00:06:31.080> location<00:06:31.470> and<00:06:31.680> then<00:06:31.770> I<00:06:31.800> have

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.010 
here so current location and then I have

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.370 
here so current location and then I have
one<00:06:32.280> infinite<00:06:32.610> loop<00:06:32.639> and<00:06:33.000> by<00:06:33.449> war<00:06:33.720> to<00:06:33.930> use<00:06:34.229> this

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 
one infinite loop and by war to use this

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:35.420 
one infinite loop and by war to use this
route<00:06:34.620> it<00:06:34.919> would<00:06:35.010> actually<00:06:35.280> give<00:06:35.400> me

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:35.430 
route it would actually give me

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.610 
route it would actually give me
turn-by-turn<00:06:35.729> navigation<00:06:36.360> and<00:06:36.960> there's<00:06:37.469> also

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 
turn-by-turn navigation and there's also

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.680 
turn-by-turn navigation and there's also
a<00:06:37.740> view<00:06:38.039> called<00:06:38.250> flyover<00:06:39.000> and<00:06:39.210> it<00:06:39.390> allows<00:06:39.539> you

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:39.690 
a view called flyover and it allows you

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:40.970 
a view called flyover and it allows you
