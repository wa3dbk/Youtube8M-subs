00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.170
 2012 anja with many good but also 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.190
 less good games disappointment 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.809
 lie behind us 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.690
 it can even go bad because 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:16.910
 For that, the follow list is because they are 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.910
 the worst games of 2012 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.510
 the games 2012 in my opinion 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.250
 these games really have the bird 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:32.520
 shot down and they would have better that 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:34.079
 daylight does not look alive 5 that 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.910
 once celebrated with the apple is always coming 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.340
 more to a virtual playboy for 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.649
 Speci only pubescent steady 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.809
 homburger club even earlier 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.360
 Unfortunately there are no compresses 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.250
 glanzat in this genre and that in 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.739
 string together completely dull ones 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.239
 of cutscenes in story mode does me 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.160
 sorry but if you already have an action 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.010
 then drive with a fighting game 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.829
 once at persona 4 the face book or 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.969
 model comes after-hours prove so 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.970
 In any case, the medal of 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.060
 honor warfighter arguably senseless 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.770
 senseless of the fps in addition to call of duty 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.380
 This year, the applicant is in front 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.880
 this series was also big and has 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.670
 even better times seen in the 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.189
 apron was in this part of the series 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.390
 of a lot of realism 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.430
 but how do you do that? 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.049
 if you are a sniper mission to 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.330
 example only then enemies can shoot 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.549
 if they shoot themselves because of one 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.850
 They invulnerable when reloading 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.439
 are 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.369
 that really does not need a picture mario 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.990
 party 9 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.180
 Well, there was a funny talk 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.189
 from nintendo where everyone takes turns 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.740
 you could pull various over the board 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.509
 Mini coins plays this concept 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.850
 has been really very much since 1990 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.500
 For a long time the figures moved 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.030
 room like the sequence at a 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.759
 Partie human does not annoy you 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.560
 but in 2012, the person was annoyed 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.540
 Hereby someone at nintendo 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.250
 thought that you complete the 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.400
 gameplay that was actually perfect 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.210
 from the predecessor part 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.370
 would have to knock in the garbage and 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.530
 instead mario party carriage ride 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.060
 Generating is too monotonous 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.590
 entertaining and with little 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.070
 replay value compared to all 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:20.360
 Previous eight parts of resident evil 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.860
 Operation raccoon city I have to talk about it 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.750
 really say at the 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.090
 disappointments this year in resident 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.580
 evil area is here with distance 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.530
 the worst part we do this 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.030
 year to face we got 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.160
 just have great popcornkino 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.440
 the only shocker ever 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.790
 Haudrauf no, then he too feels 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.790
 dear resident evil 6 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.440
 game of thrones question and how to create 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.959
 it's one of the most successful series 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.940
 the last years the book to tv 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.910
 a good luck of adoption 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.650
 found the right way to mess up 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.510
 license title well yes there are also good 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.510
 License title if you for example too 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.700
 think back to spiderman 2 the movie the 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.620
 game 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.720
 but if you already made license 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.060
 One should know that capable people 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.070
 of it have of the matter in the hand 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.530
 to press 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:15.590
 Unfortunately, this game is not so easy 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.170
 an embarrassment and 1 of the relatively few 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.820
 rpgs I've ever played 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.830
 on the other hand, lord of the rings was in the war 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.090
 north that something like that 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.489
 Chewing gum, however, almost one 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.910
 open-world-game game of thrones das 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.430
 Unfortunately, the game has too much of the 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.940
 action clasped and would have much more 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:38.060
 can get out 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:40.070
 Disney's Epic Mickey 2 East Derby Rapid 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.620
 the subtitle of this seal should be 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.269
 let's remember micky epic vii viii was 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.160
 Although a good but not a perfect game 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.810
 nevertheless had numerous innovations 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.760
 by the possibility between good evil 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.920
 one can decide one 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.340
 a little bit like comic call of the dc 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.230
 universe 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.379
 Unfortunately, this concept was replaced by a 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.349
 brainless or the brainless 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:03.870
 most harmless sidekick from the computer 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.410
 controlled because it was in the second part 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.810
 expanded 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.580
 where you can only hope the haphazard 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.120
 I put a small second stones 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.950
 in the way 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.500
 Ultimately, this game is only then 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.410
 useful if you are friends with friends 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.449
 Unfortunately, no co-op mode can play 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:23.370
 online function that still has 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:26.100
 how can compensate skylanders jeans 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.350
 I said sorry I thought skyline is 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.000
 One steps into the footsteps of capcoms 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.540
 When it comes to the purse loose 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.100
 close 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.660
 the predecessor already showed that 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.120
 collective jump'n'run not a good idea 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.100
 We are making a bill of 60 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.780
 euro for the game 80 euros for the 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.970
 Starterset and then again around 5 to 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.650
 15 euro per figure of which we 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.360
 have to buy at least six to eight 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.030
 to enjoy the full enjoyment of the game 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.950
 brazen rip off Gallo pity since 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.690
 showed the only one with huge potential 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.780
 unfortunately not fully exhausted 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.699
 could be and is abundant to everything 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.840
 then also a jump'n'run at the 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.850
 you can not jump anymore 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:04.200
 that is soft like or without 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:06.330
 wireless layer call of duty black ops 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.490
 it's always the same thing 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.750
 same game the same setting almost 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.880
 no difference to the previous ones 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.639
 The goal is just a new logo on it 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.330
 and finished here counts already long mass 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:17.550
 instead of class 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.020
 pity actually because in advance was 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:23.789
 yet spoken of so much new 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.289
 kinect star wars yes yes we have 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:27.150
 but just had the question- how as you 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.169
 License title can be a mess here 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.880
 second example 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:31.320
 either it is the wrong company 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.090
 Too strong in the act guarantees 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.560
 as is the case with game of thrones 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.780
 was and you have little room to move 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.520
 or we know it all in one 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.810
 full body motion control ever 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.449
 not react anymore if you 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.370
 trying to strengthen the main menu 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:45.809
 That's where you come in at the end 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.029
 like a lazy marathon runner 

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:50.879
 before ever nor the production 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:51.889
 We do not need to start we 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:54.599
 neither 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:57.120
 we have the places ten to two 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:06:00.870
 Looked at by the worst players 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.430
 the complete measures 2012 here again 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.900
 a summary before we look around 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.770
 the worst game of this year 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.879
 To take care of 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:13.499

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:16.409

 kinect star wars marathon sweat glands 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:45.960
 et cetera blaschke who 

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:48.960
 we come to place one fable girlie 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:51.330
 fable the journey also called film that 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:54.120
 was once a brilliant rpg kingdoms of 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:56.490
 Amalur reckoning this year shown how 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.020
 could be fable if it is not bad 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:00.209
 would 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:02.129
 but unfortunately the glittering of 

00:07:00.209 --> 00:07:03.270
 fable in the past were available 

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:04.379
 Does he think we were needed 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:07.020
 on spongy control with ego 

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:09.509
 perspective and graphic of fable 1 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.979
 many are already coming back 

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:12.659
 other ranks have shown that it 

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:15.749
 mostly backfiring like for 

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:17.610
 Example samoa done it when you enter 

00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:20.270
 good reason no z by one 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:23.909
 boring story ego perspective 

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:25.589
 session controlling and several bugs the 

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:27.860
 actually in the beta phase would have 

00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:30.770
 have long since shut off replaced 

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:33.919
 the complete reinfall this year so 

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:35.780
 monotonous and boring that needs 

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:37.000
 no rpg and that still needs one 

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:39.160
 player 

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.660
 let me know what were yours 

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.010
 after the worst games of this 

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.170
 year no disappointment but the 

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:47.100
 real cucumbers no human 

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:47.100
 needed
