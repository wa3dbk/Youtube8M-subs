00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:07.189 
hey once again this is Robert with clean

hey once again this is Robert with clean
pool<00:00:07.520> and<00:00:07.700> spa<00:00:07.910> and<00:00:08.330> in<00:00:09.080> this<00:00:09.200> video<00:00:09.410> I'm<00:00:09.830> going

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950

pool and spa and in this video I'm going
to<00:00:10.010> talk<00:00:10.190> about<00:00:10.370> some<00:00:10.760> of<00:00:10.879> the<00:00:10.969> differences

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:11.780 
to talk about some of the differences

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.039 
to talk about some of the differences
between<00:00:12.010> liquid<00:00:13.010> chlorine<00:00:13.309> versus<00:00:14.049> granular

grocery-store bleach for a long time to
chlorinate<00:00:50.930> their<00:00:51.200> pools<00:00:51.410> and<00:00:51.680> they've<00:00:51.770> done

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
chlorinate their pools and they've done

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.440 
chlorinate their pools and they've done
done<00:00:52.340> so<00:00:52.550> very<00:00:53.000> successfully<00:00:54.370> in<00:00:55.370> terms<00:00:56.180> of

done so very successfully in terms of

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.889 
done so very successfully in terms of
drawbacks<00:00:57.380> of<00:00:57.710> sodium<00:00:58.100> hypochlorite<00:00:58.899> you

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
drawbacks of sodium hypochlorite you

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:01.660 
drawbacks of sodium hypochlorite you
have<00:01:00.050> to<00:01:00.140> consider<00:01:00.800> the<00:01:00.980> storage<00:01:01.340> and<00:01:01.550> the

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
have to consider the storage and the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.520 
have to consider the storage and the
weight<00:01:01.880> a<00:01:02.149> gallon<00:01:02.960> of<00:01:03.309> liquid<00:01:04.360> equal<00:01:05.360> is<00:01:06.200> about

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
weight a gallon of liquid equal is about

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.629 
weight a gallon of liquid equal is about
8<00:01:06.740> pounds<00:01:07.310> so<00:01:08.030> in<00:01:08.390> you<00:01:08.600> also<00:01:08.780> need<00:01:09.139> more<00:01:10.100> area

00:01:10.629 --> 00:01:10.639 
8 pounds so in you also need more area

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:15.699 
8 pounds so in you also need more area
to<00:01:11.600> store<00:01:12.109> your<00:01:12.530> gallon<00:01:13.369> jugs<00:01:13.670> now<00:01:14.479> let's<00:01:15.439> turn

00:01:15.699 --> 00:01:15.709 
to store your gallon jugs now let's turn

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:17.620 
to store your gallon jugs now let's turn
our<00:01:15.770> attention<00:01:15.920> to<00:01:16.369> calcium<00:01:16.969> hypochlorite

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
our attention to calcium hypochlorite

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.769 
our attention to calcium hypochlorite
calcium<00:01:19.240> hypochlorite<00:01:20.240> is<00:01:21.009> safe<00:01:22.009> easy

00:01:22.769 --> 00:01:22.779 
calcium hypochlorite is safe easy

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:26.800 
calcium hypochlorite is safe easy
convenient<00:01:25.029> relatively<00:01:26.029> affordable<00:01:26.329> and

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
convenient relatively affordable and

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.069 
convenient relatively affordable and
it's<00:01:27.289> easy<00:01:27.529> to<00:01:27.709> apply<00:01:27.950> it's<00:01:28.369> lighter<00:01:28.819> than<00:01:29.149> the

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
it's easy to apply it's lighter than the

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.969 
it's easy to apply it's lighter than the
liquid<00:01:30.289> one-pound<00:01:31.189> of<00:01:31.579> granular<00:01:32.380> equals<00:01:33.380> one

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
liquid one-pound of granular equals one

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.480 
liquid one-pound of granular equals one
gallon<00:01:34.639> of<00:01:34.849> the<00:01:35.779> liquid<00:01:36.200> so<00:01:36.380> you<00:01:36.499> have<00:01:36.679> one

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
gallon of the liquid so you have one

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.050 
gallon of the liquid so you have one
pound<00:01:37.789> versus<00:01:38.359> eight<00:01:38.569> pounds<00:01:39.229> and<00:01:39.609> on<00:01:40.609> my<00:01:40.819> pour

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
pound versus eight pounds and on my pour

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.669 
pound versus eight pounds and on my pour
out<00:01:41.299> I<00:01:41.959> used<00:01:42.770> both<00:01:43.429> but<00:01:44.270> for<00:01:44.779> the<00:01:44.869> most<00:01:45.170> part<00:01:45.319> I

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
out I used both but for the most part I

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:47.830 
out I used both but for the most part I
use<00:01:45.889> liquid<00:01:46.189> simply<00:01:46.880> because<00:01:47.359> and<00:01:47.719> this<00:01:47.779> is

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
use liquid simply because and this is

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.859 
use liquid simply because and this is
one<00:01:48.169> of<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:48.319> drawbacks<00:01:48.499> of<00:01:49.869> calcium

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
one of the drawbacks of calcium

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.989 
one of the drawbacks of calcium
hypochlorite<00:01:51.380> is<00:01:51.529> it<00:01:51.979> does<00:01:52.099> add<00:01:52.310> calcium<00:01:52.609> to

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:52.999 
hypochlorite is it does add calcium to

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:55.089 
hypochlorite is it does add calcium to
the<00:01:53.029> pool<00:01:53.389> so<00:01:53.929> if<00:01:54.200> you<00:01:54.319> do<00:01:54.529> live<00:01:54.740> in<00:01:54.770> a<00:01:54.919> place

00:01:55.089 --> 00:01:55.099 
the pool so if you do live in a place

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:57.489 
the pool so if you do live in a place
that<00:01:55.159> has<00:01:55.639> high<00:01:55.969> hard<00:01:56.359> harness<00:01:56.959> fill<00:01:57.200> water

00:01:57.489 --> 00:01:57.499 
that has high hard harness fill water

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:00.819 
that has high hard harness fill water
like<00:01:58.399> Southern<00:01:59.090> California<00:01:59.719> or<00:01:59.929> Arizona<00:02:00.109> I

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
like Southern California or Arizona I

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.129 
like Southern California or Arizona I
know<00:02:00.979> that<00:02:01.279> it<00:02:01.459> has<00:02:01.579> around<00:02:01.759> 250<00:02:02.509> 300<00:02:02.749> parts

00:02:03.129 --> 00:02:03.139 
know that it has around 250 300 parts

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:04.629 
know that it has around 250 300 parts
per<00:02:03.169> million<00:02:03.469> now<00:02:03.709> I<00:02:03.739> live<00:02:03.979> in<00:02:04.069> Florida<00:02:04.310> it's

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:04.639 
per million now I live in Florida it's

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:09.520 
per million now I live in Florida it's
330<00:02:05.739> I<00:02:06.939> suggest<00:02:07.939> you<00:02:08.060> use<00:02:08.119> liquid<00:02:08.869> chlorine

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
330 I suggest you use liquid chlorine

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.820 
330 I suggest you use liquid chlorine
not<00:02:10.099> granular<00:02:10.910> also<00:02:11.660> if<00:02:11.900> you<00:02:12.050> if<00:02:12.349> you're

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
not granular also if you if you're

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.060 
not granular also if you if you're
fighting<00:02:13.250> a<00:02:13.460> high<00:02:13.640> pH<00:02:14.000> problem<00:02:14.770> or<00:02:15.770> if<00:02:15.920> your

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
fighting a high pH problem or if your

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.170 
fighting a high pH problem or if your
fill<00:02:16.400> water

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
fill water

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.039 
fill water
PAHs<00:02:17.989> hi<00:02:18.290> you<00:02:19.250> may<00:02:19.549> want<00:02:19.879> to<00:02:19.939> use<00:02:20.239> liquid

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
PAHs hi you may want to use liquid

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.149 
PAHs hi you may want to use liquid
chlorine<00:02:21.349> because<00:02:22.420> chlorine<00:02:23.420> granulars

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
chlorine because chlorine granulars

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:28.809 
chlorine because chlorine granulars
chlorine<00:02:25.810> calcium<00:02:26.810> hypochlorite<00:02:27.819> granules

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
chlorine calcium hypochlorite granules

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:34.599 
chlorine calcium hypochlorite granules
chlorine<00:02:29.420> granules<00:02:30.609> has<00:02:31.609> a<00:02:31.640> pH<00:02:32.209> of<00:02:32.239> 12<00:02:33.069> so<00:02:34.069> if
