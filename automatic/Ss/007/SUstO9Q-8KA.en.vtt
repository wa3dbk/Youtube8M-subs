this press stage got push it onto the
surface<00:02:23.580> you're<00:02:23.790> going<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.120> put<00:02:24.240> it<00:02:24.330> on<00:02:24.450> and

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
surface you're going to put it on and

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.540 
surface you're going to put it on and
flick<00:02:25.590> this<00:02:25.710> down<00:02:25.950> then<00:02:26.190> you're<00:02:26.310> good<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.430> go

flick this down then you're good to go
it<00:02:27.420> doesn't<00:02:27.660> work<00:02:27.690> on<00:02:28.220> porous<00:02:29.220> surfaces<00:02:29.670> like

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
it doesn't work on porous surfaces like

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.100 
it doesn't work on porous surfaces like
this<00:02:30.090> it's<00:02:30.750> kind<00:02:30.930> of<00:02:31.020> like<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:32.870> smooth<00:02:33.870> but

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
this it's kind of like a smooth but

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.750 
this it's kind of like a smooth but
somehow<00:02:34.260> rough<00:02:34.620> surface<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.340> won't<00:02:35.520> stick

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
somehow rough surface and it won't stick

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.750 
somehow rough surface and it won't stick
to<00:02:35.820> that<00:02:36.030> it's<00:02:36.210> always<00:02:36.540> big<00:02:36.780> glass<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:37.760> clean

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
to that it's always big glass and clean

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.580 
to that it's always big glass and clean
metal<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.480> water<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:39.840> clean<00:02:40.050> glass<00:02:40.350> as<00:02:40.560> well

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
metal and water and clean glass as well

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.470 
metal and water and clean glass as well
but<00:02:40.950> um<00:02:41.130> yeah<00:02:42.060> so<00:02:43.280> that's<00:02:44.280> probably<00:02:44.520> it<00:02:44.760> as<00:02:45.420> I

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
but um yeah so that's probably it as I

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.270 
but um yeah so that's probably it as I
said<00:02:45.690> only<00:02:45.900> costs<00:02:46.140> about<00:02:46.200> 23<00:02:46.709> pounds<00:02:46.950> free

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
said only costs about 23 pounds free

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.970 
said only costs about 23 pounds free
postage<00:02:47.760> watching<00:02:48.420> my<00:02:48.480> camera<00:02:48.840> across<00:02:49.140> 60<00:02:49.709> so

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
postage watching my camera across 60 so

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.650 
postage watching my camera across 60 so
overall<00:02:50.340> this<00:02:50.430> cost<00:02:50.700> around<00:02:52.910> 83<00:02:53.910> pounds<00:02:54.180> about

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
overall this cost around 83 pounds about

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.040 
overall this cost around 83 pounds about
that<00:02:54.870> so<00:02:55.530> if<00:02:55.739> I<00:02:55.830> brought<00:02:56.070> GoPro<00:02:56.550> be<00:02:56.760> 230<00:02:57.300> so<00:02:57.780> I

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
that so if I brought GoPro be 230 so I

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.550 
that so if I brought GoPro be 230 so I
easily<00:02:58.800> think<00:02:59.070> it's<00:02:59.340> as<00:02:59.580> good<00:02:59.820> so<00:03:00.180> i<00:03:00.989> will

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
easily think it's as good so i will

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.650 
easily think it's as good so i will
switch<00:03:01.770> over<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.160> footage<00:03:02.489> and<00:03:03.239> fortunes

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
switch over to the footage and fortunes

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.870 
switch over to the footage and fortunes
not<00:03:03.870> two<00:03:04.170> grades<00:03:04.470> it<00:03:04.650> was<00:03:04.800> simply<00:03:05.250> just<00:03:05.459> a<00:03:05.580> test

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
not two grades it was simply just a test

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.979 
not two grades it was simply just a test
I<00:03:06.540> may<00:03:07.020> get<00:03:07.200> a<00:03:07.260> wide<00:03:07.470> angle<00:03:07.650> lens<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.160> my<00:03:08.280> camera

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
I may get a wide angle lens to my camera

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.720 
I may get a wide angle lens to my camera
eventually<00:03:09.989> but<00:03:10.230> have<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.560> see<00:03:10.739> so<00:03:11.010> pay<00:03:11.580> for
