firstly what you have to do you have to
go<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.559> air<00:00:46.950> server<00:00:47.550> now<00:00:48.360> once<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:49.079> go<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.260> a

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
go to air server now once you go to a

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.720 
go to air server now once you go to a
server<00:00:49.739> you'll<00:00:50.219> be<00:00:52.190> going<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.340> sign<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.550> with

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
server you'll be going to sign it with

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.810 
server you'll be going to sign it with
like<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:54.559> and<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.800> says<00:00:55.980> download<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.520> server

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
like this and it says download a server

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.790 
like this and it says download a server
so<00:00:57.120> you've<00:00:57.239> got<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.390> mac<00:00:57.629> version<00:00:57.660> or<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.350> pc

here and then what you have to do is you
go<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.400> you<00:02:45.180> can<00:02:45.390> now<00:02:45.780> this<00:02:45.959> is<00:02:46.110> we<00:02:46.230> all<00:02:46.350> like

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
go to you can now this is we all like

go to you can now this is we all like
control<00:02:47.190> panels<00:02:47.940> or<00:02:48.150> center<00:02:48.510> thing<00:02:48.690> so

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
control panels or center thing so

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.940 
control panels or center thing so
firstly<00:02:50.519> you<00:02:50.880> have<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:51.269> make<00:02:51.420> sure<00:02:51.450> you<00:02:51.690> on<00:02:51.810> the

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
firstly you have to make sure you on the

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.289 
firstly you have to make sure you on the
device<00:02:52.950> is<00:02:53.190> running<00:02:53.340> on<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.730> same<00:02:53.910> Wi-Fi

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
device is running on the same Wi-Fi

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.539 
device is running on the same Wi-Fi
network<00:02:55.069> oh<00:02:56.810> it<00:02:57.810> does<00:02:58.110> work<00:02:58.380> on<00:02:58.530> iOS<00:02:58.739> 7<00:02:59.190> as<00:02:59.400> I'm

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
network oh it does work on iOS 7 as I'm

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:04.400 
network oh it does work on iOS 7 as I'm
running<00:02:59.760> now<00:03:00.890> but<00:03:01.890> I<00:03:02.190> think<00:03:03.319> devices<00:03:04.319> that

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
running now but I think devices that

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.220 
running now but I think devices that
don't<00:03:04.560> have<00:03:04.799> air<00:03:05.069> play<00:03:05.459> it<00:03:05.760> won't<00:03:06.030> support<00:03:06.480> so

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
don't have air play it won't support so

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.620 
don't have air play it won't support so
you're<00:03:07.590> an<00:03:08.220> iOS<00:03:08.430> device<00:03:08.580> does<00:03:09.090> have<00:03:09.269> to<00:03:09.450> have

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
you're an iOS device does have to have

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.440 
you're an iOS device does have to have
airplay<00:03:10.110> so<00:03:10.410> I<00:03:10.650> think<00:03:11.459> most<00:03:11.760> of<00:03:11.819> them<00:03:11.940> do<00:03:12.150> but

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
airplay so I think most of them do but

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.210 
airplay so I think most of them do but
yeah<00:03:12.750> if<00:03:12.900> they<00:03:13.019> doesn't<00:03:13.230> lyneham<00:03:13.620> smite<00:03:14.010> this

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
yeah if they doesn't lyneham smite this

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.309 
yeah if they doesn't lyneham smite this
don't<00:03:14.580> think<00:03:14.760> this<00:03:14.819> will<00:03:15.000> work<00:03:15.110> so<00:03:16.110> once

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
don't think this will work so once

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.770 
don't think this will work so once
you're<00:03:16.530> in<00:03:16.650> here<00:03:17.390> literally<00:03:18.390> you<00:03:18.420> need<00:03:18.630> to

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
you're in here literally you need to

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.830 
you're in here literally you need to
just<00:03:18.840> go<00:03:19.109> to<00:03:19.170> you<00:03:19.829> can<00:03:20.010> just<00:03:20.220> set<00:03:20.459> your<00:03:20.840> stuff

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.380 
just go to you can just set your stuff

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
here but the display and then Miriam

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.860 
here but the display and then Miriam
amiran<00:03:24.930> you<00:03:25.410> can<00:03:25.620> change<00:03:25.950> you<00:03:26.310> can<00:03:26.519> change<00:03:26.549> the

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870

resolution to whatever you want and then

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:35.479 
resolution to whatever you want and then

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
if you've got slow network when it

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.360 
if you've got slow network when it

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
streams the device to the screen and

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.370 
streams the device to the screen and
then<00:03:38.489> the<00:03:38.700> new<00:03:39.180> just<00:03:39.359> got<00:03:39.510> advanced<00:03:39.810> for<00:03:40.170> other
