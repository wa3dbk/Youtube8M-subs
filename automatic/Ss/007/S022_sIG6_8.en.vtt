00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:21.119

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.800
 I'm still tired looking 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.420
 Police officers for hints which to 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.880
 cause of the missing heiress award 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.119
 Now she has a chance of you 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.800
 know how it ends hey where could 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.480
 We eat here 20 miles from her 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.480
 There is a steakhouse called Herr lanz 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:44.870
 how much is she gonna forget you 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.870

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.680
 torture a bit and we have the 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:58.050
 bank codes and the other shit where 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.050
 we are at the end of the world 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.580
 she has in the trunk of the car 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.580
 found 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.159
 the killer killed 14 students one 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:23.520
 student is still missing 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:29.220
 that's you right and that driver that 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.810
 Everything that has been done allows us to fall into the trap 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:37.399
 I have the best chance to escape 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:39.479
 if you all kill each other, who am I? 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.800
 serial killers limit themselves to one 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.250
 victim per day 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.250

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.870
