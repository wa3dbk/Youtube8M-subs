00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.699
 since we finished studying 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:05.629
 panels in fans the module ediles will 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:07.810
 appropriate to say now 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.660
 percent of sequence 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.249
 works in this panel 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:14.959
 In principle, this does not matter GDP 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:15.649
 what sequence 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:17.720
 you say so 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.630
 during the heat 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:20.960
 regulators 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.029
 simplicity depend only on them 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.060
 Appointment but there is no what you yourself 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.189
 put up 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.419
 before her what 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.009
 genoa this is important for 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.850
 accuracy of exposure 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.250
 since you look at the photo already 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.210
 modified by all previous 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.620
 Yes, and the regulations at the same time you can 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.400
 interfere or help to build correctly 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.490
 parameter 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.400
 which revealed are working now 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.390
 there is the most convenient 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.280
 sequence allowing 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.510
 optimize 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.010
 your workflow in general terms 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.510
 the concept of this sequence 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.890
 can be expressed like this 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.200
 first put up a ton 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.740
 not paying attention to color only decide 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.150
 after 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.770
 do new collections 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:10.840
 by advice 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.760
 tons it's all regulators in the area 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.610
 tons and the most important of these is the expo 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.420
 was x 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.240
 color is white balance 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.079
 Regulators in the area therefore can 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.049
 regard as additional 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:27.800
 to deal with them 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.420
 in the end 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.970
 This approach is due to the fact that 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.990
 new image balance 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.560
 affects everything else 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.730
 and without exposing it we can not correctly 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:40.560
 line up 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.830
 nothing 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.160
 If you go to the person that is she 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.430
 even the author's will, we can recommend 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.930
 following 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.770
 approximate order 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.970
 first marks are given bti no ie 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.270
 we use the regulator dallas 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.200
 I go up to 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.780
 an example of that miserable scenery 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.560
 who pp him 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.530
 the previous year 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.909
 new round of skates old 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.399
 and he is calm in this lesson we have time 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.709
 will show 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.749
 prime editing 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:16.370
 and the image 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.639
 shading first 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:21.689
 regulators good stm clicking on the map and 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:23.319
 I bring 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.060
 the regulator is ready to appear first 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.060
 clip first and released 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:32.769
 then expose the board 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.769
 regulators in the sport, too, by clicking on the act 

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:39.060
 I bring to the first clip irony 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.409
 letting go 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:43.680
 so now they need a thinner one 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.659
 tuning 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:46.709
 see here we have basic information 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.269
 concentrated in these photos percentage 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.300
 concentrated to boil ah 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.889
 especially now after 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:56.239
 correction 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.939
 and I told you in the past about how I said that Uyar 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.019
 brass knuckles things as dangerous 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.870
 but sometimes when applied 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.109
 must say in this photo 

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:12.479
 I really want to turn it down because I'm in 

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:15.519
 course that if I will and reduce 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.519
 then I will have compression in pfo 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:22.229
 there which is located at 30 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:23.519
 summer give dark 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.250
 will be atom compression 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.310
 I will lose the contras but I am the victim because 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.149
 what's on the photo 

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:32.429
 but because it is a very small area 

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:35.319
 photos have very few details 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.119
 in these places but I want to bring it to 

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:39.729
 normal zone 

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:42.089
 the main area of ​​the photo is because 

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:44.369
 I get it too white I want 

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:45.259
 to make 

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:47.359
 histogram more 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.479
 so harmoniously i 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:52.899
 here you control the brightness very much and 

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:54.199
 thereafter 

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.409
 again increases controversy because 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:57.599
 I slipped 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.899
 I personally already 

00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:01.879
 picture more 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:04.129
 like it but i can 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:05.559
 even mhz 

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:07.859
 clip to believe the expo and then 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.319
 restore 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:10.449
 centuries-old 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:13.339
 i.e. here too 

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:16.339
 light compression into the light ah 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.180
 and always at any 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.769
 she is editing 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.819
 photos almost always 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:26.469
 intel these compression and some details 

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:29.439
 losing and doing the opposite 

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:31.080
 more contrast 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.759
 they can be seen better come as 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:34.349
 would 

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:35.559
 to choose 

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:36.690
 but basically 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.990
 quite often we know how to save 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.419
 all diddy details but here it is 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:43.680
 photograph 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.180
 amounts it can be personal my taste but me 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.740
 here already wanted to reduce the brightness 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.509
 donating to clarify dark details 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:55.870
 and then I can now withdraw some of them 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.779
 all the same to the light 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:00.189
 regulators fil bark 

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:01.539
 that is, I 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:04.339
 make in principle even more compression but 

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:07.059
 I also moved this side 

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:09.129
 Sveta 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:11.330
 so some details of course I 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.979
 lost but also bombs with them cop in general 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.749
 the photo has become 

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:18.279
 better see what she was 

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:21.099
 how tired so but after i 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:23.749
 performed more than something new correction 

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:25.800
 because everything i did 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.729
 now it was work with a tone 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:31.409
 after that i do white balance but 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:33.139
 here he is in principle 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:34.939
 probably normal because you 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:37.939
 dear this i remember she was not a captive 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.490
 this time by such a shade because 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.949
 you will see that there will be 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:48.050
 tractor what are the goals in brown 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.490
 substance there 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:50.580
 moving 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.479
 so in principle here ntmk not knowing 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:55.909
 changed white balance or not but 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:58.689
 so instantly I didn't even need him 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:05:59.629
 change 

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:01.719
 what do we do after that 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:04.289
 light because when we 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:07.469
 change tons that tons affect 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:10.369
 Colour 

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:12.859
 better to post after we 

00:06:12.859 --> 00:06:14.939
 put the right tons 

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:17.669
 and after that we can already do 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:20.669
 to refugees that is to give some 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:23.020
 character but here I want of course 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.900
 3 thousand even increase 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.270
 cool speech 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.020
 it's good for landscapes 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.300
 increase and for 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.699
 portraits especially 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:34.699
 female special taking off well reduce 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:39.069
 and a little Yana Feliche in the regional 

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:42.039
 landscapes are usually no more than 40 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:44.759
 the city leaves its way because after 

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:46.729
 this value already looks 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:49.430
 not a natural landscape 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.119
 so here it was here it became 

00:06:52.119 --> 00:06:54.839
 the difference is i like it more 

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:58.119
 what did they become? 

00:06:58.119 --> 00:07:00.619
 so we finished studying the panel 

00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:01.409
 fan 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:04.499
 and the next lesson learning panel 

00:07:04.499 --> 00:07:06.219
 thin Islands 

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:08.559
 we will come back here lazaro 

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:10.180
 explanations 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.649
 because it was there in the hospital 

00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:14.449
 this is the basis of our processing 

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:15.939
 images and 

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:17.699
 the basis of our knowledge 

00:07:17.699 --> 00:07:20.289
 at the meeting fok on site light room 

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:22.680
 the rub point is all you 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.330
 good
