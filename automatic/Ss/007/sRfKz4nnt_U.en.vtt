 Hello everyone welcome back suffered Starsi 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.969
 today andro nizar and the look inspired by 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.880
 that of katy perry worn for i 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.529
 bering iris problems this look e 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.500
 also perfect for the evening of 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.210
 New Year 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.430
 I started realizing my base already 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.980
 I applied a moisturizer 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.900
 I later used this 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.210
 premium and transparent ideal for all 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.489
 skin types the planner serves a 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.530
 magnify the skin and increase the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.600
 foundation holding immediately after ho 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.370
 applied this illuminating foundation 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.290
 all over my face focusing on 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.670
 central part and shading towards 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.379
 the outside 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.660
 as for the glasses instead 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.710
 applied or simple tone corrector 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.110
 caught 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.489
 now I'll go and fix it 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.969
 with aci between opacifier to start 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.210
 apcom primer over the entire eyelid 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.850
 as you can see the product once 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:09.780
 absorbed becomes transparent hanging on 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.040
 produced also in the lower rhyme for 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.470
 recreate this look at its best 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.090
 I am going to make a base 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.729
 for my make-up with a pencil 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.250
 silvered I open the pencil on the whole 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.350
 mobile eyelid and I stop at the fold 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.340
 of mine 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.930
 then I smudge it with my fingers 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.020
 I apply the pencil also in the rhyme 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.050
 lower 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.760
 perfume also here with the fingers but from 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.180
 blend a gray eye shadow into the fold 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.800
 but don't worry about being precise 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.030
 because later we will go to 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:49.560
 anyway fade into the nuance and now 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:52.020
 blends everything katy perry wears this 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.490
 really sheen silver eyeshadow and then 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.460
 I'm going to apply it on the eyelid 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.550
 and under the lower line the number 60 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.900
 century in the internal rhyme I go to 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.640
 always apply a silver pencil with 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.990
 a wind number 59 of sephora 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.390
 I intensify the external angle in this 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.680
 look the part of the upper lashes e 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.720
 very intense 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.180
 therefore he wants to create a line of 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.710
 eyeliner and I'm going to extend this 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.480
 line also making a small one 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.590
 final hill makes small ones 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:29.480
 dashes and then I go to 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.480
 make a continuous line 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.930
 yet the island with a final for 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.390
 best recreate these cat eyes 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.459
 very strong use of false eyelashes 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.410
 and long when we buy new ones 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:49.360
 false eyelashes to give it a shape for go 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:53.269
 no mica we can apply immediately and 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.190
 pull them in such a way that they may have 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.349
 a natural curve to apply the 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.790
 using the end of the handle of 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:04.519
 a panel that like light movements 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:08.900
 I'm going to apply it all over China 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:12.349
 insisting on external angles mi 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.170
 I concentrate and then I say 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:17.170
 well the external corners to make more 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.250
 times lennon sicilia and to intensify it 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.180
 more we apply a black pencil 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.280
 in this upper inner rhyme katy 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.620
 perry abundant mascara on the lashes 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.200
 higher and lower ones then 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.569
 to apply the moving zig mascara 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.129
 zag asking the eyelid work well on the 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:36.920
 produced in such a way that my eyelashes 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:40.790
 natural limits the site well with 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.990
 those fake lico abundant mascara 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.510
 even on lower neighbors 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.190
 to conclude a few mica and give a 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.450
 bright touch I go to apply a 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.750
 shimmer eye shadow under the arch 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.040
 eyebrow 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.470
 with regards to lip make-up 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.630
 katy perry wears a red lipstick that 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.370
 therefore illuminates the smile a lot 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.250
 we are going to apply a long estate 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.530
 on the targeted the breast a small 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.930
 trick to prevent lipstick from rolling 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.390
 from on the teeth you take or a diskette of 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.100
 you put cotton or a tissue paper on it 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.160
 inside the lips and repeat 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.810
 the operation several times for this look 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.420
 katy perry uses a pink blush 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.580
 very emphasized I will realize it as 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.740
 but you wear it if you want 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.570
 realize it in a much more thermal way 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.350
 I apply my arm smiling with 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:30.180
 circular movements I apply lenses 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.110
 colored to complete the most of 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.930
 katy perry look 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.180
