price than what you would pay if you
went<00:00:47.579> through<00:00:48.300> them<00:00:48.480> directly<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:50.030> the<00:00:51.030> only

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
went through them directly so the only

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.270 
went through them directly so the only
drawback<00:00:51.840> with<00:00:52.079> this<00:00:52.289> is<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:53.010> will<00:00:53.160> only
