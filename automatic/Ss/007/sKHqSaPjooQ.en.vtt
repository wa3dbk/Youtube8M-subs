00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
yeah what if it's a Giants can arise and

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.630 
yeah what if it's a Giants can arise and
each<00:02:15.510> for<00:02:15.989> get<00:02:16.769> a<00:02:16.800> certain<00:02:17.069> amount<00:02:17.099> of<00:02:17.280> zombies

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
each for get a certain amount of zombies

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.430 
each for get a certain amount of zombies
until<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.060> reach<00:02:18.239> the<00:02:18.269> top<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.900> like<00:02:19.319> it

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
until you reach the top and like it

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.080 
until you reach the top and like it
would<00:02:19.560> probably<00:02:19.739> take<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:20.220> like<00:02:20.340> round<00:02:20.550> 50<00:02:20.940> to

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
would probably take to like round 50 to

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.630 
would probably take to like round 50 to
reach<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.510> exact<00:02:21.900> copy<00:02:22.230> linemen<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.769> they

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
reach the exact copy linemen and they

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.309 
reach the exact copy linemen and they
all<00:02:23.760> come<00:02:23.940> on<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.030> one<00:02:24.330> window<00:02:24.720> or<00:02:24.900> one<00:02:25.140> like

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
all come on a one window or one like

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.020 
all come on a one window or one like
elevators<00:02:25.920> like<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.250> elevator<00:02:26.550> keeps<00:02:26.700> coming

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
up bringing more zombies goes back down

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.589 
up bringing more zombies goes back down

picks up more zombies brings them up
honestly<00:02:31.379> I<00:02:31.470> think<00:02:31.560> that's<00:02:31.799> pretty<00:02:31.920> badass

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
honestly I think that's pretty badass

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.460 
honestly I think that's pretty badass
and<00:02:32.549> that<00:02:32.580> would<00:02:32.940> be<00:02:32.970> pretty<00:02:33.540> cool<00:02:33.660> map<00:02:34.319> to

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
and that would be pretty cool map to

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.440 
and that would be pretty cool map to
play<00:02:34.620> anything<00:02:35.310> new<00:02:35.730> would<00:02:35.880> be<00:02:36.000> Oscar<00:02:36.269> play

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
play anything new would be Oscar play
