step 3 is crucial this step is very

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.410 
step 3 is crucial this step is very
important<00:01:39.860> because<00:01:40.039> we<00:01:40.729> now<00:01:40.969> fully

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
important because we now fully

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.359 
important because we now fully
completely<00:01:42.020> infuse<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.950> character<00:01:43.310> new

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
completely infuse the character new

completely infuse the character new
collagen<00:01:43.880> into<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.719> hair<00:01:45.610> to<00:01:46.610> do<00:01:46.759> this<00:01:46.969> we<00:01:47.270> use

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
collagen into the hair to do this we use

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.660 
collagen into the hair to do this we use
a<00:01:47.479> smoothing<00:01:47.960> iron<00:01:48.289> that's<00:01:48.710> bringing<00:01:49.340> it<00:01:49.490> to<00:01:49.610> a

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
a smoothing iron that's bringing it to a

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.240 
a smoothing iron that's bringing it to a
specific<00:01:49.880> temperature<00:01:50.710> we<00:01:51.710> take<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:52.009> same

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
specific temperature we take the same

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.830 
specific temperature we take the same
thing<00:01:52.490> sections<00:01:52.970> that<00:01:53.179> we<00:01:53.329> gave<00:01:53.539> when<00:01:53.750> we

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
thing sections that we gave when we

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.050 
thing sections that we gave when we
apply<00:01:54.049> the<00:01:54.110> product<00:01:54.439> and<00:01:55.069> go<00:01:55.250> over<00:01:55.610> it<00:01:55.759> with<00:01:56.000> a

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
apply the product and go over it with a

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.029 
apply the product and go over it with a
smoothing<00:01:56.390> iron<00:01:56.689> until<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.590> hair<00:01:57.770> becomes

smoothing iron until the hair becomes

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.450 
smoothing iron until the hair becomes
shiny<00:01:58.340> silky<00:01:59.119> and<00:01:59.299> smooth<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:01.100> important

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
shiny silky and smooth the important

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.039 
shiny silky and smooth the important
thing<00:02:01.579> to<00:02:01.610> remember<00:02:01.729> here<00:02:02.119> is<00:02:02.509> that<00:02:02.659> this<00:02:02.899> is

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
thing to remember here is that this is

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.709 
thing to remember here is that this is
not<00:02:03.200> a<00:02:03.229> permanent<00:02:03.649> procedure<00:02:04.509> very<00:02:05.509> much<00:02:05.659> like

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
not a permanent procedure very much like
