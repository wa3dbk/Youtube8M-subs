guy is like a complete recluse he's been

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.550 
guy is like a complete recluse he's been
in<00:01:36.299> here<00:01:36.450> pretty<00:01:36.689> much<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.020> whole<00:01:37.170> time<00:01:37.200> I've

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
in here pretty much the whole time I've

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.990 
in here pretty much the whole time I've
had<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.860> tank<00:01:38.130> over<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:39.000> year<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:40.850> literally<00:01:41.850> I

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
had the tank over a year and literally I

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.770 
had the tank over a year and literally I
see<00:01:42.360> him<00:01:42.570> like<00:01:42.810> once<00:01:43.079> every<00:01:43.530> four<00:01:43.979> months<00:01:44.509> so<00:01:45.509> I

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
see him like once every four months so I

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.149 
see him like once every four months so I
figured<00:01:46.259> I'd<00:01:46.350> throw<00:01:46.380> them<00:01:46.680> into<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.920> video

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
figured I'd throw them into the video

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.630 
figured I'd throw them into the video
here<00:01:47.460> because<00:01:47.670> he's<00:01:48.030> actually<00:01:48.299> out<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.750> about

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
here because he's actually out and about

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.389 
here because he's actually out and about
and<00:01:50.689> the<00:01:51.689> reason<00:01:51.990> I'm<00:01:52.079> doing<00:01:52.110> 50%<00:01:52.619> obviously

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
and the reason I'm doing 50% obviously

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.859 
and the reason I'm doing 50% obviously
is<00:01:53.460> because<00:01:53.759> all<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.119> damn<00:01:54.360> green<00:01:54.630> hair

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869
