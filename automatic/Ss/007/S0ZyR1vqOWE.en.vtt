00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
first thing is get yourself piece of

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.390 
first thing is get yourself piece of
paracord<00:00:27.269> single<00:00:27.900> strand<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.590> couple<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.250> feet

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
paracord single strand a couple of feet

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.939 
paracord single strand a couple of feet
long<00:00:29.609> make<00:00:30.449> sure<00:00:30.599> you<00:00:30.720> have<00:00:30.869> plenty<00:00:31.050> always

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
long make sure you have plenty always

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.510 
long make sure you have plenty always
better<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.219> have<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.399> bit<00:00:32.520> more<00:00:32.579> than<00:00:33.000> enough<00:00:33.450> so

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
better to have a bit more than enough so

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
better to have a bit more than enough so
first<00:00:35.520> thing<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.730> don't<00:00:35.790> want<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.030> do<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.270> just

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
first thing you don't want to do is just

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.610 
first thing you don't want to do is just
make<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.719> loop<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.230> cord<00:00:37.940> towards<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.620> so

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
make a loop in the cord towards you so

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.490 
make a loop in the cord towards you so
you<00:00:40.710> have<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.040> car<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.820> right<00:00:42.230> in<00:00:43.230> front

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
you have the car to the right in front

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.010 
you have the car to the right in front
of<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.620> one<00:00:43.770> going<00:00:44.160> out<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.489> left

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
of the one going out to the left

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.020 
of the one going out to the left
so<00:00:46.020> pinch<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.559> there<00:00:46.800> at<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.309> cross<00:00:47.670> over

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
so pinch that there at the cross over

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.279 
so pinch that there at the cross over
make<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.899> loop<00:00:49.200> in<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.649> right<00:00:49.829> hand<00:00:50.039> piece<00:00:51.289> now

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
make a loop in the right hand piece now

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.799 
make a loop in the right hand piece now
you're<00:00:52.440> going<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.620> want<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.860> come<00:00:53.039> through

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
you're going to want to come through

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.840 
you're going to want to come through
through<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.960> first<00:00:55.170> loop<00:00:55.379> from<00:00:55.710> behind<00:00:56.010> with

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
through the first loop from behind with

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.029 
through the first loop from behind with
the<00:00:57.030> new<00:00:57.180> loop<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.539> created<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:58.770> have<00:00:58.920> it

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
the new loop you created so you have it

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.250 
the new loop you created so you have it
something<00:00:59.489> like<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.930> now<00:01:00.930> you're<00:01:01.079> going<00:01:01.199> to

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
something like that now you're going to

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.170 
something like that now you're going to
want<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.469> cinch<00:01:01.829> down<00:01:01.890> on<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.430> second<00:01:02.850> loop<00:01:02.940> so

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
want to cinch down on the second loop so

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.299 
want to cinch down on the second loop so
you<00:01:03.210> just<00:01:03.510> need<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.780> pull<00:01:04.019> out<00:01:04.229> try<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.189> hold

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
you just need to pull out try and hold

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.620 
you just need to pull out try and hold
it<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.700> way<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.850> am<00:01:06.030> here<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.360> you're<00:01:06.479> holding

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
it the way I am here so you're holding

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.560 
it the way I am here so you're holding
this<00:01:06.930> kind<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.500> bottom<00:01:07.740> loop<00:01:07.920> just<00:01:08.880> gently<00:01:09.180> and

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
this kind of bottom loop just gently and

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.109 
this kind of bottom loop just gently and
then<00:01:09.960> pull<00:01:10.260> out<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.439> left<00:01:10.799> end<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.729> cord

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
then pull out the left end of the cord

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.960 
then pull out the left end of the cord
and<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.110> should<00:01:13.619> cinch<00:01:13.920> down<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.180> have

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
and that should cinch down so you have

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.670 
and that should cinch down so you have
the<00:01:17.970> right<00:01:18.180> hand<00:01:18.330> loop<00:01:18.509> trapped<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.530> way

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
the right hand loop trapped in that way

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.070 
the right hand loop trapped in that way
there<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.060> this<00:01:21.060> part<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.570> cord<00:01:21.810> should<00:01:21.990> be

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
there so this part of the cord should be

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.600 
there so this part of the cord should be
kind<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.320> sitting<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.680> top<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.159> left<00:01:23.369> hand

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
kind of sitting on top of the left hand

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.520 
kind of sitting on top of the left hand
side<00:01:23.880> if<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.150> like<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.570> have<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.990> this

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
side if you like so you have that this

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.469 
side if you like so you have that this
piece<00:01:25.770> wrapping<00:01:26.159> through<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.970> piece<00:01:27.210> lying

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
piece wrapping through this piece lying

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.590 
piece wrapping through this piece lying
over<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.810> top<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.200> like<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:29.600> have

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
over the top of it like that you have

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.620 
over the top of it like that you have
that<00:01:30.780> shape<00:01:30.810> there<00:01:32.030> next<00:01:33.030> thing<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.240> want<00:01:33.600> to

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
that shape there next thing you want to

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.440 
that shape there next thing you want to
do<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:34.079> take<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.590> right<00:01:34.950> hand<00:01:35.070> piece<00:01:35.280> card<00:01:35.549> and

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
do is take the right hand piece card and

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.940 
do is take the right hand piece card and
go<00:01:36.630> down<00:01:37.020> through<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:37.770> loop<00:01:40.610> cameras<00:01:41.610> not

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
go down through this loop cameras not

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.830 
go down through this loop cameras not
wanting<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.009> focus<00:01:44.130> there<00:01:44.490> we<00:01:44.549> go<00:01:44.750> so<00:01:45.750> you're

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
wanting to focus there we go so you're

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.940 
wanting to focus there we go so you're
gonna<00:01:45.930> go<00:01:46.079> down<00:01:46.229> through<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.710> loop<00:01:46.890> there

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
gonna go down through that loop there

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.179 
gonna go down through that loop there
like<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.590> again<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.740> want<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.950> cinch

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
like that and again you want to cinch

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.130 
like that and again you want to cinch
down<00:01:50.280> on<00:01:50.640> this<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.630> do<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.780> you're<00:01:52.110> just

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
down on this so to do that you're just

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.780 
down on this so to do that you're just
gonna<00:01:52.350> pull<00:01:52.649> out<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.799> bottom<00:01:53.040> piece<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.610> this

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
gonna pull out the bottom piece of this

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.380 
gonna pull out the bottom piece of this
newest<00:01:54.420> loop<00:01:55.490> just<00:01:56.490> pull<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:56.790> down<00:01:56.969> again

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
newest loop just pull that down again

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.789 
newest loop just pull that down again
you're<00:01:57.630> going<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.869> be<00:01:57.930> too<00:01:58.079> tight<00:01:58.350> with<00:01:58.530> any<00:01:58.680> of

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
you're going to be too tight with any of

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.499 
you're going to be too tight with any of
these<00:01:58.920> it's<00:01:59.430> actually<00:01:59.759> beneficial<00:02:00.149> for<00:02:00.329> this

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
these it's actually beneficial for this

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.480 
these it's actually beneficial for this
not<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.750> be<00:02:00.930> keep<00:02:01.619> things<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.920> little<00:02:02.159> looser

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
not to be keep things a little looser

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.830 
not to be keep things a little looser
until<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.939> end<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.329> then<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.479> can<00:02:03.719> always

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
until the end and then you can always

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.749 
until the end and then you can always
tighten<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.320> up<00:02:04.409> later<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:05.399> makes<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.670> little

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
tighten it up later it makes a little

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.150 
tighten it up later it makes a little
easier<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.479> less<00:02:06.930> likely<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.350> twist<00:02:07.740> up<00:02:07.920> if

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
easier and less likely to twist up if

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.609 
easier and less likely to twist up if
you<00:02:08.369> keep<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.929> with<00:02:09.929> just<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.170> little<00:02:10.289> bit<00:02:10.470> loose

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
you keep it with just a little bit loose

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.150 
you keep it with just a little bit loose
as<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.069> go

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
as you go

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.570 
as you go
so<00:02:12.760> that<00:02:12.910> should<00:02:13.120> be<00:02:13.150> what<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:13.510> have<00:02:13.690> now<00:02:14.580> you

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
so that should be what you have now you

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.270 
so that should be what you have now you
have<00:02:15.700> this<00:02:15.880> right-hand<00:02:16.480> loop<00:02:16.720> here<00:02:17.020> and<00:02:17.980> all

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
have this right-hand loop here and all

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.040 
have this right-hand loop here and all
we're<00:02:18.460> going<00:02:18.580> to<00:02:18.640> do<00:02:18.700> now<00:02:19.240> to<00:02:19.450> finish<00:02:19.660> off<00:02:19.870> the

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
we're going to do now to finish off the

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.080 
we're going to do now to finish off the
knot<00:02:20.080> is<00:02:20.440> twist<00:02:21.280> this<00:02:21.520> right<00:02:21.730> hand<00:02:21.910> loops

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
knot is twist this right hand loops

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.090 
knot is twist this right hand loops
you're<00:02:22.210> going<00:02:22.330> to<00:02:22.390> twist<00:02:22.510> it<00:02:22.720> towards<00:02:22.960> you<00:02:23.470> so

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
you're going to twist it towards you so

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.860 
you're going to twist it towards you so
top<00:02:24.400> is<00:02:24.580> coming<00:02:25.000> towards<00:02:25.360> you<00:02:25.450> over<00:02:25.780> the

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
top is coming towards you over the

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.840 
top is coming towards you over the
bottom<00:02:26.110> piece<00:02:27.000> like<00:02:28.000> so<00:02:29.340> I've<00:02:30.340> twisted<00:02:30.550> that

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
bottom piece like so I've twisted that

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.900 
bottom piece like so I've twisted that
down<00:02:31.120> there<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:33.100> you're<00:02:33.280> going<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:33.460> take<00:02:33.580> this

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
down there and you're going to take this

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.180 
down there and you're going to take this
which<00:02:34.450> is<00:02:34.600> your<00:02:34.810> your<00:02:35.170> right<00:02:35.410> hand<00:02:35.710> piece<00:02:36.040> of

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
which is your your right hand piece of

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.460 
which is your your right hand piece of
car<00:02:36.430> so<00:02:36.730> if<00:02:36.790> we<00:02:36.910> undo<00:02:37.150> that<00:02:37.270> twist<00:02:37.570> again<00:02:37.810> you

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
car so if we undo that twist again you

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.780 
car so if we undo that twist again you
have<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.650> piece<00:02:38.830> coming<00:02:39.130> through<00:02:39.370> from<00:02:39.580> the

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
have the piece coming through from the

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.410 
have the piece coming through from the
right<00:02:40.470> so<00:02:41.470> twist<00:02:41.740> your<00:02:41.890> loop<00:02:42.070> I'm<00:02:43.060> gonna<00:02:43.240> take

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
right so twist your loop I'm gonna take

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.180 
right so twist your loop I'm gonna take
that<00:02:43.630> piece<00:02:43.960> and<00:02:44.230> come<00:02:44.830> up<00:02:44.950> through<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.640> loop

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
that piece and come up through the loop

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.510 
that piece and come up through the loop
alright<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:49.650> you're<00:02:50.650> just<00:02:50.890> gonna<00:02:51.070> pull<00:02:51.370> that

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
alright and you're just gonna pull that

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.540 
alright and you're just gonna pull that
through<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:53.440> again<00:02:53.680> you<00:02:53.920> want<00:02:54.100> to<00:02:54.130> cinch<00:02:54.370> this

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
through and again you want to cinch this

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.310 
through and again you want to cinch this
down<00:02:54.610> so<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.120> way<00:02:55.210> to<00:02:55.240> do<00:02:55.450> that<00:02:55.600> is<00:02:55.810> to<00:02:55.930> pull<00:02:56.140> on

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
down so the way to do that is to pull on

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.750 
down so the way to do that is to pull on
this<00:02:56.530> piece<00:02:56.800> here<00:02:57.130> that's<00:02:57.280> coming<00:02:57.610> through

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
this piece here that's coming through

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.620 
this piece here that's coming through
the<00:02:57.910> knot<00:02:58.120> so<00:02:59.110> just<00:02:59.350> pull<00:02:59.620> on<00:02:59.650> that<00:03:00.630> feed

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
the knot so just pull on that feed

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.210 
the knot so just pull on that feed
through<00:03:01.870> this<00:03:02.020> right<00:03:02.290> hand<00:03:02.500> piece<00:03:02.740> as<00:03:02.920> you<00:03:03.040> go

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
through this right hand piece as you go

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.850 
through this right hand piece as you go
just<00:03:03.550> keep<00:03:04.000> pulling<00:03:04.270> it<00:03:04.450> through<00:03:04.860> you're

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
just keep pulling it through you're

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.800 
just keep pulling it through you're
pulling<00:03:06.100> it<00:03:06.190> through<00:03:08.250> eventually<00:03:09.810> things

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
pulling it through eventually things

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.730 
pulling it through eventually things
should<00:03:11.020> start<00:03:11.320> to<00:03:11.470> cinch<00:03:11.680> up<00:03:13.440> and<00:03:14.440> you<00:03:14.560> should

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
should start to cinch up and you should

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.460 
should start to cinch up and you should
start<00:03:15.010> see<00:03:15.430> your<00:03:16.270> eternity<00:03:16.660> knot<00:03:16.870> which<00:03:17.230> looks

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
start see your eternity knot which looks

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.590 
start see your eternity knot which looks
like<00:03:17.560> that<00:03:17.860> so<00:03:18.820> you<00:03:18.910> get<00:03:19.030> some<00:03:19.180> better<00:03:19.330> light

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
like that so you get some better light

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.710 
like that so you get some better light
on<00:03:19.840> it<00:03:19.960> here<00:03:20.230> just<00:03:20.530> a<00:03:20.680> second<00:03:24.360> so<00:03:25.360> you'll<00:03:25.540> see

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
on it here just a second so you'll see

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.210 
on it here just a second so you'll see
if<00:03:25.960> you've<00:03:26.140> done<00:03:26.290> it<00:03:26.410> correctly<00:03:26.440> you'll<00:03:27.010> see

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
if you've done it correctly you'll see

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.060 
if you've done it correctly you'll see
you<00:03:27.340> have<00:03:27.520> these<00:03:28.320> these<00:03:29.320> middle<00:03:29.710> strands

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
you have these these middle strands

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.360 
you have these these middle strands
going<00:03:30.400> side<00:03:30.610> by<00:03:30.640> side<00:03:31.620> two<00:03:32.620> loops<00:03:32.920> top<00:03:33.190> and

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
going side by side two loops top and

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.310 
going side by side two loops top and
bottom<00:03:33.700> and<00:03:34.180> on<00:03:34.330> the<00:03:34.480> right<00:03:34.660> hand<00:03:34.810> side<00:03:35.080> you'll

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
bottom and on the right hand side you'll

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.250 
bottom and on the right hand side you'll
have<00:03:35.350> a<00:03:35.740> piece<00:03:36.580> going<00:03:36.760> under<00:03:37.150> your<00:03:37.330> cord<00:03:37.660> the

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
have a piece going under your cord the

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.960 
have a piece going under your cord the
left<00:03:38.500> hand<00:03:38.740> side<00:03:39.010> piece<00:03:39.250> going<00:03:39.490> over<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:39.910> of

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
left hand side piece going over and of

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.700 
left hand side piece going over and of
course<00:03:40.210> you<00:03:40.360> flip<00:03:40.810> not<00:03:41.140> over<00:03:41.410> you<00:03:41.500> have<00:03:41.620> the

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:41.710 
course you flip not over you have the

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.460 
course you flip not over you have the
reverse<00:03:42.040> of<00:03:42.220> that<00:03:42.280> so<00:03:42.670> nice<00:03:43.540> I<00:03:44.880> guess<00:03:45.880> it's
