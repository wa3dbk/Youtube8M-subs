this<00:00:16.010> soil<00:00:16.250> has<00:00:16.580> a<00:00:16.640> lot<00:00:17.120> of<00:00:17.150> clay<00:00:17.570> and<00:00:18.280> it's

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:19.280 
this soil has a lot of clay and it's

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.880 
this soil has a lot of clay and it's
caked<00:00:19.550> together<00:00:20.439> and<00:00:21.439> what<00:00:21.619> we're<00:00:21.710> going<00:00:21.740> to

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
caked together and what we're going to

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.580 
caked together and what we're going to
do<00:00:22.070> when<00:00:22.279> we<00:00:22.310> put<00:00:22.640> the<00:00:23.200> fermented<00:00:24.200> Bokashi

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
do when we put the fermented Bokashi

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.200 
do when we put the fermented Bokashi
product<00:00:25.220> in<00:00:25.400> here<00:00:26.080> is<00:00:27.640> greatly<00:00:28.640> increase<00:00:29.180> the

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
product in here is greatly increase the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.110 
product in here is greatly increase the
nutrient<00:00:29.840> content

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:31.120 
nutrient content

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.820 
nutrient content
but<00:00:31.540> we're<00:00:31.690> also<00:00:31.810> going<00:00:32.200> to<00:00:32.320> add<00:00:32.470> a<00:00:32.500> lot<00:00:32.710> of

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:32.830 
but we're also going to add a lot of

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:46.880 
but we're also going to add a lot of
humans<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:34.390> make<00:00:34.600> this<00:00:34.750> oil<00:00:35.170> less<00:00:40.560> hold<00:00:41.560> on

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.050 

you<00:00:47.890> gotta<00:00:48.040> be<00:00:48.160> mindful<00:00:48.489> you<00:00:48.640> got<00:00:48.790> jets

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:49.060 
you gotta be mindful you got jets

00:00:49.060 --> 00:01:36.380 
you gotta be mindful you got jets
overhead<00:00:49.510> all<00:00:49.660> the<00:00:49.750> time

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.099 

so<00:01:37.390> we've<00:01:37.539> just<00:01:37.569> picked<00:01:37.899> an<00:01:38.109> area<00:01:38.259> here<00:01:38.859> and

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:40.109 
so we've just picked an area here and

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:43.930 
so we've just picked an area here and
yoga<00:01:41.109> ground

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.850 

and<00:01:44.450> when<00:01:44.660> we<00:01:44.750> look<00:01:44.870> at<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.080> soil<00:01:45.380> as<00:01:45.530> we<00:01:45.680> turn

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
and when we look at the soil as we turn

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.660 
and when we look at the soil as we turn
it<00:01:45.980> up<00:01:46.510> it's<00:01:47.510> very<00:01:47.720> compact<00:01:48.290> it<00:01:48.590> has<00:01:49.370> a<00:01:49.400> lot<00:01:49.640> of

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
it up it's very compact it has a lot of

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.990 
it up it's very compact it has a lot of
clay<00:01:50.800> it<00:01:53.920> obviously<00:01:54.920> has<00:01:55.280> some<00:01:55.490> earthworms

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
clay it obviously has some earthworms

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.490 
clay it obviously has some earthworms
and<00:01:56.150> it<00:01:56.300> is<00:01:56.420> probably<00:01:56.780> pretty<00:01:56.930> good<00:01:57.200> soil

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
and it is probably pretty good soil

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.300 
and it is probably pretty good soil
we're<00:01:58.340> going<00:01:58.460> to<00:01:58.520> make<00:01:58.610> it<00:01:58.760> a<00:01:58.850> lot<00:01:59.000> better

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
we're going to make it a lot better

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.270 
we're going to make it a lot better
after<00:02:01.310> we<00:02:01.370> get<00:02:01.550> done<00:02:01.610> adding<00:02:02.120> the<00:02:02.210> Bokashi

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
after we get done adding the Bokashi

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.980 
after we get done adding the Bokashi
fermented<00:02:04.280> product<00:02:05.410> about<00:02:06.410> a<00:02:06.440> week<00:02:07.990> nutrients

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
fermented product about a week nutrients

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.070 
fermented product about a week nutrients
in<00:02:09.200> here<00:02:09.470> is<00:02:09.560> going<00:02:09.710> to<00:02:09.770> go<00:02:09.890> up<00:02:09.920> dramatically

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
in here is going to go up dramatically

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.300 
in here is going to go up dramatically
and<00:02:12.080> quality<00:02:12.560> this<00:02:12.680> toya<00:02:12.890> will<00:02:13.040> be<00:02:13.130> better

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
and quality this toya will be better

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.550 
and quality this toya will be better
won't<00:02:13.580> be<00:02:13.840> won't<00:02:14.840> be<00:02:15.020> all<00:02:15.110> stuck<00:02:15.380> together

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
won't be won't be all stuck together

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.400 
won't be won't be all stuck together
like<00:02:15.830> this<00:02:16.160> batted<00:02:16.730> down<00:02:17.080> so<00:02:18.080> we're<00:02:18.200> going<00:02:18.320> to

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
like this batted down so we're going to

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.400 
like this batted down so we're going to
take<00:02:18.530> a<00:02:18.590> hole<00:02:18.830> here<00:02:19.010> that's<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.400> foot<00:02:19.640> deep

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
take a hole here that's a foot deep

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.770 
take a hole here that's a foot deep
three<00:02:21.410> feet<00:02:21.620> long<00:02:23.620> then<00:02:24.620> put<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:25.780> fermented

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
three feet long then put the fermented

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.410 
three feet long then put the fermented
product<00:02:27.140> right<00:02:27.260> at<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.470> base<00:02:28.030> for<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.090> mix<00:02:29.330> it

let<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.210> microbes<00:02:32.540> get<00:02:32.780> a<00:02:32.810> head<00:02:33.020> start

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
let the microbes get a head start
