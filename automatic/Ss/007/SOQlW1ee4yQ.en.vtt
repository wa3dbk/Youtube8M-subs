another Canadian like board games so

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.520 
another Canadian like board games so
this<00:04:37.120> is<00:04:37.270> not<00:04:37.449> something<00:04:37.780> readily<00:04:38.319> available

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
this is not something readily available

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.790 
this is not something readily available
on<00:04:38.860> like<00:04:39.639> US<00:04:39.970> market<00:04:40.330> shelves<00:04:40.539> it<00:04:41.440> goes<00:04:41.590> like

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
on like US market shelves it goes like

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.370 
on like US market shelves it goes like

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
fun it is ages five to 99 so probably a

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.640
