00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
the counter colors because they tend to

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.470 
the counter colors because they tend to
dry<00:00:37.769> out<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.039> hair<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.550> over<00:00:38.940> process<00:00:39.329> the

to get a relaxer you can definitely get

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.500 
to get a relaxer you can definitely get
some<00:00:52.289> color<00:00:52.500> because<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.370> relaxer<00:00:53.850> does<00:00:54.149> um

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
some color because the relaxer does um

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.229 
some color because the relaxer does um
it<00:00:54.929> actually<00:00:55.530> takes<00:00:56.280> away<00:00:56.489> much<00:00:56.789> more<00:00:57.089> than

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
it actually takes away much more than

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.040 
it actually takes away much more than
what<00:00:57.359> color<00:00:57.690> does<00:00:57.960> but<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:59.239> color<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.539> relaxer

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050
