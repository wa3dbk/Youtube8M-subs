once again we're back at messages and
there<00:00:10.530> are<00:00:10.650> some<00:00:10.769> interesting<00:00:10.950> things<00:00:11.429> here

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
there are some interesting things here

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.789 
there are some interesting things here
that<00:00:11.759> I<00:00:11.910> want<00:00:12.120> you<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.300> look<00:00:12.420> at<00:00:12.599> first<00:00:13.080> is<00:00:13.349> that

that I want you to look at first is that

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.680 
that I want you to look at first is that
you've<00:00:14.099> got<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.250> system<00:00:14.700> message<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.420> these

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
you've got a system message and these

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.570 
you've got a system message and these
will<00:00:15.929> periodically<00:00:16.440> come<00:00:16.890> out<00:00:17.010> from<00:00:17.190> time<00:00:17.430> to

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
will periodically come out from time to

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.120 
will periodically come out from time to
time<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:18.150> they<00:00:18.240> will<00:00:18.420> tell<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:19.130> different

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
time and they will tell you different

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.400 
time and they will tell you different
things<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.369> pay<00:00:20.550> attention<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:21.060> here<00:00:21.810> we

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
things to pay attention to here we

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.870 
things to pay attention to here we
actually<00:00:22.560> fix<00:00:22.980> some<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.250> achievements

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
actually fix some of the achievements

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.939 
actually fix some of the achievements
and<00:00:24.150> now<00:00:24.449> this<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.900> where<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.529> system<00:00:25.740> is

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
and now this is where the system is

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.349 
and now this is where the system is
telling<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.910> times<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.300> will

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
telling you that of the times it will

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.320 
telling you that of the times it will
tell<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.660> scenarios<00:00:28.400> that<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.580> can<00:00:29.730> play<00:00:29.970> and

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
tell you scenarios that you can play and

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.200 
tell you scenarios that you can play and
things<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.080> are<00:00:31.320> also<00:00:31.560> new<00:00:31.890> features<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
things that are also new features the

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.000 
things that are also new features the
other<00:00:33.360> thing<00:00:33.510> that's<00:00:33.540> interesting<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:34.380> look

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
other thing that's interesting is look

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.340 
other thing that's interesting is look
at<00:00:35.190> right<00:00:35.520> oh<00:00:35.550> he<00:00:36.180> attacked<00:00:36.570> me<00:00:36.809> with<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.050> ram

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
at right oh he attacked me with a ram

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.000 
at right oh he attacked me with a ram
jam<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.070> his<00:00:38.700> color<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.989> green<00:00:40.320> now<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:40.860> is

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
jam and his color is green now this is

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.619 
jam and his color is green now this is
important<00:00:41.520> because<00:00:41.579> what<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.000> means<00:00:42.300> is

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
important because what this means is

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.310 
important because what this means is
that<00:00:43.079> i<00:00:43.730> can<00:00:44.730> actually<00:00:44.969> counterattack<00:00:45.840> in<00:00:45.870> and

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
that i can actually counterattack in and

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.690 
that i can actually counterattack in and
i<00:00:46.440> don't<00:00:46.620> know<00:00:46.739> if<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:46.950> remember<00:00:47.070> back<00:00:47.460> from

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
i don't know if you remember back from

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.970 
i don't know if you remember back from
your<00:00:47.850> basic<00:00:48.030> training<00:00:48.600> but<00:00:49.170> when<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.469> attack

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
your basic training but when you attack

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.520 
your basic training but when you attack
somebody<00:00:50.010> they<00:00:50.550> have<00:00:50.670> 30<00:00:51.030> minutes<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.750> respond

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
somebody they have 30 minutes to respond

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.500 
somebody they have 30 minutes to respond
meaning<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.039> can't<00:00:53.309> attack<00:00:53.430> them<00:00:53.640> again<00:00:54.120> and

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
meaning you can't attack them again and

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.439 
meaning you can't attack them again and
they<00:00:54.570> have<00:00:54.809> 30<00:00:55.050> minutes<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.410> respond<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.449> the

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
they have 30 minutes to respond so the

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.819 
they have 30 minutes to respond so the
reason<00:00:57.629> why<00:00:57.780> counter-attack<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.649> awesome

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
reason why counter-attack is so awesome

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.889 
reason why counter-attack is so awesome
is<00:00:59.219> because<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.670> does<00:00:59.820> fifty<00:01:00.270> percent<00:01:00.600> more

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
is because it does fifty percent more

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.450 
is because it does fifty percent more
damage<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.590> there's<00:01:01.739> actually<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.129> lot<00:01:02.280> of

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
damage so there's actually a lot of

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.789 
damage so there's actually a lot of
strategy<00:01:02.910> behind<00:01:03.120> when<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.080> counter-attack

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
strategy behind when you counter-attack

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.820 
strategy behind when you counter-attack
and<00:01:05.129> when<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.489> regular<00:01:05.939> attack

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
and when you regular attack

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.560 
and when you regular attack
counter-attacks<00:01:07.830> make<00:01:08.010> less<00:01:08.280> money<00:01:08.570> because

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
counter-attacks make less money because

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.080 
counter-attacks make less money because
just<00:01:09.960> as<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:11.040> can<00:01:11.189> probably<00:01:11.400> guess<00:01:11.610> you're

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
just as you can probably guess you're

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.910 
just as you can probably guess you're
hard<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.540> put<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.720> hit<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:12.900> somebody<00:01:13.049> that's

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
hard to put a hit on somebody that's

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.920 
hard to put a hit on somebody that's
when<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.250> get<00:01:14.400> paid<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.820> do<00:01:14.970> an<00:01:15.090> attack<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.780> a

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
when you get paid to do an attack and a

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.140 
when you get paid to do an attack and a
kill<00:01:16.170> but<00:01:16.920> if<00:01:17.040> someone<00:01:17.250> attacks<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:17.880> you

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
kill but if someone attacks you and you

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.570 
kill but if someone attacks you and you
are<00:01:18.180> retaliating<00:01:19.189> you're<00:01:20.189> only<00:01:20.310> going<00:01:20.490> to

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
are retaliating you're only going to

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.560 
are retaliating you're only going to
make<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.700> little<00:01:20.909> bit<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.150> money<00:01:21.180> on<00:01:21.450> that

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
make a little bit of money on that

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.760 
make a little bit of money on that
because<00:01:21.810> you're<00:01:21.900> not<00:01:21.990> actually<00:01:22.170> being<00:01:22.500> hired

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
because you're not actually being hired

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.800 
because you're not actually being hired
on<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.070> you're<00:01:23.250> just<00:01:23.369> going<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.970> get<00:01:24.750> a

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
on that you're just going to get a

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.830 
on that you're just going to get a
little<00:01:24.990> bit<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.439> payoff<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:26.689> let's<00:01:27.689> go<00:01:27.810> ahead

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
little bit of a payoff so let's go ahead

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.109 
little bit of a payoff so let's go ahead
and<00:01:27.990> counter-attack<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:28.920> now<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.490> see<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:29.970> he

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
and counter-attack in now I see that he

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.010 
and counter-attack in now I see that he
has<00:01:30.409> 1500<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:32.299> health<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.600> I'm<00:01:33.689> going<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.869> go

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
has 1500 in health so I'm going to go

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.289 
has 1500 in health so I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.350> pick<00:01:34.530> something<00:01:35.119> around<00:01:36.119> the

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
ahead and pick something around the

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.870 
ahead and pick something around the
thousand<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.810> remember<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.350> our<00:01:37.880> fundamental

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
thousand and remember in our fundamental

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.780 
thousand and remember in our fundamental
training<00:01:39.329> we<00:01:40.110> actually<00:01:40.860> bought<00:01:41.189> some<00:01:41.490> peanut

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
training we actually bought some peanut

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.520 
training we actually bought some peanut
butter<00:01:41.909> or<00:01:42.299> made<00:01:42.570> some<00:01:42.750> custom<00:01:43.110> peanut<00:01:43.380> butter

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530
