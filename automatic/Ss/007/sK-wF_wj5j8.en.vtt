00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.210
 people and he said that so we 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.130
 unknown that I did not even know him 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.860
 a lot of people were saying same time and 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.660
 that can not be a rule and then it's over 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.880
 facebook does not even exist anymore, I do not 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.650

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.600

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.330

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.450

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.970

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.049
 I inspired myself and even today 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.090
 in several I like the series that 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.010
 began to follow too much to work out 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.160
 It was not even convenient for those who are very happy. 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.930
 that much is so even thrilled 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.359

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.640
 It's much more in front of you, I found 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.140
 incredible and shows that these two beasts 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.440
 there is no competition that everyone is 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.000

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.040

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.570
 so when you asked Lauro 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:23.359

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:26.660
 Give up kiss me a kiss 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:28.640
 Beautiful, when she starts to enter. 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.010
 not because I was loving it. 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.810
 and inspire in part the girls and 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.540
 wanting to show what I knew to 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.280
 you, but the base in the middle of a 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.410
 here started joining school with 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.420
 other responsibilities we will 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.750
 want if he's going to have other little things 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.510
 To be responsible then I started to 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.549
 think about quitting but it was only once or 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.859
 another went my family my boyfriend 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.959
 also stayed with me, spoke in the UN 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:56.450
 where there was a stage in a moment 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.889
 passes and passed and I'm lively here and 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.609
 wanting to record a lot more people to 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:00.440
 you 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:01.640
 Camila Godoy asked 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.830
 Do you want to live in São Paulo? 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.480
 Are you planning to send me the money? 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.660
 let the success 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.730
 A kiss, I still want to die. 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.610
 Mother, I'm from Sao Paulo because I think 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.280
 center of everything is a sector dior there are people 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.010
 good that they are more famous maybe 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.470
 and that's where everything developed we have 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.330
 events they have the main things 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.400
 that women also participate in the 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.200
 will and the girl from em são paulo and from 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.640
 live there maybe I just think that 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.010
 for now it will not be possible because 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.530
 My parents do not get the idea and if 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.790
 Would you rather stay here on the river and me? 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.640
 I want to do college of publicity 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:41.720
 and advertising or veterinary I have not yet 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:44.150
 I know who sent kiss kiss salina and 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.010
 drawn by the question to giovani na 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.440
 gil sea border asked what you 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.850
 prefers to follow world fashion what she 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.730
 just for fashion do not care about 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:56.690
 opinion of others I see a beautiful kiss 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:59.330
 so I do not follow fashion was never that 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.970
 person who finds list following fashion 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.340
 correct of favelas trend is clear 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.350
 thus having a tendency to raynaud or 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.620
 have a tendency that is in the moment 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.330
 even a strong color of something like that 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.510
 I use it just because it 's in the 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.919
 shops that had this 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.900
 kind of thing like that is the kind of thing 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:20.960
 when I like it too when I accept 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.870
 the tendency because I do not use something that 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.910
 I do not like what I feel well then 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.160
 I end up creating my own fashion it 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.750
 not even calling because others say 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.280
 I think I know how to combine the cool parts. 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.100
 I think in the end it gives a result 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.660
 cool the victory, Pope asked 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.500
 you could change something in your 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.540
 profession 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:42.730
 one thing that blog bothers you 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:44.870
 I know who says kiss since beautiful and 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.090
 ok let's see 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:51.380
 I do not think it would change anything I think 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:54.500
 blogger is and youtuber is a profession 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.720
 wonderful and that I identified myself 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.720
 I really liked it a lot and I think I 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.270
 I developed very well. 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.970
 Let's see, have you two to talk? 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.310
 with you then thinking it would change nothing I 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.080
 I think it is perfect without receiving function 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.150
 some diet in my voice I play 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.990

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.120

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.790
 I'm sorry, let's go to the next one.

 You spend the day with me the end of

 Yes, of course I had this. 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.330
 opportunity if you agree without 

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:43.850
 to know the call would show pass the 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.680
 days with me maybe another week or a 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.720
 late even if it's a little time to 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.090
 We met the student Deborah Lopes. 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.070
 asked which products to do with 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.980
 sure should not be reminiscent of 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:57.260
 corrective button or balbi send kisses 

00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:00.290
 I think a lot of good people like him 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.570
 answer corrective mascara button but 

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:04.640
 I'm going to answer balm football is a 

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.500
 thing that I can not live without mine 

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.940
 mouth of hell it becomes dry in the 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.070
 summer was rejected in the fall and 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.530
 spring any season she stays 

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:15.110
 so you always need an 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:17.390
 Get me in my bag on my side at school. 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:19.669
 my studio anywhere it takes 

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.800
 of a good deal, always passing 

00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:23.450
 nicolle costa de araujo asked there 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.700
 now there are no people to have a blog and a 

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:28.580
 channel and what the disadvantage since the 20 

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:31.340
 I love a beautiful kiss so the advantage 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:33.320
 sure to receive all this affection and 

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:36.110
 support and I'm not tired of saying this to 

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:38.419
 you because even the biggest advantage of 

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:39.710
 work that I do and the downside was 

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:42.290
 what I said does not have many advantages 

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:44.479
 this area is perhaps one criticism that 

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:46.400
 people say that we do not like that 

00:07:44.479 --> 00:07:48.530
 those like that with mice but we
