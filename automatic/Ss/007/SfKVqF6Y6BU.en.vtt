00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.299
 I found this remedy on the internet 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:06.480
 I checked and I can contribute to 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:08.800
 Evidence of its effectiveness 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.820
 lr what you put on the web where I 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.349
 I discovered in 1928 Richard Simon's said 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.960
 that colds and viruses of the 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:19.050
 flu enter through the ear canal the 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.660
 medical community denied such claim 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.220
 in 1938 German researchers had 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.590
 great success using peroxide 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.199
 hydrogen in the treatment of 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.469
 colds and the flu your data have been 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:34.370
 ignored maybe suppressed for more 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:36.710
 60 years old 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.230
 well that weird thing you've heard is water 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.450
 oxygenated 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.800
 you know when you throw something at 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.020
 generate some wound occur 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.629
 enough bubbles and if you throw the water 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.480
 oxygenated skin on a healthy skin does not 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.739
 occur there is no effect then 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.949
 over the ear is exactly the same 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.989
 when the flu virus is there 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:59.910
 they produce bubbles and if there is no flu or 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:02.700
 nothing like that does not produce any reaction 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.160
 in the video that you see from my ear that what 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.350
 I recorded just as I could you can appreciate 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.210
 the bubbles although I was not very 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.210
 caught was the second day I had the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.860
 flu and loved the symptoms and the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.860
 Last night had sweated a lot in 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.020
 bed and that already crushes the virus a lot 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.670
 that's why you can appreciate that the 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.670
 Bubbles are pretty small 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.530
 I will not tell you all my experience 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.060
 staff to not lengthen the video just 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.980
 I 'll tell you if you've been with the 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.780
 flu and you're pretty bad with fever and 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.090
 others the little bubbles are small 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.440
 first minute from there until you 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.450
 scared of the compulsive reaction 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.960
 that has oxygenated water by the 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.360
 virus action 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.090
 you have the feeling that your ear is a 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.280
 volcano and mention says the web where what 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.369
 discover that you can even produce a 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.350
 slight pain but that fight to the death 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.240
 although it scares at the beginning 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.670
 incredibly rewarding to feel 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.970
 how do you end up with that little cabroncete 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.070
 microscopic 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.780
 well before you think about doing the 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.450
 I'll tell you that I do not know if 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.830
 it can be counterproductive that it can 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.619
 have contraindications of any 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.530
 type I applied it to me and I have not felt 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:15.610
 no type of side effect 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.350
 in fact I have done the auditory test 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.090
 in this time of last year that what 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.700
 I tried the first time so far and I've 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.490
 lost absolutely nothing I do not have 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.720
 No problem would need to read all 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.010
 the conclusions they reached 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.270
 during the study that was done in 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:33.010
 1938 yes, if you have a tear of 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.620
 eardrum anything rare or you 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.180
 happen to try 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.670
 if those studies were really 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.860
 hidden then there will be no shortage 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.330
 detractors who will ensure that it is 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.670
 terrible from the oxygenated water in the 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:49.150
 heard but I'm telling you that there is no 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:52.180
 side effect that can be appreciated 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.849
 the way to apply it is by throwing two or 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.189
 three drops in each ear infected the 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:59.409
 oxygenated water should be 3% and 10 % 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:02.379
 volume is selling you a 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:04.780
 pharmacies sometimes only one ear is 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:06.269
 infected and sometimes the two are not 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.430
 you will know until you do the test 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:13.019
 I ever have filled up 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.019
 stop and nothing has happened 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.959
 in the water if general stay in the 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.940
 forgetfulness between 5 and 10 minutes so 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.580
 you have to lean a little and take the 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.700
 water inside the ear you should repeat the 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.860
 process every hour or every two hours until 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.870
 stop blowing bubbles in a day or 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.840
 two you can finish with the videos 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.110
 perfectly 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.930
 in case you do not keep coming out 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.310
 bubbles in your ear and keep noticing the 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.459
 symptoms of flu you should not 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.870
 worry you will see 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.060
 apparently it works like a ship of 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.370
 nurse who stays in the ear and from 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.470
 there is polluting the body if you kill 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.120
 the mothership the others dies only the 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.549
 antibodies of our body are 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.800
 order and every time the symptoms will be 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:59.110
 minors to disappear 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.780
 Well now comes the most interesting thing about 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:06.080
 the question because doctors do not know 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.460
 this is known since the 1930s 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.380
 in the case that oxygenated water 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.090
 may have any contraindication 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.620
 because they have not developed a 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.640
 medicine that attacks the virus 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.130
 directly in the ear 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.859
 right now I do not know but 30 years ago 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.590
 in the 80s so the flu was one of 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.990
 the biggest businesses that existed now 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.300
 will be overcome by cancer and some 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.720
 but still it's still a 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.790
 huge business 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.260
 you can imagine the pile of millions that 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.760
 they would stop winning if everyone 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.920
 knew the oxygenated water remedy 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.020
 you can bet that it's probably that 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.550
 the real reason that this remedy 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.470
 will be separated from knowledge 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.680
 popular and even knowledge 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.830
 doctor 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.530
 there are deaths from flu and there is a known 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.849
 infallible and simple remedy since 1938 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:56.219
 but how can they lie like that 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:57.779
 is that even if you remain deaf for 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:05:00.089
 using oxygenated water is preferable 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:02.809
 lose your hearing and even the entire ear 

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:02.809
 before dying 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.759
 the doctors of public health do not 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.129
 they work for the pharmaceutical companies but 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:11.300
 they work for the people but the 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:13.550
 knowledge they acquire in the 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.930
 university seem designed to 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.930
 benefit the pharmaceutical industry 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.510
 apparently there are many studies that 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.280
 like this oxygenated water are 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.390
 hidden by the private interests of 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.370
 the big pharma 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.590
 I want you to see some videos so that 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.020
 think a bit about it and you can 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:34.070
 so assess how far they are 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.900
 we live swindled 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.250
 but above all I want to ask you 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.480
 doctors who investigate if 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.370
 there is truly some 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.530
 contraindication that may motivate the 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.020
 use of hydrogen peroxide for 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.540
 treatment of the flu do not trust 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.940
 the first thing someone says to us 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:51.670
 check it 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.110
 You have seen it in the video , not what 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.590
 you can deny 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:59.260
 there can not be more deaths from the flu 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:01.330
 and if you do not find contraindications the 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.790
 echo of the news raise awareness 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.340
 to the town that they play with their health and 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.050
 your pocket and it can be the blow of 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.460
 effect that we need to change this 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.460
 system corrupted by money 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:16.540
 some documentaries that can do but 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.400
 to anyone who interests the 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.620
 big capitalists are above

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.620
 making you sick can be the 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.169
 following 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.360

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:35.170

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.260
 retransmitted in the nut that speaks of 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:50.450
 Spanish health

 doctors 

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:17.450
