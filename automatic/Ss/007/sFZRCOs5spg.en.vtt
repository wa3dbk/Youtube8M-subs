00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.460 
is the Iron Bowl I can't go ahead of
that<00:06:16.400> we'll<00:06:16.970> discuss<00:06:17.330> that<00:06:17.510> when<00:06:17.930> the<00:06:18.110> season

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:18.470 
that we'll discuss that when the season

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.320 
that we'll discuss that when the season
is<00:06:18.590> over<00:06:18.770> but<00:06:19.280> it<00:06:19.400> really<00:06:19.580> all<00:06:19.789> depends<00:06:20.180> on

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330 
is over but it really all depends on

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.060 
is over but it really all depends on
where<00:06:20.510> he<00:06:20.660> grades<00:06:20.900> out<00:06:21.110> Tony<00:06:21.410> if<00:06:21.590> he's<00:06:21.770> in<00:06:21.950> the

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
where he grades out Tony if he's in the

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.620 
where he grades out Tony if he's in the
if<00:06:22.250> he's<00:06:22.430> in<00:06:22.700> you<00:06:22.910> know<00:06:23.030> the<00:06:23.150> first<00:06:23.360> round

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:23.630 
if he's in you know the first round

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.360 
if he's in you know the first round
there's<00:06:23.900> there's<00:06:24.229> really<00:06:24.650> a<00:06:24.770> ceiling<00:06:25.280> you

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
there's there's really a ceiling you

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.219 
there's there's really a ceiling you
can't<00:06:25.640> go<00:06:25.789> any<00:06:25.970> higher<00:06:26.180> you<00:06:26.510> would<00:06:26.630> expect<00:06:27.020> him

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:27.229 
can't go any higher you would expect him

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:29.500 
can't go any higher you would expect him
to<00:06:27.380> go<00:06:27.530> but<00:06:27.800> if<00:06:28.100> he's<00:06:28.370> you<00:06:28.669> know<00:06:28.789> in<00:06:29.090> a<00:06:29.210> later

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:29.510 
to go but if he's you know in a later

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.570 
to go but if he's you know in a later
round<00:06:29.900> then<00:06:30.140> maybe<00:06:30.320> he<00:06:30.530> stays<00:06:30.800> and<00:06:31.039> comes<00:06:31.280> back

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
round then maybe he stays and comes back

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.880 
round then maybe he stays and comes back
but<00:06:32.180> really<00:06:32.750> the<00:06:32.870> matchup<00:06:33.409> that<00:06:33.590> I<00:06:33.650> don't

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:33.890
