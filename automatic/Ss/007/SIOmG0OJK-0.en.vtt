00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.250
 all are 96 in this video maps for 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.750
 while because I said good in this 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.580
 I bring you 3 different maps 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.760
 the three maps contain what is 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:24.610
 caves mines lava each map has something 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.580
 special that makes them different from 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.850
 the three of us good we start with the first 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:35.050
 in the first one I have some time 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.580
 playing at what this map has village and 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.040
 what a village has like 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:44.409
 minecraft of pc that is being 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.909
 crops houses the water but the only 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:48.040
 that the lack and saying the villagers 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:52.150
 this the description I will leave a 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:55.049
 video of how to add villagers for 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.979
 If you want to make this map more fun 

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:58.629
 good 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:01.750
 we pass well we are going to give you some 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:04.120
 images of this map as you see have 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.860
 and as the crack type I think this 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.950
 map has like two or three theories 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.500
 you crack the truth that I remember a lot 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.530
 I have no time for the game either 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.619
 have mines 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.880
 and the truth is pretty cool 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.770
 well we went with the next one with the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.950
 second map 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.600
 the second map what the what good about what 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.329
 what makes it special is that it has a 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.700
 good strength from those strengths 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:33.079
 as of which the minecraft pc when 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.880
 You will find when you go to the 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:38.700
 that you go through a fortress type in 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.310
 mind that it is something similar and has 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.270
 like dallas 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.940
 the bookstores in the caves as well 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.670
 as shown in this image 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.509
 This is the strength 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.530
 in you true on this map in the little while 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:59.210
 I was playing, I found too much 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.920
 too much diamond the truth the same 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.420
 very exaggerated it makes me 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.890
 they put in but I think they did not put it 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.020
 because we are in the lowest part 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.720
 for where is the diamond like 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.330
 come here at least I think there were 7 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.160
 diamonds in a little while I played it already 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.590
 had gotten more than 20 diamonds the 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.110
 true that's a breakthrough 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.590
 be here you also have caves and mines 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.170
 everything except village 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.870
 look here is another diamond and I think 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.760
 that the part of being in the lava is another 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.090
 well we keep going with the next 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.090
 Map 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.620
 the following map is like snow this 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.620
 the truth 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.299
 it's pretty che is pretty good 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:51.049
 as you can take advantage of this to see 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:53.860
 more or less about how are the 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:56.050
 caves on this map 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.810
 this mind a huge crack the most 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.090
 has one is if I did not badly find one but 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.910
 As you can see, they have lava and water, so you 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.150
 you can fall look here I also took advantage 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.970
 that and I took the picture as you see here here 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:13.090
 they show them the caves how is 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.950
 match the whole map 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.410
 Well I hope you liked the 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:21.069
 online video to me you motivate me to 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.709
 keep making the videos this comment 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.500
 what video would you like for me to do 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:30.660
 and make them good this would be all 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.660
