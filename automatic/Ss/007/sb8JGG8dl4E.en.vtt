00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
guys on the other team were not not the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.209 
guys on the other team were not not the
best<00:00:41.610> but<00:00:42.500> i'm<00:00:43.500> using<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.040> rapid<00:00:45.030> fire<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.510> 25

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
best but i'm using the rapid fire in 25

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:49.670 
best but i'm using the rapid fire in 25
which<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.789> actually<00:00:48.480> pretty<00:00:49.110> much<00:00:49.289> what<00:00:49.530> you

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
which is actually pretty much what you

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.160 
which is actually pretty much what you
need<00:00:49.950> if<00:00:50.640> you're<00:00:50.820> gonna<00:00:50.910> use<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.210> mp5<00:00:51.600> i<00:00:51.840> think

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
need if you're gonna use the mp5 i think

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.010 
need if you're gonna use the mp5 i think
i<00:00:52.379> think<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.890> gun<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:54.059> just<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.600> doesn't<00:00:54.750> drop

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
i think that gun it just it doesn't drop

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.660 
i think that gun it just it doesn't drop

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
guys but usually run with rapid fire and

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.060 
guys but usually run with rapid fire and
here's<00:01:00.809> one<00:01:01.050> thing<00:01:01.260> i<00:01:01.440> will<00:01:01.500> say<00:01:01.649> about

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
here's one thing i will say about

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.440 
here's one thing i will say about
demolition<00:01:02.570> that<00:01:03.570> dumb<00:01:04.489> it's<00:01:05.489> honestly<00:01:06.270> it's

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
demolition that dumb it's honestly it's

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.020 
demolition that dumb it's honestly it's
kind<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.869> unfair<00:01:07.229> it's<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.430> fact<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.760> their

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
kind of unfair it's the fact that their

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.140 
kind of unfair it's the fact that their
spawn<00:01:09.330> never<00:01:09.659> really<00:01:09.960> changes<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.700> so<00:01:11.700> if<00:01:12.000> i

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
spawn never really changes and so if i

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.510 
spawn never really changes and so if i
called<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.510> Napalm<00:01:12.900> like<00:01:13.080> i<00:01:13.170> did<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.680> their

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
called the Napalm like i did in their

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.950 
called the Napalm like i did in their
spawn<00:01:14.820> they're<00:01:15.119> just<00:01:15.330> gonna<00:01:15.450> keep<00:01:15.540> spawning

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
spawn they're just gonna keep spawning

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.730 
spawn they're just gonna keep spawning
into<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.979> just<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.610> honestly<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.509> sucks<00:01:18.750> but

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
into it it just it honestly it sucks but

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.859 
into it it just it honestly it sucks but
on<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.040> map<00:01:20.250> like<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.490> when<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.119> spawn<00:01:21.390> trap<00:01:21.689> i

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
on a map like this when you spawn trap i

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.109 
on a map like this when you spawn trap i
think<00:01:22.229> there<00:01:23.070> are<00:01:23.189> two<00:01:23.340> maps<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:23.909> game

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
think there are two maps in this game

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.940 
think there are two maps in this game
for<00:01:24.509> demolition<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:25.170> i<00:01:25.200> think<00:01:25.320> are<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
for demolition that i think are the

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.420 
for demolition that i think are the
nastiest<00:01:26.700> Von<00:01:27.000> Trapps<00:01:27.710> one<00:01:28.710> being<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.189> mad

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
man I would already backed out after I

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.959 
man I would already backed out after I
died<00:02:00.899> right<00:02:01.170> when<00:02:01.200> i<00:02:01.350> spawned<00:02:01.710> like<00:02:02.219> if<00:02:02.850> it

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
died right when i spawned like if it

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.700 
died right when i spawned like if it
would<00:02:03.090> happen<00:02:03.240> twice<00:02:03.540> man<00:02:03.990> i<00:02:04.049> would<00:02:04.229> back<00:02:04.469> out

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
would happen twice man i would back out

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.399 
would happen twice man i would back out
but<00:02:05.549> you<00:02:06.030> know<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.390> guess<00:02:06.689> that's<00:02:07.290> the

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
but you know that I guess that's the

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.460 
but you know that I guess that's the
that's<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.220> price<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.489> pay<00:02:08.610> for<00:02:09.170> for<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.200> plane

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
that's the price you pay for for a plane

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.040 
that's the price you pay for for a plane
demolition<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.129> if<00:02:11.610> you're<00:02:11.730> in<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:11.849> party<00:02:12.239> and

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
demolition and if you're in a party and

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.690 
demolition and if you're in a party and
you're<00:02:13.590> getting<00:02:13.800> spawn<00:02:14.040> trapped<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.460> know<00:02:14.580> it

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
you're getting spawn trapped you know it

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.680 
you're getting spawn trapped you know it
it<00:02:15.150> really<00:02:15.960> sucks<00:02:16.320> and<00:02:16.700> i<00:02:17.700> will<00:02:18.000> say<00:02:18.210> after<00:02:18.570> the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
it really sucks and i will say after the

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.770 
it really sucks and i will say after the
first<00:02:18.930> team<00:02:19.350> backed<00:02:19.590> out<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:20.180> now<00:02:21.180> now<00:02:21.540> i'm<00:02:21.690> in

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
you know it it was really fucked up that

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.570 
you know it it was really fucked up that
they<00:02:27.180> joined<00:02:27.420> this<00:02:27.540> game<00:02:27.750> because<00:02:28.310> there<00:02:29.310> I

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
they joined this game because there I

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.790 
they joined this game because there I
mean<00:02:29.970> they<00:02:30.120> really<00:02:30.330> have<00:02:30.480> no<00:02:30.660> chance<00:02:30.930> that<00:02:31.650> guy

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
mean they really have no chance that guy

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.020 
mean they really have no chance that guy
almost<00:02:32.010> killed<00:02:32.310> me<00:02:32.520> but<00:02:32.730> he<00:02:32.760> didn't<00:02:33.630> so<00:02:35.090> yeah<00:02:36.090> I

almost killed me but he didn't so yeah I

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.670 
almost killed me but he didn't so yeah I
mean<00:02:39.030> there's<00:02:39.210> not<00:02:39.630> much<00:02:39.810> else<00:02:39.960> to<00:02:40.050> say<00:02:40.140> other

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
mean there's not much else to say other

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.410 
mean there's not much else to say other
than<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:41.790> kind<00:02:42.420> of<00:02:42.570> it<00:02:43.500> kind<00:02:43.530> of<00:02:43.950> sucks<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.520> play

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
than it kind of it kind of sucks to play

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.600 
than it kind of it kind of sucks to play
a<00:02:45.450> game<00:02:45.510> like<00:02:45.780> this<00:02:45.960> and<00:02:46.770> I<00:02:47.040> know<00:02:47.100> hutch<00:02:47.430> and

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
a game like this and I know hutch and

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.780 
a game like this and I know hutch and
brought<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.970> idea<00:02:48.270> of<00:02:49.100> adding<00:02:50.100> a<00:02:50.280> responder

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
brought the idea of adding a responder

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.170 
brought the idea of adding a responder
later<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.420> demolition<00:02:51.860> but<00:02:52.860> I<00:02:53.160> would<00:02:53.580> say<00:02:53.880> all

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
later to demolition but I would say all

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.210 
later to demolition but I would say all
honesty<00:02:54.720> they<00:02:54.990> added<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.320> respawn<00:02:55.680> delay<00:02:55.980> it

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
honesty they added a respawn delay it

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.460 
honesty they added a respawn delay it
would<00:02:56.400> actually<00:02:56.520> make<00:02:56.940> spawn<00:02:57.360> killing<00:02:57.660> worse

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
would actually make spawn killing worse

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.620 
would actually make spawn killing worse
I<00:02:58.860> think<00:02:59.430> it<00:02:59.550> would<00:02:59.670> it<00:03:00.030> would<00:03:00.060> happen<00:03:00.330> a<00:03:00.510> lot

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
I think it would it would happen a lot

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.660 
I think it would it would happen a lot
more<00:03:00.900> because<00:03:01.590> if<00:03:01.860> you<00:03:01.980> look<00:03:02.070> here<00:03:02.340> they're

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
more because if you look here they're

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.780 
more because if you look here they're
spawning<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.270> they<00:03:03.690> at<00:03:03.840> least<00:03:04.140> have<00:03:04.640> you<00:03:05.640> know

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
spawning and they at least have you know

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.900 
spawning and they at least have you know
a<00:03:06.120> second<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:06.960> half<00:03:06.990> to<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:07.740> tried<00:03:08.280> reacted

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
a second and a half to you tried reacted

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.060 
a second and a half to you tried reacted
to<00:03:09.300> shoot<00:03:09.510> somebody<00:03:09.770> but<00:03:10.770> if<00:03:10.830> they<00:03:10.950> had<00:03:11.040> a

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
to shoot somebody but if they had a

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.370 
to shoot somebody but if they had a
respawn<00:03:11.430> delay<00:03:11.670> i<00:03:11.700> mean<00:03:12.060> they<00:03:12.900> would<00:03:13.050> they

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
respawn delay i mean they would they

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.230 
respawn delay i mean they would they
would<00:03:13.410> really<00:03:13.860> never<00:03:14.100> have<00:03:14.370> a<00:03:14.400> chance<00:03:14.730> because

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
would really never have a chance because

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.330 
would really never have a chance because
we<00:03:15.630> would<00:03:15.780> just<00:03:16.080> look<00:03:16.290> at<00:03:16.470> all<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.710> spawns<00:03:17.010> and

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
we would just look at all the spawns and

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.640 
we would just look at all the spawns and
we<00:03:18.330> would<00:03:18.480> have<00:03:18.630> time<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:18.840> set<00:03:19.170> up<00:03:19.200> after<00:03:19.410> we

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
we would have time to set up after we

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.790 
we would have time to set up after we
bring<00:03:19.890> them<00:03:19.950> off<00:03:20.100> or<00:03:20.550> we<00:03:21.150> get<00:03:21.270> them<00:03:21.330> all<00:03:21.480> down

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 
bring them off or we get them all down

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.340 
bring them off or we get them all down
so<00:03:22.800> i<00:03:23.360> don't<00:03:24.360> know<00:03:24.480> this<00:03:24.660> is<00:03:24.840> just<00:03:25.050> a<00:03:25.140> perfect

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
so i don't know this is just a perfect

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.240 
so i don't know this is just a perfect
perfect<00:03:26.100> example<00:03:26.940> of<00:03:27.260> something<00:03:28.260> that<00:03:28.410> myself

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
perfect example of something that myself

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.850 
perfect example of something that myself
and<00:03:29.820> some<00:03:30.570> Envy<00:03:30.900> guys<00:03:31.080> we<00:03:31.410> used<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.680> play

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
and some Envy guys we used to play

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.699 
and some Envy guys we used to play
demolition<00:03:32.580> on<00:03:32.700> modern<00:03:33.030> warfare<00:03:33.150> 2<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:34.410> we

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
demolition on modern warfare 2 and we

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.560 
demolition on modern warfare 2 and we
used<00:03:34.890> to<00:03:34.980> do<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.220> same<00:03:35.400> thing<00:03:35.670> pretty<00:03:36.450> much

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
used to do the same thing pretty much

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.400 
used to do the same thing pretty much
every<00:03:36.870> game<00:03:37.400> especially<00:03:38.400> on<00:03:38.910> favela<00:03:39.410> favela

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
every game especially on favela favela

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.890 
every game especially on favela favela
was<00:03:40.590> probably<00:03:40.890> been<00:03:41.100> worst<00:03:41.400> map<00:03:41.730> that<00:03:42.720> you

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
was probably been worst map that you

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.260 
was probably been worst map that you
could<00:03:43.080> play<00:03:43.230> against<00:03:43.590> us<00:03:43.739> if<00:03:43.950> if<00:03:44.610> we<00:03:45.000> got<00:03:45.150> you

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
could play against us if if we got you

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.130 
could play against us if if we got you
into<00:03:45.450> a<00:03:45.510> spawn<00:03:45.750> trap<00:03:46.020> because<00:03:47.600> literally<00:03:48.600> we

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
into a spawn trap because literally we

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.040 
into a spawn trap because literally we
could<00:03:49.940> we<00:03:50.940> could<00:03:51.090> just<00:03:51.330> hold<00:03:51.690> down<00:03:51.840> the

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
could we could just hold down the

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.250 
could we could just hold down the
trigger<00:03:52.290> and<00:03:52.880> we<00:03:53.880> would<00:03:54.090> we<00:03:54.540> would<00:03:54.570> hit<00:03:54.930> you<00:03:54.959> as

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
trigger and we would we would hit you as

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.690 
trigger and we would we would hit you as
you<00:03:55.410> spawn<00:03:55.680> you<00:03:56.040> guys<00:03:56.190> would<00:03:56.340> never<00:03:56.370> have<00:03:56.640> a

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
you spawn you guys would never have a
