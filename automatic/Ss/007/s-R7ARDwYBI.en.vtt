okay<00:00:40.370> well<00:00:40.519> apart<00:00:40.760> from<00:00:40.790> the<00:00:40.970> fact<00:00:41.000> that<00:00:41.239> it's

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
okay well apart from the fact that it's

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:44.049 
okay well apart from the fact that it's
a<00:00:41.570> 40<00:00:41.930> millimeter<00:00:42.110> case<00:00:42.530> it<00:00:43.220> comes<00:00:43.400> with<00:00:43.610> a<00:00:43.670> 7<00:00:43.940> 3

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
a 40 millimeter case it comes with a 7 3

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.390 
a 40 millimeter case it comes with a 7 3
3<00:00:44.360> movement<00:00:44.930> which<00:00:45.050> is<00:00:45.199> just<00:00:45.379> a<00:00:45.470> standard<00:00:45.710> SW

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
3 movement which is just a standard SW

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.000 
3 movement which is just a standard SW
200<00:00:47.120> which<00:00:47.390> is<00:00:47.570> of<00:00:47.690> course<00:00:47.839> 26<00:00:48.470> joules<00:00:48.739> with<00:00:48.979> a

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
200 which is of course 26 joules with a

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.280 
200 which is of course 26 joules with a
38<00:00:49.489> hour<00:00:49.850> power<00:00:50.210> reserve<00:00:50.690> now<00:00:50.960> the<00:00:51.019> actual

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
38 hour power reserve now the actual

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.229 
38 hour power reserve now the actual
dimension<00:00:51.739> of<00:00:51.920> this<00:00:52.250> movement<00:00:52.760> is<00:00:52.879> twenty

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
dimension of this movement is twenty

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.509 
dimension of this movement is twenty
five<00:00:53.420> point<00:00:53.839> six<00:00:54.170> millimeters<00:00:54.739> in<00:00:55.220> diameter

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
five point six millimeters in diameter

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.930 
five point six millimeters in diameter
okay<00:00:56.150> so<00:00:56.360> that's<00:00:56.690> the<00:00:56.839> guys<00:00:57.159> now<00:00:58.159> the<00:00:58.580> women's

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
okay so that's the guys now the women's

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.820 
okay so that's the guys now the women's
is<00:00:59.089> a<00:00:59.119> smaller<00:00:59.540> watch<00:00:59.780> does<00:01:00.530> it<00:01:00.650> have<00:01:00.769> a

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
is a smaller watch does it have a

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.740 
is a smaller watch does it have a
different<00:01:01.159> movement<00:01:01.280> in<00:01:01.489> water<00:01:01.699> and<00:01:01.939> it<00:01:02.479> does

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
different movement in water and it does

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.990 
different movement in water and it does
it<00:01:03.140> has<00:01:03.350> two<00:01:03.589> just<00:01:03.979> for<00:01:04.100> the<00:01:04.159> physical<00:01:04.339> size<00:01:04.760> of

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
it has two just for the physical size of

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.550 
it has two just for the physical size of
the<00:01:05.059> case<00:01:05.360> which<00:01:05.659> of<00:01:05.689> course<00:01:05.840> is<00:01:06.170> 31

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
the case which of course is 31

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.010 
the case which of course is 31
millimeters<00:01:06.790> so<00:01:07.790> in<00:01:08.150> that<00:01:08.420> case<00:01:08.689> what<00:01:08.900> we<00:01:08.990> have

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
millimeters so in that case what we have

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.550 
millimeters so in that case what we have
is<00:01:09.200> a<00:01:09.670> it's<00:01:10.670> a<00:01:10.820> Norris<00:01:11.150> 561<00:01:11.990> movement<00:01:12.439> which

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
is a it's a Norris 561 movement which

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.929 
is a it's a Norris 561 movement which
equates<00:01:12.920> to<00:01:13.070> an<00:01:13.430> ETA<00:01:13.759> to<00:01:14.229> 671<00:01:15.939> actual

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
equates to an ETA to 671 actual

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:18.969 
equates to an ETA to 671 actual
dimension<00:01:17.330> of<00:01:17.450> that<00:01:17.570> movement<00:01:17.960> is<00:01:18.049> 17<00:01:18.619> point

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
dimension of that movement is 17 point

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.060 
dimension of that movement is 17 point
two<00:01:19.189> millimeters<00:01:20.350> which<00:01:21.350> is<00:01:21.380> a<00:01:21.500> standard<00:01:21.920> size

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
two millimeters which is a standard size

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.680 
two millimeters which is a standard size
for<00:01:22.280> a<00:01:22.340> lady's<00:01:22.670> movement<00:01:23.030> I<00:01:23.060> suppose<00:01:23.390> a<00:01:23.420> lot<00:01:23.630> of

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
for a lady's movement I suppose a lot of

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.490 
for a lady's movement I suppose a lot of
cases<00:01:23.960> as<00:01:24.320> a<00:01:24.380> 25<00:01:24.860> jul<00:01:25.390> 30<00:01:26.390> 8<00:01:26.630> our<00:01:26.840> powers<00:01:27.290> of

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
cases as a 25 jul 30 8 our powers of

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.620 
cases as a 25 jul 30 8 our powers of
okay<00:01:28.100> so<00:01:28.160> both<00:01:28.550> watches<00:01:28.970> are<00:01:29.090> waterproof<00:01:29.330> down

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
okay so both watches are waterproof down

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.960 
okay so both watches are waterproof down
to<00:01:29.930> 30<00:01:30.170> meters<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.590> three<00:01:30.890> atmospheres<00:01:31.040> they

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
to 30 meters the three atmospheres they

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.570 
to 30 meters the three atmospheres they
have<00:01:32.120> a<00:01:32.150> slightly<00:01:32.750> done<00:01:33.170> sapphire<00:01:34.040> crystal

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
have a slightly done sapphire crystal

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.610 
have a slightly done sapphire crystal
glass<00:01:34.790> with<00:01:35.210> any<00:01:35.450> reflective<00:01:35.930> coating<00:01:36.380> on<00:01:36.500> the

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 
glass with any reflective coating on the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.160 
glass with any reflective coating on the
inside<00:01:36.970> for<00:01:37.970> my<00:01:38.210> personal<00:01:38.570> point<00:01:38.750> of<00:01:38.840> view<00:01:38.900> I

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
inside for my personal point of view I

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.120 
inside for my personal point of view I
think<00:01:39.380> a<00:01:40.370> great<00:01:41.150> his-and-hers<00:01:41.870> watch<00:01:42.230> and<00:01:42.620> I

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
think a great his-and-hers watch and I

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.430 
think a great his-and-hers watch and I
think<00:01:43.940> they<00:01:44.420> match<00:01:44.690> beautifully<00:01:44.900> with<00:01:45.290> us

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
think they match beautifully with us

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.040 
think they match beautifully with us
with<00:01:46.040> a<00:01:46.070> silver<00:01:46.460> doll<00:01:46.729> I<00:01:46.970> think<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.690> ladies

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
with a silver doll I think the ladies

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.710 
with a silver doll I think the ladies
personally<00:01:48.590> is<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:48.950> best<00:01:49.250> ladies<00:01:50.060> watch<00:01:50.300> in

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
personally is the best ladies watch in

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.800 
personally is the best ladies watch in
in<00:01:51.409> the<00:01:51.560> iris<00:01:51.800> range<00:01:52.070> I<00:01:52.340> think<00:01:52.850> so<00:01:53.270> you<00:01:53.330> know<00:01:53.600> in

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
in the iris range I think so you know in

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.260 
in the iris range I think so you know in
a<00:01:53.870> lot<00:01:53.960> of<00:01:54.020> cases<00:01:54.340> many<00:01:55.340> ladies<00:01:55.580> don't<00:01:56.060> want

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
a lot of cases many ladies don't want

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.940 
a lot of cases many ladies don't want
that<00:01:56.390> extra<00:01:56.570> bling<00:01:56.960> everything<00:01:57.350> of<00:01:57.470> diamonds

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
that extra bling everything of diamonds

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.130 
that extra bling everything of diamonds
around<00:01:58.250> the<00:01:58.370> dial<00:01:58.610> this<00:01:59.150> has<00:01:59.420> just<00:01:59.690> enough<00:01:59.930> I

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
around the dial this has just enough I
