00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 so i say i have so much to do 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.309
 work then we have projects yorks 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.870
 then we have open air here with us 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.860
 4000 people and of course youtube though 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.500
 how do i say to my co-workers 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.270
 always making a sound out of it 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.310
 Let's just do it today 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.500
 have dealt with the housing 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.330
 and who we are on facebook is 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.930
 who knows what I did at easter 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.789
 namely the side part of the ship Knox the 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.980
 thing is that there is for that 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.840
 deep his sex and side with 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.960
 window but the window is just like that 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.390
 designed that just the hard drives cages 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.829
 not shown as a solid 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.379
 Metal piece is and the window only 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.030
 left at the motherboard area is like that 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.649
 that the graphics cards and the motto 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.140
 board pulls and the power supply is to 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.949
 good luck too hidden but we 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.079
 want to continue in knox or 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.090
 already remove the hard disk cages 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.289
 and then come the water reservoirs 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.149
 and pumping and we want that 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.399
 of course, we see, above all, build 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.500
 Water cooling for optical purposes 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.840
 purely naturally also cool purposes 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.810
 but if you are such a massive thing 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.049
 pure will also have to look at why is 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.880
 there is a custom window and what i have 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.880
 because she did that now 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.409
 By the way, I have an oxer like that 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.420
 in between a few pictures sent 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.790
 from the housing itself as to the location 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.009
 is and then came back as an answer 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.110
 yes, as our housing is not 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.250
 to recognize more 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.909
 but I do not show it to you yet 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.340
 me a little asshole so if you 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.960
 to make such a material for your housing 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.979
 want there are many for example the 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.299
 from how hot to be quiet of the housing 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.979
 do not know exactly what it means 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.690
 but you know what I mean 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.940
 since I have no time you can find it in there 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.890
 is to come once as far as I heard 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.420
 But I really understand that 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.210
 not yet and at the moment they have 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.460
 housing no window there are for example 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.420
 online moschitz to buy as the gets 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.110
 hose with 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.869
 this is me where shore is shaped me 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.480
 we can then just the thing out 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.790
 make the hose tower and then back 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.860
 make the disc clean with the 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.290
 Hose, I personally do not think so 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.610
 nice does not look good and the 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.630
 look there are different 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.450
 possibilities 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.180
 you can give that away to the laser 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.820
 does not go exactly then but has problems 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.739
 So a bit of the paint and leaves 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.170
 of course extremely hot and it can be 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.959
 that the paint then really massive off 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.459
 splinters then you can flex it out 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.290
 if you looked that too, I did too 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.959
 the temperature would be a huge problem 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.140
 that, especially with white housing, the salmon 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.299
 I then follow the heat flashes 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.980
 gets and bloat and play 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.200
 everything will not even be able to do it to me 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.000
 The jigsaw is also one 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.700
 possibility but you always have that 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.400
 problem in the paint I did it that way 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.109
 i am a metalworker i am going there 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.760
 and says here is 20 euros in the 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.880
 Drink money we make the evening meal 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.170
 and if you want to do something service 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.359
 just go to a metal farmer 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.769
 back and says hey come on we do this time 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.720
 and mostly friends if he likes 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.519
 to do something different like now 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.380
 somehow 1000 parts of it probably pull 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.030
 or that means I did it 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.340
 let me cut that out and me 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.790
 really have zero problems in the country 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.530
 no players had no heat bubbles 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.150
 otherwise , that is of course already 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.069
 even a good base I have it any 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.970
 bit that sanded the edges 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.620
 not so keen 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.580
 if now the disc clean in there 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.160
 there are different possible 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.020
 you can plexiglas on the internet 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.000
 writing or acrylic glass slices too 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.480
 cut and send 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.710
 to let 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.720
 But you can also do it the way I did 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.310
 I went to the bauhaus once more 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.530
 Buy a slice and then the desired one 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.240
 size may look like a bit 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.010
 but remember that 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.140
 slice must be about one to two 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.780
 centimeters larger than it punched her 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.540
 have continued for I knox watch time go 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.880
 Next the disc stands for box 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.280
 I made it that way now , we want it that way 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.260
 a bit of water cooling as 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.750
 highlight and that's why I have 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.450
 thought to me blue coolant 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.810
 I already consider any white and 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.720
 blue 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.260
 In any case, my thought was that 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.480
 special on the housing should 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.370
 be highlighted with blue and 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.540
 That's why I'm around the edge of 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.580
 I have the slice in the thin 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.370
 blue rank would be one of a kind 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.220
 black line is framed and so on 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.320
 I just have that a bit too 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.330
 Do not paint too blatantly and I think 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.920
 that they look good if there is one 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.169
 then fix it because there is 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.640
 also still different possibilities one 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.350
 For example, it can have two components 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.510
 take glue because you just paint 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.240
 on the outside and then press the disc 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.800
 from the inside, however, has the advantage that 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.600
 it opposite a double-sided 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.840
 adhesive tape that I used myself 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.130
 with double-sided adhesive tape has that 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.040
 Of course, a certain amount of tape 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.810
 Thick and this is not the slice 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.970
 right on the tin turn and that can 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.740
 of course look stupid but I think 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.840
 it now looks at a side of the 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.730
 is with double-sided adhesive tape 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.560
 I just around the double-sided 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.390
 made tape and then the 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.919
 disc pushed firmly and pressed 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.380
 then just let it get stuck 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:16.330
 If you look for a full-on, you pull 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.770
 almost not that slice a bit 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.780
 stands out and I think so 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.280
 actually the most beautiful that is 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.640
 Now most beautiful my opinion, the 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.070
 what I have done so far because of the 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.870
 Hose is ugly with the sheet it 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.940
 There is a little bit of accent 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.919
 bit highlight brings the whole one 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.800
 bit inside the housing 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:38.050
 look and the slice a bit 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.960
 sections 7 not at all the advantage 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.880
 with double sided tape it must 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.710
 does not have to be too strong there now 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:48.340
 not that everyone is going up 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.630
 90 kilos of water always endures the advantage 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.460
 is then if you for example 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.860
 you make out of graz in the 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.420
 then it could be very easy 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.430
 solve it again there are also the 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:00.040
 possibility of course you can 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.440
 correctly-making the metal or 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.450
 Screw everything together but I'll tell you 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.460
 it's a bit too close up 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.080
 above my level you have to 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.180
 can let yourself be in the plan, it was 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.040
 I did not get that far from there 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.290
 I trust and screw now 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.070
 not so cool 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:17.800
 that's why on your personal 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:20.350
 taste off that's definitely the case 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.970
 side piece for fort knox a slice 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:25.270
 I would like to thank you 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.470
 I like it very much 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:29.140
 Of course it will be the whole thing 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.490
 but it is so far I am now with 

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.640
 the second part of this is finished 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.380
 first part was done is the insulation 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.990
 I do not really know if I'll be back 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.550
 pure maybe I had the good 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.440
 but glue can remove the point 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.790
 is just music from the front and pulls 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.710
 not at all that some glue 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.790
 But residues are just like me 

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.430
 I will probably know 

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:52.060
 remove me yes the service team 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:53.880
 clarified looks and so but well I do 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.470
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.450
 I was trying a little something now 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:00.730
 to make housing it already became 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.390
 much to go on rebuilding of the 

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:04.060
 casing 

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:05.350
 The metal plate is as good as finished 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.050
 when I'm done I'll give you the 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:09.700
 show and if you liked it 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.500
 Thumbs up when you see more videos 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:15.000
 you want to be able to abo and in that 

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:15.000
 think ade warsaw
