00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
you'll require your C DNA sample and

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.750 
you'll require your C DNA sample and
finally<00:00:51.579> some<00:00:52.579> water<00:00:54.070> these<00:00:55.070> pipette<00:00:55.460> men<00:00:55.610> are

finally some water these pipette men are

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.370 
finally some water these pipette men are
here<00:00:55.910> to<00:00:56.059> show<00:00:56.210> you<00:00:56.270> that<00:00:56.420> you<00:00:56.989> essentially

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.380 
here to show you that you essentially

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.350 
here to show you that you essentially
pipette<00:00:58.219> the<00:00:59.140> reagents<00:01:00.140> into<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:00.680> plate<00:01:00.890> you

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
pipette the reagents into the plate you

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.509 
pipette the reagents into the plate you
then<00:01:02.360> seal<00:01:02.719> the<00:01:02.750> plate<00:01:03.110> this<00:01:03.950> is<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:04.219> final

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
then seal the plate this is the final

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.069 
then seal the plate this is the final
product<00:01:04.879> which<00:01:05.059> we<00:01:05.209> then<00:01:05.359> run<00:01:05.569> on<00:01:05.810> the

00:01:06.069 --> 00:01:06.079 
product which we then run on the

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:07.840 
product which we then run on the
instrument<00:01:06.619> and<00:01:06.740> in<00:01:06.979> this<00:01:07.100> case<00:01:07.310> the<00:01:07.490> step<00:01:07.670> 1

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850

plus and now I'm walking over to the

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:13.599 
plus and now I'm walking over to the
step<00:01:10.850> 1<00:01:11.060> plus<00:01:11.619> I'm<00:01:12.619> going<00:01:12.889> to<00:01:12.979> load<00:01:13.159> my<00:01:13.189> plate

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:13.609 
step 1 plus I'm going to load my plate

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:16.419 
step 1 plus I'm going to load my plate
in<00:01:13.789> the<00:01:13.880> instrument<00:01:14.529> simply<00:01:15.529> by<00:01:15.770> pulling<00:01:16.189> open

00:01:16.419 --> 00:01:16.429 
in the instrument simply by pulling open

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:21.219 
in the instrument simply by pulling open
the<00:01:16.670> door<00:01:17.259> and<00:01:19.119> setting<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:20.240> plate<00:01:20.479> the<00:01:21.200> a

okay<00:01:53.290> I<00:01:53.320> saved<00:01:53.710> my<00:01:53.860> experiment<00:01:54.370> I'm<00:01:55.060> going<00:01:55.120> to

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
okay I saved my experiment I'm going to

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.360 
okay I saved my experiment I'm going to
start<00:01:55.480> the<00:01:55.630> run<00:01:55.750> now<00:01:57.960> say<00:01:58.960> okay<00:01:59.350> now<00:02:00.130> what's

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
start the run now say okay now what's

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.690 
start the run now say okay now what's
happening<00:02:00.820> is<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:01.420> cover<00:02:01.630> is<00:02:01.810> heating<00:02:02.170> and<00:02:02.700> as

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
happening is the cover is heating and as

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.880 
happening is the cover is heating and as
soon<00:02:03.880> as<00:02:04.000> the<00:02:04.120> cover<00:02:04.360> has<00:02:04.750> come<00:02:05.050> up<00:02:05.170> to<00:02:05.200> the

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
soon as the cover has come up to the

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.890 
soon as the cover has come up to the
proper<00:02:06.190> temperature<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:07.360> will<00:02:07.540> see<00:02:07.720> that

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
proper temperature you will see that

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.580 
proper temperature you will see that
this<00:02:08.050> wide<00:02:08.380> band<00:02:08.410> becomes<00:02:09.160> smaller<00:02:09.700> as<00:02:10.590> the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
this wide band becomes smaller as the

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:18.720 
this wide band becomes smaller as the
plate<00:02:11.800> is<00:02:11.950> moving<00:02:11.980> up

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.240 

and<00:02:20.050> as<00:02:21.050> it<00:02:21.200> says<00:02:21.380> here<00:02:21.560> on<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.770> screen<00:02:21.980> the

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
and as it says here on the screen the

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.920 
and as it says here on the screen the
required<00:02:22.610> run<00:02:22.940> temperature<00:02:23.420> of<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.660> heated

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
required run temperature of the heated

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.560 
required run temperature of the heated
lid<00:02:24.110> is<00:02:24.410> 105<00:02:25.040> or<00:02:25.460> right<00:02:25.700> now<00:02:25.880> at<00:02:26.030> ninety<00:02:26.360> point

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.380 
lid is 105 or right now at ninety point
five<00:02:26.780> so<00:02:27.470> after<00:02:27.770> a<00:02:27.800> few<00:02:27.890> more<00:02:28.250> degrees<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:29.180> run

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
five so after a few more degrees the run

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.380 
five so after a few more degrees the run
will<00:02:29.570> begin<00:02:30.130> so<00:02:31.130> now<00:02:31.370> that<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.730> run<00:02:32.240> is

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
will begin so now that the run is

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.180 
will begin so now that the run is
completed<00:02:32.960> on<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.110> step<00:02:33.410> one<00:02:33.560> plus<00:02:33.830> I'm<00:02:34.040> going

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
completed on the step one plus I'm going

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.030 
completed on the step one plus I'm going
to<00:02:34.280> collect<00:02:34.580> results<00:02:35.110> by<00:02:36.110> putting<00:02:36.440> in<00:02:36.560> my<00:02:36.709> USB

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
to collect results by putting in my USB

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.910
