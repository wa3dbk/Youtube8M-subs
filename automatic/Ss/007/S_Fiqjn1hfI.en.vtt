begin<00:02:59.239> to<00:02:59.299> decorate<00:02:59.959> is<00:03:00.230> what<00:03:00.769> I'm<00:03:00.950> doing

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
begin to decorate is what I'm doing

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.229 
begin to decorate is what I'm doing
beginning<00:03:01.790> to<00:03:01.910> decorate<00:03:02.299> all<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.540> flaps<00:03:04.239> the

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
beginning to decorate all the flaps the

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.110 
beginning to decorate all the flaps the
flaps<00:03:06.100> there<00:03:07.100> are<00:03:07.220> three<00:03:07.430> inches<00:03:07.760> by<00:03:07.910> three

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
flaps there are three inches by three

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.770 
flaps there are three inches by three
inches<00:03:08.260> but<00:03:09.260> I<00:03:09.319> think<00:03:09.590> I'm<00:03:09.709> doing<00:03:10.569> two<00:03:11.569> three

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
inches but I think I'm doing two three

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.599 
inches but I think I'm doing two three
quarters<00:03:12.200> or<00:03:12.530> I<00:03:12.560> always<00:03:13.010> leave<00:03:13.160> a<00:03:13.220> little<00:03:13.430> bit

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
quarters or I always leave a little bit

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:17.650 
quarters or I always leave a little bit
of<00:03:13.670> a<00:03:13.850> hoarder<00:03:14.980> so<00:03:15.980> we<00:03:16.190> the<00:03:16.850> pink<00:03:17.180> can<00:03:17.450> show<00:03:17.630> a

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
of a hoarder so we the pink can show a

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.559 
of a hoarder so we the pink can show a
little<00:03:17.870> bit<00:03:18.190> here<00:03:19.190> I<00:03:19.220> punched<00:03:19.730> all<00:03:19.910> the<00:03:20.269> inside

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
little bit here I punched all the inside

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:26.949 
little bit here I punched all the inside
pages<00:03:20.870> and<00:03:21.859> put<00:03:22.130> the<00:03:22.489> prong<00:03:25.569> the<00:03:26.569> original

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
pages and put the prong the original

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.319 
pages and put the prong the original
idea<00:03:27.230> didn't<00:03:27.620> have<00:03:27.829> that<00:03:28.100> extra<00:03:28.549> pages<00:03:28.910> but<00:03:29.299> I

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
idea didn't have that extra pages but I

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.430 
idea didn't have that extra pages but I
think<00:03:29.720> it<00:03:29.930> was<00:03:31.959> you<00:03:32.959> know<00:03:33.079> we<00:03:33.230> have<00:03:33.410> to

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
think it was you know we have to

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:44.430 
think it was you know we have to
optimize<00:03:34.040> more<00:03:34.609> the<00:03:34.819> space<00:03:35.150> on<00:03:35.389> the<00:03:35.480> album<00:03:35.870> so

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
check on the ribbon because then you

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.350 
check on the ribbon because then you
know<00:05:34.920> when<00:05:35.190> the<00:05:35.280> purse<00:05:35.430> begins<00:05:35.760> to<00:05:35.910> open<00:05:35.940> up

know when the purse begins to open up
and<00:05:36.540> close<00:05:36.720> so<00:05:37.500> the<00:05:37.710> ribbon<00:05:38.010> doesn't<00:05:38.340> begin<00:05:38.610> to

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
and close so the ribbon doesn't begin to

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.850 
and close so the ribbon doesn't begin to
tear<00:05:39.120> or<00:05:40.130> you<00:05:41.130> can<00:05:41.340> find<00:05:41.550> this<00:05:41.700> on<00:05:41.760> the<00:05:41.910> sewing

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
tear or you can find this on the sewing

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:53.290 
tear or you can find this on the sewing
part<00:05:43.860> of<00:05:44.160> your<00:05:45.950> store

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.249 

and<00:05:53.919> that's<00:05:54.919> pretty<00:05:55.220> much<00:05:55.370> it<00:05:55.789> so<00:05:56.659> you<00:05:57.050> have<00:05:57.229> a

00:05:57.249 --> 00:05:57.259 
and that's pretty much it so you have a

00:05:57.259 --> 00:05:58.809 
and that's pretty much it so you have a
picture<00:05:57.710> of<00:05:57.740> the<00:05:57.889> album<00:05:58.310> if<00:05:58.370> you<00:05:58.430> want<00:05:58.610> to<00:05:58.699> see
