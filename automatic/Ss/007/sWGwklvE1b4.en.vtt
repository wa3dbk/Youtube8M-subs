Sciences<00:03:21.989> like<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.590> don't<00:03:22.980> know<00:03:23.190> just<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.090> the

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
Sciences like I don't know just the the

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.720 
Sciences like I don't know just the the
stuff<00:03:24.660> that<00:03:24.900> is<00:03:25.109> theories<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.370> all<00:03:26.549> that

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
stuff that is theories and all that

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.150 
stuff that is theories and all that
stuff<00:03:27.000> just<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.389> math<00:03:27.600> is<00:03:27.900> just<00:03:27.930> goes<00:03:28.920> right

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
stuff just the math is just goes right

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.620 
stuff just the math is just goes right
over<00:03:29.220> my<00:03:29.430> head<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:29.819> I<00:03:29.910> have<00:03:30.060> no<00:03:30.209> idea<00:03:30.450> what<00:03:30.569> I'm

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
over my head and I have no idea what I'm

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.449 
over my head and I have no idea what I'm
doing<00:03:30.660> at<00:03:31.049> that<00:03:31.079> point<00:03:31.440> because<00:03:32.040> I<00:03:32.250> don't<00:03:32.400> have

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
doing at that point because I don't have

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.000 
doing at that point because I don't have
a<00:03:32.519> mathematical<00:03:32.790> II<00:03:33.239> think<00:03:33.450> it<00:03:33.540> mine<00:03:33.799> but<00:03:34.799> I
