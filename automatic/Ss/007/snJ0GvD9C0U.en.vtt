for<00:01:00.000> em<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.690> cs<00:01:00.960> 2010<00:01:01.350> as<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> very<00:01:01.829> fast

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
for em the cs 2010 as a very fast

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.000 
for em the cs 2010 as a very fast
favorite<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.239> then<00:01:03.660> close<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.500> medium<00:01:04.799> range

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
favorite so then close to medium range

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.770 
favorite so then close to medium range
gunfights<00:01:05.400> you're<00:01:05.850> going<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.030> dominate<00:01:06.390> with

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
gunfights you're going to dominate with

gunfights you're going to dominate with
this<00:01:06.869> connects<00:01:07.229> easy<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.799> use<00:01:07.950> but<00:01:08.430> long-range

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
this connects easy to use but long-range

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.539 
this connects easy to use but long-range
it's<00:01:09.180> going<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.390> recoil<00:01:09.780> as<00:01:09.990> it's<00:01:10.770> got<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.310> very

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
it's going to recoil as it's got a very

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.160 
it's going to recoil as it's got a very
fast<00:01:11.850> favorite<00:01:12.299> which<00:01:12.630> means<00:01:12.869> it's<00:01:12.960> going<00:01:13.049> to

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
fast favorite which means it's going to

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.560 
fast favorite which means it's going to
recall<00:01:13.460> significantly<00:01:14.460> more<00:01:14.850> but<00:01:15.360> anyway

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
recall significantly more but anyway

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.120 
recall significantly more but anyway
with<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.840> attachments<00:01:16.380> i'm<00:01:16.530> currently<00:01:16.890> using

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
with the attachments i'm currently using

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.590 
with the attachments i'm currently using
the<00:01:18.020> suppressor<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.290> for<00:01:19.650> grip<00:01:20.210> for<00:01:21.210> grip<00:01:21.420> is

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
the suppressor and for grip for grip is

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.240 
the suppressor and for grip for grip is
going<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.869> stop<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.170> recoil<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.770> vertical

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
going to stop that recoil that vertical

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.100 
going to stop that recoil that vertical
recoil<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.850> bounced<00:01:24.090> up<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.420> down<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:25.080> that

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
recoil that bounced up and down so that

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.370 
recoil that bounced up and down so that
will<00:01:25.350> help<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.710> lot<00:01:25.890> long-range<00:01:27.020> going<00:01:28.020> down<00:01:28.170> to

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
will help a lot long-range going down to

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.580 
will help a lot long-range going down to
the<00:01:29.030> suppressor<00:01:30.030> suppressor<00:01:30.960> actually<00:01:31.350> makes

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
the suppressor suppressor actually makes

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.890 
the suppressor suppressor actually makes
your<00:01:31.710> accuracy<00:01:32.040> better<00:01:32.579> what<00:01:33.479> actually<00:01:33.780> makes

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
your accuracy better what actually makes

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.690 
your accuracy better what actually makes
the<00:01:34.049> recoil<00:01:34.470> west<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.250> if<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.400> use<00:01:35.549> the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
the recoil west so if you use the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.660 
the recoil west so if you use the
combination<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.570> far<00:01:37.500> grip<00:01:37.680> as<00:01:37.890> well<00:01:38.159> your

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
combination of far grip as well your

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.460 
combination of far grip as well your
recoil<00:01:39.030> shouldn't<00:01:39.450> be<00:01:39.540> anywhere<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.380> your

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
recoil shouldn't be anywhere and your

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.170 
recoil shouldn't be anywhere and your
accuracy<00:01:40.799> should<00:01:41.100> be<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.250> tad<00:01:41.520> better<00:01:41.790> but

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
accuracy should be a tad better but

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.730 
accuracy should be a tad better but
again<00:01:42.210> at<00:01:42.509> long<00:01:42.630> range<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:43.140> still<00:01:43.409> going<00:01:43.649> to

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
again at long range it's still going to

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.380 
again at long range it's still going to
be<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:44.100> little<00:01:44.520> bit<00:01:44.670> awkward<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.030> get<00:01:45.270> them

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
be a little bit awkward to get them

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.740 
be a little bit awkward to get them
long-range<00:01:45.780> kills<00:01:46.079> but<00:01:46.770> then<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:48.119> might<00:01:48.630> have

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
long-range kills but then you might have

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.780 
long-range kills but then you might have
to<00:01:48.869> sacrifice<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.829> suppressive<00:01:50.310> something

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790

it's<00:02:18.300> kind<00:02:18.510> of<00:02:18.599> like<00:02:18.810> a<00:02:18.870> decoy<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.400> helps

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730

to pick up my gun and shoot the enemies
quicker<00:03:31.709> after<00:03:32.100> sprinting<00:03:32.700> so<00:03:33.090> that<00:03:33.239> is

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
quicker after sprinting so that is

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.319 
quicker after sprinting so that is
pretty<00:03:34.290> much<00:03:34.530> my<00:03:34.590> pet<00:03:35.040> combination<00:03:35.760> i<00:03:35.880> feel

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
pretty much my pet combination i feel

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.479 
pretty much my pet combination i feel
it's<00:03:36.540> like<00:03:36.660> being<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.109> best<00:03:37.320> combination<00:03:37.650> if

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
it's like being the best combination if

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.360 
it's like being the best combination if
you<00:03:38.670> feel<00:03:38.910> other<00:03:39.209> just<00:03:39.989> use<00:03:40.620> someone<00:03:40.890> else<00:03:41.010> but

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
you feel other just use someone else but

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.340 
you feel other just use someone else but
I<00:03:41.549> pretty<00:03:42.090> sure<00:03:42.329> this<00:03:42.570> is<00:03:42.630> one<00:03:43.049> of<00:03:43.079> the<00:03:43.200> best

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
I pretty sure this is one of the best

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.319
