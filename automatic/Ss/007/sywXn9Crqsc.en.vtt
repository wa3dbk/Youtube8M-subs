00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:12.850 
at least like the one I'm running when

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.100 
at least like the one I'm running when
you<00:00:13.710> release<00:00:14.710> the<00:00:14.740> throttle<00:00:15.129> the<00:00:16.110> electricity

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.110 
you release the throttle the electricity

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.249 
you release the throttle the electricity
will<00:00:17.369> come<00:00:18.369> back<00:00:18.670> just<00:00:19.180> show<00:00:19.480> please

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:20.259 
will come back just show please

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:22.320 
will come back just show please
well<00:00:20.770> it's<00:00:21.040> there's<00:00:21.430> nothing<00:00:21.580> sure<00:00:22.090> really

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:22.330 
well it's there's nothing sure really

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.310 
well it's there's nothing sure really
here<00:00:23.170> see<00:00:23.500> the<00:00:24.490> capacitors<00:00:25.029> here<00:00:25.240> this<00:00:26.050> -

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
here see the capacitors here this -

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.189 
here see the capacitors here this -
uh-huh<00:00:26.830> I<00:00:27.160> put<00:00:27.910> another<00:00:28.119> two<00:00:28.420> here<00:00:28.720> in<00:00:28.810> serious

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199 
uh-huh I put another two here in serious

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.700 
uh-huh I put another two here in serious
one<00:00:30.010> and<00:00:30.039> two<00:00:30.340> here<00:00:30.580> yeah<00:00:31.060> right<00:00:31.630> so<00:00:32.349> that<00:00:32.529> way

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
one and two here yeah right so that way

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.570 
one and two here yeah right so that way
there<00:00:32.949> is<00:00:33.040> a<00:00:33.070> little<00:00:33.460> bit<00:00:33.640> more<00:00:34.230> capacity<00:00:35.580> tank

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:36.580 
there is a little bit more capacity tank

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.189 
there is a little bit more capacity tank
already<00:00:36.730> shut<00:00:37.210> up<00:00:37.449> when<00:00:37.660> you're<00:00:37.809> shutting

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:38.199 
already shut up when you're shutting

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:39.960 
already shut up when you're shutting
down<00:00:38.350> the<00:00:38.590> throttle<00:00:39.280> when<00:00:39.460> you<00:00:39.610> release<00:00:39.940> the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
down the throttle when you release the

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.820 
down the throttle when you release the
electricity's<00:00:40.750> got<00:00:40.930> to<00:00:41.050> go<00:00:41.140> somewhere<00:00:41.440> yeah

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 
electricity's got to go somewhere yeah

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.950 
electricity's got to go somewhere yeah
it<00:00:42.100> comes<00:00:42.370> back<00:00:42.699> right<00:00:43.059> from<00:00:43.600> the<00:00:43.750> motor

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
it comes back right from the motor

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.110 
it comes back right from the motor
because<00:00:44.199> the<00:00:44.409> motor<00:00:44.620> is<00:00:44.710> a<00:00:44.799> dynamo<00:00:45.309> right<00:00:45.549> so

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
because the motor is a dynamo right so

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.180 
because the motor is a dynamo right so
it's<00:00:46.269> turning<00:00:46.629> yeah<00:00:47.110> and<00:00:47.320> when<00:00:47.799> you<00:00:47.830> release

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
it's turning yeah and when you release

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.130 
it's turning yeah and when you release
the<00:00:48.220> trouble<00:00:48.729> you<00:00:48.879> listen<00:00:49.210> you<00:00:49.510> you<00:00:49.839> remove

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
the trouble you listen you you remove

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.530 
the trouble you listen you you remove
electricity<00:00:50.769> the<00:00:51.370> motor<00:00:51.850> will<00:00:52.120> create<00:00:52.449> a

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
electricity the motor will create a

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.719 
electricity the motor will create a
little<00:00:52.780> ease<00:00:53.140> that<00:00:53.350> comes<00:00:53.650> back<00:00:53.920> to<00:00:53.979> the<00:00:54.369> to

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:54.729 
little ease that comes back to the to

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:56.399 
little ease that comes back to the to
the<00:00:54.850> speed<00:00:55.059> controller<00:00:55.479> and<00:00:55.750> that's<00:00:56.199> what

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:56.409 
the speed controller and that's what

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:58.859 
the speed controller and that's what
those<00:00:56.619> capacitors<00:00:57.250> are<00:00:57.460> there<00:00:57.640> for<00:00:57.940> to<00:00:58.390> absorb

00:00:58.859 --> 00:00:58.869 
those capacitors are there for to absorb

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:01.439 
those capacitors are there for to absorb
that<00:00:59.110> but<00:01:00.010> if<00:01:00.129> you're<00:01:00.339> running<00:01:00.519> too<00:01:01.180> much

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
that but if you're running too much

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.960 
that but if you're running too much
power<00:01:01.839> and<00:01:02.199> you<00:01:02.260> know<00:01:02.710> like<00:01:02.949> or<00:01:03.190> you're<00:01:03.670> doing

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
power and you know like or you're doing

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.780 
power and you know like or you're doing
that<00:01:04.150> back<00:01:04.989> and<00:01:05.170> forth<00:01:05.260> too<00:01:05.560> much<00:01:05.740> the<00:01:06.580> power

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
that back and forth too much the power

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.539 
that back and forth too much the power
will<00:01:07.030> be<00:01:07.119> more<00:01:07.360> than<00:01:07.510> the<00:01:07.720> capacitors<00:01:08.290> are

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
will be more than the capacitors are

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.490 
will be more than the capacitors are
able<00:01:09.549> to<00:01:09.760> people<00:01:10.210> yeah<00:01:10.840> so<00:01:11.080> you<00:01:11.140> put<00:01:11.229> in

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
able to people yeah so you put in

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.790 
able to people yeah so you put in
serious<00:01:11.890> more<00:01:15.870> that<00:01:16.870> all<00:01:17.050> it<00:01:17.200> was<00:01:17.350> out<00:01:17.620> here

it's actually like less than a month old
fish<00:01:38.590> on<00:01:38.830> older<00:01:39.300> fish<00:01:40.300> on<00:01:40.450> older<00:01:40.750> that<00:01:41.320> one<00:01:41.530> is

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
fish on older fish on older that one is

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.320 
fish on older fish on older that one is
old<00:01:41.890> that's<00:01:42.100> why<00:01:42.280> that's<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:42.820> one<00:01:43.030> I<00:01:43.060> got

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
old that's why that's the one I got

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.160 
old that's why that's the one I got
first<00:01:43.630> bike<00:01:44.440> and<00:01:45.010> value<00:01:45.460> by<00:01:46.120> then<00:01:46.900> I<00:01:46.930> thought

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
first bike and value by then I thought

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.170 
first bike and value by then I thought
that<00:01:47.200> because<00:01:47.890> I<00:01:48.040> liked<00:01:48.280> it<00:01:48.610> like<00:01:48.790> the<00:01:48.909> way<00:01:49.060> it

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
that because I liked it like the way it

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.649 
that because I liked it like the way it
looks

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.870 

yeah<00:01:55.659> to<00:01:55.900> fill<00:01:56.140> it<00:01:56.290> up<00:01:56.550> that's<00:01:57.960> really<00:01:59.880> okay

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
yeah to fill it up that's really okay

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.910 
yeah to fill it up that's really okay
but<00:02:01.150> next<00:02:01.420> time<00:02:01.840> probably<00:02:02.380> I<00:02:02.409> will<00:02:02.500> bring

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
but next time probably I will bring

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.060 
but next time probably I will bring
alekhya<00:02:03.159> is<00:02:03.610> it<00:02:03.760> solar<00:02:04.330> batteries<00:02:05.020> and<00:02:05.290> we

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
alekhya is it solar batteries and we

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.570 
alekhya is it solar batteries and we
will<00:02:06.250> charge<00:02:06.640> by<00:02:07.030> nature<00:02:07.990> by<00:02:08.289> by<00:02:08.739> solar<00:02:09.039> energy

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
will charge by nature by by solar energy
