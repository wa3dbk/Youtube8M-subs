00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
this this is the actual gate I chewed it

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.680 
this this is the actual gate I chewed it
up<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.119> little<00:01:48.300> bit<00:01:48.479> but<00:01:48.690> it<00:01:48.840> used<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.080> be<00:01:49.229> square

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
up a little bit but it used to be square

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.830 
up a little bit but it used to be square
the<00:01:51.690> key<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.080> to<00:01:52.229> get<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.619> round<00:01:52.979> but<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:54.030> drilled

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
the key is to get it round but I drilled

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.300 
the key is to get it round but I drilled
it<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.050> drilled<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.530> drilled<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.130> it's

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
it and drilled it and drilled it so it's

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.639 
it and drilled it and drilled it so it's
not<00:01:56.429> round<00:01:56.670> anymore<00:01:57.030> but<00:01:57.450> you'll<00:01:58.110> never<00:01:58.289> see

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
not round anymore but you'll never see

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.249 
not round anymore but you'll never see
it<00:01:58.679> and<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.099> does<00:01:59.310> what<00:01:59.490> needs<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.880> do<00:02:00.259> so

these black things in a place and then
the<00:03:21.190> actual<00:03:21.370> screws<00:03:21.910> when<00:03:22.180> you<00:03:22.270> stick<00:03:22.480> the

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
the actual screws when you stick the

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.810 
the actual screws when you stick the
screws<00:03:22.900> through<00:03:23.280> that<00:03:24.280> holds<00:03:24.580> the<00:03:24.670> other

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
screws through that holds the other

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.500 
screws through that holds the other
sides<00:03:25.350> if<00:03:26.350> you<00:03:26.500> look<00:03:26.680> there's<00:03:27.010> one<00:03:27.970> there<00:03:28.240> one

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
sides if you look there's one there one

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.510 
sides if you look there's one there one
there<00:03:28.540> one<00:03:28.810> there<00:03:29.140> one<00:03:29.380> there<00:03:29.650> and<00:03:30.100> then<00:03:30.370> these

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
there one there one there and then these

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.330 
there one there one there and then these
tabs<00:03:30.910> hope<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:32.050> other<00:03:32.230> side<00:03:34.350> so<00:03:35.350> just<00:03:35.650> cut<00:03:36.190> out

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
tabs hope the other side so just cut out

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.610 
tabs hope the other side so just cut out
the<00:03:36.490> middle<00:03:36.790> in<00:03:36.910> a<00:03:36.970> circle<00:03:37.420> what<00:03:37.960> I<00:03:37.990> used<00:03:38.380> was

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
the middle in a circle what I used was

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.510 
the middle in a circle what I used was
this<00:03:39.010> I<00:03:39.690> flipped<00:03:40.690> it<00:03:40.810> around<00:03:40.870> this<00:03:41.260> way<00:03:41.530> use

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
this I flipped it around this way use

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.320 
this I flipped it around this way use
this<00:03:43.200> drill<00:03:44.200> saw<00:03:44.530> it<00:03:45.520> was<00:03:45.640> kind<00:03:45.880> of<00:03:45.940> round<00:03:46.150> on

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
this drill saw it was kind of round on

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.890 
this drill saw it was kind of round on
that<00:03:46.540> in<00:03:46.750> but<00:03:46.990> then<00:03:47.110> it<00:03:47.260> started<00:03:47.350> slipping<00:03:47.980> and

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
that in but then it started slipping and

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.280 
that in but then it started slipping and
in<00:03:49.900> a<00:03:50.110> the<00:03:50.740> surface<00:03:51.190> I<00:03:51.310> didn't<00:03:51.550> have<00:03:51.990> the<00:03:52.990> drill

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
in a the surface I didn't have the drill

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.500 
in a the surface I didn't have the drill
right<00:03:53.590> but<00:03:53.950> even<00:03:54.700> if<00:03:54.820> you<00:03:54.940> want<00:03:55.120> you<00:03:55.240> can<00:03:55.330> maybe

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
right but even if you want you can maybe

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.270 
right but even if you want you can maybe
put<00:03:55.780> a<00:03:55.810> couple<00:03:56.050> of<00:03:56.170> screws<00:03:56.440> in<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.770> old<00:03:56.980> block

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
put a couple of screws in the old block

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.700 
put a couple of screws in the old block
of<00:03:57.310> wood<00:03:57.640> and<00:03:57.910> each<00:03:58.540> one<00:03:58.810> of<00:03:58.840> those<00:03:59.020> to<00:03:59.320> hold<00:03:59.530> it

00:03:59.700 --> 00:03:59.710 
of wood and each one of those to hold it

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.000 
of wood and each one of those to hold it
and<00:03:59.830> then<00:03:59.920> drill<00:04:00.880> through<00:04:01.240> I<00:04:01.680> mean<00:04:02.680> using<00:04:02.890> a

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
and then drill through I mean using a

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.590 
and then drill through I mean using a
razor<00:04:03.250> knife<00:04:03.370> to<00:04:03.700> cut<00:04:03.880> it<00:04:04.030> out<00:04:04.150> was<00:04:04.330> pretty

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
razor knife to cut it out was pretty

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.620 
razor knife to cut it out was pretty
hard<00:04:04.870> but<00:04:05.050> that's<00:04:05.230> how<00:04:05.410> you<00:04:05.470> do<00:04:05.680> it<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.970> then

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
hard but that's how you do it and then

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:13.220 
hard but that's how you do it and then
yeah

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.410 

put<00:04:14.230> her<00:04:14.320> back<00:04:14.530> together<00:04:17.880> wit<00:04:18.880> just<00:04:19.030> to<00:04:19.209> show

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
put her back together wit just to show

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:27.210 
put her back together wit just to show
you<00:04:20.610> instead<00:04:21.610> of<00:04:21.880> square<00:04:25.320> that's<00:04:26.320> complete

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
you instead of square that's complete

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.910 
you instead of square that's complete
circle<00:04:28.740> both<00:04:29.740> sides<00:04:31.290> free-flowing<00:04:32.290> new

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
circle both sides free-flowing new

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.790 
circle both sides free-flowing new
square<00:04:34.950> looks<00:04:35.950> like<00:04:36.370> on<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:36.610> inside<00:04:37.060> but

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
square looks like on the inside but

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.140 
square looks like on the inside but
what<00:04:38.800> she<00:04:38.950> wants<00:04:39.190> the<00:04:39.280> axial<00:04:39.640> movement<00:04:39.820> on

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
what she wants the axial movement on

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.030 
what she wants the axial movement on
your<00:04:40.300> joystick<00:04:42.030> hope<00:04:43.030> it<00:04:43.210> helped<00:04:44.040> cheaper

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
your joystick hope it helped cheaper

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.040 
your joystick hope it helped cheaper
than<00:04:45.130> buying<00:04:45.340> one<00:04:45.670> I<00:04:45.910> mean<00:04:46.420> you<00:04:46.660> can<00:04:46.780> never<00:04:46.960> go

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
than buying one I mean you can never go

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.260 
than buying one I mean you can never go
back<00:04:47.170> to<00:04:47.470> the<00:04:47.590> square<00:04:47.890> but<00:04:48.280> if<00:04:48.910> you<00:04:49.060> want<00:04:49.210> to

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
back to the square but if you want to

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.230 
back to the square but if you want to
circle<00:04:49.600> on<00:04:49.690> what's<00:04:49.930> the<00:04:50.050> sense<00:04:50.350> that

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
circle on what's the sense that

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.770 
circle on what's the sense that
concludes<00:04:52.240> my<00:04:52.330> video<00:04:52.570> thanks<00:04:53.260> hope<00:04:53.440> it<00:04:53.590> helped
