00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.200
 hello everyone today I shoot a video 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:07.340
 about your packages from the store 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.280
 online store 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:14.510
 pharmacy cosmetics the first thing I ordered 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:17.689
 it was a sunscreen for oily 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:21.519
 Uryash skin 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:24.859
 that's what it looks like spf30 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:27.229
 here is the description of this cream that she 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.869
 fast fast 

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:33.920
 absorbable as a low-fat multi 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:37.510
 which quickly intensely moisturizes 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.860
 Matte oily combination skin 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.760
 we hope that this means to me 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:47.350
 like unlike the means 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:51.620
 similar from the Vichy company 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.460
 has a pleasant smell so light 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.200
 texture 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.710
 the form of such a low-fat milk or lotion 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.350
 chicco 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.140
 I tried my hand at another person 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.009
 did not wear 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.009
 I 'll try to show you now 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:17.970
 In general, here is a means in principle 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:22.890
 it does not leave any fat film 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:26.880
 I still at the foreground at first glance 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:33.079
 liked this tool see what 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:36.390
 will come next that I ordered it 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.530
 such a tonic for oily problem 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:44.039
 skin 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:48.720
 oh from the company Aries and series wedges he 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:52.189
 goes to a powder such a little white smell 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.880
 he is also so nice enough 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.229
 I used similar tonics from 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:05.450
 firms 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:09.979
 clinic and reviews are cheap and syria is the same 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:14.250
 tea tree is not quite tonic 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:19.109
 arrange the next remedy again 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:22.010
 to use it in warm hot 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:25.430
 the weather is such a means this 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.440
 micellar water for all skin types 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.079
 including for sensitive skin from 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.329
 firms and Vichy 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:36.090
 It is suitable for removing makeup from the face and 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.109
 eye including for people who wear 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.720
 contact lenses 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:42.319
 she smells so nice too 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:48.260
 neutral enough 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:48.260
 Now anyone interested weighs description 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.420
 until I tried to take off their cosmetics 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:59.989
 but I think there shouldn't be something 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.730
 so negative because the firm 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:06.849
 I respect things in principle 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:08.019
 I like a lot of money from this 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.720
 of the company 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:14.420
 but to compare bioderma and I tried 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.780
 only green bioderma for oily skin 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:21.260
 so I probably will not compare 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:25.519
 it 's still different companies 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:28.010
 different compositions therefore someone like 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:30.280
 bioderma to someone else I decided 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.860
 try something new for yourself 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.519
 the following is I took this cream 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.630
 aqualia termal 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:40.940
 it is light moisturizer for greasy 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:47.209
 combined minimal kombi nervous 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:51.200
 skin it looks here and so I have 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:54.380
 a jar is not opened and while I have 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.150
 care products therefore wait when 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.459
 I will end at least one 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.639
 some face cream because 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:05.359
 even in the locker just a blockage 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:07.730
 but could not resist a discount of seven 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:10.940
 percent plus an extra I was 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:15.019
 discount and gift for the order so here 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:20.530
 I ordered this cream on trial I hope 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:27.320
 like it and what came as a gift 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:31.340
 The first thing I will show you is probes such 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.650
 sampler toothpastes atrox basically a 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.979
 Roksana toothpastes are very good 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:41.389
 even good there contains enzyme 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:43.249
 papain and bromelain what's different so 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:48.829
 let's say you can call 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:53.319
 of so let's say this from pineapple extract it 

00:04:48.829 --> 00:04:56.239
 cleans your teeth well here this yellowness 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:59.779
 the plaque removes therefore all dental pacter 

00:04:56.239 --> 00:05:02.299
 Roxana posts whiten my teeth well 

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:06.619
 really like it but that's exactly the caribbean 

00:05:02.299 --> 00:05:07.429
 summer is not my favorite pasta and I already 

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:10.069
 and tried 

00:05:07.429 --> 00:05:12.619
 I prefer the ripe pineapple it 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:16.699
 such a nice very unusual he 

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:20.709
 I like the taste so much that I 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:26.269
 came to the sampler samplers this from the firm 

00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:30.829
 jansen for dry skin moisturizing daytime 

00:05:26.269 --> 00:05:40.009
 cream with hyaluronic acid if i 

00:05:30.829 --> 00:05:44.929

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:48.379

00:05:44.929 --> 00:05:52.189
 water 50 milliliters from the company of Rosh 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:55.610
 pose I tried thermal water from 

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:57.579
 things and for the story is not yet well, I think 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.839
 that it doesn't differ much from us 

00:05:57.579 --> 00:06:02.809
 sprayer I tried wonderful 

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:07.549
 working meth as a dispersed spray 

00:06:02.809 --> 00:06:11.479
