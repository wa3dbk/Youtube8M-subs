00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 Hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.370
 Today I want to give them the media 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.540
 biggest news in the new internet 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.540
 introduce explorer 10 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.980
 the main difference is that 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:24.539
 it is now two built-in version from e10 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:27.930
 gives once as app or in the 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.429
 classic desktop version we start 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.920
 with the classic desktop version 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.579
 In principle this is the still relatively 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.540
 similar if you are now 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.940
 for example, in the internet options 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.760
 so you can find a new one here 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.590
 Entry at the start here you can select 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.480
 whether you are with the selected home page 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.360
 want to start or with a 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.039
 tab of the last session of the 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.250
 others can be found, for example, and 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.300
 Data protection on a new option 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.579
 for example, the 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.410
 possibility of position request from 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.309
 to block corresponding websites 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.199
 that also means that 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.360
 For example, websites like google maps 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.780
 do not automatically know where they are 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.780
 are located 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:16.290
 the app version of the internet explorer 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.700
 is in the completely new way they have 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.320
 here basically the whole 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.460
 screen for navigation in the 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.340
 internet available 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.650
 only with a right-click open 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.060
 the other possibilities in the 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.549
 bottom bar they have about one 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.909
 address bar as well as frequently used 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:36.060
 websites and perform as well 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.369
 possibilities to navigate back or 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.740
 Navigate the page again forward 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.259
 to load 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.060
 the website either at the start menu 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.509
 to pin or to the favorites 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.360
 add or wisely on this 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:55.070
 search something or in the desktop 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.070
 display version of the IE10 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.030
 in the upper bar you have 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.750
 possibilities to the different tabs too 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.299
 manage 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.590
 currently only one is open with one 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.710
 I can click on a new one 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:11.539
 tab raffl and example 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.539
 on google.de to amend 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.150

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.290
 There are more in the three points 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.909
 register km tools so i can 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.409
 for example, a new inprivate 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:29.409
 open the tab 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:32.319
 that means that from navigation in 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:34.989
 this website no record on 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.579
