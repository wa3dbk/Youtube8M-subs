00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:04.300
 one of the strongest comedies 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.050
 this is the favorite material of modern 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.880
 interior designers 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.390
 as a building material he 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.250
 durable or ganchine and steadily acid 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.250
 rains 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:20.889
 granite wildfire is located on 

00:00:20.889 --> 00:00:22.919
 several kilometers deep 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:25.029
 famous magna rock formation under 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.379
 pressure rises through 

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:28.179
 cracks and cracks in the earth's crust 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:29.989
 america in as she rises she 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:30.899
 rips off 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:33.899
 and turns into faces 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.920
 basically border or g 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.560
 water sedimentary rocks which 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.740
 make up most of the earth 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.740
 surface 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.530
 To begin, choose a part of granite stele 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.660
 30 meters long and 7 meters wide 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.370
 then burning with a gas torch 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.190
 long narrow grooves to delineate 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.640
 side around the perimeter of the cup are fighting 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.640
 holes depth and up to 7 meters 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.670
 where to put explosives 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.350
 blast freeing rock 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.170
 with the help of the drills that she was cut down money 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.670
 three granite blocks 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.280
 one and a half meters 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.610
 since size is optimal for 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.610
 most granite latitudes 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.780
 although the blocks seem small each 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.780
 weigh at least twenty tons 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.550
 The first stage of work in the factory sharply blocks 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.079
 for cutting pieces thicker than five 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.219
 centimeters use it 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:11.139
 working surface of the body and consists of 

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:12.919
 metal segment particles 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:14.489
 artificial diamonds that allows 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.809
 Reach the right trainer for cutting 

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:18.749
 water not allowing surfaces 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:19.789
 overheated 

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:21.889
 this is a very slow sawing process 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:23.889
 permits less than two square meters 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:27.169
 breeds per hour 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:28.679
 for cutting pieces longer than five 

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:30.089
 centimeters use it 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:32.059
 state of the blade durable enough 

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:33.919
 so as not to make it through the process of tails 

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:36.089
 thin enough to go as you can 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:37.399
 more precisely 

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:39.879
 this case cuts 8 square meters 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.859
 commercial in sections of block 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:44.859
 requiring up to 3 rubles 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:00.260
 as soon as the unit is discharged plate and how 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.529
 will affect the grinding 

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:05.529
 this process brings out the beauty of Ukraine 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.219
 19 heads for each of them 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:13.219
 which are 9 abrasive alimony 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.729
 The author found includes a square meter 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:20.229
 screens per minute 

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:22.269
 for maximum flash drive unit passes 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.189
 through the gap ethnocide heads a for 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:27.189
 average only through the first 10 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.139
 and if you need a coffin polishing finish 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:40.729
 replaces shock 

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:42.329
 the surface of the people are processed 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.179
 flame gas burners and 

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:46.129
 at the same time watered 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:49.129
 avoid cracks 

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:57.949
 now heat up 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:00.139
 examining a blasting check and 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:01.759
 becomes rough 

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:03.319
 such granite is used when 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.319
 making a few more floors 

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:11.829
 after trim and plaid shape attached 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.829
 depending on the destination 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.629
 granite substances 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:35.419
 give it a presentation and well-known 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.780
 strength why granite will always be 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.860
 the embodiment of style and durability
