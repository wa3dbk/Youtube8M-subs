00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
button on the back you've got the three

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.380 
button on the back you've got the three
Triple<00:00:53.309> A<00:00:53.399> batteries<00:00:53.430> which<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.180> where<00:00:54.300> you

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
Triple A batteries which is where you

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.540 
Triple A batteries which is where you
can<00:00:54.510> run<00:00:54.629> most<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.110> USB<00:00:55.440> devices<00:00:55.649> on<00:00:55.860> but

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
can run most of the USB devices on but

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.240 
can run most of the USB devices on but
one<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.879> drawbacks<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.320> some<00:00:59.219> of

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
one of the drawbacks is is that some of

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.770 
one of the drawbacks is is that some of
the<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.640> doesn't<00:00:59.850> say<00:01:00.120> which<00:01:00.239> ones<00:01:00.480> but<00:01:00.629> you

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
the it doesn't say which ones but you

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.450 
the it doesn't say which ones but you
know<00:01:00.899> some<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.289> USB<00:01:01.770> devices<00:01:02.100> require

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
know some of you USB devices require

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.410 
know some of you USB devices require
more<00:01:02.730> than<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.969> average<00:01:03.210> bus<00:01:03.470> power<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:04.920> you

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
more than the average bus power so you

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.060 
more than the average bus power so you
have<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.510> use<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.750> AC<00:01:06.930> adapter<00:01:07.409> which<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.740> here

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
have to use the AC adapter which is here

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.770 
have to use the AC adapter which is here
which<00:01:08.310> sort<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.610> defies<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:08.939> point<00:01:09.299> if<00:01:09.510> it's

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
which sort of defies the point if it's

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.260 
which sort of defies the point if it's
portable<00:01:11.000> but<00:01:12.000> anyway<00:01:12.240> moving<00:01:12.360> on<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:14.270> it

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
portable but anyway moving on so it

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.580 
portable but anyway moving on so it
might<00:01:15.390> be<00:01:15.450> useful<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.840> few<00:01:16.049> let's<00:01:16.259> say<00:01:16.409> you're

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
might be useful a few let's say you're

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.929 
might be useful a few let's say you're
taking<00:01:16.830> photos<00:01:17.009> on<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.220> go<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.700> want<00:01:17.850> to

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
taking photos on the go and you want to

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.219 
taking photos on the go and you want to
give<00:01:18.270> them<00:01:18.330> somebody<00:01:18.689> without<00:01:18.930> having<00:01:19.170> a

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
give them somebody without having a

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.490 
give them somebody without having a
computer<00:01:19.470> on<00:01:19.680> them<00:01:20.090> personally<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.450> think<00:01:21.600> it

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
computer on them personally I think it

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.990 
computer on them personally I think it
has<00:01:22.650> too<00:01:22.830> many<00:01:22.890> limitations<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.580> be<00:01:23.640> properly

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
has too many limitations to be properly

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.420 
has too many limitations to be properly
useful<00:01:24.500> but<00:01:25.500> I'll<00:01:25.590> show<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.830> quickly<00:01:25.950> how<00:01:26.189> it

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
useful but I'll show you quickly how it

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
useful but I'll show you quickly how it
works<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.939> what<00:01:27.750> we<00:01:27.780> can<00:01:27.990> do<00:01:28.080> with<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:32.450> and

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
works and what we can do with it and

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.050 
works and what we can do with it and
take<00:01:33.659> out<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.530> SD<00:01:35.070> card<00:01:35.310> it's<00:01:35.430> one<00:01:35.640> gigabyte

of<00:01:54.720> copy<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.140> want<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.320> do<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.530> want<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.680> cover

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
of copy you want to do you want to cover

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.340 
of copy you want to do you want to cover
the<00:01:55.979> full<00:01:56.250> source<00:01:56.790> onto<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.810> target<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.259> join

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
the full source onto the target and join

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.380 
the full source onto the target and join
it<00:01:58.469> just<00:01:58.649> copy<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.890> root<00:01:59.040> directory<00:01:59.360> which<00:02:00.360> is

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
it just copy the root directory which is

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.670 
it just copy the root directory which is
another<00:02:00.600> thing<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.869> can't<00:02:01.170> choose<00:02:01.469> which

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
another thing you can't choose which

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.580 
another thing you can't choose which
fast<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.070> do<00:02:02.270> access<00:02:03.270> notes<00:02:03.479> or<00:02:03.570> display<00:02:03.899> but

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
fast to do access notes or display but

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.910 
fast to do access notes or display but
anyway<00:02:04.829> we'll<00:02:05.310> just<00:02:05.490> copy<00:02:06.469> the<00:02:07.469> full<00:02:07.710> we'll

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
anyway we'll just copy the full we'll

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.830 
anyway we'll just copy the full we'll
have<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.160> cover<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.429> folder<00:02:08.729> cuz<00:02:08.910> photos<00:02:09.720> are

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
have to cover the folder cuz photos are

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
have to cover the folder cuz photos are
saved<00:02:10.050> inside<00:02:10.200> folders

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
saved inside folders

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.559 
saved inside folders
sauce<00:02:11.370> goes<00:02:11.610> in<00:02:11.819> ways<00:02:11.970> connected<00:02:12.390> there's<00:02:12.510> a

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
sauce goes in ways connected there's a

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.150 
sauce goes in ways connected there's a
blue<00:02:12.780> LED<00:02:12.989> here

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
blue LED here

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.160 
blue LED here
and<00:02:14.460> also<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.760> red<00:02:15.030> one<00:02:15.210> here<00:02:15.420> just<00:02:15.660> on<00:02:16.110> the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
and also a red one here just on the

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:25.460 
and also a red one here just on the
actual<00:02:16.410> device<00:02:16.500> itself<00:02:16.620> oh<00:02:24.080> right<00:02:25.080> okay<00:02:25.410> so

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
actual device itself oh right okay so

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.530 
actual device itself oh right okay so
now<00:02:25.770> we<00:02:25.830> get<00:02:26.070> my<00:02:26.250> 8<00:02:26.490> gig<00:02:26.760> memory<00:02:26.970> stick<00:02:27.330> here

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
now we get my 8 gig memory stick here

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.140 
now we get my 8 gig memory stick here
and<00:02:27.720> stick<00:02:28.380> this<00:02:28.500> into<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:29.100> target<00:02:29.610> section

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
and stick this into the target section

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.190 
and stick this into the target section
cuz<00:02:30.270> that's<00:02:30.390> what<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.540> want<00:02:30.750> everything<00:02:30.960> to<00:02:31.080> go

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
cuz that's what I want everything to go

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.170 
cuz that's what I want everything to go
on<00:02:31.320> at<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.280> moment<00:02:32.550> there's<00:02:32.670> nothing<00:02:32.880> on<00:02:33.000> here

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
on at the moment there's nothing on here

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.380 
on at the moment there's nothing on here
to<00:02:33.510> do<00:02:33.750> is<00:02:33.870> ID<00:02:33.990> photos<00:02:34.440> so<00:02:35.060> stick<00:02:36.060> that<00:02:36.180> into

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
to do is ID photos so stick that into

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.710 
to do is ID photos so stick that into
the<00:02:36.570> target

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
the target

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.330 
the target
there<00:02:39.720> we<00:02:39.780> go<00:02:39.900> that's<00:02:40.080> lit<00:02:40.350> up<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:41.190> blue

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
there we go that's lit up and the blue

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.920 
there we go that's lit up and the blue
one<00:02:41.520> right<00:02:41.910> so<00:02:42.120> it's<00:02:42.240> all<00:02:42.360> ready<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.630> go<00:02:42.750> you

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
one right so it's all ready to go you

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.800 
one right so it's all ready to go you
got<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:44.670> tick<00:02:44.910> is<00:02:45.090> lighting<00:02:45.540> blue<00:02:45.750> to

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
got the the tick is lighting blue to

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.470 
got the the tick is lighting blue to
show<00:02:46.020> it's<00:02:46.170> ready<00:02:46.320> so<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.590> can<00:02:46.740> just<00:02:46.830> press<00:02:47.040> copy

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
show it's ready so I can just press copy

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.240 
show it's ready so I can just press copy
and<00:02:48.480> now<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:49.200> will<00:02:49.350> see<00:02:49.470> alternate<00:02:49.860> lights

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
and now you will see alternate lights

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.680 
and now you will see alternate lights
there<00:02:50.520> so<00:02:50.670> it's<00:02:50.790> actually<00:02:50.880> doing<00:02:51.240> the<00:02:51.330> process

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
there so it's actually doing the process

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.060 
there so it's actually doing the process
so<00:02:52.140> you're<00:02:52.260> transferring<00:02:52.530> everything<00:02:52.950> off

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
so you're transferring everything off

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.220 
so you're transferring everything off
here<00:02:53.280> which<00:02:53.490> I<00:02:53.640> comes<00:02:54.150> dami<00:02:54.390> photos<00:02:54.810> and

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
here which I comes dami photos and

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.690 
here which I comes dami photos and
everything<00:02:55.620> onto<00:02:55.740> here<00:02:55.860> when<00:02:56.070> it's<00:02:56.190> done<00:02:56.370> that

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
everything onto here when it's done that

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.410 
everything onto here when it's done that
should<00:02:56.880> light<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.090> green<00:02:57.240> they're<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:59.420> very

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
should light a green they're a very

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.950 
should light a green they're a very
simple<00:03:00.960> process<00:03:01.110> it's<00:03:01.560> not<00:03:01.710> hard<00:03:01.920> at<00:03:02.100> all<00:03:04.850> in

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
simple process it's not hard at all in

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.360 
simple process it's not hard at all in
ways<00:03:06.960> it's<00:03:07.440> easier<00:03:07.740> than<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:08.010> is<00:03:08.130> on<00:03:08.160> the

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
ways it's easier than it is on the

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.100 
ways it's easier than it is on the
computer<00:03:08.640> because<00:03:08.850> you<00:03:09.030> don't<00:03:09.210> have<00:03:09.360> to<00:03:09.540> drag

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
computer because you don't have to drag

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.470 
computer because you don't have to drag
and<00:03:10.290> drop<00:03:10.320> files<00:03:11.070> for<00:03:11.760> them<00:03:11.880> as<00:03:12.030> this<00:03:12.180> is<00:03:12.330> more

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
and drop files for them as this is more

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.000 
and drop files for them as this is more
prone<00:03:12.660> to<00:03:12.780> error<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.170> I<00:03:13.410> have<00:03:13.590> at<00:03:13.710> it<00:03:13.830> doing

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
prone to error and I have at it doing

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.140 
prone to error and I have at it doing
this<00:03:14.100> for<00:03:14.280> like<00:03:14.370> 10<00:03:14.580> minutes<00:03:14.850> when<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.030> should

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
this for like 10 minutes when you should

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.960 
this for like 10 minutes when you should
take<00:03:15.300> 30<00:03:15.540> seconds<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.580> then<00:03:17.580> I've<00:03:17.700> had<00:03:17.730> to

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
take 30 seconds and then I've had to

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.210 
take 30 seconds and then I've had to
press<00:03:18.120> reset<00:03:18.450> so<00:03:19.350> let's<00:03:20.130> see<00:03:20.310> how<00:03:20.700> it<00:03:20.820> goes

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
press reset so let's see how it goes

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.680 
press reset so let's see how it goes
now<00:03:23.220> here<00:03:23.580> we<00:03:23.640> go<00:03:23.970> this<00:03:24.150> is<00:03:24.240> what<00:03:24.360> happens<00:03:24.600> when

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
now here we go this is what happens when

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.090 
now here we go this is what happens when
you<00:03:24.780> have<00:03:24.900> an<00:03:24.960> error<00:03:25.110> red<00:03:25.560> light<00:03:25.740> comes<00:03:25.950> up

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
you have an error red light comes up

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.160 
you have an error red light comes up
here<00:03:26.250> you<00:03:27.030> can<00:03:27.180> probably<00:03:27.630> just<00:03:27.870> make<00:03:27.990> it<00:03:28.080> out

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
here you can probably just make it out

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.720 
here you can probably just make it out
of<00:03:28.200> video<00:03:28.470> that<00:03:28.980> means<00:03:29.070> there<00:03:29.310> has<00:03:29.400> happened

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
of video that means there has happened

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.520 
of video that means there has happened
and<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.480> problem<00:03:30.720> is<00:03:30.810> you<00:03:30.930> don't<00:03:31.020> know<00:03:31.200> what's

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
and the problem is you don't know what's

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.340 
and the problem is you don't know what's
wrong<00:03:31.890> you<00:03:31.950> don't<00:03:32.400> know<00:03:32.610> how<00:03:32.900> if<00:03:33.900> any<00:03:34.110> files

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
wrong you don't know how if any files

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.870 
wrong you don't know how if any files
have<00:03:34.590> been<00:03:34.740> transferred<00:03:35.130> or<00:03:35.340> anything<00:03:35.490> it's

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
just see if that's a problem it has

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.730 
just see if that's a problem it has
worked<00:03:51.120> for<00:03:51.360> me<00:03:51.420> before<00:03:51.540> I've<00:03:52.110> tried<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:52.590> and

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
worked for me before I've tried it and

00:03:52.740 --> 00:04:06.890 
worked for me before I've tried it and
it's<00:03:52.920> worked<00:03:58.250> but<00:04:00.980> one<00:04:04.640> take<00:04:05.640> let's<00:04:06.630> just<00:04:06.780> try

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
it's worked but one take let's just try

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:16.620 
it's worked but one take let's just try
once<00:04:07.170> more<00:04:10.580> ready<00:04:11.580> and<00:04:11.990> copy

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.130 

so<00:04:17.590> it<00:04:17.800> really<00:04:18.220> is<00:04:18.400> that<00:04:18.700> simple<00:04:19.060> process<00:04:19.870> to

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
so it really is that simple process to

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.180 
so it really is that simple process to
use<00:04:21.010> the<00:04:21.190> Belkin<00:04:21.580> USB<00:04:22.000> anywhere

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
use the Belkin USB anywhere

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.740

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
but I've had too many errors to meet

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.500 
but I've had too many errors to meet
problems<00:04:26.200> working<00:04:26.760> just<00:04:27.760> it's<00:04:28.090> not<00:04:28.240> reliable

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
problems working just it's not reliable

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.450 
problems working just it's not reliable
enough<00:04:28.870> to<00:04:29.020> use<00:04:29.230> in<00:04:29.380> a<00:04:29.470> portable<00:04:29.920> like<00:04:30.130> feel

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
enough to use in a portable like feel

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.760 
enough to use in a portable like feel
environment<00:04:31.230> so<00:04:32.230> that's<00:04:32.350> the<00:04:32.410> Belkin<00:04:32.650> you
