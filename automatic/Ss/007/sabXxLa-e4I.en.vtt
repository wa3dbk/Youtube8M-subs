gotten hacked and then not gotten reset
but<00:01:12.840> i<00:01:12.869> don't<00:01:13.049> know<00:01:13.110> why<00:01:13.320> they<00:01:13.470> resent<00:01:13.860> me<00:01:13.920> I

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
but i don't know why they resent me I

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.080 
but i don't know why they resent me I
didn't<00:01:14.189> even<00:01:14.250> hack<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.580> on<00:01:14.640> purpose<00:01:14.880> but

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
didn't even hack it on purpose but

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.969 
didn't even hack it on purpose but
either<00:01:15.210> way<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.600> think<00:01:15.930> it's<00:01:16.320> going<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.500> be<00:01:16.680> I

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
either way I think it's going to be I

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.160 
either way I think it's going to be I
think<00:01:17.549> they<00:01:17.640> should<00:01:18.060> do<00:01:18.180> 15<00:01:18.600> because<00:01:18.780> someone

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
think they should do 15 because someone

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.450 
think they should do 15 because someone
actually<00:01:19.350> tweeted<00:01:19.860> out<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.159> one<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
actually tweeted out to one of the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.640 
actually tweeted out to one of the
bigwigs<00:01:21.060> over<00:01:21.810> it's<00:01:21.930> sledgehammer<00:01:22.170> whether

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
bigwigs over it's sledgehammer whether

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.859 
bigwigs over it's sledgehammer whether
they<00:01:22.830> should<00:01:22.860> have<00:01:23.130> 10<00:01:23.369> or<00:01:23.400> 15<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.090> they<00:01:24.479> and

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
they should have 10 or 15 and they and

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.330 
they should have 10 or 15 and they and
they<00:01:24.900> actually<00:01:25.080> respond<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.650> asking<00:01:26.070> people

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
they actually respond to asking people

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.859 
they actually respond to asking people
do<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.580> want<00:01:26.729> 10<00:01:26.909> or<00:01:27.000> 15<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.509> I<00:01:27.570> think<00:01:27.659> that's

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
do you want 10 or 15 so I think that's

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.300 
do you want 10 or 15 so I think that's
really<00:01:28.140> cool<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.470> sledgehammer<00:01:28.710> goes<00:01:29.100> out

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
really cool that sledgehammer goes out

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.740 
really cool that sledgehammer goes out
and<00:01:29.490> takes<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.060> time<00:01:30.240> out<00:01:30.270> of<00:01:30.420> their<00:01:30.570> way<00:01:30.720> to

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
and takes the time out of their way to

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.940 
and takes the time out of their way to
be<00:01:30.990> like<00:01:31.140> well<00:01:31.350> we<00:01:31.530> haven't<00:01:31.680> actually
