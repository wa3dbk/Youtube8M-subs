00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.170
 What would you say if you were 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.019
 walking down the street found a person 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:15.230
 that you really believe that you want to 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:18.380
 convince that two plus two is not 4 is 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.250
 rather what the white color is not white is 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.380
 black and that black is not black on white 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.779
 What would you say about that person? 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.230
 Maybe you would call it crazy where 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.960
 crazy or weird maybe they out of the house 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.540
 in this person but this one I tried 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.510
 convince you already believed lies 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.520
 much larger than these very 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.880
 more contradictory than this 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.500
 let me give you an example let's look at one 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.739
 school environment 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.379
 usually the guy with no future the guy 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.450
 that the worst influence of all the guy 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.070
 who do not have the good grades actually he 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.590
 has the worst notes 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.170
 This is the most popular guy in school or 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.670
 the girl comments animals food that 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.939
 same that can not pass any 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.049
 proof of someone and only thinks of 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:10.219
 other boys makeup clothes 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:10.939
 usually this girl they all want 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:12.889
 to be 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.109
 but this is totally contradictory 

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:17.659
 because no one wants to be one without a future 

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:20.899
 nobody wants to be a food but everyone 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.959
 want to be these people let's look at the 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:26.090
 another example is a girl she will have 

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:27.829
 a party and she does not want to do anything 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.770
 Wrong she does not want to be with the girl. 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:33.349
 11 she never surrender to anyone but 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.289
 the friends begin to influence the talk 

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:39.469
 with her convince her to give herself to 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:43.759
 kiss someone to be with someone and there 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:46.279
 she yields to this influence 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.429
 after a short time something happens nothing 

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:51.969
 in this friendship and the influencers 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:55.520
 begin to criticize that which was 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:59.169
 influence begins to form this 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:02.630
 girl calling her easy to fudil 

00:01:59.169 --> 00:02:04.820
 telling everyone what she did and what 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.720
 spreading gossip 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:11.480
 of this person of this girl but peraÃ­ 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.510
 It was you who influenced it was you who 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.670
 told me she did all these things 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.060
 Who are you now to point the finger? 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.980
 so let's look at the example one 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.230
 boy goes to a party 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.630
 he arrives there if he intends to drink without 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.970
 intention to do nothing wrong but start 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.030
 listening to your friends after a lot of 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.510
 insistence he decides to let the baby stay 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.489
 close to employee he start doing 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.820
 shameful things 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:43.190
 those same friends who sent nbb that 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.440
 have influenced the baby they will be the 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.010
 first to get the iphone out of 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.930
 start filming so that the next day 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.630
 be a social network 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:58.660
 the same ones my friends who will command the 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.660
 bb are going to be the same ones that will make it 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:07.550
 a motive for other people and that the 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:09.170
 world uses what it offers to 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.019
 take it from the air 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:16.670
 what he says is so good 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:19.190
 he uses to shame the dish he 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:24.650
 puts it in front of you and says 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:26.989
 bring joy fulfillment fulfillment is 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.150
 this dish he uses for her to be 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:32.780
 sorrow of defeat sadness depression 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.329
 A few moments later he uses this 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.920
 dish to make new remorse 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:40.489
 Do you know I do not know how your heart is? 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:45.040

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:48.560
 by rejection of suicidal thoughts of 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.700
 contempt of loneliness and anguish of 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.069
 shame but I know one thing 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:58.099

00:03:55.069 --> 00:04:01.909

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:13.370

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:16.220

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.380
