away you can see here I've done a couple

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.450 
away you can see here I've done a couple
of<00:00:23.170> quick<00:00:23.410> angles<00:00:23.800> just<00:00:23.860> to<00:00:24.070> get<00:00:24.190> a<00:00:24.220> thing

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
of quick angles just to get a thing

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.210 
of quick angles just to get a thing
going<00:00:24.820> for<00:00:25.029> you<00:00:25.349> alright<00:00:26.349> so<00:00:26.560> now<00:00:26.740> what<00:00:27.070> I'm

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
going for you alright so now what I'm

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.290 
going for you alright so now what I'm
gonna<00:00:27.369> do<00:00:27.610> here<00:00:27.910> is<00:00:27.970> I'm<00:00:28.300> gonna<00:00:28.540> first<00:00:29.050> step<00:00:30.300> is

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
gonna do here is I'm gonna first step is

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.970 
gonna do here is I'm gonna first step is
angles<00:00:32.020> so<00:00:32.770> I'm<00:00:33.640> not<00:00:34.090> gonna<00:00:34.510> do<00:00:34.810> the<00:00:35.560> ovals

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
angles so I'm not gonna do the ovals

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.910 
angles so I'm not gonna do the ovals
first<00:00:36.340> first<00:00:36.790> I'm<00:00:37.000> just<00:00:37.300> simply<00:00:37.810> I'm<00:00:38.739> gonna

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
first first I'm just simply I'm gonna

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.220 
first first I'm just simply I'm gonna
come<00:00:39.190> on<00:00:39.370> down<00:00:39.610> and<00:00:39.970> I'm<00:00:40.150> gonna<00:00:40.329> pretend<00:00:40.870> as<00:00:41.200> if

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
come on down and I'm gonna pretend as if

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.040 
come on down and I'm gonna pretend as if
there's<00:00:41.740> a<00:00:41.830> ruler<00:00:42.400> on<00:00:42.610> the<00:00:42.720> side<00:00:43.720> of<00:00:43.750> the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
there's a ruler on the side of the

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.800 
there's a ruler on the side of the
models<00:00:44.440> head<00:00:44.680> and<00:00:44.920> I'm<00:00:45.610> gonna<00:00:45.820> get<00:00:46.180> the<00:00:46.420> angles

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:46.810 
models head and I'm gonna get the angles

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.070 
models head and I'm gonna get the angles
now<00:00:46.990> most<00:00:47.860> students<00:00:48.430> in<00:00:48.580> my<00:00:48.760> class<00:00:49.090> really<00:00:49.690> do

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.080 
now most students in my class really do

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.970 
now most students in my class really do
not<00:00:50.320> like<00:00:50.620> working<00:00:51.430> on<00:00:51.760> the<00:00:51.970> angles<00:00:52.980> they're

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
not like working on the angles they're

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.470 
not like working on the angles they're
really<00:00:54.460> important<00:00:55.000> that<00:00:55.300> you<00:00:55.540> master<00:00:56.230> it<00:00:57.480> it's

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
really important that you master it it's

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.810 
really important that you master it it's
the<00:00:58.780> students<00:00:59.320> who<00:00:59.470> don't<00:00:59.710> really<00:01:00.040> attempt<00:01:00.610> to

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
the students who don't really attempt to

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.510 
the students who don't really attempt to
master<00:01:01.030> it<00:01:01.300> never<00:01:01.900> get<00:01:02.170> proportions<00:01:02.740> right<00:01:02.830> so

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
master it never get proportions right so

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.490 
master it never get proportions right so
just<00:01:03.940> understand<00:01:04.479> that<00:01:04.629> that<00:01:04.780> yes<00:01:05.049> it<00:01:05.259> looks

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
just understand that that yes it looks

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.179 
just understand that that yes it looks
kind<00:01:05.950> of<00:01:06.040> stiff<00:01:06.340> and<00:01:07.299> it<00:01:07.450> looks<00:01:07.630> weird<00:01:08.189> but

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:09.189 
kind of stiff and it looks weird but

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:10.740 
kind of stiff and it looks weird but
it's<00:01:09.340> very<00:01:09.610> important<00:01:10.090> and<00:01:10.210> if<00:01:10.299> you<00:01:10.479> work

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
it's very important and if you work

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.590 
it's very important and if you work
light<00:01:11.049> to<00:01:11.290> dark<00:01:11.530> at<00:01:11.710> home<00:01:11.950> it's<00:01:12.549> gonna<00:01:12.850> be<00:01:13.150> you

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
light to dark at home it's gonna be you

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.239 
light to dark at home it's gonna be you
know<00:01:13.630> background<00:01:14.079> noise<00:01:14.590> and<00:01:14.859> then<00:01:14.950> you<00:01:14.979> work

00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:15.249 
know background noise and then you work

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:16.919 
know background noise and then you work
with<00:01:15.399> an<00:01:15.490> organic<00:01:15.880> line<00:01:16.060> on<00:01:16.179> top<00:01:16.390> of<00:01:16.509> it<00:01:16.600> so

00:01:16.919 --> 00:01:16.929 
with an organic line on top of it so

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:19.139 
with an organic line on top of it so
this<00:01:17.109> is<00:01:17.289> as<00:01:17.679> light<00:01:18.310> as<00:01:18.429> I<00:01:18.549> want<00:01:18.729> to<00:01:18.789> go<00:01:18.909> for

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
this is as light as I want to go for

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:20.489 
this is as light as I want to go for
this<00:01:19.270> DVD<00:01:19.539> I<00:01:19.689> don't<00:01:19.840> want<00:01:19.960> to<00:01:20.020> go<00:01:20.079> much<00:01:20.259> lighter

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:20.499 
this DVD I don't want to go much lighter

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:21.929 
this DVD I don't want to go much lighter
than<00:01:20.679> this<00:01:20.829> because<00:01:20.979> then<00:01:21.189> you're<00:01:21.670> not<00:01:21.789> going

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
than this because then you're not going

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:23.789 
than this because then you're not going
to<00:01:21.999> be<00:01:22.090> able<00:01:22.149> to<00:01:22.240> see<00:01:22.450> it<00:01:22.570> so<00:01:23.079> now<00:01:23.350> you<00:01:23.409> think

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
to be able to see it so now you think

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:26.880 
to be able to see it so now you think
about<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:25.030> formula<00:01:25.630> that<00:01:25.840> we<00:01:26.409> did<00:01:26.560> with<00:01:26.740> the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
about the formula that we did with the

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.160 
about the formula that we did with the
ovals<00:01:27.280> and<00:01:27.429> let's<00:01:28.179> go<00:01:28.359> back<00:01:28.390> to<00:01:28.749> what<00:01:28.869> I<00:01:28.899> talked

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
ovals and let's go back to what I talked

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.010 
ovals and let's go back to what I talked
about<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.560> ear<00:01:29.829> and<00:01:30.159> the<00:01:30.670> ear<00:01:30.700> on<00:01:31.270> this<00:01:31.569> let's

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
about the ear and the ear on this let's

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.109 
about the ear and the ear on this let's
let's<00:01:32.499> have<00:01:32.649> the<00:01:32.799> camera<00:01:33.159> pan<00:01:33.429> over<00:01:33.729> just<00:01:33.939> to

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
let's have the camera pan over just to

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:35.969 
let's have the camera pan over just to
the<00:01:34.210> photograph<00:01:34.600> for<00:01:34.780> a<00:01:34.840> second<00:01:35.289> what<00:01:35.829> I'm

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
the photograph for a second what I'm

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.889 
the photograph for a second what I'm
gonna<00:01:36.219> look<00:01:36.429> at<00:01:36.640> next<00:01:36.999> when<00:01:37.149> I<00:01:37.240> draw<00:01:37.509> this<00:01:37.689> is

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
gonna look at next when I draw this is

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:39.389 
gonna look at next when I draw this is
I'm<00:01:38.020> gonna<00:01:38.109> look<00:01:38.319> at<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.469> distance<00:01:38.859> from<00:01:38.920> here

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
I'm gonna look at the distance from here

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.429 
I'm gonna look at the distance from here
to<00:01:39.460> here<00:01:39.880> I'm<00:01:40.600> gonna<00:01:40.749> look<00:01:40.899> at<00:01:41.020> the<00:01:41.079> distance

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
to here I'm gonna look at the distance

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.309 
to here I'm gonna look at the distance
from<00:01:41.499> here<00:01:41.979> to<00:01:42.789> the<00:01:42.909> front<00:01:43.090> of<00:01:43.240> his<00:01:43.329> face<00:01:43.389> I'm

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319 
from here to the front of his face I'm

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:46.230 
from here to the front of his face I'm
gonna<00:01:44.530> pull<00:01:44.829> a<00:01:44.859> line<00:01:45.130> across<00:01:45.490> this<00:01:45.789> model's

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
gonna pull a line across this model's

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.319 
gonna pull a line across this model's
eyes<00:01:46.450> or<00:01:46.780> even<00:01:46.960> with<00:01:47.229> his<00:01:47.380> ear<00:01:48.219> this<00:01:48.819> model's

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
I'm gonna do interior angles for the

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:09.090 
I'm gonna do interior angles for the
shape<00:02:06.729> of<00:02:06.939> the<00:02:07.329> hair<00:02:07.569> now<00:02:08.140> when<00:02:08.590> I<00:02:08.619> do<00:02:08.770> these

shape of the hair now when I do these
interior<00:02:09.610> angles<00:02:09.940> on<00:02:10.060> my<00:02:10.179> drawing<00:02:10.509> and<00:02:11.069> I

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
interior angles on my drawing and I

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.730 
interior angles on my drawing and I
compare<00:02:12.790> them<00:02:13.090> to<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.510> models<00:02:13.930> hair<00:02:14.170> the

compare them to the models hair the
model<00:02:15.190> doesn't<00:02:15.610> have<00:02:15.819> like<00:02:16.300> a<00:02:16.330> definite<00:02:16.990> edge

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
model doesn't have like a definite edge

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.100 
model doesn't have like a definite edge
on<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:18.010> side<00:02:18.280> of<00:02:18.580> his<00:02:18.760> head<00:02:19.330> that<00:02:19.360> where<00:02:19.959> his

on the side of his head that where his
hair<00:02:20.349> meets

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
hair meets

I'm thinking about next I'm going to I'm

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.580 
I'm thinking about next I'm going to I'm
still<00:03:21.069> measuring<00:03:21.549> but<00:03:21.790> now<00:03:22.120> I'm<00:03:22.599> using<00:03:23.260> these

still measuring but now I'm using these

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.460 
still measuring but now I'm using these
measure<00:03:23.920> lines<00:03:24.569> this<00:03:25.569> is<00:03:25.780> really<00:03:26.169> tough

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470
