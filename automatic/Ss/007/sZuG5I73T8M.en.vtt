 make career for google video and at 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.000
 google a student imagine the new 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.010
 microsoft visual identity the ratio 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.900
 mac / pc reaches historical level 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.349
 hi to all and the precious days yes 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.349
 I am 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.370
 google just announced the end of google 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.960
 video the platform of claude and 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.180
 sharing video content that 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.190
 did not accept submission from 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.680
 2009 was clearly duplicated with 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.960
 youtube also owned by google 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.820
 if that end was planned that of 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.500
 google is however more surprising 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.360
 igoogle and the home page 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.220
 customizable from google she will you 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.900
 allows to add widgets for the 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.879
 weather news feeds from 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.890
 calendar and other various tools 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.410
 all accessible from your page 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.360
 igoogle's main focus was 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.430
 jumps competitor but like igoogle 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.020
 this one never really took off 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.489
 to the general public for all those 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.050
 who were addicted to their home page 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.239
 personalized igoogle 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.730
 you will still have until the 1st 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.110
 November 2013 to enjoy it date to 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.110
 which service will disappear 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.480
 his name is stamped but he is 21 years old and 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.040
 he is a student of design in dhr he 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.530
 just made a project rather 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.720
 original in three days the student has 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.060
 simply redefines the identity 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.490
 complete visual of microsoft an image 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.320
 modern and trendy which concerns the 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.230
 brand microsoft but also on facebook 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.210
 son andrew who makes you a finding 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.190
 simple microsoft products are 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.170
 outdated representing the world of 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.120
 the company which would be penalizing 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.890
 for the overall image of the brand and its 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.140
 more mainstream products like kinect 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.060
 his project is obviously not at all 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.310
 commissioned by microsoft it is rather a 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.110
 exercise of style but he managed to 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.970
 to talk about him in a few hours 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.570
 his work has thus toured the 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.130
 world 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.960
 the andrew kim project is therefore a 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.900
 interesting track to help microsoft 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.460
 to become again the cool company she 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.460
 was at least 15 years ago 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.380
 the mac vs. pc war has been raging ever since 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.970
 a long time but laura sion between 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.220
 pc sales and sales of mac 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.679
 today reaches a historic threshold 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.959
 while in 2004 it was sold 50 times 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.000
 more pc than mac the ratio fell 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.819
 today only fifteen times he 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.980
 is again equivalent to that of 1985 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.019
 date that marks the beginning of the long 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.489
 microsoft air career in the 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.810
 world of personal computers 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.130
 this figure is even more 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.599
 impressive that we know he 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.610
 there is only one manufacturer of snacks 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.890
 against tens producing 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.170
 pc the health of apple is looking good and 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.940
 despite higher prices than pc the 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.560
 macbook pro is one of the computers the 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.000
 more sold in the united states 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.319
 and as tablets are also 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.540
 considered computers 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.140
 in the statistics of 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.390
 sales 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.709
 the ipad's dominance only makes 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.380
 strengthen this trend 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.910
 it's over for today 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.620
 find tomorrow new background 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.250
 shares of the high tech planet 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.250
