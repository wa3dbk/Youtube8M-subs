00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:23.320
 as you can see the drink the title of 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.300
 how to get the contract for ten 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.619
 greater other times of contract that 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.510
 The finger came out because it had not come up 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.010
 but I will know how to do it good what 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.230
 what we do and I have it initial patrol 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.540
 in venus or they're going to go patrol 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.190
 Some of us here are going to give 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.019
 our vehicle and follow the path that 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.280
 it is very important practically a 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:40.720
 good output a very simple way in 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.670
 less than five minutes the contract me 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.799
 they will be finished so only 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.250
 they have to follow the path that I go to 

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:51.070
 give ok let's come by this shore 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.780
 and we're just going to do this here we come 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.060
 to this part of what are we going to do towards 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.000
 right this has practically 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.350
 taken to an area where many appear 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.510
 vex so much bar snipers 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.190
 yellow those are the biggest others 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.350
 Sometimes they come to be that the bar's 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.810
 would call also appear the normals and 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.890
 appear others that are equal about 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.810
 all that have yellow bar 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.160
 christian of the bucks practically us 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.780
 help for the contract so when 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.160
 we come to this area because we are going to 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.800
 complete in a very simple way ok 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.970
 let's see who arrived in this area and 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.830
 here we are practically going to find 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.040
 starting three and here we're going to see what 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.100
 they respond many times they appear more or 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.720
 active creamer can see 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.700
 we jump from this area to here and 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.060
 just here look here you can see 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.780
 there are two or that is that we are going to repeat 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.400
 block 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.860
 let's repeat but so much is so many 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.149
 Sometimes as we want we will simply see 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.149
 we shoot to see how we can here 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.730
 let's kill them and it's practically 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.040
 we will complete the contract in a very 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.890
 simple says fast key as you can see 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.810
 call you 2 now from this side of here 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.850
 here where we are in a mission there 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.580
 another many times there is another other ex 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.840
 yellow from premiered here the historic 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.880
 not red but here is the sea and hunger 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.880
 as you can see, here may be the yellow 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.760
 by killing this from here it will give us 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.660
 time for the one above is 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.760
 answer me because many times that 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.170
 they do not respond but good when doing this 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.550
 they will respond in the goal 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.620
 very careful not to die just someone 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.480
 very carefully that as you can see 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.980
 here by ensuring that rivas practically 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.990
 they will respond again the babies of 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.090
 here if we do not answer simply we 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.550
 we move a little away so they will appear 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.110
 although we do not know from this side of here and 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.240
 many times this will leave decks 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.950
 of those who are yellow but ok 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.360
 of the snipers here on this side 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.380
 look there is one of those but of the 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.970
 yellows what often appear 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.290
 yellows inhabit the reds 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.690
 we wait for the yellows to appear 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.220
 and if we go back to that millions already 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.960
 they will have to answer them to anyone in solar 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.390
 as you can see and well we're just going 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.220
 to see those gentlemen walk here to here 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.040
 but here in this area we will complete 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.810
 contract in a very simple way that 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.160
 is that not to a battle practically 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.390
 nothing 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.640
 ok as it has been said then we have to 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.080
 watch him die just let's see here 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.360
 for there and here as we can here 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.880
 I'm missing one if I 'm not mistaken 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.470
 says less than three minutes and how can 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.740
 see almost I already have the contract 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.450
 done and can see that already not complete 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.709
 It took me a long time so it's more 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.240
