00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:09.279
 welcome 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.279
 Welcome to the world of sweets 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.460
 good morning everyone in the video of 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.380
 today you will see in the background a beautiful with stretches 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.599
 which we had approximately makes a 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.119
 month if you've never seen like pegon gm 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.070
 you are going to be plaid and wanted 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.260
 take advantage to communicate some 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.660
 little things to start I have not been very 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.090
 active for a thousand things for today burdens 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.100
 studies for other personal things and 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.019
 Finally, the truth is that he was not 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.640
 very motivated at first to all the 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:46.500
 world we started with a lot of encouragement in 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.900
 youtube but there comes a time when 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.510
 you get discouraged is day and life had no 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.460
 very clear what content upload the certain 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.890
 is that I have very little time what 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.230
 could easily climb are coliseums and 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.600
 pvp is but there were people who considered 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.309
 this kind of easy videos and not 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.160
 I was very clear to what extent 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.570
 they liked that why I asked you 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.060
 directly and you have come to me to say 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.039
 that you prefer to see that kind of videos 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.320
 the guides and that the truth is that I 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:15.479
 I liked it enough I will not stop going up 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.090
 guides but now that I know if you like 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.850
 and I want to do more things in the channel 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.780
 to start do not have a single trio 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.440
 I want to have three triplets one of levels 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.780
 199 to 200 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.440
 there you know already go another level 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.050
 150 and finally a trio of more levels 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.090
 or less than level 60 80 although this 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.610
 It will take time and money but it is my 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.160
 objective and once you have all three in 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.960
 every video of the Coliseum that I will upload 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.480
 tell me in the comments what 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.430
 trio want to see in the next video well 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.230
 it will be you who will tell me what is 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.830
 what you really want to see what you 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.870
 It seems 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.270
 this time I ask you to write to me 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.400
 in the comments what trios would you like 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.620
 see play is to say that you tell me what 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.960
 races you want to see in action think that 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.850
 I'm going to put together two new tips and also 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.790
 of course arico and you with 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.130
 subscribers the problem is that now 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.350
 that I will record in the morning in Spain 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.500
 there are many people on but good we will see 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.850
 how do you arrange that the coliseums 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.280
 surely they live here because if 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.740
 what you ask me most and by the way 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.080
 I would love to play with a man so I do not 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.810
 I know if I can put something in some team 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.970
 I think I'll look more at those tips and 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.489
 well so so doing when they have 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.590
 more time this discouragement to climb 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.280
 videos was largely because the 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.590
 guides 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.110
 a lot but that a lot of work and effort 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.910
 and try so hard that I do not arrive 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.280
 to three thousand visits when the coliseums 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.230
 in three or four days they reach 4000 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.020
 easily because it frustrates a little 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.720
 I will also change my routine your life already 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.610
 minimum week one or two videos and 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.470
 talking about this there is a kind of videos 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.260
 new ones that I feel like climbing 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.720
 come on I want to create a section I know that 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.360
 This idea that I am going to propose to you is very 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.760
 female and I'm not sure if it's going to 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.410
 like and you are going to participate but since 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.300
 I really like it, because we are going to 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.950
 try the goal of this new 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.470
 section is about you sending me 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.390
 messages for other people and I follow 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.400
 here is like when someone sends a 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.380
 message another person could radio more or 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.110
 less you can send messages of all 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.360
 guy except affecting the respect this is 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.280
 obviously not me 7 although if you want 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.860
 send declarations of war always and 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.380
 when they are with a formal tone and nothing 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.959

 dear I do not know what message attentively x 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.520
 and although you run the risk of repeating 20 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.860
 millions of times the word message in 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.610
 this video also wanted to comment 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.590
 kenya official page the peach has 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.140
 deactivated private messages by 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.450
 several reasons to begin with came to me 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.310
 enough messages and it's complicated 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.830
 answer everyone and also 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:11.160
 many times how many do you answer 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.260
 late people get angry does not understand that 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.750
 It is very difficult to answer the whole world 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.780
 and on the second or send you 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:21.150
 and it's also that many of the questions 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.280
 that sends me vice for private buoys 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.170
 you make several people is to say equal 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.600
 front people have made me the same 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:30.120
 question and I find it absurd to answer 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.490
 20 times the same thing for that I prefer 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.200
 you send me the questions there are ask 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.390
 created because I know about the direction of 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.550
 to where he answered the questions there 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.650
 and when he answers those questions 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:43.620
 those answers come to my facebook 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.230
 peach alba and there's twitter and also 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.660
 there are 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.280
 or whatever I do not even know how it is 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.980
 the address right now I am a disaster 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:55.490
 and so when you answer a question to 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:57.650
 you can all see is that answer and I 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.810
 So it serves the same question for all 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.060
 and I think that if you have something that 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.710
 tell me what you want me to answer what 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.140
 it is better that you send me to my address 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.150
 of us and so I have a single site in the 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.970
 that I'm going to answer the messages and 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.620
 over public way well all the 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.630
 world you can know what I am 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.700
