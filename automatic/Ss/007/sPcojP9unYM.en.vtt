 three envelopes of primal duels 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.670
 tell you what they thought to do a little 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.949
 referring to the openings because pump 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.740
 those that you like I thought about doing 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.840
 every 50 likes open a new envelope is 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.689
 say that if this video will reach 300 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.050
 likes and would open in the next opening 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.480
 six pokemon envelopes so you know 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.940
 pop the like button if you want to see 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.530
 more pokemon openings and contrast mind 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.610
 I'm saving to have a 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.250
 booster box of 36 envelopes a booster box 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.020
 english in English of 36 envelopes of the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.690
 new collection will come out within 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.820
 a mesecito the collection of rolling 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.190
 skies I do not know exactly how the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.860
 Traditional Spanish would be the sky 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.660
 gold roar or something 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.450
 if you want to see an opening of an adjustment 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.580
 from 36 is that they cost 100 dollars 100 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.500
 euros 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.410
 I'm going to roll more I think we're going to 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.030
 start this opening if you have not seen 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.920
 the other pokemon openings that I've 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.080
 brought to the channel you know that always 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.729
 you will always have them in the 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.100
 description I leave the link to the list 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.950
 of reproduction and I do not roll up we're going to 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.790
 start with this mega opening that in 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.790
 true they are only 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.990
 three men but good we go there I have 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.750
 the little finger a bit crappy yet so 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.750
 all to cost this to open it 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:38.700
 we have the code here so that what 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:43.650
 want to use but here behind section 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.870
 we will do as 2 and 3 1 and 2 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.810
 If I want to be a lot when I do the cut 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.970
 ok I'm using a different camera 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.100
 Now I guess you will have noticed and 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.100
 the others I guess you noticed 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.650
 be camera a little different but good 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.270
 I'll try to make it look good you do not see all 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.500
 the whole letter but we are not interested 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.390
 either and you see the entire letter 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.390
 but this here to a hippopotamus 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.540
 everything is luxury 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.239
 all have gone to the cndh 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.430
 trap ings 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.430
 firmer 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:29.060
 went out or cinema or his paper continued 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.730
 rope life 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.060
 we are even more than time 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.239
 with a river card we have a bearded man who 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.940
 it's not weird in the normal letter here 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.760
 comes the super handsome rivers design and with 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.069
 weird face we have a beam a barrel no 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.240
 it's just not holographic 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:53.290
 we see the letters over here 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.290
 with the following on 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.740
 this is good about the ones I bought in 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.680
 my people precisely in a setting the 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.480
 goal that my people have that they say is 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.010
 that my people who precisely buy or 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.570
 be all the envelopes that are in that 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.010
 I like the box I bought them, I mean 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.629
 all those envelopes 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.650
 I've bought myself because it is the 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:17.560
 I have counted I do not have them counted 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.290
 it's a booster box and basically I 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.939
 agreement that is but we buy all of 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.400
 the letters of salt busteros little to 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:27.459
 little bit and in that in that box they have already 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.980
 touched 12 x is worth 12 x have touched me in 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.069
 that box is not the whole box ie 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.769
 do not 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.930
 I do not know there are still those envelopes in that box 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.590
 and I do not know if the X will touch me 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.459
 missing in this opening or it will touch me in 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.989
 yours in the envelopes that are there that 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.670
 I do not know if it will touch me depends on what 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.450
 compare someone who is not me but 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.450
 as I returned 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.650
 espn that 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.800
 even more 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.800
 markit 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.350
 everything is fibers 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:06.120
 and the same 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.120
 let's call it hectic 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.629
 as we are very fans 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:18.139
 Energy Recovery 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.420
 instead of river we have a light 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:24.590
 hot 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:27.560
 and as rare we have an electric semi 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:31.150
 art support to this type of letter is not 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.150
 holographic semi-circular agreement 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:37.529
 the mud is fleeting or nothing rare and 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.740
 we have here on Monday that neither 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:42.940
 it is rare is the letter only rivers 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.880
 let's see if we're lucky with this 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.010
 opening of the river at the moment nothing of 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.100
 luck but nothing nothing nothing could touch 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:53.050
 at least one holographic letter since 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.860
 good is reliable because an X and 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.880
 what 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.750
 I practically buy them good so 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.360
 what I told you before 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.110
 schumi hard to touch an X 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.110
 aversion to this 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:12.129
 without that code aside 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:14.120
 let's have dinner with we know a two and three 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:16.960
 a 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.689
 and I leave you here 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:24.849
 the last letter 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:28.149
 last letter of the opening rare card and 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:30.340
 let's start with the opening with all the 

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:34.320
 letters 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.320
 normal these pulls 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:40.320
 to a rock sun 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.070
 marquez 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.070
 trapping 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.249
 it is not peace 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.650
 mccargo 

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:53.830
 considers 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:56.550
 gore bis and as a letter river we have a 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.770
 semi- elvish 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:02.400
 perfect up 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:04.300
 and finally we have the rare letter letter 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.550
 weird 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.830
 possibility that is nothing be 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:13.919
 only one simple and rare one letter 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.919
 holographic a letter xo a letter hello 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.199
 I do not know why I have a hunch 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:20.350
 that there's going to be something inside 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:22.870
 important at least one X is going to 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.200
 have here at least now it is possible 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.360
 what 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.610
 it does not sound x but it is one or it succeeds 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.010
 everything you are all around 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.120
 to this letter that goes around this 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:36.950
 letter that gives the return that gives the 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:40.060
 back like pretty attention 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:43.520
 we have a full letter 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:46.129

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.729
 cool plants that have touched us in this 

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:17.330
