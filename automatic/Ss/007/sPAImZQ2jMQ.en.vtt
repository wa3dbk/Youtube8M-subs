5l<00:01:06.780> motorcycle<00:01:07.500> engine<00:01:07.829> so<00:01:08.040> top<00:01:08.909> speeds<00:01:09.240> about

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
5l motorcycle engine so top speeds about

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.270 
5l motorcycle engine so top speeds about
160<00:01:10.439> 165<00:01:11.159> maybe<00:01:12.020> something<00:01:13.020> like<00:01:13.170> that

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
160 165 maybe something like that

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.120 
160 165 maybe something like that
anyways<00:01:14.280> would<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.700> say<00:01:14.850> 750<00:01:15.390> 775<00:01:15.900> pounds<00:01:16.770> so

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
is tires last forever and brakes last

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.860 
is tires last forever and brakes last
forever<00:01:26.640> because<00:01:26.909> there's<00:01:27.540> not<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.720> lot<00:01:27.840> of

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
forever because there's not a lot of

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.960 
forever because there's not a lot of
weight<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.140> anything<00:01:28.560> yeah<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.190> mean<00:01:29.460> I've<00:01:29.790> had

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
weight on anything yeah I mean I've had

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.370 
weight on anything yeah I mean I've had
these<00:01:30.120> brake<00:01:30.360> pads<00:01:30.570> on<00:01:30.690> there<00:01:30.810> for<00:01:30.900> 20<00:01:31.170> years

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
these brake pads on there for 20 years

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.980 
these brake pads on there for 20 years
and<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.800> drive<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.220> hard<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:33.540> get<00:01:33.720> hardly

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
and I drive it hard and you get hardly

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.330 
and I drive it hard and you get hardly
anywhere<00:01:34.350> because<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.860> car<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.070> so

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
anywhere because the car is so

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.100 
anywhere because the car is so
lightweight<00:01:35.610> but<00:01:35.970> let's<00:01:36.270> move<00:01:36.479> down<00:01:36.720> here<00:01:36.750> and

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
lightweight but let's move down here and

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.469 
lightweight but let's move down here and
move<00:01:37.590> towards<00:01:37.920> more<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.340> supercar<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.030> that's

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
move towards more the supercar so that's

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.710 
move towards more the supercar so that's
a<00:01:39.659> load<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.870> salon<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.920> parked<00:01:41.250> next<00:01:41.370> to

a load of salon this is parked next to

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.940 
a load of salon this is parked next to
the<00:01:42.720> rocket<00:01:43.140> because<00:01:43.290> it's<00:01:43.590> another<00:01:43.799> example

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
the rocket because it's another example

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.800 
the rocket because it's another example
of<00:01:44.310> extremely<00:01:44.700> lightweight<00:01:45.090> that's<00:01:45.570> about

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
of extremely lightweight that's about

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.410 
of extremely lightweight that's about
1,400<00:01:46.620> 1,500<00:01:46.880> pounds<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.000> it's<00:01:48.120> fiberglass
