00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
that's within the gel coat we talked

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.820 
that's within the gel coat we talked
about<00:03:25.550> the<00:03:25.790> microscopic<00:03:26.570> cracks<00:03:27.200> that<00:03:27.470> exist

about the microscopic cracks that exist

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.979 
about the microscopic cracks that exist
within<00:03:28.040> that<00:03:28.400> gel<00:03:29.060> coat<00:03:29.270> when<00:03:29.420> it<00:03:29.510> is<00:03:29.630> older

within that gel coat when it is older
the<00:03:30.260> purpose<00:03:30.590> of<00:03:30.680> an<00:03:30.770> epoxy<00:03:31.040> primer<00:03:31.220> is<00:03:31.640> to

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
the purpose of an epoxy primer is to

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.000 
the purpose of an epoxy primer is to
completely<00:03:32.150> seal<00:03:32.510> that<00:03:32.750> off<00:03:32.810> stabilize<00:03:33.770> the

completely seal that off stabilize the

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.710 
completely seal that off stabilize the
surface<00:03:34.430> and<00:03:34.610> make<00:03:34.940> it<00:03:35.090> possible<00:03:35.239> for<00:03:35.540> the

surface and make it possible for the
topcoat<00:03:36.200> to<00:03:36.350> give<00:03:36.530> you<00:03:36.620> back<00:03:36.800> the<00:03:37.010> highest

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
topcoat to give you back the highest

topcoat to give you back the highest
level<00:03:37.700> also<00:03:38.060> possibly<00:03:38.480> here<00:03:38.750> we<00:03:39.200> use<00:03:39.470> two

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
level also possibly here we use two

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.090 
level also possibly here we use two
coats<00:03:40.130> the<00:03:40.370> first<00:03:40.640> one<00:03:40.850> we<00:03:41.060> rolled<00:03:41.330> it<00:03:41.510> on<00:03:41.660> and

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
coats the first one we rolled it on and

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.380 
coats the first one we rolled it on and
we<00:03:43.100> used<00:03:43.459> a<00:03:43.730> foam<00:03:44.209> roller<00:03:45.200> and<00:03:45.500> this<00:03:45.860> is<00:03:46.130> a

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
we used a foam roller and this is a

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.660 
we used a foam roller and this is a
solvent<00:03:47.440> impervious<00:03:48.440> type<00:03:48.650> roller<00:03:49.010> right<00:03:49.550> you

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
solvent impervious type roller right you

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.520 
solvent impervious type roller right you
know<00:03:49.790> you'll<00:03:50.120> watch<00:03:50.330> solvents<00:03:50.989> to<00:03:51.140> destroy

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
know you'll watch solvents to destroy

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.199 
know you'll watch solvents to destroy
your<00:03:51.770> foam<00:03:51.950> rollers<00:03:52.370> they<00:03:52.550> can<00:03:52.730> some<00:03:52.970> of<00:03:53.000> them

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
your foam rollers they can some of them

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:54.760 
your foam rollers they can some of them
they<00:03:53.300> can<00:03:53.360> kind<00:03:53.660> of<00:03:53.720> disintegrate<00:03:54.260> so<00:03:54.709> you

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 
they can kind of disintegrate so you

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:55.930 
they can kind of disintegrate so you
want<00:03:54.950> to<00:03:55.010> make<00:03:55.130> sure<00:03:55.160> that<00:03:55.430> you<00:03:55.550> have<00:03:55.670> a<00:03:55.700> good

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
quality foam roller we roll down the

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.760 
quality foam roller we roll down the
first<00:03:58.310> coat<00:03:58.520> we<00:03:58.760> let<00:03:59.030> it<00:03:59.180> cure<00:03:59.510> we<00:04:00.140> sanded<00:04:00.620> it

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
first coat we let it cure we sanded it

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.390 
first coat we let it cure we sanded it
using<00:04:01.209> 240<00:04:02.209> grit<00:04:02.390> sandpaper<00:04:03.010> we<00:04:04.010> came<00:04:04.220> back

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
using 240 grit sandpaper we came back

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.340 
using 240 grit sandpaper we came back
and<00:04:04.700> we<00:04:05.060> roll<00:04:05.239> down<00:04:05.420> the<00:04:05.540> second<00:04:05.930> coat<00:04:06.140> but

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
and we roll down the second coat but

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.460 
and we roll down the second coat but
this<00:04:06.590> time<00:04:06.860> we<00:04:07.430> used<00:04:07.610> a<00:04:07.760> good<00:04:07.940> quality<00:04:08.600> animal

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
this time we used a good quality animal

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.020 
this time we used a good quality animal
hair<00:04:09.709> brush<00:04:09.980> this<00:04:10.190> is<00:04:10.220> a<00:04:10.340> badger<00:04:10.670> hair<00:04:10.970> brush

hair brush this is a badger hair brush
right<00:04:11.450> here<00:04:11.510> it's<00:04:11.780> very<00:04:11.959> expensive<00:04:12.410> but<00:04:13.250> what

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
right here it's very expensive but what

does allowed us to do was to kind of get

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.190 
does allowed us to do was to kind of get
the<00:04:15.680> material<00:04:16.160> to<00:04:16.190> flow<00:04:16.489> out<00:04:16.910> on<00:04:17.209> the<00:04:17.989> hull

the material to flow out on the hull

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.900 
the material to flow out on the hull
side<00:04:19.030> 133rd<00:04:20.030> we<00:04:20.690> we<00:04:20.989> came<00:04:21.260> back<00:04:21.530> with<00:04:21.799> some<00:04:21.950> 360

we sanded that folks but notice the
black<00:04:28.110> on<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:29.070> whole<00:04:29.220> side<00:04:29.460> well<00:04:29.820> that's<00:04:30.090> just

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
black on the whole side well that's just

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.480 
black on the whole side well that's just
some<00:04:30.480> spray<00:04:30.870> paint<00:04:30.900> some<00:04:31.590> flat<00:04:31.860> black<00:04:32.160> spray

some spray paint some flat black spray
paint<00:04:32.520> that<00:04:32.820> we<00:04:33.030> used<00:04:33.210> as<00:04:33.390> a<00:04:33.420> guide<00:04:33.810> coat<00:04:34.170> and

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
distinction of where have we sanded and

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.750 
distinction of where have we sanded and
where<00:04:40.380> haven't<00:04:40.710> we<00:04:40.770> sanded<00:04:41.310> that's<00:04:41.490> a<00:04:41.580> real
