00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:07.080
 the crystal glass 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.580
 crystal glass is a product used 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.400
 to imitate glass effect on the pieces 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.160
 have transparent and high finish 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.430
 brightness can be applied over wood 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.710
 ceramic plaster the glass you can apply

 decoupage work

 preparation is done by placing 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:37.520
 component b smaller packaging within the 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.590
 vial of the component at the 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.820
 always be two parts of component 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:46.460
 to a part of the component after 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:51.410
 the product begins to mix with 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:53.960
 a toothpick the mixture will be shaken

 but you should stir until the mixture 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.260
 crystal clear 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:03.170
 which should happen in approximately 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:06.280
 three minutes let the product rest 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.280
 three to five minutes 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:12.830
 the amount available on the glass 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.130
 Crystal is ideal for filling a part 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.030
 20 by 30 centimeters for parts 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.219
 minors 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.100
 the ideal is to prepare the amount that is 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:24.530
 used in a separate bottle type pet 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.869
 always mixing in the mouth 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.109
 proportion of two parts of component a 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.329
 for a part of the component after 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:33.710
 of use of skateboard all the pieces 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.530
 used 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.850
 pour the product on the moving part to 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.850
 that the product levels 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:52.220
 with a toothpick or needle I'm 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:56.740
 air bubbles that appear and place the 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.740
 piece to dry for 72 hours 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:04.100
 it is very important to check the 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.850
 the surface where you place the part to 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.490
 dry 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.190
 if the piece is also irregular 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.560
 may dry irregularly 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.990
 the piece should also dry in place 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.360
 protected from dust since all 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.930
 deposited fragments dried next to the
