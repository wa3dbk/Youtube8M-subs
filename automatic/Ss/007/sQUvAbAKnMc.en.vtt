00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 so we look a little today 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.759
 strange accessories of the 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.719
 This year racing tablet racing 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.690
 wheel by eclipse german distributor 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.580
 I would say that part already 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.720
 view the box but directly 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.830
 the steering wheel is a steering wheel for ipads 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.330
 or for racing games the man 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.100
 maybe want to play on the ipad 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.269
 next to the box here away that exists 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.920
 from two parts to one of these handlebars 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.240
 device of this bracket quasi here 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.880
 the ipad will be set afterwards 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.480
 look at our live 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.290
 what then cling here with these two 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.730
 is being held behind 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.399
 squeezed shut 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.750
 underneath, the ipad is sitting here 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.070
 inside the whole time you get back 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.610
 if you have this button up here 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.600
 pulls exactly then that falls in the best 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.190
 case not out on the back is 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.600
 here almost the bracket for the 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.739
 pedestrians come in here is only one 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.780
 small button with the whole 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.859
 history is subsequently arrested and 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.129
 we have two small ones here 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.600
 pitch below and above with the 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.390
 We then each again the holder 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.720
 can make it seven millimeters tighter 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.400
 or from 9 to 16 mm this 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.510
 contact pressure, the one also make that 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.340
 we look the same again live on 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.439
 down in there are so little foam rubber 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.939
 bracket out and in the big one 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.509
 and whole is therefore a piece of plastic 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.619
 Keep the mechanism in place 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:31.380
 the stand itself is the rage like this 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.310
 Ball joint head moves quite well 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.780
 looks a bit heavy now 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.340
 evaluate the steering wheel before 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.320
 tuned 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.400
 then there is a bigger lever and 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.320
 The whole thing can also be much better 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.990
 left and right in it and on it 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.729
 So we have some rubber feet too 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.040
 keep you well on the table bit 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.869
 Strange I found this a kind 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.250
 Battery has been inside but now 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.350
 not equipped with batteries, it is 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.149
 there are no contacts and nix the 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.219
 Anyone planned, although one 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.229
 she does not need 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.530
 As I said we have the rubber feet below 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.079
 tuned 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.369
 we have our head and me here 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.470
 would suggest we are stuck now 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.590
 just be the steering wheel 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:13.890
 The whole thing should be in the best case 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:15.390
 that's exactly what I think 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.370
 you have to put it in it too 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.680
 press this button above 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.830
 the whole thing then locks in place now 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.210
 have something in it for the part so on 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.740
 The table is relatively free 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:39.480
 move and I would say we're stuck 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:40.860
 just once since selling so the whole 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.360
 history runs so you can tell that already 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.680
 will be much harder market too 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.840
 right down so far the tablet there 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.010
 is in and now you have to go together 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.780
 be pushed and then you can do that 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.310
 use 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:54.870
 in my profile, they look at the whole 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.490
 thing like the handlebar which can be 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.290
 You can move the whole thing relatively free 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.760
 thing and take up that one 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:05.100
 looks right on it and then can 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:07.200
 move 360 degrees as shown 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.820
 we'll take a look while 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.080
 but I can play the game at the front 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.190
 already express a little criticism as 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.190
 I just tried it 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.850
 The steering wheel you can not really 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.959
 around the thumb closes with the hand 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.790
 here perhaps a lie in the 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.620
 middle if you are such a thing 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.450
 buys and that's the way it is relative 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.950
 big takes away a lot of space 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.810
 then they would find it, too 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.160
 make two centimeters wider 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.459
 that you can really get it right 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.730
 can 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.930
 So somehow you always have a hand yes 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.510
 so at the side and is not so 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.850
 In addition, it really comes with a handlebar 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.160
 was made so synchronously 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.450
 on one side is the one up here 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.310
 excerpt on the other side he is 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.080
 Down here that's also called when I'm here 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.380
 is create my hand never feels so 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:53.010
 right like a steering wheel , I say 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.840
 So you are a bit too big 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.780
 compromise than me that thing 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.670
 I would think 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:03.709
 sometimes individual races and we race 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.709
 times with the handlebar animal through the area 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.590
 So you can see it or you can 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.610
 you can see it is quite filigree 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.830
 steer here 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.000
 Of course you also need to play games 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.949
 not so much with the 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.300
 fingers must make on the display if 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.590
 I'll switch all the time now 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.060
 and it would have to brake 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.060
 probably quite as convenient 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.750
 conclusion one must say one has 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:04.250
 virtually the entire display around you 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:06.770
 then in the big picture in it to god he is 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.530
 hard to play at the same time and also 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.300
 One wanted to dare to say something else 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:18.080
 has a lot of space and everything here too 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:19.670
 see what happens on the display and 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.040
 can draw pretty much 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.260
 But it's just security for you 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.430
 exactly a category of games and 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.780
 its a racing game 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.040
 otherwise you could do the whole thing 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:35.120
 history maybe still as a video 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:36.440
 Stands use very special chip 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.830
 We would still be one anyway 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.260
 Video 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:42.220
 You can already see this up 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.390
 the eighth place it takes you can 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.030
 to steer properly with it is moved 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.870
 Being in the flow well is not too tight 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.800
 but it would be something I have to completely 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.390
 honestly do not say personally anymore 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.980
 I do not think so 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:57.740
 100 euro is a bit too expensive so 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:59.270
 this time for 25 you can do that in the 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.850
 Ask and users from time to time if it 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.050
 But in june, that's fun 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.520
 Steering wheel one side a bit 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.980
 have to be cut out better and 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.480
 Just let yourself be closed 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.830
 better with that as I said I have here 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.290
 Still the problem that I do not like that 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.910
 right steering wheel fit in the steering wheel 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:18.170
 but the whole thing can do more 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:20.870
 or less on the sides of that 

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.430
 Here's a bit quieter place one 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.200
 it has not become his place 14 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.710
 but I'm also not somehow 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.700
 hectic into the guardrail 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.270
 with us all the time again from 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.740
 behind 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.710
 As I said, he gets up very well here 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.120
 the table on it but whether you are now 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.010
 we really need that 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.860
 undecided 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:42.670
 the tablet racing as fonic we say 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.670
 Thank you for watching
