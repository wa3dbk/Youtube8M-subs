00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
this guy here is that the on this side

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.539 
this guy here is that the on this side
the<00:01:38.420> heads<00:01:38.600> going<00:01:38.810> this<00:01:39.229> way<00:01:39.380> and<00:01:39.649> down<00:01:40.310> here

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
the heads going this way and down here

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:41.980 
the heads going this way and down here
on<00:01:40.609> the<00:01:40.670> bottom<00:01:40.789> side<00:01:40.969> its<00:01:41.600> twist<00:01:41.840> to<00:01:41.929> the

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
on the bottom side its twist to the

on the bottom side its twist to the
other<00:01:42.049> way<00:01:42.259> so<00:01:42.319> these<00:01:42.530> heads<00:01:42.799> or<00:01:43.280> just<00:01:43.520> set<00:01:43.700> off

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
other way so these heads or just set off

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.179 
other way so these heads or just set off
19<00:01:44.179> degrees<00:01:44.270> of<00:01:44.509> each<00:01:44.600> other<00:01:44.799> so<00:01:45.799> the<00:01:45.950> world

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
19 degrees of each other so the world

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.129 
19 degrees of each other so the world
follows<00:01:46.639> each<00:01:47.119> side<00:01:47.450> kind<00:01:47.659> of<00:01:47.689> rolls<00:01:47.899> a<00:01:47.990> little

00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:48.139 
follows each side kind of rolls a little

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:49.029 
follows each side kind of rolls a little
bit<00:01:48.229> different<00:01:48.530> kind<00:01:48.590> of<00:01:48.679> gives<00:01:48.829> a<00:01:48.889> really

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
bit different kind of gives a really

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:50.859 
bit different kind of gives a really
unique<00:01:49.159> falling<00:01:49.549> action<00:01:49.670> to<00:01:49.969> it<00:01:50.090> like<00:01:50.630> these

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
unique falling action to it like these

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.719 
unique falling action to it like these
last<00:01:51.049> two<00:01:51.229> words<00:01:51.350> more<00:01:51.649> wacky<00:01:52.280> rig<00:01:52.490> style
