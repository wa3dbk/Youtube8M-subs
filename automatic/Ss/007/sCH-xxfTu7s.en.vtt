well hi this is Brian and this is my
latest<00:00:07.399> gardening<00:00:08.090> project<00:00:09.280> my<00:00:10.280> traditional

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:10.760 
latest gardening project my traditional

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.870 
latest gardening project my traditional
garden<00:00:11.210> which<00:00:12.080> you<00:00:12.230> see<00:00:12.440> over<00:00:12.620> here<00:00:12.650> it's<00:00:13.640> kind

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:13.880 
garden which you see over here it's kind

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.929 
garden which you see over here it's kind
of<00:00:13.910> dying<00:00:14.210> after<00:00:14.420> the<00:00:14.720> winter<00:00:14.950> stuff<00:00:15.950> has<00:00:16.279> kind

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:16.939 
of dying after the winter stuff has kind

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:19.470 
of dying after the winter stuff has kind
of<00:00:17.060> finished<00:00:17.529> and<00:00:18.529> never<00:00:18.800> really<00:00:19.070> did<00:00:19.279> well

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 
of finished and never really did well

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.729 
of finished and never really did well
and<00:00:20.480> I<00:00:20.659> think<00:00:20.929> a<00:00:20.989> lot<00:00:21.140> of<00:00:21.169> the<00:00:21.289> reasons<00:00:21.560> I've

00:00:21.729 --> 00:00:21.739 
and I think a lot of the reasons I've

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:24.700 
and I think a lot of the reasons I've
had<00:00:22.449> poor<00:00:23.449> luck<00:00:23.480> with<00:00:23.869> this<00:00:24.019> garden<00:00:24.259> is<00:00:24.529> that

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
had poor luck with this garden is that

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.319 
had poor luck with this garden is that
it's<00:00:24.919> just<00:00:25.069> really<00:00:25.220> not<00:00:25.460> raised<00:00:25.759> enough<00:00:26.119> I

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:26.329 
it's just really not raised enough I

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:29.620 
it's just really not raised enough I
didn't<00:00:26.569> import<00:00:26.899> enough<00:00:27.140> good<00:00:27.349> dirt<00:00:28.569> and<00:00:29.569> I

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
didn't import enough good dirt and I

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.200 
didn't import enough good dirt and I
know<00:00:29.720> it's<00:00:29.899> an<00:00:29.960> eyesore<00:00:30.259> right<00:00:30.439> now<00:00:30.589> but

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
know it's an eyesore right now but

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.340 
know it's an eyesore right now but
anyway<00:00:32.210> the<00:00:32.570> only<00:00:32.660> thing<00:00:32.899> that's<00:00:33.050> growing

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
anyway the only thing that's growing

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.100 
anyway the only thing that's growing
well<00:00:33.530> in<00:00:33.710> here<00:00:33.920> is<00:00:34.070> tomatoes<00:00:34.810> so<00:00:35.810> my<00:00:35.930> latest

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
well in here is tomatoes so my latest

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.760 
well in here is tomatoes so my latest
attempt<00:00:36.710> is<00:00:36.830> to<00:00:37.540> kind<00:00:38.540> of<00:00:38.630> go<00:00:38.780> all<00:00:39.230> out<00:00:39.290> and

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
attempt is to kind of go all out and

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.340 
attempt is to kind of go all out and
really<00:00:40.520> raise<00:00:40.700> the<00:00:40.910> bed<00:00:41.090> use<00:00:41.780> none<00:00:42.080> of<00:00:42.230> my

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
really raise the bed use none of my

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.490 
really raise the bed use none of my
existing<00:00:42.950> dirt<00:00:43.840> give<00:00:44.840> myself<00:00:45.170> lots<00:00:45.380> of

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
existing dirt give myself lots of

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.400 
existing dirt give myself lots of
drainage<00:00:46.030> and<00:00:47.030> this<00:00:47.180> is<00:00:47.330> going<00:00:47.600> to<00:00:47.660> be<00:00:47.780> a<00:00:47.810> or<00:00:48.140> is

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
drainage and this is going to be a or is

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
drainage and this is going to be a or is
a<00:00:48.440> keyhole<00:00:49.780> design<00:00:50.780> now<00:00:51.650> usually<00:00:51.950> a<00:00:52.010> keyhole

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
a keyhole design now usually a keyhole

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.819 
a keyhole design now usually a keyhole
is<00:00:52.550> round<00:00:52.870> and<00:00:53.870> that's<00:00:54.200> probably<00:00:54.410> the<00:00:54.560> ideal

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
is round and that's probably the ideal

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.470 
is round and that's probably the ideal
shape<00:00:56.200> but<00:00:57.200> I<00:00:57.760> wanted<00:00:58.760> to<00:00:58.850> build<00:00:59.180> it<00:00:59.329> out<00:00:59.450> of

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
shape but I wanted to build it out of

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.670 
shape but I wanted to build it out of
wood<00:00:59.690> because<00:00:59.900> I'm<00:01:00.079> more<00:01:00.230> comfortable<00:01:00.380> with

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
wood because I'm more comfortable with

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.790 
wood because I'm more comfortable with
that<00:01:01.120> and<00:01:02.120> at<00:01:02.810> least<00:01:02.930> in<00:01:03.110> my<00:01:03.230> area<00:01:03.380> it<00:01:03.620> seemed

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
that and at least in my area it seemed

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.300 
that and at least in my area it seemed
to<00:01:03.890> be<00:01:03.980> the<00:01:04.100> cheaper<00:01:04.400> option<00:01:04.430> and<00:01:05.049> so<00:01:06.049> I<00:01:06.320> went

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
to be the cheaper option and so I went

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.370 
to be the cheaper option and so I went
and<00:01:07.399> built<00:01:07.609> it<00:01:07.759> out<00:01:07.880> of<00:01:07.909> 2x4<00:01:08.659> and<00:01:08.929> plywood

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
and built it out of 2x4 and plywood

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.279 
and built it out of 2x4 and plywood
material<00:01:10.069> yeah<00:01:11.090> plywood<00:01:11.329> material<00:01:11.869> may<00:01:12.020> not

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:12.289 
material yeah plywood material may not

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:14.919 
material yeah plywood material may not
last<00:01:12.530> too<00:01:12.770> long<00:01:12.950> it<00:01:13.159> may<00:01:13.280> break<00:01:13.549> down<00:01:13.609> and<00:01:14.119> bow

00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:14.929 
last too long it may break down and bow

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:18.219 
last too long it may break down and bow
and<00:01:15.439> not<00:01:16.069> do<00:01:16.579> too<00:01:16.609> well<00:01:16.999> as<00:01:17.390> a<00:01:17.450> wall<00:01:17.749> structure

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
and not do too well as a wall structure

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.410 
and not do too well as a wall structure
but<00:01:18.469> I<00:01:19.689> can<00:01:20.689> fill<00:01:20.929> in<00:01:21.139> these<00:01:21.770> areas<00:01:22.189> with<00:01:23.179> more

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
but I can fill in these areas with more

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.690 
but I can fill in these areas with more
two<00:01:23.630> by<00:01:23.749> fours<00:01:24.020> if<00:01:24.259> I<00:01:24.380> need<00:01:24.590> needed<00:01:25.340> additional

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
two by fours if I need needed additional

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.840 
two by fours if I need needed additional
reinforcement<00:01:26.420> as<00:01:27.289> time<00:01:27.499> goes<00:01:27.710> on<00:01:27.799> but<00:01:28.490> the

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
reinforcement as time goes on but the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.609 
reinforcement as time goes on but the
basic<00:01:29.210> idea<00:01:29.509> with<00:01:29.659> a<00:01:29.689> keyhole<00:01:30.079> garden<00:01:30.439> which

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
basic idea with a keyhole garden which

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.109 
basic idea with a keyhole garden which
you<00:01:30.740> can<00:01:30.920> google<00:01:31.219> and<00:01:31.310> learn<00:01:31.459> more<00:01:31.639> about<00:01:31.759> but

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
you can google and learn more about but

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.709 
you can google and learn more about but
is<00:01:32.959> basically<00:01:33.380> you<00:01:33.590> put<00:01:33.999> all<00:01:34.999> your<00:01:35.060> compost

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:35.719 
is basically you put all your compost

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:38.889 
is basically you put all your compost
and<00:01:36.049> stuff<00:01:36.350> in<00:01:36.649> this<00:01:36.799> middle<00:01:37.130> area<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:37.899> then

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
and stuff in this middle area and then

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.440 
and stuff in this middle area and then
as<00:01:39.079> it<00:01:39.229> decomposes<00:01:39.799> the<00:01:40.369> moisture<00:01:41.209> and

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
as it decomposes the moisture and

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.440 
as it decomposes the moisture and
nutrients<00:01:41.990> and<00:01:42.819> you<00:01:43.819> know<00:01:43.909> beneficial

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
nutrients and you know beneficial

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.300 
nutrients and you know beneficial
microbes<00:01:44.840> and<00:01:45.109> stuff<00:01:45.319> kind<00:01:45.590> of<00:01:45.649> leach<00:01:46.100> out

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
microbes and stuff kind of leach out

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.260 
microbes and stuff kind of leach out
into<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:46.789> surrounding<00:01:47.240> soil<00:01:47.889> and<00:01:48.889> the

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
into the surrounding soil and the

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.940 
into the surrounding soil and the
typical<00:01:50.270> diameter<00:01:51.079> of<00:01:51.170> a<00:01:51.259> keyhole<00:01:51.439> garden<00:01:51.829> is

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
typical diameter of a keyhole garden is

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.120 
typical diameter of a keyhole garden is
6<00:01:52.159> feet<00:01:52.369> and<00:01:52.609> this<00:01:53.329> is<00:01:53.509> a<00:01:53.539> 6<00:01:53.840> foot<00:01:53.929> box<00:01:54.350> so<00:01:54.889> the

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
6 feet and this is a 6 foot box so the

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.289 
6 feet and this is a 6 foot box so the
corners<00:01:55.429> are<00:01:55.579> going<00:01:55.700> to<00:01:55.759> be<00:01:55.850> a<00:01:55.880> little<00:01:55.999> bit<00:01:56.179> too

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
corners are going to be a little bit too

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.719 
corners are going to be a little bit too
far<00:01:56.509> away<00:01:56.659> and<00:01:57.229> it<00:01:57.499> is<00:01:57.649> really<00:01:57.979> tall<00:01:58.219> it's<00:01:58.520> 3

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
far away and it is really tall it's 3

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.279 
far away and it is really tall it's 3
feet<00:01:58.939> high<00:01:59.149> on<00:01:59.479> the<00:01:59.599> outside<00:02:00.020> and<00:02:00.200> a<00:02:00.259> little

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
feet high on the outside and a little

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.919 
feet high on the outside and a little
bit<00:02:00.529> taller<00:02:00.679> in<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:01.069> middle<00:02:01.549> the<00:02:02.539> reason<00:02:02.749> for

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
bit taller in the middle the reason for

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:05.319 
bit taller in the middle the reason for
that<00:02:02.990> I<00:02:03.109> think<00:02:03.289> is<00:02:03.619> so<00:02:04.340> that<00:02:04.520> gravity<00:02:04.939> can<00:02:04.969> kind

that I think is so that gravity can kind

is<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:29.530> 2x4<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:30.560> plywood<00:02:31.599> the<00:02:32.599> corners<00:02:33.019> are

I've<00:02:35.900> got<00:02:36.049> 3-inch<00:02:36.439> screws<00:02:37.159> holding<00:02:37.730> it

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
I've got 3-inch screws holding it

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.410 
I've got 3-inch screws holding it
together<00:02:38.650> I<00:02:39.650> did<00:02:40.400> spray<00:02:40.760> it<00:02:40.909> with<00:02:41.030> a<00:02:41.090> wood

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
together I did spray it with a wood

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.209 
together I did spray it with a wood
sealer<00:02:41.810> inside<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.409> out<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:42.799> then<00:02:42.980> I'm<00:02:43.099> gonna

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:43.219 
sealer inside and out and then I'm gonna

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:45.550 
sealer inside and out and then I'm gonna
stain<00:02:43.519> it<00:02:43.549> on<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:43.879> outside

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
stain it on the outside

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.770 
stain it on the outside
I<00:02:45.590> didn't<00:02:46.459> probably<00:02:46.760> do<00:02:46.819> enough<00:02:47.180> research<00:02:47.269> on

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
I didn't probably do enough research on

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.929 
I didn't probably do enough research on
the<00:02:47.870> wood<00:02:48.019> sealer<00:02:48.379> it<00:02:49.040> seems<00:02:49.310> like<00:02:49.489> a<00:02:49.519> fairly

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:49.939 
the wood sealer it seems like a fairly

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:53.080 
the wood sealer it seems like a fairly
benign<00:02:50.060> water-based<00:02:51.579> product<00:02:52.579> that<00:02:52.700> I<00:02:52.730> used

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
benign water-based product that I used

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.670 
benign water-based product that I used
but<00:02:53.480> it<00:02:53.780> would<00:02:54.049> have<00:02:54.109> been<00:02:54.230> good<00:02:54.379> to<00:02:54.439> use<00:02:54.650> a

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
but it would have been good to use a

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.280 
but it would have been good to use a
truly<00:02:55.519> food<00:02:55.699> safe<00:02:56.030> product<00:02:56.780> so<00:02:56.959> if<00:02:57.049> you<00:02:57.169> do

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
truly food safe product so if you do

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.349 
truly food safe product so if you do
this<00:02:57.439> I<00:02:57.680> would<00:02:57.769> recommend<00:02:58.150> researching<00:02:59.150> a

00:02:59.349 --> 00:02:59.359 
this I would recommend researching a

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:01.420 
this I would recommend researching a
little<00:02:59.510> bit<00:02:59.599> more<00:02:59.780> the<00:03:00.680> stain<00:03:00.919> is<00:03:01.069> definitely

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
little bit more the stain is definitely

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.640 
little bit more the stain is definitely
not<00:03:01.609> a<00:03:01.909> very<00:03:02.480> safe<00:03:02.750> product<00:03:03.019> so<00:03:03.349> that's<00:03:03.530> going

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
not a very safe product so that's going

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.129 
not a very safe product so that's going
to<00:03:03.709> only<00:03:04.159> be<00:03:04.280> on<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.459> outside<00:03:04.790> for<00:03:05.150> mostly

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:06.139 
to only be on the outside for mostly

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:10.599 
to only be on the outside for mostly
cosmetic<00:03:06.319> purposes<00:03:07.389> and<00:03:08.919> then<00:03:09.919> on<00:03:10.219> the<00:03:10.310> inside

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
cosmetic purposes and then on the inside

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:15.280 
cosmetic purposes and then on the inside
I<00:03:10.969> kind<00:03:11.959> of<00:03:12.019> constructed<00:03:12.680> this<00:03:13.060> little<00:03:14.060> Inn<00:03:14.689> of

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
I kind of constructed this little Inn of

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.240 
I kind of constructed this little Inn of
a<00:03:15.469> wall<00:03:15.709> walled<00:03:16.370> area<00:03:16.549> to<00:03:16.939> walk<00:03:17.060> into<00:03:17.650> and<00:03:18.650> then

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
a wall walled area to walk into and then

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.420 
a wall walled area to walk into and then
basically<00:03:19.669> this<00:03:20.000> is<00:03:20.349> two<00:03:21.349> feet<00:03:21.590> wide<00:03:21.799> here<00:03:22.250> and

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
basically this is two feet wide here and

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.300 
basically this is two feet wide here and
then<00:03:23.150> these<00:03:23.299> are<00:03:23.449> each<00:03:23.569> two<00:03:23.810> foot<00:03:24.079> walls<00:03:24.310> so

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
then these are each two foot walls so

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.800 
then these are each two foot walls so
hopefully<00:03:25.759> it'll<00:03:25.879> be<00:03:26.000> strong<00:03:26.239> enough<00:03:26.479> I<00:03:26.629> put

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
hopefully it'll be strong enough I put

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.039 
hopefully it'll be strong enough I put
in<00:03:26.900> these<00:03:26.989> little<00:03:27.229> reinforcing<00:03:28.129> pieces<00:03:29.120> to

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
in these little reinforcing pieces to

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.199 
in these little reinforcing pieces to
kind<00:03:30.199> of<00:03:30.379> make<00:03:31.129> sure<00:03:31.159> that<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:31.639> crush<00:03:31.909> of<00:03:32.180> the

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
kind of make sure that the crush of the

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.990 
kind of make sure that the crush of the
soil<00:03:32.540> on<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:33.259> other<00:03:33.409> side<00:03:33.620> doesn't<00:03:34.000> squeeze

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
soil on the other side doesn't squeeze

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.229 
soil on the other side doesn't squeeze
this<00:03:35.209> thing<00:03:35.269> and<00:03:35.780> together<00:03:36.849> so<00:03:37.849> we'll<00:03:38.000> see<00:03:38.150> how

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
this thing and together so we'll see how

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.080 
this thing and together so we'll see how
that<00:03:38.389> goes<00:03:38.569> and<00:03:38.829> then<00:03:39.829> as<00:03:40.040> far<00:03:40.189> as<00:03:40.250> the<00:03:40.430> compost

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
that goes and then as far as the compost

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.679 
that goes and then as far as the compost
area<00:03:41.829> so<00:03:42.829> I<00:03:43.189> didn't<00:03:43.609> do<00:03:43.699> anything<00:03:43.970> special

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:44.689 
area so I didn't do anything special

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:46.509 
area so I didn't do anything special
except<00:03:44.959> spray<00:03:45.259> a<00:03:45.290> little<00:03:45.409> bit<00:03:45.530> of<00:03:45.620> wood<00:03:46.159> sealer

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
except spray a little bit of wood sealer

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.270 
except spray a little bit of wood sealer
on<00:03:46.699> the<00:03:46.819> on<00:03:47.090> the<00:03:47.209> outer<00:03:47.359> walls<00:03:47.689> but<00:03:48.530> in<00:03:48.859> here

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
on the on the outer walls but in here

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.369 
on the on the outer walls but in here
it's<00:03:49.430> gonna<00:03:49.579> be<00:03:49.669> really<00:03:50.239> moist<00:03:50.509> all<00:03:51.019> the<00:03:51.169> time

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:51.379 
it's gonna be really moist all the time

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:54.819 
it's gonna be really moist all the time
lots<00:03:52.220> of<00:03:52.540> you<00:03:53.540> know<00:03:53.569> microbial<00:03:54.319> activity

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
lots of you know microbial activity

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.210 
lots of you know microbial activity
against<00:03:55.729> this<00:03:55.879> wood<00:03:56.120> at<00:03:56.269> all<00:03:56.389> times<00:03:56.629> so<00:03:57.099> we<00:03:58.099> had

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
against this wood at all times so we had

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.800 
against this wood at all times so we had
some<00:03:58.489> furniture<00:03:59.030> wrap<00:04:00.129> that<00:04:01.129> you<00:04:01.159> get<00:04:01.370> at<00:04:01.519> like

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
some furniture wrap that you get at like

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.929 
some furniture wrap that you get at like
u-haul<00:04:02.810> or<00:04:02.840> whatever<00:04:03.379> and<00:04:04.340> so<00:04:04.459> I<00:04:04.489> just<00:04:04.759> did<00:04:04.909> a

00:04:04.929 --> 00:04:04.939 
u-haul or whatever and so I just did a

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:06.670 
u-haul or whatever and so I just did a
couple<00:04:05.150> layers<00:04:05.449> of<00:04:05.719> that<00:04:05.900> wrapped<00:04:06.530> around

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
couple layers of that wrapped around

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.569 
couple layers of that wrapped around
that<00:04:06.979> area<00:04:07.189> to<00:04:07.459> try<00:04:07.489> to<00:04:07.699> keep<00:04:07.909> the<00:04:08.209> moist

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
that area to try to keep the moist

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:13.179 
that area to try to keep the moist
compost<00:04:10.579> pile<00:04:10.879> away<00:04:11.269> from<00:04:11.599> the<00:04:11.780> wood<00:04:12.009> and<00:04:13.009> then

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:13.189 
compost pile away from the wood and then

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:15.849 
compost pile away from the wood and then
the<00:04:13.310> outside<00:04:13.669> is<00:04:13.879> just<00:04:13.909> chicken<00:04:14.299> wire<00:04:14.859> wrapped

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
the outside is just chicken wire wrapped

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:20.050 
the outside is just chicken wire wrapped
around<00:04:16.039> some<00:04:16.519> steaks<00:04:17.419> and<00:04:18.409> then<00:04:19.310> stakeholder

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
around some steaks and then stakeholder

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.409 
around some steaks and then stakeholder
ham<00:04:20.419> nailed<00:04:20.750> into<00:04:21.019> the<00:04:21.289> side<00:04:21.650> there<00:04:22.330> by<00:04:23.330> the

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
ham nailed into the side there by the

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.540 
ham nailed into the side there by the
compost<00:04:23.840> or<00:04:24.229> this<00:04:24.349> wire<00:04:24.560> rather<00:04:24.830> is<00:04:25.070> really

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
compost or this wire rather is really

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.839 
compost or this wire rather is really
not<00:04:25.699> doing<00:04:25.880> too<00:04:26.210> much<00:04:26.419> but<00:04:27.279> typically<00:04:28.279> you<00:04:28.699> do

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 
not doing too much but typically you do

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:29.910 
not doing too much but typically you do
see<00:04:29.060> some<00:04:29.330> sort<00:04:29.570> of<00:04:29.630> a

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
see some sort of a

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.800 
see some sort of a
being<00:04:30.160> scheme<00:04:30.490> around<00:04:30.670> the<00:04:30.910> compost<00:04:31.300> pile<00:04:31.540> and

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
being scheme around the compost pile and

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.440 
being scheme around the compost pile and
I<00:04:32.020> think<00:04:32.500> the<00:04:32.560> idea<00:04:32.830> is<00:04:32.890> just<00:04:32.980> to<00:04:33.250> kind<00:04:33.460> of<00:04:33.550> keep

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
I think the idea is just to kind of keep

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.470 
I think the idea is just to kind of keep
some<00:04:34.690> of<00:04:34.780> the<00:04:34.840> outer<00:04:35.080> soil<00:04:35.410> at<00:04:35.620> bay<00:04:35.800> I<00:04:36.790> really

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
some of the outer soil at bay I really

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.790 
some of the outer soil at bay I really
don't<00:04:37.660> know<00:04:37.810> that<00:04:38.080> this<00:04:38.200> is<00:04:38.380> going<00:04:38.560> to<00:04:38.710> do

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
don't know that this is going to do

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.110 
don't know that this is going to do
anything<00:04:39.130> it's<00:04:39.280> not<00:04:39.460> certainly<00:04:39.820> strong

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
anything it's not certainly strong

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.260 
anything it's not certainly strong
enough<00:04:40.330> to<00:04:40.510> hold<00:04:40.630> much<00:04:40.900> out<00:04:41.080> but<00:04:42.270> basically

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
enough to hold much out but basically

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.810 
enough to hold much out but basically
we'll<00:04:43.510> fill<00:04:43.660> it<00:04:43.780> in<00:04:43.870> with<00:04:44.580> compostable<00:04:45.580> stuff

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
we'll fill it in with compostable stuff

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.910 
we'll fill it in with compostable stuff
in<00:04:46.000> here<00:04:46.270> fill<00:04:46.630> it<00:04:46.720> in<00:04:46.930> with<00:04:46.960> dirt<00:04:47.290> on<00:04:47.410> the

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
in here fill it in with dirt on the

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.990 
in here fill it in with dirt on the
outside<00:04:48.250> at<00:04:48.460> the<00:04:48.730> same<00:04:48.820> time<00:04:49.380> so<00:04:50.380> the<00:04:51.000> the

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
outside at the same time so the the

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.430 
outside at the same time so the the
forces<00:04:52.330> should<00:04:52.480> be<00:04:52.540> roughly<00:04:52.900> equal<00:04:53.050> to<00:04:53.260> each

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
forces should be roughly equal to each

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.000 
forces should be roughly equal to each
other

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
other

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.410 
other
this<00:04:54.400> just<00:04:54.550> kind<00:04:54.700> of<00:04:54.820> provides<00:04:55.120> a<00:04:55.180> little<00:04:55.330> bit

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
this just kind of provides a little bit

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.910 
this just kind of provides a little bit
of<00:04:55.480> a<00:04:55.540> barrier<00:04:55.780> especially<00:04:56.440> up<00:04:56.530> at<00:04:56.620> the<00:04:56.710> top

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
of a barrier especially up at the top

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.100 
of a barrier especially up at the top
where<00:04:57.700> a<00:04:57.730> lot<00:04:58.000> of<00:04:58.150> just<00:04:58.360> kind<00:04:58.540> of<00:04:58.600> raw

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
where a lot of just kind of raw

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.450 
where a lot of just kind of raw
vegetables<00:04:59.140> and<00:04:59.770> stuff<00:05:00.010> are<00:05:00.160> going<00:05:00.220> to<00:05:00.370> be

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
vegetables and stuff are going to be

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.550 
vegetables and stuff are going to be
decaying<00:05:00.940> you<00:05:01.840> know<00:05:01.930> what<00:05:02.080> those<00:05:02.230> just<00:05:02.440> kind

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
decaying you know what those just kind

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.050 
decaying you know what those just kind
of<00:05:02.680> rolling<00:05:03.550> out<00:05:03.790> onto<00:05:04.150> the<00:05:04.270> garden<00:05:04.680> area<00:05:06.060> the

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
of rolling out onto the garden area the

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.970 
of rolling out onto the garden area the
next<00:05:07.240> step

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:07.980 
next step

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.380 
next step
besides<00:05:08.980> the<00:05:09.160> stain<00:05:09.430> once<00:05:09.760> it<00:05:09.910> dries<00:05:10.090> up<00:05:10.270> a

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
besides the stain once it dries up a

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.150 
besides the stain once it dries up a
little<00:05:10.570> bit<00:05:10.660> here<00:05:10.870> we've<00:05:11.050> kind<00:05:11.440> of<00:05:11.530> have<00:05:11.650> some

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
little bit here we've kind of have some

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.690 
little bit here we've kind of have some
wet<00:05:12.310> days<00:05:12.490> here<00:05:12.730> as<00:05:13.270> I'm<00:05:14.080> gonna<00:05:14.230> bring<00:05:14.530> in<00:05:14.800> a

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
wet days here as I'm gonna bring in a

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.020 
wet days here as I'm gonna bring in a
drip<00:05:16.690> line<00:05:16.900> sprinkler<00:05:17.680> so<00:05:18.490> I'll<00:05:18.610> show<00:05:18.820> that<00:05:18.850> in

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
drip line sprinkler so I'll show that in

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.060 
drip line sprinkler so I'll show that in
the<00:05:19.240> next<00:05:19.420> video<00:05:19.720> but<00:05:20.020> I<00:05:20.260> already<00:05:20.740> have<00:05:21.040> a

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
the next video but I already have a

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.830 
the next video but I already have a
buried<00:05:21.520> line<00:05:21.760> right<00:05:22.000> here<00:05:22.300> and<00:05:22.540> I'm<00:05:22.690> just

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
buried line right here and I'm just

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.350 
buried line right here and I'm just
gonna<00:05:23.010> kind<00:05:24.010> of<00:05:24.100> bring<00:05:24.430> it<00:05:24.520> across<00:05:24.700> and<00:05:25.240> then

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
gonna kind of bring it across and then

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.660 
gonna kind of bring it across and then
come<00:05:25.600> up<00:05:25.630> the<00:05:26.470> side<00:05:26.710> and<00:05:27.130> then<00:05:27.340> we're<00:05:27.490> going<00:05:27.580> to

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:27.670 
come up the side and then we're going to

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.850 
come up the side and then we're going to
come<00:05:27.850> out<00:05:28.000> here<00:05:28.360> into<00:05:29.110> kind<00:05:29.620> of<00:05:29.680> a<00:05:30.150> u-shape<00:05:31.150> and

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
come out here into kind of a u-shape and

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.260 
come out here into kind of a u-shape and
so<00:05:32.860> that<00:05:33.010> should<00:05:33.190> should<00:05:33.730> be<00:05:33.760> good

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
so that should should be good

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.270 
so that should should be good
give<00:05:34.930> me<00:05:35.050> some<00:05:35.230> automated<00:05:35.790> watering<00:05:38.280> so

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
give me some automated watering so

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.000 
give me some automated watering so
that's<00:05:39.400> phase<00:05:39.700> one<00:05:39.760> well<00:05:40.690> let<00:05:40.870> you<00:05:41.020> know<00:05:41.050> or

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
that's phase one well let you know or

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.590 
that's phase one well let you know or
I'll<00:05:42.130> give<00:05:42.400> an<00:05:42.490> update<00:05:42.580> once<00:05:42.970> we've<00:05:43.270> got<00:05:43.390> some

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 
I'll give an update once we've got some

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.920 
I'll give an update once we've got some
dirt<00:05:43.780> and<00:05:43.990> and<00:05:44.440> everything<00:05:44.620> like<00:05:44.860> that
