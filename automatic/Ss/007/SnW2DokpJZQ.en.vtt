00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.670
 who looks at current advertising the 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.970
 know that these movies or photos are in style 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.200
 The 70s are currently in full swing 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.090
 but how do you get to his 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.210
 artwork if the original photo so 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.340
 looked quite easy with analog 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.170
 projects by franzis verlag i am 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.349
 markus baur and I show now like that 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.029
 is working 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.669
 simply opens analog projects and 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.529
 Get right out of the program 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:30.900
 output image in the surface of 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.820
 analog projects you see within 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.460
 fractions of a second gets her already 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.080
 various picture examples displayed as yours 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.300
 photo can look like 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.460
 In this case I would like something 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.190
 That's why we use it 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.850
 this preset here and we use that 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.850
 expert mode 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:52.130
 in expert mode we can then target 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.390
 select which effect for our picture 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.500
 should be applied 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.120
 I have a few here 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.080
 prepared and we will switch now 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.200
 one after the other 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.870
 then, as a first degradation curve 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.330
 bit sepia tint the first 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.250
 Exposure error please one more 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.130
 install exposure error because that is 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.960
 yes, just the part of this 70s years 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.110
 Now I want something more colorful 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.910
 luminosity a vignette would be nice 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.390
 a little more sparkle in the light 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:23.570
 bring structure is still missing and too good 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.729
 last the typical film frame from the 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.930
 analog time 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.610
 is interesting in the context too 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.170
 even if you look for example 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.509
 detail of an exposure error 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.520
 You can click here and see 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.190
 then show the respective error 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.330
 let or choose the man in the 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.670
 wants to install image 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.460
 we see this sparkle from the right here 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.350
 above and that's exactly how it works 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.590
 you can also see in this picture here 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.590
 can 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.610
 if you like the picture then just 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.250
 result image save a name 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.570
 forgive 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.490
 the picture will be in the 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.190
 calculated full size and that's it 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.200
 beautiful 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:07.259
 you see so easily you come from such 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.360
 photos on these photos in total 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.420
 hip style of the good old 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.250
 analog fotowelt much fun 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.250
 imitate with analog projects
