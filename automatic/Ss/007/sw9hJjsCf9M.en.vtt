on you and a digital terrestrial and
television<00:00:20.910> service<00:00:21.270> okay<00:00:21.869> now<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.470> consists

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
television service okay now it consists

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.310 
television service okay now it consists
of<00:00:22.859> four<00:00:23.100> basic<00:00:23.550> parts<00:00:23.730> okay<00:00:24.180> on<00:00:24.539> my<00:00:24.930> left<00:00:25.140> hand

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
of four basic parts okay on my left hand

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.220 
of four basic parts okay on my left hand
side<00:00:25.439> here<00:00:25.890> we<00:00:26.189> have<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.369> UHF<00:00:26.820> area<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.869> a

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
side here we have a UHF area this is a

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.279 
side here we have a UHF area this is a
black<00:00:28.439> lip<00:00:28.740> wideband<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:30.090> Ariel<00:00:30.510> who<00:00:30.840> chosen

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
black lip wideband to Ariel who chosen

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.569 
black lip wideband to Ariel who chosen
specifically<00:00:31.679> because<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.189> covers<00:00:32.489> the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
specifically because it covers the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.940 
specifically because it covers the
entire<00:00:32.610> immunogen<00:00:33.570> spectrum<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.559> ideal

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
entire immunogen spectrum and is ideal

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.880 
entire immunogen spectrum and is ideal
for<00:00:35.329> receiving<00:00:36.329> Savita<00:00:36.989> t<00:00:37.170> there's<00:00:37.710> no

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
for receiving Savita t there's no

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.920 
for receiving Savita t there's no
recorded<00:00:38.370> versions<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:38.969> which<00:00:39.480> may<00:00:39.690> work

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
recorded versions of this which may work

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.569 
recorded versions of this which may work
slightly<00:00:40.379> better<00:00:40.530> at<00:00:40.739> certain<00:00:40.920> transmitters

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
slightly better at certain transmitters

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.610 
slightly better at certain transmitters
with<00:00:42.030> because<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.480> Deacon<00:00:42.809> T<00:00:42.930> Sigma<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.410> quite

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
with because the Deacon T Sigma is quite

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.410 
with because the Deacon T Sigma is quite
strong<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.700> area<00:00:44.940> will<00:00:45.239> walk

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
strong and this area will walk

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.479 
strong and this area will walk
conversely<00:00:45.899> on<00:00:46.020> locations<00:00:46.559> quite<00:00:46.770> well<00:00:46.980> so

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
conversely on locations quite well so

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.950 
conversely on locations quite well so
the<00:00:47.610> earlier<00:00:47.850> itself<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.420> made<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.690> three

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
the earlier itself is made of three

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.950 
the earlier itself is made of three
parts<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.739> main<00:00:49.980> area<00:00:50.370> deflection<00:00:51.329> here<00:00:51.570> and

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
parts the main area deflection here and

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.720 
parts the main area deflection here and
also<00:00:52.320> we<00:00:52.649> have<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> bracket<00:00:53.070> with<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.370> mounts

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
also we have a bracket with the mounts

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.389 
also we have a bracket with the mounts
onto<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.000> back<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.360> area<00:00:54.600> which<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.899> here

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
onto the back of the area which is here

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.369 
onto the back of the area which is here
and<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.090> used<00:00:57.300> exactly<00:00:57.750> hearing<00:00:58.230> with

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
and this is used exactly hearing with

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.959 
and this is used exactly hearing with
ultra<00:00:58.770> Bowl<00:00:59.039> okay<00:00:59.489> so<00:01:00.390> that's<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.289> basic

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
ultra Bowl okay so that's the basic

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.920 
ultra Bowl okay so that's the basic
absolute<00:01:03.409> okay<00:01:04.790> so<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:05.939> theory<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.479> learn<00:01:06.659> of

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
absolute okay so this theory of learn of

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.620 
absolute okay so this theory of learn of
the<00:01:07.110> way<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.070> next<00:01:08.189> campus<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.150> the

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
the way and the next campus of that the

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.920 
the way and the next campus of that the
sedusa<00:01:10.430> is<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.670> actual<00:01:12.060> bracket<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.780> this

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
sedusa is the actual bracket that this

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.170 
sedusa is the actual bracket that this
will<00:01:13.080> mark<00:01:13.229> on<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:14.010> we<00:01:14.130> have<00:01:14.310> here<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.790> private

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
will mark on so we have here a private

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.910 
will mark on so we have here a private
that<00:01:15.299> actually<00:01:15.600> comes<00:01:15.840> off<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.439> sky<00:01:16.650> it's

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
that actually comes off of the sky it's

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.730 
that actually comes off of the sky it's
not<00:01:17.070> like<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:18.299> now<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.380> ideal<00:01:19.710> for

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
not like this and now it's ideal for

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.410 
not like this and now it's ideal for
this<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.310> can<00:01:20.400> buy<00:01:20.549> them<00:01:20.759> separately<00:01:20.970> off<00:01:21.299> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
this you can buy them separately off the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.420 
this you can buy them separately off the
TV<00:01:21.689> trade<00:01:21.930> website<00:01:22.409> what<00:01:22.830> happens<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.280> we

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
TV trade website what happens is we

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.060 
TV trade website what happens is we
drill<00:01:23.640> four<00:01:24.150> holes<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.750> wall<00:01:24.930> we<00:01:25.500> put<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.890> in

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
drill four holes in a wall we put it in

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.420 
drill four holes in a wall we put it in
a<00:01:26.869> plastic<00:01:27.869> box<00:01:28.409> which<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.829> can<00:01:29.040> see<00:01:29.189> here

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
a plastic box which you can see here

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.600 
a plastic box which you can see here
plus<00:01:30.119> I'm<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.540> bowls<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.380> cultures<00:01:32.070> should

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
plus I'm the bowls and cultures should

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.460 
plus I'm the bowls and cultures should
actually<00:01:32.880> bought<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.360> bracket<00:01:33.900> securely

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
actually bought this bracket securely

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.760 
actually bought this bracket securely
onto<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:35.009> wall<00:01:35.340> okay

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
onto a wall okay

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.830 
onto a wall okay
it's<00:01:37.770> quite<00:01:37.950> an<00:01:38.159> effective<00:01:38.520> way<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.450> mounting

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
it's quite an effective way of mounting

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.280 
it's quite an effective way of mounting
an<00:01:40.229> area<00:01:40.500> onto<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> wall<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.780> it<00:01:42.780> works<00:01:43.200> quite

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
an area onto a wall and it works quite

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.319 
an area onto a wall and it works quite
well<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.950> for<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.130> VTT<00:01:44.430> service<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.270> is

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
well and for the VTT service this is

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.480 
well and for the VTT service this is
normally<00:01:45.780> sufficient<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.320> get<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.470> good<00:01:47.280> signal

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
normally sufficient to get a good signal

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.999 
normally sufficient to get a good signal
and<00:01:47.939> if<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.869> move<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.350> fragmented<00:01:49.920> way
