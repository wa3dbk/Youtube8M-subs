00:00:01.489 --> 00:00:04.370 

so<00:00:02.489> next<00:00:02.670> up<00:00:02.909> is<00:00:03.120> replacing<00:00:03.690> the<00:00:03.779> brakes<00:00:04.049> now

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
so next up is replacing the brakes now

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.889 
so next up is replacing the brakes now
I'm<00:00:04.920> not<00:00:05.100> just<00:00:05.310> going<00:00:05.430> to<00:00:05.490> replace<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.660> pads

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
I'm not just going to replace the pads

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.549 
I'm not just going to replace the pads
which<00:00:07.319> is<00:00:07.499> what<00:00:07.680> you<00:00:08.000> have<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.150> do<00:00:09.330> FS<00:00:10.139> often

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
which is what you have to do FS often

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.700 
which is what you have to do FS often
I'm<00:00:11.009> also<00:00:11.160> going<00:00:11.370> to<00:00:11.429> give<00:00:11.719> the<00:00:12.719> brake<00:00:13.320> arms<00:00:13.620> a

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
I'm also going to give the brake arms a

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.619 
I'm also going to give the brake arms a
bit<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:13.919> an<00:00:14.009> overhaul<00:00:14.429> take<00:00:15.059> them<00:00:15.209> apart<00:00:15.299> and

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:15.629 
bit of an overhaul take them apart and

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:17.750 
bit of an overhaul take them apart and
regress<00:00:16.200> them<00:00:16.440> because<00:00:17.190> I'm<00:00:17.400> guessing<00:00:17.550> if

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
regress them because I'm guessing if

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.790 
regress them because I'm guessing if
it's<00:00:17.880> an<00:00:18.000> old<00:00:18.210> bike<00:00:18.449> then<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.019> chances<00:00:19.380> are<00:00:19.560> a

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
it's an old bike then the chances are a

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.300 
it's an old bike then the chances are a
lot<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.430> dirts<00:00:20.730> when<00:00:20.939> I've<00:00:21.060> got<00:00:21.210> in<00:00:21.330> there<00:00:21.570> and

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
lot of dirts when I've got in there and

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.380 
lot of dirts when I've got in there and
they're<00:00:23.310> not<00:00:23.430> going<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.609> be<00:00:23.699> quite<00:00:23.939> as<00:00:24.029> springy

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
they're not going to be quite as springy

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.980 
they're not going to be quite as springy
as<00:00:24.570> they<00:00:24.689> used<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:25.019> be<00:00:26.480> so<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.570> first<00:00:27.779> thing<00:00:27.900> to

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
as they used to be so the first thing to

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.950 
as they used to be so the first thing to
do<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.380> release<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.710> brakes<00:00:29.630> which<00:00:30.630> do

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
do is to release the brakes which do

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.560 
do is to release the brakes which do
what<00:00:31.349> put<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.800> cross<00:00:31.980> up<00:00:32.220> that<00:00:32.400> pushing<00:00:33.330> them<00:00:33.450> to

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
what put a cross up that pushing them to

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.049 
what put a cross up that pushing them to
the<00:00:33.660> side<00:00:37.280> you<00:00:38.280> then<00:00:38.430> need<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.640> get<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.910> wheel

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
the side you then need to get the wheel

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.950 
the side you then need to get the wheel
off<00:00:39.239> she<00:00:40.110> can<00:00:40.260> do<00:00:40.469> apply<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.809> in<00:00:42.809> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
off she can do apply and in the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.049 
off she can do apply and in the
quick-release<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:45.379> it's<00:00:46.379> good<00:00:46.910> put<00:00:47.910> this

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
quick-release and it's good put this

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:57.790 
quick-release and it's good put this
back

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.509 

next<00:00:58.800> up<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.250> release<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> brake<00:00:59.879> blocks

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
next up is to release the brake blocks

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.260 
next up is to release the brake blocks
so<00:01:02.519> you<00:01:02.789> just<00:01:03.090> use<00:01:03.269> your<00:01:03.300> allen<00:01:03.780> key<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:05.270> untie

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
so you just use your allen key and untie

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.960 
so you just use your allen key and untie
them<00:01:09.560> it's<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.680> good<00:01:10.860> idea<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.430> remember<00:01:11.820> the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
them it's a good idea to remember the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.280 
them it's a good idea to remember the
order<00:01:12.149> of<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:14.210> washers<00:01:15.210> on<00:01:15.390> here<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.050> can

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
order of the washers on here so you can

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.889 
order of the washers on here so you can
just<00:01:16.490> quite<00:01:17.490> easily<00:01:17.670> replace<00:01:18.149> them<00:01:18.390> back<00:01:18.750> in

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
just quite easily replace them back in

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:26.800 
just quite easily replace them back in
the<00:01:19.020> same<00:01:20.000> position<00:01:21.000> they<00:01:21.119> were<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.270> before<00:01:21.479> I

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.120 

do<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.899> quick<00:01:28.229> comparison<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:30.890> new<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.070> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
do a quick comparison of the new and the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.370 
do a quick comparison of the new and the
old<00:01:32.369> brake<00:01:32.729> blocks<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.240> can<00:01:33.270> clearly<00:01:33.929> see<00:01:34.110> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
old brake blocks you can clearly see the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.490 
old brake blocks you can clearly see the
difference<00:01:34.820> the<00:01:35.820> old<00:01:35.970> one<00:01:36.179> is<00:01:36.360> severely<00:01:37.229> worn

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
difference the old one is severely worn

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.100 
difference the old one is severely worn
out<00:01:37.740> where's<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.880> new<00:01:39.060> one<00:01:39.240> but<00:01:39.750> looking<00:01:39.990> very

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
out where's the new one but looking very

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.279 
out where's the new one but looking very
fresh<00:01:40.350> here<00:01:41.210> now<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.270> both<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.750> pads<00:01:42.990> are<00:01:43.200> off

off because the salt can create can make

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.200 
off because the salt can create can make
it<00:02:52.480> rusty<00:02:52.810> and<00:02:52.930> create<00:02:53.170> problems<00:02:54.030> so<00:02:55.030> once

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
it rusty and create problems so once

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.470 
it rusty and create problems so once
that's<00:02:55.420> done<00:02:55.780> dry<00:02:57.090> you've<00:02:58.090> given<00:02:58.330> it<00:02:58.390> a<00:02:58.450> good

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
that's done dry you've given it a good

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.960 
that's done dry you've given it a good
clean<00:02:58.870> then<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.860> next<00:03:00.100> part<00:03:00.220> is<00:03:00.400> to<00:03:00.460> add<00:03:00.700> some

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
clean then the next part is to add some

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.530 
clean then the next part is to add some
grease<00:03:01.770> now<00:03:02.770> you<00:03:03.610> can<00:03:03.760> pick<00:03:03.940> up<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.210> tub<00:03:04.420> of

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
grease now you can pick up the tub of

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.880 
grease now you can pick up the tub of
grease<00:03:04.750> are<00:03:05.050> pretty<00:03:05.740> cheap<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:08.680> want<00:03:08.830> to

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
grease are pretty cheap and you want to

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.520 
grease are pretty cheap and you want to
be<00:03:08.950> fairly<00:03:09.310> liberal<00:03:09.640> with<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.530> application

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
be fairly liberal with the application

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:19.750 
be fairly liberal with the application
of<00:03:11.650> it<00:03:12.510> on<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:13.810> different<00:03:14.110> parts

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.259 

so<00:03:20.480> you<00:03:20.569> basically<00:03:20.750> want<00:03:21.019> to<00:03:21.170> apply<00:03:21.530> it<00:03:21.590> to

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
so you basically want to apply it to

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:27.240 
so you basically want to apply it to
moving<00:03:23.269> parts<00:03:23.659> and<00:03:23.870> parts<00:03:24.319> like<00:03:24.470> this<00:03:24.620> screw

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.470 

this<00:03:28.250> basically<00:03:28.610> keeps<00:03:28.819> the<00:03:28.970> water<00:03:29.150> out<00:03:29.360> and

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
this basically keeps the water out and

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.570 
this basically keeps the water out and
it<00:03:29.690> keeps<00:03:29.900> all<00:03:30.080> the<00:03:30.170> different<00:03:30.470> parts<00:03:30.769> rust

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
it keeps all the different parts rust

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:38.330 
it keeps all the different parts rust
free<00:03:31.909> and<00:03:32.120> keeps<00:03:32.299> them<00:03:32.480> moving

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.530 

the<00:03:39.340> other<00:03:39.490> part<00:03:39.670> you<00:03:39.760> want<00:03:39.880> to<00:03:39.940> apply<00:03:40.180> grease

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
the other part you want to apply grease

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:47.100 
the other part you want to apply grease
to<00:03:40.570> is<00:03:41.080> the<00:03:42.330> attachment<00:03:43.330> here<00:03:45.900> here<00:03:46.900> you<00:03:46.960> want

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
to is the attachment here here you want

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.370 
to is the attachment here here you want
to<00:03:47.140> apply<00:03:47.320> pretty<00:03:48.040> liberally<00:03:48.460> all<00:03:49.380> over

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
to apply pretty liberally all over

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.290 
to apply pretty liberally all over
because<00:03:51.280> this<00:03:52.000> part<00:03:52.300> needs<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:52.570> be<00:03:52.690> very<00:03:53.590> well

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
because this part needs to be very well

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:05.300 
because this part needs to be very well
educated<00:03:55.300> you<00:03:57.390> can<00:03:58.650> reattach<00:03:59.650> a<00:04:00.400> very<00:04:01.360> calm

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.610 

now<00:04:06.310> there's<00:04:07.120> one<00:04:07.360> final<00:04:07.390> thing<00:04:07.960> to<00:04:08.200> be<00:04:08.530> aware

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
now there's one final thing to be aware

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.190 
now there's one final thing to be aware
of<00:04:08.920> here<00:04:09.160> is<00:04:09.310> that<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:10.420> three<00:04:10.840> different

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
of here is that the three different

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.900 
of here is that the three different
holes<00:04:11.470> that<00:04:12.070> this<00:04:12.280> can<00:04:12.490> go<00:04:12.610> into<00:04:14.460> so<00:04:15.460> generally

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
holes that this can go into so generally

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.400 
holes that this can go into so generally
speaking<00:04:16.270> you<00:04:16.390> want<00:04:16.420> to<00:04:16.570> be<00:04:16.690> in<00:04:16.840> the<00:04:16.930> middle<00:04:19.410> in

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
speaking you want to be in the middle in

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:21.780 
speaking you want to be in the middle in
the<00:04:20.470> middle<00:04:20.560> hole<00:04:20.920> which<00:04:21.220> works<00:04:21.430> for<00:04:21.580> most

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
the middle hole which works for most

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.670 
the middle hole which works for most
bikes<00:04:22.090> but<00:04:22.420> if<00:04:22.540> the<00:04:22.630> supremist<00:04:23.140> isn't<00:04:23.410> working

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
bikes but if the supremist isn't working

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.110 
bikes but if the supremist isn't working
very<00:04:23.710> well<00:04:23.860> then<00:04:24.190> you<00:04:24.280> can<00:04:24.430> adjust<00:04:24.760> it<00:04:24.940> by

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
very well then you can adjust it by

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.710 
very well then you can adjust it by
switching<00:04:25.720> to<00:04:25.930> one<00:04:26.080> of<00:04:26.170> the<00:04:26.260> other<00:04:26.410> holes<00:04:27.720> once

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
switching to one of the other holes once

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.770 
switching to one of the other holes once
you<00:04:28.810> even<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:30.000> cable<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.180> brake<00:04:31.360> cable<00:04:31.540> a

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
you even the cable the brake cable a

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:52.129 
you even the cable the brake cable a
quick<00:04:32.140> wipe<00:04:32.320> down<00:04:32.380> you<00:04:32.800> can<00:04:32.950> reattach<00:04:33.220> it

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:54.479 

now<00:04:53.139> it's<00:04:53.259> time<00:04:53.409> to<00:04:53.439> add<00:04:53.679> the<00:04:53.709> brake<00:04:54.009> pads<00:04:54.249> back

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:54.489 
now it's time to add the brake pads back

00:04:54.489 --> 00:04:58.459 
now it's time to add the brake pads back
in<00:04:54.899> make<00:04:55.899> sure<00:04:56.139> you<00:04:56.289> double<00:04:56.619> check<00:04:56.649> make<00:04:57.159> sure

00:04:58.459 --> 00:04:58.469 
in make sure you double check make sure

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:01.259 
in make sure you double check make sure
you<00:04:59.469> put<00:04:59.919> them<00:05:00.009> the<00:05:00.129> right<00:05:00.279> way<00:05:00.309> around<00:05:00.489> summer

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:01.269 
you put them the right way around summer

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:04.139 
you put them the right way around summer
bar<00:05:01.539> to<00:05:01.719> the<00:05:01.899> front<00:05:01.929> arrow<00:05:02.699> and<00:05:03.699> I<00:05:03.759> left<00:05:03.969> it

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:04.149 
bar to the front arrow and I left it

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:16.270 
bar to the front arrow and I left it
right

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.500 

so<00:05:17.280> in<00:05:17.520> the<00:05:17.670> beginning<00:05:17.790> when<00:05:18.120> you<00:05:18.210> add<00:05:18.330> them

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
so in the beginning when you add them

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.770 
so in the beginning when you add them
back<00:05:18.690> in<00:05:18.900> you<00:05:19.470> want<00:05:19.650> to<00:05:19.740> just<00:05:19.950> tighten<00:05:20.520> it<00:05:20.780> very

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
back in you want to just tighten it very

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.780 
back in you want to just tighten it very
loosely<00:05:22.260> because<00:05:23.220> you'll<00:05:24.150> be<00:05:24.180> making<00:05:24.420> further

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 
loosely because you'll be making further

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:31.910 
loosely because you'll be making further
adjustments<00:05:26.790> later<00:05:27.750> on<00:05:30.410> so<00:05:31.410> do<00:05:31.620> the<00:05:31.740> same

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:31.920 
adjustments later on so do the same

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.000 
adjustments later on so do the same
thing<00:05:32.130> with<00:05:32.580> the<00:05:32.670> other<00:05:32.730> side<00:05:33.770> when<00:05:34.770> it<00:05:34.860> comes

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
thing with the other side when it comes

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.750 
thing with the other side when it comes
to<00:05:35.130> reattached<00:05:35.550> in<00:05:35.700> the<00:05:35.790> wheel<00:05:36.000> you<00:05:36.780> want<00:05:36.990> to

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
to reattached in the wheel you want to

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:44.450 
to reattached in the wheel you want to
pull<00:05:38.760> back<00:05:38.790> this<00:05:40.370> really<00:05:41.370> rail<00:05:41.670> like<00:05:42.000> this<00:05:43.460> and

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
pull back this really rail like this and

00:05:44.460 --> 00:06:03.390 
pull back this really rail like this and
then<00:05:44.880> as<00:05:45.720> your<00:05:46.050> wheel

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.640 

then<00:06:04.400> find<00:06:04.670> me<00:06:04.730> tighten<00:06:05.060> up<00:06:05.120> the<00:06:05.240> pads<00:06:05.450> and<00:06:06.110> to

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.650 
then find me tighten up the pads and to

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.220 
then find me tighten up the pads and to
do<00:06:06.800> that<00:06:06.980> you<00:06:07.100> want<00:06:07.250> them<00:06:07.400> to<00:06:07.430> touch<00:06:07.870> it's<00:06:08.870> good

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:09.230 
do that you want them to touch it's good

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.890 
do that you want them to touch it's good
touch<00:06:09.440> flatly<00:06:09.890> against<00:06:10.190> the<00:06:10.370> rim<00:06:10.750> make<00:06:11.750> sure

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
touch flatly against the rim make sure

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.740 
touch flatly against the rim make sure
they're<00:06:12.020> not<00:06:12.080> touching<00:06:12.410> the<00:06:12.500> tire<00:06:12.710> at<00:06:12.890> all<00:06:13.750> and

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
they're not touching the tire at all and

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.030 
they're not touching the tire at all and
they<00:06:14.960> should<00:06:15.140> be<00:06:15.230> meeting<00:06:15.530> it<00:06:15.620> square<00:06:15.920> on

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.040 
they should be meeting it square on

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.540 
they should be meeting it square on
effectively<00:06:17.650> so<00:06:18.650> the<00:06:18.740> best<00:06:18.890> way<00:06:19.040> to<00:06:19.070> do<00:06:19.310> it<00:06:19.430> is

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
effectively so the best way to do it is

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.770 
effectively so the best way to do it is
to<00:06:19.730> push<00:06:19.940> it<00:06:20.120> tight<00:06:20.720> against<00:06:21.170> the<00:06:22.630> against<00:06:23.630> the

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:23.780 
to push it tight against the against the

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:29.680 
to push it tight against the against the
rim<00:06:27.580> and<00:06:28.580> then<00:06:28.730> once<00:06:29.180> you've<00:06:29.330> got<00:06:29.360> it<00:06:29.480> in<00:06:29.600> the

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:29.690 
rim and then once you've got it in the

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.400 
rim and then once you've got it in the
right<00:06:29.780> position<00:06:31.390> tighten<00:06:32.390> up<00:06:32.450> the<00:06:32.600> spot<00:06:32.840> make

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:33.410 
right position tighten up the spot make

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.570 
right position tighten up the spot make
sure<00:06:33.440> you<00:06:33.620> do<00:06:33.800> it<00:06:33.860> very<00:06:34.430> very<00:06:34.580> tight<00:06:36.130> and<00:06:37.130> then

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.580 
sure you do it very very tight and then

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.330 
sure you do it very very tight and then
to<00:06:37.850> double-check<00:06:38.150> that<00:06:38.300> it's<00:06:38.510> tight<00:06:38.750> enough

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:39.340 
to double-check that it's tight enough

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.830 
to double-check that it's tight enough
simply<00:06:40.340> try<00:06:41.000> and<00:06:41.120> move<00:06:41.210> this<00:06:41.390> with<00:06:41.540> your<00:06:41.660> hand

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:41.840 
simply try and move this with your hand

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.260 
simply try and move this with your hand
as<00:06:42.350> long<00:06:42.470> as<00:06:42.650> it's<00:06:42.800> completely<00:06:43.670> solid<00:06:43.910> then

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:44.270 
as long as it's completely solid then

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:53.830 
as long as it's completely solid then
you're<00:06:44.840> good<00:06:44.960> to<00:06:44.990> go

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.900
