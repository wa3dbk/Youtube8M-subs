Intimidator itself now one thing that
you<00:00:53.210> can<00:00:53.449> notice<00:00:53.690> with<00:00:54.530> this<00:00:54.680> light<00:00:54.979> is<00:00:57.309> it's<00:00:58.309> a

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
you can notice with this light is it's a

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.450 
you can notice with this light is it's a
lot<00:00:59.360> smaller<00:00:59.600> than<00:01:00.110> its<00:01:00.290> bigger<00:01:00.530> brothers<00:01:00.979> and

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
lot smaller than its bigger brothers and

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.840 
lot smaller than its bigger brothers and
there's<00:01:01.820> a<00:01:01.879> reason<00:01:02.239> for<00:01:02.269> that<00:01:02.769> it<00:01:03.820> not<00:01:04.820> only

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
there's a reason for that it not only

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.980 
there's a reason for that it not only
has<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:05.920> SST<00:01:06.920> 50<00:01:07.340> in<00:01:07.460> it<00:01:07.610> but<00:01:08.180> it<00:01:08.450> doesn't<00:01:08.780> have

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
the battery pack that as bigger brothers

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.920 
the battery pack that as bigger brothers
does<00:01:11.680> so<00:01:12.680> this<00:01:13.490> light<00:01:13.760> although<00:01:14.420> it<00:01:14.570> has<00:01:14.720> the
