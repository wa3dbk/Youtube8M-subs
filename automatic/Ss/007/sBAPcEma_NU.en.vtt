00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.710
 Stefan but after another special week in your career, one is waiting now 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.950
 away match with Feyenoord against Heerenveen does not say that is one 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.489
 crucial 

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:14.199
 but I think they are all crucial from now on 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:16.120
 years are all christian horner 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.970
 to start with 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.789
 Saturday with Heerenveen which is a very difficult opponent for sure 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.279
 over time they are very strong and have current range 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.279
 so nec put recently 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.819
 yes know what awaits us and 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:33.670
 yes i think we are well prepared there is the power of Japan 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.370
 team of marco van basts 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.560
 yes she started a lot of quality especially for one with one 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.700
 very good your sites and 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.149
 finnbogason they are just excellent players and then we have to go there 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.710
 just watch out 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.110
 We also believe in our quality and we are simply concerned with three points 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.380
 make it to the cup competition 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.690
 talk about special evenings with all those penalties in mind 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:57.780
 me on 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.610
 yes exactly then 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.150
 it was a beautiful evening 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.610
 worked out well for us 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.180
 years after thereafter penalty kick only after 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.329
 we got there anyway 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:11.329
 Perhaps unnecessary two goals from weesp wondering what's going on nowadays 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.650
 yes they can still drag one and an extension 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.560
 his other circumstances makes the final phase a particularly exciting one 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.880
 competition in which you are a kilo, it will happen without pellet 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.370
 likes 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.870
 many people have been busy for a long time 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.540
 bmw continuously or not 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.550
 yes but you have to 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.550
 have made demi great that's just the way it is 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.350
 that was suspended and that effortlessly and must do 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.940
 Also with the team that in the city we have every confidence 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.950
 tips the supply has been given a training to solve this 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.390
 in terms of arrangement 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.460
 well tips in I am also plus 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.080
 yesterday I ended up again after the international match 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.080
 and then of course I am going to focus on the 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.590
 also Heerenveen and no 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.590
 wherever they go about what to do with the trainer 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.650
 well talked about it 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.970
 the trainer is also not saying anything about speaking at a press conference 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.979
 And that's up to the trainer's disappointment to live 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.120
 Brandon is talking about you and you are on your way for a good week 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.340
 Dutch national team plays two good World Cup qualifying matches 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.859
 what do you have in particular personal to such a week 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:27.249
 nevertheless remains where you have a point on a higher level with 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.869
 yes with the better and fellow players and 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:33.859
 and that is nice to have 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:38.869
 because to be with because to look at yourself we stand and certainly with 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:40.109
 such 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:43.269
 players walking around there is fun to see if you are in there 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.389
 Go along with Basel's conclusion for yourself if you compare yourself or 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:50.499
 say to colleagues and competitors of course 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:52.049
 well it is anyway 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.920
 I always like to be where they are 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.049
 how good they are still a mazda they found 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.619
 seated there 

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:02.549
 in to the training site and in competitions yes 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.449
 those boys are ready for that 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:07.789
 there is an absolute top and that is in the street 

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:11.189
 many young boys they were now bees and who dives there can win the tour as well 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:13.209
 for which many steps still have to be taken 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.499
 yes because then it is also about your personal it is about this again 

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:18.379
 club about your contracts from you 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:22.190
 I once said I would only talk about both after this competition 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.519
 or add it yourself if you go into your own future 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.719
 still eleventh year and that also with feyenoord 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:32.109
 agreed and that of marwijk just fine that there 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:36.480
 yes it is just an important period for the feyenoord now with the 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:38.529
 last seven games in which 

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:41.949
 many years of play and then the most important thing is me 

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:45.689
 we just use that to focus completely and that it just goes well and 

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:49.309
 Jelle can approach after the competition can be binoculars 

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:53.939
 the final ranking of feyenoord in this competition if you had to be a champion now 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:56.939
 at least twenty league play a role in your choice 

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:59.899
 well that does play along 

00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:04.479
 yes I think that I am still stepping out but I can go to feyenoord 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:07.119
 every week it gets better and better 

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:08.290
 and 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.290
 yes that I can still make that stepper but yes it is of course true 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.269
 that the development is faster if you also play European football and 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.380
 the throat not only applies to me March yes to the whole team to many young 

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:21.709
 boys walk 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.070
 yes, who still wants to be able to develop, and that goes faster anyway 

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:27.520
 was also European plays 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.229
 is that stefan for the young about continuing another two questions about also a whole 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.830
 difficult choice because you have that world cup in brazil later and you also know if 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:35.700
 you keep pulling 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.490
 you never know for sure that you will get injured here too 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.590
 another year 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.629
 then you play for a year in the run-up to a World Cup and at a foreign club 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:44.449
 is that again to wait 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:47.180
 yes of course those are things that go through your head 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.529
 in riots 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:51.580
 yes we think about it and that is how decisions can be 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.439
 and I can have crystals and 

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:55.889
 and that 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.710
 yes that also indicates but for the rest of your career how it goes and 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.099
 so it should be good that think about it carefully and consider all options 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:06.620
 it is your interest as a consultant in this 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.120
 well that there are several with family my girlfriend and business observers 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.919
 you just talk there 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:16.249
 about such things and I just find it very difficult for sure because it is now 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:17.949
 for the first time 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:21.159
 for the second time I am concerned because I am still natural 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:22.189
 very young and 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:25.089
 that is why we think very carefully about it 

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:27.839
 are you done with the premier league as left and right were suggested from the 

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:28.389
 neighborhood 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:31.710
 no, certainly not off that is a huge out of context and 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.780
 yes that happens more often that you are after such a game and and therefore saw the 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.120
 mixed zone dead to 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.440
 different journalists speaks and 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.380
 year four inter times that good and one not and that it is often magnified 

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:46.900
 but no, that certainly did not happen 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.639
 seven more games how many points have been taken to become a champion 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:51.599
 do you think 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:54.479
 yeah that's a good one that's hard that 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.569
 You can't think right now because you don't know it 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:01.310
 what competitors are going to do but year that was very close together and 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:05.159
 yes I think we are just all the games that are coming 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:06.810
 years to go to win everything
