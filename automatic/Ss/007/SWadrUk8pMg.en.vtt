00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:05.410
 a nice haunt goes without by Timor frugal too too in the 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.900
 Fuel guzzler ass for years, the auto industry promises us to further sink the 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.139
 Fuel consumption good environmental conscience and high gasoline prices just that 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.260
 German carmakers celebrate themselves as the experts for more fuel-efficient engines as well 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.460
 because they hang behind the trend electric car Thaci me 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.380
 we wanted to know how good we really are when it comes to saving fuel 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.550
 our father Hans Koberstein and CEO Sperling a few test drives in the 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.310
 Urban traffic was undertaken when he opposed brand new models 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.520
 Where other cars stop saving them with their car start-stop feature 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.770
 was that easy 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.010
 Users the more frequently reduced signs for more efficiency 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.460
 Chemnitz 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.670
 next to the neck June and highly efficient cars 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.050
 what is it 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.800
 We do the test with the most economical Finder gasoline engine on the BMW has to offer 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.650
 the 523 the refreshingly exciting 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.479
 we compare this with a ten year old predecessor model 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.360
 We start together in the Berlin city traffic 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.010
 Rides same pace 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.260
 always under each other 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.460
 both BMW are petrol have six-cylinder 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.070
 three liters of displacement and more than 200 hp 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.720
 after spending 100 kilometers we would have consumption at the gas station 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.130
 Result of the old BMW consumed on 100 kilometers 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.530
 penalty 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.480
 a classic is intended 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.910
 and the new economy car 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.290
 new municipality 1 liter just two liters less 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.340
 For decades, Axel Friedrich has made the Federal Environmental Agency into economical engines 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.490
 worked 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.610
 his comment on the 9 liter car of BMW and one too much for 1 2 to 1 4 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.020
 because we know it works 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.479
 with half also operate such a vehicle in city traffic 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.960
 the car salon in Paris last week 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.750
 BMW proudly presents its fuel-saving technology 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.729
 Testers Hex 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:19.319
 we ask questions 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.379
 in the comparison, it has been shown that he has two liters to its predecessor 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.549
 consume less 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.689
 9 liters is what I think about what we do 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.459
 The city traffic that he is now not the ideal claim area 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:32.269
 on 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.900
 Aigner asked for such a vehicle if you are happy 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.709
 Satisfied with my parents 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.399
 for this motorization year 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:42.629
 looking easy is to make her happy 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.040
 Mercedes on the opposite side wants to beat them all here you do not announce 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.720
 less than a second out of 2 mobile 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.279
 revolution 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:55.400
 but then our company founders had an idea 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.400
 which changed our locomotion forever 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.359
 a new challenge 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.299
 Millions of cars emitting thousands of tons of CO2 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:12.680
 Although it is for our next big idea our goal is the zero emission 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.239
 Mobility the way there 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.239
 Blue Efficiency 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:20.439
 do we 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:25.099
 with the new e-class BlueEFFICIENCY our comparison photo is this time 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.929
 especially old predecessor model 

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:30.219
 the 200's 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:33.689
 Farmer 1974 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.029
 followed before the test franc 

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:37.490
 and then it works again 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.130
 good in a row 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.130
 the same speed through the Berlin city traffic 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:45.099
 both cars drive with diesel 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.099
 Colors four-cylinder and colorful two-liter displacement 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.659
 but the new e-class had three times more 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.519
 After 100 kilometers we fill up again full 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.519
 at the same time 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:04.379
 first the Mercedes vintage car from the seventies 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.939
 he needs just 100 kilometers of city traffic Oh come on 6 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:10.749
 liter 

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:13.749
 and the new Automobile Revolution 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:18.079
 barely less than seven point 5 meters 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.190
 Rheine lean result three decades of German engineering 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.720
 and deliver a fuel savings of just 1 formally 1 

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:28.740
 Progress a snail 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.099
 moves slowly 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:33.999
 Of course, the new Mercedes has power for performance and speed 

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:35.229
 above all, more mass 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:39.160
 and that means in the end also consumes more energy because of it 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.280
 The progress in engine technology has also been seen 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.159
 and this at the dams 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.330
 Always stronger 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.210
 always faster 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.270
 only in consumption hardly anything has prevented despite Luk Pfaff fishing goal 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.379
 At the Paris Motor Show we show the Mercedes board our test result 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:59.709
 one liter less consumption after 36 years of research and development 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.020
 know in Wieseck CW 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.789
 maybe they are now going the surname of 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:07.819
 just go for a show 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:10.819
 when we sum up the car's properties of ideas 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:18.909
 is the flood is initiated 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:21.509
 despite the embarrassing result 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:25.559
 a few halls further Volkswagen also has a new chic buzzword 

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:26.490
 found 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.479
 Zoom oven is called this 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:31.539
 so that the Gulf should be particularly economical 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:34.559
 Let's go see that comparison test 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:40.430
 In a backyard we find a rickety deregistered Golf built 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.059
 1982 

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:46.369
 for nine months he has not run anymore we get one 

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:49.369
 Day admission and off we go 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.689
 followed by deeds again 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:54.919
 drive in city traffic in a row 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:58.339
 front of the new Golf TDI BlueMotion 

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:01.339
 One diesel can do six liters of displacement 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:05.400
 The old Golf is still one of the first model series 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.560
 that took 5 more Golf generations to the newest BlueMotion 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.610
 after 100 kilometers Franconia again full 

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:16.930
 Results 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.020
 who old golf 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.020
 four municipalities 0 5 liters pretty little 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:25.849
 Ulf the Gulf with fresh flowers oven Loburg 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:27.809
 many come 9 2 liters 

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:32.689
 they brought a 20-year-old rattling hate against his high tech successor 

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:34.249
 born 

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:37.740
 against Philipp Lahm have the result for Volkswagen 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.069
 Head of development 

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:43.740
 he received Kurt Masur 82 had consumed scarce liters less than explain 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.200
 she that 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.220
 the court ordered both the comedy was not wanted that we 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.490
 these are fallen 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.979
 summery percent myself was a little over a percent ahead 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:57.139
 which seat is 1000 cars 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:06:58.999
 both the software and many others 

00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:00.580
 I can do that with the victories over 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.930
 we have fallen in a row city traffic hundred kilometers and the 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.030
 tv-man 9 5 use of the new Volvo 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.779
 Hundreds would be missing 

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:08.990
 then you will be safe 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.990
 The driver, too, if returning a refreshing big role 

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:14.699
 but bigger role still plays 

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:16.129
 the postage 

00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:18.819
 no matter if the fish and Dynamics 

00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:23.419
 Deep sea fish or plume scurry they consume in the city approximately 

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:26.399
 the same video before Altena predecessor models
