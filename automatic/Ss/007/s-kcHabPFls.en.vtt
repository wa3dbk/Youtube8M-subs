Chris McNamara with super topo we're
checking<00:00:06.029> out<00:00:06.300> how<00:00:06.720> to<00:00:07.229> do<00:00:07.410> a<00:00:07.439> lower<00:00:08.069> out

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.730 
checking out how to do a lower out
this<00:00:09.599> comes<00:00:10.139> after<00:00:10.469> either<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.429> pendulum<00:00:11.969> or<00:00:12.480> a

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
this comes after either a pendulum or a

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.770 
this comes after either a pendulum or a
big<00:00:13.740> traversing<00:00:14.429> pitch<00:00:14.700> where<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.389> leader

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
big traversing pitch where the leader

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.020 
big traversing pitch where the leader
didn't<00:00:16.110> leave<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.289> lot<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.560> gear<00:00:17.100> or<00:00:17.700> the<00:00:17.730> ropes

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.030 
didn't leave a lot of gear or the ropes

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.420 
didn't leave a lot of gear or the ropes
going<00:00:18.300> way<00:00:18.570> over<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.870> the<00:00:18.990> side<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.740> there's

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
going way over to the side and there's

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.510 
going way over to the side and there's
no<00:00:20.700> way<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:20.940> safely<00:00:21.480> get<00:00:22.470> over<00:00:22.740> there<00:00:22.980> without

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:23.520 
no way to safely get over there without

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.900 
no way to safely get over there without
doing<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.330> lower<00:00:24.570> out<00:00:24.890> so<00:00:25.890> first<00:00:26.490> thing<00:00:26.700> you<00:00:26.730> do

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
doing a lower out so first thing you do

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.480 
doing a lower out so first thing you do
is<00:00:27.090> if<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.300> have<00:00:27.420> any<00:00:27.540> back<00:00:27.810> up<00:00:28.020> knots<00:00:28.310> you<00:00:29.310> let

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
is if you have any back up knots you let

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.860 
is if you have any back up knots you let
them<00:00:29.580> out<00:00:30.170> you<00:00:31.170> then<00:00:31.430> want<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.690> take<00:00:33.690> your

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
them out you then want to take your

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.560 
them out you then want to take your
gris-gris<00:00:34.499> or<00:00:34.679> in<00:00:34.739> my<00:00:34.859> case<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.129> cinch<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.969> make

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
gris-gris or in my case a cinch and make

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.700 
gris-gris or in my case a cinch and make
sure<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.609> the<00:00:38.609> rope<00:00:38.879> it's<00:00:39.659> it's<00:00:40.019> on<00:00:40.289> and<00:00:40.649> it's

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
sure that the rope it's it's on and it's

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.790 
sure that the rope it's it's on and it's
close<00:00:41.399> because<00:00:41.730> you<00:00:42.329> want<00:00:42.539> you<00:00:42.839> very

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
close because you want you very

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.819 
close because you want you very
important<00:00:44.249> time<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.489> be<00:00:44.730> backed<00:00:45.239> up<00:00:45.829> because

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
important time to be backed up because

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.099 
important time to be backed up because
if<00:00:47.039> you're<00:00:47.730> ascenders<00:00:48.300> are<00:00:48.480> going<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.659> pop<00:00:48.899> off

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:49.109 
if you're ascenders are going to pop off

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:51.110 
if you're ascenders are going to pop off
it's<00:00:49.769> probably<00:00:50.219> going<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.370> be<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.609> this<00:00:50.789> type

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
it's probably going to be in this type

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.479 
it's probably going to be in this type
of<00:00:51.149> scenario<00:00:51.449> where<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.170> Rope<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.010> going<00:00:53.069> way

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
of scenario where the Rope is going way

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.380 
of scenario where the Rope is going way
to<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.789> side<00:00:54.440> so<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.649> upper<00:00:56.069> ascender<00:00:56.640> you

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
to the side so the upper ascender you

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.259 
to the side so the upper ascender you
want<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.600> put<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.899> up<00:00:58.499> and<00:00:59.039> leave<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.519> few<00:01:00.210> inches

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
want to put it up and leave a few inches

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:03.469 
want to put it up and leave a few inches
below<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.350> beaner<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.940> don't<00:01:03.089> want<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.329> get

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
below the beaner you don't want to get

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:07.219 
below the beaner you don't want to get
it<00:01:03.600> jammed<00:01:03.960> up<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.320> there<00:01:05.420> bottom<00:01:06.420> ascender<00:01:07.020> I

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
it jammed up in there bottom ascender I

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.440 
it jammed up in there bottom ascender I
put<00:01:07.649> just<00:01:07.920> kind<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.310> at<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> comfortable

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
put just kind of at a comfortable

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.889 
put just kind of at a comfortable
location<00:01:09.799> so<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:10.829> I<00:01:11.009> can<00:01:11.280> stand<00:01:11.689> this<00:01:12.689> were

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
location so that I can stand this were

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:18.219 
location so that I can stand this were
steeper<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.740> might<00:01:14.070> have<00:01:14.219> to<00:01:14.369> fifi<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:14.969> to<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.399> the

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
steeper I might have to fifi in to a the

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.950 
steeper I might have to fifi in to a the
lower<00:01:19.229> ascender<00:01:19.979> but<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.149> not<00:01:21.329> steep<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:21.899> I

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
lower ascender but it's not steep so I

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.319 
lower ascender but it's not steep so I
can<00:01:22.110> balance<00:01:22.439> myself<00:01:22.619> here<00:01:23.149> now<00:01:24.149> what<00:01:24.270> I'm

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
can balance myself here now what I'm

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.630 
can balance myself here now what I'm
gonna<00:01:24.420> do<00:01:24.539> is<00:01:24.659> take<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.530> rope<00:01:25.740> take<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> big

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
gonna do is take the rope take a big

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.899 
gonna do is take the rope take a big
bite<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.880> rope<00:01:27.180> from<00:01:27.570> my<00:01:27.810> waist<00:01:28.079> and<00:01:28.759> I'm<00:01:29.759> going

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
bite a rope from my waist and I'm going

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.410 
bite a rope from my waist and I'm going
to<00:01:29.939> pass<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.659> through<00:01:31.430> the<00:01:32.430> piece<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.270> I'm

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
to pass it through the piece that I'm

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.090 
to pass it through the piece that I'm
going<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.750> leaving<00:01:34.020> behind<00:01:34.649> when<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.009> do

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
going to be leaving behind when I do

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.550 
going to be leaving behind when I do
this<00:01:35.340> lower<00:01:35.670> out<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.539> in<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.780> case<00:01:37.049> this

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
this lower out so in this case this

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.179 
this lower out so in this case this
sling<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.250> going<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.490> get<00:01:38.609> left<00:01:38.909> behind<00:01:40.189> often

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
sling is going to get left behind often

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.399 
sling is going to get left behind often
when<00:01:41.399> you're<00:01:41.600> doing<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.659> lower<00:01:42.840> out<00:01:43.020> there<00:01:43.229> you

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
when you're doing a lower out there you

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.859 
when you're doing a lower out there you
either<00:01:43.649> be<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.920> bolt<00:01:44.280> or<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.640> Piton<00:01:45.149> or<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> fixed

belay loop clip that Bight of rope to
the<00:02:05.100> beaner<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:06.390> now<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.109> have<00:02:07.619> these<00:02:07.920> four

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
the beaner and now you have these four

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.640 
the beaner and now you have these four
strands<00:02:09.270> here<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:10.670> what<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.760> can<00:02:12.000> do<00:02:12.180> is

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
strands here and what you can do is

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.050 
strands here and what you can do is
start<00:02:13.650> yarding<00:02:14.310> up

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060

pulling<00:02:18.060> yourself<00:02:18.450> closer<00:02:18.810> into<00:02:19.110> that<00:02:19.260> piece

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
pulling yourself closer into that piece

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.270 
pulling yourself closer into that piece
now<00:02:20.670> what<00:02:20.790> I'm<00:02:20.880> going<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.030> do<00:02:21.150> is<00:02:21.320> shift<00:02:22.320> my

weight to my bottom foot and this is

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.130 
weight to my bottom foot and this is
going<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.200> let<00:02:28.620> me<00:02:28.770> take<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:30.210> top<00:02:30.540> ascender

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
going to let me take the top ascender

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.270 
going to let me take the top ascender
off<00:02:31.640> pass<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:33.090> piece<00:02:34.310> put<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.340> back<00:02:35.520> on<00:02:35.790> and

off pass the piece put it back on and

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.560 
off pass the piece put it back on and
now<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.870> can<00:02:39.870> take<00:02:40.800> my<00:02:40.860> weight<00:02:41.280> off<00:02:41.490> the<00:02:41.940> bottom

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
now I can take my weight off the bottom

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.010 
now I can take my weight off the bottom
ascender<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:44.150> now<00:02:45.150> I've<00:02:45.300> put<00:02:45.510> all<00:02:45.630> my<00:02:45.810> weight

on<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.740> strands<00:02:47.610> that<00:02:47.760> I<00:02:47.790> put<00:02:48.270> through<00:02:48.540> the

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
on the strands that I put through the

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.810 
on the strands that I put through the
lever<00:02:48.840> piece<00:02:49.170> I<00:02:49.470> can<00:02:50.280> now<00:02:50.900> unclip<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:53.610> rope

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
lever piece I can now unclip the rope

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.540 
lever piece I can now unclip the rope
through<00:02:54.239> that<00:02:54.390> beaner<00:02:55.130> I'm<00:02:56.130> going<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.400> take

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
through that beaner I'm going to take

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.640 
through that beaner I'm going to take
this<00:02:56.700> beaner<00:02:57.000> with<00:02:57.420> me<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:59.030> now<00:03:00.030> I<00:03:00.480> can<00:03:01.380> start

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
this beaner with me and now I can start

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.070 
this beaner with me and now I can start
letting<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.190> rope<00:03:02.370> out<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:02.910> doing<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.900> lower

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
letting the rope out and doing the lower

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:11.750 
letting the rope out and doing the lower
out<00:03:07.880> and<00:03:08.880> you<00:03:09.420> basically<00:03:09.600> just<00:03:10.530> lower<00:03:10.830> until

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
out and you basically just lower until

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.600 
out and you basically just lower until
you're<00:03:12.230> about<00:03:14.360> under<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.600> piece<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:17.370> once

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
you're about under the piece and once

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.289 
you're about under the piece and once
you're<00:03:17.760> under<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.270> piece<00:03:18.510> or<00:03:18.870> close<00:03:19.290> enough

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
you're under the piece or close enough

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.660 
you're under the piece or close enough
you<00:03:21.299> go<00:03:21.720> back<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.170> your<00:03:22.320> beaner<00:03:22.560> attached<00:03:23.370> to

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
you go back to your beaner attached to

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.960 
you go back to your beaner attached to
your<00:03:23.730> bleep<00:03:24.470> you<00:03:25.470> undo<00:03:25.860> it<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:26.580> then<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:26.820> can

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
your bleep you undo it and then you can

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.280 
your bleep you undo it and then you can
release<00:03:27.330> that<00:03:27.570> strand<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:28.410> pull<00:03:29.400> it<00:03:29.580> through

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
release that strand and pull it through

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.810 
release that strand and pull it through
and<00:03:32.420> now<00:03:33.420> you're<00:03:33.630> ready<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:33.959> keep<00:03:34.230> going<00:03:34.820> at

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
and now you're ready to keep going at

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.670 
and now you're ready to keep going at
this<00:03:35.880> point<00:03:36.299> what<00:03:36.720> I<00:03:36.750> would<00:03:36.930> probably<00:03:37.110> do<00:03:37.440> is

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
this point what I would probably do is

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.080 
this point what I would probably do is
tie<00:03:39.170> a<00:03:40.170> back<00:03:40.769> up<00:03:40.980> not<00:03:41.160> just<00:03:41.760> because<00:03:41.910> there's

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
tie a back up not just because there's

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.150 
tie a back up not just because there's
probably<00:03:42.390> going<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:42.630> be<00:03:42.690> a<00:03:42.720> lot<00:03:43.019> of<00:03:43.049> extra<00:03:43.830> rope

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
probably going to be a lot of extra rope

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.460 
probably going to be a lot of extra rope
hanging<00:03:44.459> below<00:03:44.910> you<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.239> you<00:03:45.959> don't<00:03:46.200> want

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
hanging below you and you don't want

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.910 
hanging below you and you don't want
more<00:03:47.220> extra<00:03:47.670> rope<00:03:47.880> then<00:03:48.150> you<00:03:48.540> can<00:03:48.690> manage<00:03:48.959> for

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
more extra rope then you can manage for

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.259 
more extra rope then you can manage for
all<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.130> reasons<00:03:50.250> we've<00:03:50.580> covered<00:03:50.790> you<00:03:51.090> don't

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
all the reasons we've covered you don't

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.539 
all the reasons we've covered you don't
want<00:03:51.480> it<00:03:51.650> getting<00:03:52.650> stuck<00:03:52.860> in<00:03:52.980> a<00:03:53.040> crack<00:03:53.280> or

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
want it getting stuck in a crack or

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.160 
want it getting stuck in a crack or
swinging<00:03:54.120> over<00:03:54.390> and<00:03:54.630> getting<00:03:54.750> hooked<00:03:54.930> on<00:03:55.110> a

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
swinging over and getting hooked on a

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.110 
swinging over and getting hooked on a
flake<00:03:55.549> so<00:03:56.549> that's<00:03:57.390> how<00:03:57.510> you<00:03:57.570> do<00:03:57.720> a<00:03:57.750> lower<00:03:58.019> out

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
flake so that's how you do a lower out

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.000 
flake so that's how you do a lower out
maybe<00:04:00.120> one<00:04:00.360> of<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.510> more<00:04:00.660> complex<00:04:01.170> parts<00:04:01.799> of

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
maybe one of the more complex parts of

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.520 
maybe one of the more complex parts of
cleaning<00:04:02.549> on<00:04:02.670> a<00:04:02.700> big<00:04:02.940> wall<00:04:03.120> but<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:03.810> practice

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
cleaning on a big wall but you practice

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:15.020 
cleaning on a big wall but you practice
a<00:04:04.650> few<00:04:04.799> times<00:04:04.860> and<00:04:05.400> you'll<00:04:05.519> have<00:04:05.640> it<00:04:05.760> dialed

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.090 

you
