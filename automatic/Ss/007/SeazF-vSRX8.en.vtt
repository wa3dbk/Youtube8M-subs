stable one one issue i did have

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.950 
stable one one issue i did have
initially<00:04:24.729> when<00:04:25.090> i<00:04:25.180> when<00:04:25.419> i<00:04:25.479> first<00:04:25.720> tried<00:04:25.900> this

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
initially when i when i first tried this

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.300 
initially when i when i first tried this
on<00:04:26.320> it<00:04:26.880> felt<00:04:27.880> like<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.240> heel<00:04:28.479> collar<00:04:29.310> the

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
on it felt like the heel collar the

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.689 
on it felt like the heel collar the
material<00:04:30.849> is<00:04:30.880> a<00:04:30.970> little<00:04:31.330> bit<00:04:31.510> rigid<00:04:31.780> on<00:04:32.770> the

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:35.730 
material is a little bit rigid on the
ankle<00:04:33.909> collar<00:04:34.270> here<00:04:34.690> where<00:04:35.020> your<00:04:35.199> where<00:04:35.590> your

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
ankle collar here where your where your

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.980 
ankle collar here where your where your
ankle<00:04:36.400> bone<00:04:36.550> sits<00:04:36.970> and<00:04:37.360> I<00:04:37.389> think<00:04:37.630> it's<00:04:37.750> cut<00:04:37.960> a

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
ankle bone sits and I think it's cut a

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.710 
ankle bone sits and I think it's cut a
little<00:04:38.229> bit<00:04:38.440> high<00:04:38.760> so<00:04:39.760> it<00:04:39.970> was<00:04:40.120> it<00:04:40.419> felt<00:04:40.570> like

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
little bit high so it was it felt like

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.300 
little bit high so it was it felt like
it<00:04:40.870> was<00:04:40.960> digging<00:04:41.349> in<00:04:41.500> a<00:04:41.590> little<00:04:41.830> bit<00:04:41.979> and<00:04:42.220> I

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
it was digging in a little bit and I

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.620 
it was digging in a little bit and I
thought<00:04:42.550> you<00:04:42.970> know<00:04:43.030> that<00:04:43.210> was<00:04:43.300> going<00:04:43.449> to<00:04:43.479> be<00:04:43.570> a
