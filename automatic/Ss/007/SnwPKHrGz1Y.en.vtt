00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:44.399
 so here as I had already spoken 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:50.640
 When I step by the rose 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:55.500
 every time you paint always 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.289

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.980

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:17.180

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:21.170
 excuse not martin and glacial mineral 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.750
 near the bottom of the green leaves of 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:30.000
 pine and sep 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:32.630
 Now I'm going to give one of the sheets with the 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.630
 green 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:47.670

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.740

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:09.599

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.640

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:15.470

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:23.090
 I come from the edge of the other leaf 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:28.540
 inside I'm pulling time again 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:35.630

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:47.780
 smoke in here so as not to be 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:50.540
 marks the division of the sheet 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:54.550
 okay so this is filling 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:03:03.019
 inside the two-tone sheet 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:19.390

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:40.930
 I'll get the same two-tone brush 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:43.490
 I put it at the beginning of the leaf and I go 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:50.020
 to the inside of the sheet to the 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:50.020
 The crux of it is dark. 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:58.940
 now only with the green pine in place 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.420

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:35.479
