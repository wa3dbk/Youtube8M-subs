happening okay there it is there with

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.790 
happening okay there it is there with
wait<00:00:44.960> in<00:00:45.140> the<00:00:45.260> system<00:00:45.710> when<00:00:45.830> that<00:00:45.860> ring<00:00:46.460> that

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.840 

ring<00:00:51.800> gets<00:00:52.040> in<00:00:52.190> the<00:00:52.309> pulley<00:00:52.580> and<00:00:53.470> the<00:00:54.470> Pinto<00:00:54.890> it

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
ring gets in the pulley and the Pinto it

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.590 
ring gets in the pulley and the Pinto it
jams<00:00:56.270> that<00:00:56.510> rope<00:00:57.940> ropes<00:00:58.940> going<00:00:59.270> through<00:00:59.420> no

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
jams that rope ropes going through no

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:07.990 
jams that rope ropes going through no
problem<00:01:04.449> the<00:01:05.449> Rings<00:01:05.660> jamming<00:01:06.200> it<00:01:06.850> have<00:01:07.850> you

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
problem the Rings jamming it have you

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.840 
problem the Rings jamming it have you
ever<00:01:08.030> had<00:01:08.570> that<00:01:08.600> happen<00:01:08.810> before<00:01:15.610> with<00:01:16.610> weight

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
ever had that happen before with weight

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.670 
ever had that happen before with weight
in<00:01:17.000> the<00:01:17.119> system<00:01:17.570> see<00:01:17.750> right<00:01:17.960> now<00:01:18.140> it's<00:01:18.440> coming

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
in the system see right now it's coming

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.130 
in the system see right now it's coming
through

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.210 

but<00:01:22.710> with<00:01:22.860> Wade<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.400> system<00:01:25.730> it<00:01:26.730> jams<00:01:27.180> it

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
but with Wade in the system it jams it

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:36.610 
but with Wade in the system it jams it
if<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.430> got<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.850> thing<00:01:30.090> 30<00:01:30.390> 40<00:01:30.840> 50<00:01:31.170> feet<00:01:31.380> up

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:42.130 

huh<00:01:37.620> don't<00:01:38.580> know<00:01:39.530> that's<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.620> tough<00:01:40.770> one

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
huh don't know that's a tough one

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.040 
huh don't know that's a tough one
okay<00:01:43.140> I'll<00:01:43.470> try<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.830> see<00:01:44.400> if<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.610> can<00:01:45.050> duplicate

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
okay I'll try to see if I can duplicate

00:01:46.050 --> 00:02:11.280 
okay I'll try to see if I can duplicate
this<00:01:47.300> again

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.110 

okay<00:02:12.290> you<00:02:13.190> see<00:02:13.370> what's<00:02:13.550> going<00:02:13.610> on<00:02:13.910> with<00:02:14.090> that

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
okay you see what's going on with that

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.300 
okay you see what's going on with that
ring

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.870 

all<00:02:19.910> right<00:02:20.090> I<00:02:20.330> flipped<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:20.990> rope<00:02:21.730> I'm<00:02:22.730> going

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
all right I flipped the rope I'm going

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.730 
all right I flipped the rope I'm going
to<00:02:22.940> hook<00:02:23.030> that<00:02:23.209> up<00:02:23.270> and<00:02:23.720> try<00:02:24.319> to<00:02:24.380> run<00:02:24.590> it

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
to hook that up and try to run it

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.800 
to hook that up and try to run it
through<00:02:24.860> and<00:02:25.069> I'll<00:02:25.240> I'll<00:02:26.240> show<00:02:26.510> you<00:02:26.600> what's

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
through and I'll I'll show you what's

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.980 
through and I'll I'll show you what's
going<00:02:26.900> on<00:02:27.290> again<00:02:27.620> with<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.730> non<00:02:28.970> spliced<00:02:29.569> side

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
going on again with the non spliced side

going on again with the non spliced side
okay<00:02:33.130> I've<00:02:34.130> got<00:02:34.340> it<00:02:34.459> hooked<00:02:34.610> up<00:02:36.069> put<00:02:37.069> it<00:02:37.130> out<00:02:37.220> on

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
okay I've got it hooked up put it out on

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.750 
okay I've got it hooked up put it out on
my<00:02:37.459> woodshed<00:02:38.530> just<00:02:40.480> easy<00:02:41.480> reach<00:02:41.810> easy<00:02:42.319> setup

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
my woodshed just easy reach easy setup

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.280 
my woodshed just easy reach easy setup
okay<00:02:43.760> I<00:02:43.790> want<00:02:44.150> to<00:02:44.180> show<00:02:44.270> you<00:02:44.450> what's<00:02:44.630> going<00:02:44.720> on

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
okay I want to show you what's going on

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.860 
okay I want to show you what's going on
I<00:02:45.319> just<00:02:45.650> tried<00:02:45.950> this<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:48.830> I<00:02:49.250> it<00:02:49.910> makes<00:02:50.569> sense

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
I just tried this and I it makes sense

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.900 
I just tried this and I it makes sense
to<00:02:51.080> me<00:02:51.230> it's<00:02:51.470> so<00:02:52.630> clear<00:02:53.630> now<00:02:54.220> but<00:02:55.220> you<00:02:55.700> watch

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
to me it's so clear now but you watch

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:04.410 
to me it's so clear now but you watch
the<00:02:56.180> rope<00:02:56.390> come<00:02:56.660> up<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:59.720> goes<00:02:59.900> into

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.850 

goes<00:03:04.960> into<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.380> pulley<00:03:05.620> no<00:03:06.610> problem<00:03:07.860> it's

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
goes into the pulley no problem it's

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.800 
goes into the pulley no problem it's
going<00:03:09.010> into<00:03:09.310> that<00:03:09.400> Pinto<00:03:09.820> no<00:03:10.060> problem<00:03:10.570> but

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
going into that Pinto no problem but

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
going into that Pinto no problem but
look<00:03:10.960> what's<00:03:11.110> happening<00:03:12.390> how<00:03:13.390> do<00:03:13.450> you<00:03:13.830> solve

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
look what's happening how do you solve

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.870 
look what's happening how do you solve
that<00:03:14.980> how<00:03:15.250> do<00:03:15.310> you<00:03:15.400> fix<00:03:15.700> that<00:03:17.190> it<00:03:18.190> will<00:03:18.460> it<00:03:18.670> will

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
that how do you fix that it will it will

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.830 
that how do you fix that it will it will
pull<00:03:19.210> through<00:03:19.480> cuz<00:03:19.900> I'm<00:03:20.050> right<00:03:20.260> here<00:03:20.740> but<00:03:21.840> with

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
pull through cuz I'm right here but with

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.090 
pull through cuz I'm right here but with
weight<00:03:23.110> in<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.410> system

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:33.510 

it<00:03:27.610> pulls<00:03:28.800> the<00:03:29.800> ring<00:03:30.480> into<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.510> Pinto<00:03:32.320> is<00:03:32.650> that

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
it pulls the ring into the Pinto is that

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:40.620 
it pulls the ring into the Pinto is that
a<00:03:33.550> common<00:03:34.150> thing<00:03:36.990> that's<00:03:37.990> very<00:03:38.440> odd<00:03:38.800> I<00:03:39.630> see

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
a common thing that's very odd I see

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.570 
a common thing that's very odd I see
what's<00:03:40.810> happening<00:03:41.290> it's<00:03:41.380> blocking<00:03:41.740> it<00:03:44.580> you

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
what's happening it's blocking it you

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.880 
what's happening it's blocking it you
see<00:03:45.850> it<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.390> more<00:03:46.600> you<00:03:46.750> pull<00:03:47.020> the<00:03:47.440> harder<00:03:47.770> it

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
see it the more you pull the harder it

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.560 
see it the more you pull the harder it
pulls<00:03:48.130> that<00:03:48.250> ring<00:03:48.580> in<00:03:50.910> just<00:03:51.910> because<00:03:52.240> of<00:03:52.360> where

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
pulls that ring in just because of where

00:03:52.570 --> 00:04:01.280 
pulls that ring in just because of where
I'm<00:03:52.720> at<00:03:52.900> and<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:54.700> angle<00:03:57.540> try<00:03:58.540> to<00:03:59.160> mimic<00:04:00.160> being

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
I'm at and the angle try to mimic being

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:07.590 
I'm at and the angle try to mimic being
up<00:04:02.290> in<00:04:02.440> the<00:04:02.560> tree<00:04:03.060> you<00:04:04.060> pull<00:04:04.360> on<00:04:04.540> that<00:04:04.780> and<00:04:06.600> it

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
up in the tree you pull on that and it

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.150 
up in the tree you pull on that and it
makes<00:04:07.750> sense<00:04:07.990> when<00:04:08.170> I<00:04:08.230> flip<00:04:08.560> the<00:04:08.740> rope<00:04:08.920> it

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
makes sense when I flip the rope it

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.560 
makes sense when I flip the rope it
would<00:04:09.310> go<00:04:09.460> through<00:04:09.760> because<00:04:10.090> it<00:04:10.270> would<00:04:10.360> flip

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
would go through because it would flip

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.020 
would go through because it would flip
the<00:04:10.630> ring<00:04:10.930> out<00:04:11.110> of<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:11.350> way<00:04:11.790> but<00:04:12.790> when<00:04:12.910> you

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
the ring out of the way but when you

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.460 
the ring out of the way but when you
pull<00:04:13.330> on<00:04:13.510> that<00:04:15.480> it's<00:04:16.480> jamming<00:04:16.960> the<00:04:17.050> ring<00:04:17.230> in

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
pull on that it's jamming the ring in

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.040 
pull on that it's jamming the ring in
that<00:04:19.080> makes<00:04:20.080> sense<00:04:20.350> but<00:04:20.590> how<00:04:20.830> do<00:04:21.190> you<00:04:21.960> how<00:04:22.960> do

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
that makes sense but how do you how do

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.910 
that makes sense but how do you how do
you<00:04:23.140> solve<00:04:23.440> that<00:04:23.590> I<00:04:25.560> don't<00:04:26.560> know

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.590 

I'm<00:04:29.430> going<00:04:29.610> to<00:04:29.700> have<00:04:29.820> to<00:04:29.940> think<00:04:30.120> about<00:04:30.270> that

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
I'm going to have to think about that

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.700 
I'm going to have to think about that
one

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.230 

I<00:04:36.740> wouldn't<00:04:37.400> have<00:04:37.460> thought<00:04:37.550> that<00:04:37.700> that<00:04:38.030> could

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
I wouldn't have thought that that could

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.000 
I wouldn't have thought that that could
happen<00:04:39.250> that's<00:04:40.250> the<00:04:40.430> splice<00:04:40.730> tie<00:04:41.030> on<00:04:41.770> goes<00:04:42.770> in

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
happen that's the splice tie on goes in

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.070 
happen that's the splice tie on goes in
nice<00:04:43.220> and<00:04:43.460> easy<00:04:43.960> and<00:04:44.960> if<00:04:45.050> I'm<00:04:45.200> out<00:04:45.350> here<00:04:45.560> change

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
nice and easy and if I'm out here change

00:04:47.080 --> 00:05:09.500 
nice and easy and if I'm out here change
see<00:04:48.080> even<00:04:48.440> that<00:04:48.620> I<00:04:53.140> don't<00:04:54.140> know<00:05:01.390> don't<00:05:02.390> know

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:15.790 

it<00:05:10.080> is<00:05:10.290> odd

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:22.010 

that's<00:05:16.190> odd

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.550 

Oh

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:32.790 

you

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.860 

you
