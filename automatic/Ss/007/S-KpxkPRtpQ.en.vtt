accessories<00:01:09.420> from<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:09.990> device<00:01:10.320> than<00:01:10.680> what's

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
accessories from this device than what's

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.970 
accessories from this device than what's
available<00:01:11.010> on<00:01:11.400> just<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.700> camera<00:01:12.030> itself<00:01:12.980> so

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:13.980 
available on just the camera itself so

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.460 
available on just the camera itself so
what's<00:01:14.160> the<00:01:14.310> range<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.990> so<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.140> range<00:01:16.350> is

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
what's the range of it so the range is

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.100 
what's the range of it so the range is
going<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.740> be<00:01:16.830> somewhere<00:01:17.190> between<00:01:17.930> 300<00:01:18.930> feet

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
going to be somewhere between 300 feet

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.570 
going to be somewhere between 300 feet
and<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> thousand<00:01:19.770> feet<00:01:19.950> depending<00:01:20.160> on

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
and a thousand feet depending on

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.490 
and a thousand feet depending on
conditions<00:01:21.270> those<00:01:21.930> are<00:01:22.050> going<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.229> be<00:01:22.350> more

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
conditions those are going to be more

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.530 
conditions those are going to be more
ideal<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:23.580> annoy<00:01:23.760> Z<00:01:23.970> environments<00:01:24.479> like

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
ideal so in annoy Z environments like

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.780 
ideal so in annoy Z environments like
nab<00:01:25.020> here<00:01:25.320> it's<00:01:25.800> going<00:01:26.010> to<00:01:26.040> be<00:01:26.190> reduced<00:01:26.640> to

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
nab here it's going to be reduced to

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.080 
nab here it's going to be reduced to
probably<00:01:27.210> about<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.390> hundred<00:01:27.570> feet

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.590 

in<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.899> rough<00:01:31.170> price<00:01:31.710> rough<00:01:32.700> price<00:01:33.000> point<00:01:33.450> is

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
in a rough price rough price point is

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.660 
in a rough price rough price point is
going<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.960> be<00:01:34.049> more<00:01:34.380> than<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.590> cubes<00:01:35.250> right<00:01:35.460> now

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
going to be more than a cubes right now

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.520 
going to be more than a cubes right now
but<00:01:35.939> less<00:01:36.270> than<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.630> keep<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.020> we're<00:01:37.350> going<00:01:37.439> to

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
but less than to keep so we're going to

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:47.580 
but less than to keep so we're going to
target<00:01:37.710> around<00:01:37.979> 3,000<00:01:38.789> for<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.030> device
