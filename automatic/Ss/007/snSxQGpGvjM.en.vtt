this design and it's got its got a full
floating<00:02:32.130> axle<00:02:32.640> across<00:02:32.970> here<00:02:33.210> so<00:02:33.420> this<00:02:33.570> this

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
floating axle across here so this this

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.150 
floating axle across here so this this
axle<00:02:34.230> here<00:02:34.530> moves<00:02:35.370> like<00:02:36.060> so<00:02:36.390> on<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:37.110> wheel<00:02:37.320> the

axle here moves like so on the wheel the

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.210 
axle here moves like so on the wheel the
front<00:02:38.400> bar<00:02:38.610> is<00:02:39.180> rigid<00:02:39.720> so<00:02:40.709> you<00:02:40.770> actually<00:02:41.010> have

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
front bar is rigid so you actually have

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.500 
front bar is rigid so you actually have
a<00:02:41.340> fully<00:02:41.610> floating<00:02:42.060> axle<00:02:44.150> i'm<00:02:45.150> here<00:02:45.390> with
