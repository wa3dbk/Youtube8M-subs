00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
teams but it doesn't really take

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770

you're going to want to pick up a

you're going to want to pick up a

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
guardian angel in most of your games so

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.399 
guardian angel in most of your games so
contrary<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.509> what<00:01:39.720> most<00:01:39.930> people<00:01:40.290> actually

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
contrary to what most people actually

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.679 
contrary to what most people actually
thinks<00:01:41.070> if<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.430> really<00:01:41.729> isn't<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.090> strong<00:01:42.509> in

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
the early laning phase because she

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.859 
the early laning phase because she
realized<00:01:44.340> quite<00:01:44.640> heavily<00:01:44.880> on<00:01:45.030> items<00:01:45.630> and

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
realized quite heavily on items and

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.749 
realized quite heavily on items and
ability<00:01:46.290> rank<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:46.770> don't<00:01:47.070> worry<00:01:47.250> if<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.579> feels

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
ability rank so don't worry if it feels

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.370 
ability rank so don't worry if it feels
like<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.090> first<00:01:48.360> Q<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.810> actually<00:01:49.079> throw

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
like the first Q you actually throw

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.469 
like the first Q you actually throw
doesn't<00:01:49.829> no<00:01:49.979> damage<00:01:50.369> at<00:01:50.490> all<00:01:50.640> now<00:01:51.090> as<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.360> get

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
doesn't no damage at all now as you get

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.940 
doesn't no damage at all now as you get
some<00:01:51.689> levels<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.110> should<00:01:52.409> look<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.770> start

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
some levels you should look to start

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.249 
some levels you should look to start
trading<00:01:53.310> with<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.700> enemy<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.689> because<00:01:55.020> Civ<00:01:55.229> is

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259

basic<00:01:55.710> attack<00:01:55.950> range<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:56.610> low<00:01:56.850> it's<00:01:57.149> kind

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
basic attack range is so low it's kind

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.450

with a few auto attacks if you feel like

also<00:02:38.439> applies<00:02:38.859> when<00:02:38.890> you<00:02:39.250> leave<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:39.609> laning

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.699 
also applies when you leave the laning
phase<00:02:39.909> so<00:02:40.510> Sivir<00:02:40.720> is<00:02:40.810> great<00:02:41.290> at<00:02:41.470> starting
