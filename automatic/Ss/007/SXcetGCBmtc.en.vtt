 It's not that small either. 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.859

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.380
 many believe that for many 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.080
 You guys, it's speechless. 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.179
 so it is difficult to describe the emotion of 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.890
 Feeling now why the channel was created 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.829

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.450
