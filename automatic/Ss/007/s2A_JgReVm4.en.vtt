00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.160
 hi to all friends it's four 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.099
 tutorial points on kyle i am with omega 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.700
 so it's time to square ap 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.670
 it can be played mid or top and the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.449
 technique to learn with kyle oria 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.699
 They and we actually had a little 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.010
 between the two but the best is the 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:26.550
 so in his staff you have to take a 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.699
 start a tomme of amplification with 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.470
 gearboxes to more you 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.500
 advance proposed to buy in two 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.020
 swimmers game on wizard goodbye 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.790
 many calls from the attack speed 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.969
 after docking higgins at it's a bit 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.410
 helped and support better way to 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.350
 each one you attack you attack 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.850
 faster to basic attacks and to 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.739
 you could learn undermine 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.210
 disguises haunted for a bit of pv 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.160
 and ap and more you will approach beyond the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.410
 full stuff you will have to post to badens 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.930
 for many zapped board miss 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.579
 lots of pv and antoine landry for 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.390
 have even more pv and calls 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.070
 that is to say the continuation of the disguise of 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.729
 so we will see a small elite certain 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.530
 to have the first three way spells in 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.810
 hollow friends it's gone people too 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.530
 of the tour with his techniques so his 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.820
 passive as for you use it ben you 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.060
 same policy when you make a 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.000
 technique it goes from the armor of the enemy 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.520
 so that's what it sent something in there 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.240
 at a long range he came out of the damage 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.200
 and it slows down as follow the e you have 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.380
 not so fast it's a little bit 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.530
 weak in a few steps 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.549
 this is the e c1 he 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.530
 so that's that mark gives life and a 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.200
 little speed of movement speed 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.329
 I think so and it increases its 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.340
 range of 400 400 in lol it's not 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.259
 a lot in that sense it would already be that 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.939
 yeah but actually no but 400 was throwing 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.320
 majority that it's half of the map 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.930
 while not actually it's just a 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.969
 door and a little more raised so the 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.729
 they attack how a hydra to 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.140
 voracious actually side by side the champion more 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.060
 this case in turn you see that makes some 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.870
 flames and so that's it 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.940
 and finally no 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.300
 last ellipses power the ultimate and 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.350
 to make passive liabilities I say them that 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:20.320
 reduced their walls with each attack 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:24.760
 each reaches the elite it's for the v6 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.170
 and the 21 hollow friends so I 'm going 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.210
 tell you about the ultimate ultimate invade 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.060
 it's a style of dognen but to you 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.560
 can you actually move there yes you 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.120
 can move attack and it opens in 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.570
 sensitive to all guys for two 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.210
 seconds 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.950
 in two seconds in so fast c1 but 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.740
 good and it's increasing with time 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.850
 I sincerely believe with the level of 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:48.310
 multi is not it's possible so 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.010
 that she is very strong against darius 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.240
 stone even and made a last seen that 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.750
 it's a zone style yesterday to you is 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:58.390
 invulnerable and btan darius hue you 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.010
 do your only team ben you accelerate 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:04.840
 you activate it it's over but at 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.790
 that's the thing when we click 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.710
 r that does not make us directly 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.600
 have to click so either you put it in 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:14.100
 place and it does it to you and you 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.690
 are a big one in the forest with your allies 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.620
 because all of this I have a little trouble 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.970
 to put it a lot less of 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.000
 journalists I find it a bit hard 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.390
 besides these same dance and we go there 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.610
 weak these weaknesses here after he is 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.630
 very weak against theoretical 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.300
 nautilis moved 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.430
 Yorick is good because you did it 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.040
 in a previous tutorial there abeaucoup 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.630
 of arras and you have to get in a bus 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.760
 for that goulard is attacked otherwise 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.950
 it's too much too much appreciated in 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.900
 which he has big damage if the sound 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.959
 ultimate and b used in a teamfight that 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.430
 can reverse everything imagine you shoot 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.380
 a mother trident is very sick active 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.070
 his last of the pendants dozen of 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.070
 seconds I saw the man 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.690
 after good ya no skype 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.910
 he is very fragile and we would have 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.910
 trinh-duke interview would be fun 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.800
 the fight of the immortals not especially you 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.190
 put it on a ring back is in your 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.500
 team 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.370
 ah yes yes yes his part I'm mortal 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.290
 for 5 seconds 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.200
 it's over and then I went back to 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.209
 below was taken we made the match 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.949
 direct is to show liquid to 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.240
 ultimate sap boss has a big trick 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:25.449
 is that we will learn the lesson 

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:36.100
 ok I'm hot potato to hoist her 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:41.080
 boss m 2 a goodbye to the very level 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:05:04.780
 badly besides why it's one that has 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:05:07.630
 had so much legitimate defense as 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.770
 true all beats to I could mona in 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.100
 damage 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.780
 I was going to me at two seconds 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.979
 complete 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:18.760
 I'm going to do an elite it's time 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:23.349
 that I relive ink friends so that 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:24.580
 it's gone for the stage dance in time 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:26.289
 but in fact it's more to let it become 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.050
 profitable we could you there 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:30.639
 hello alongside the love nexus at 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.220
 fucking it's a single time it's rather 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:35.470
 weird must know that cahill is a 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.490
 girl of a game bring me closer to 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.630
 turrets still happy 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.449
 it's like you're calling jessica 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.190
 was a man me I can not believe that 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:46.780
 it's a guy because we are good there 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:51.840
 there is an armor so we can not do 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.840
 it's coming to you by not him 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:56.220
 but never mind 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:11.190
