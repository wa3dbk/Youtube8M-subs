00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
a cup of mashed potatoes well as we

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.850 
a cup of mashed potatoes well as we
mentioned<00:03:23.239> previously<00:03:23.269> a<00:03:23.959> serving<00:03:24.470> of<00:03:24.560> green

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
mentioned previously a serving of green

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.160 
mentioned previously a serving of green
or<00:03:25.070> starchy<00:03:25.430> vegetable<00:03:25.940> is<00:03:26.090> actually<00:03:26.750> half<00:03:27.019> a

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
or starchy vegetable is actually half a

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.900 
or starchy vegetable is actually half a
cup<00:03:27.410> or<00:03:27.680> it<00:03:28.640> would<00:03:28.820> resemble<00:03:29.150> half<00:03:29.930> a<00:03:30.080> baseball

so<00:03:31.910> here<00:03:32.510> we<00:03:33.110> notice<00:03:33.320> that<00:03:33.590> that's<00:03:33.709> about

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
so here we notice that that's about

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.729 
so here we notice that that's about
twice<00:03:34.580> the<00:03:34.610> size<00:03:34.910> or<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.480> size<00:03:35.810> of<00:03:36.080> this<00:03:36.260> 1<00:03:36.500> cup

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739

twice the size or the size of this 1 cup
measuring<00:03:38.140> next<00:03:39.140> we<00:03:39.290> have<00:03:39.470> half<00:03:39.860> a<00:03:40.040> cup<00:03:40.070> of<00:03:40.459> non
