00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
possibly a three-ton truck it's a it's

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.990 
possibly a three-ton truck it's a it's
one<00:00:19.289> heck<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.740> it's<00:00:20.189> been<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.490> big<00:00:20.730> truck

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
one heck of a it's been a big truck

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.519 
one heck of a it's been a big truck
let's<00:00:21.240> just<00:00:21.449> say<00:00:22.100> so<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.720> gonna<00:00:24.720> start<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.410> up

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
let's just say so I gonna start it up

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.779 
let's just say so I gonna start it up
here<00:00:25.740> for<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:27.050> and<00:00:28.050> by<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.039> way<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.580> hole

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
you see on the floor right down there

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.130 
you see on the floor right down there
that<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.040> cutout<00:00:32.640> someone<00:00:33.540> cut<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.840> out<00:00:33.899> to

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
that is a cutout someone cut that out to

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.170 
that is a cutout someone cut that out to
get<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.350> transmission<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.059> not

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
get this transmission in it this is not

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.389 
get this transmission in it this is not
the<00:00:36.480> original<00:00:36.930> transmission<00:00:37.680> for<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.190> truck

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
the original transmission for this truck

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.209 
the original transmission for this truck
this<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.730> bigger<00:00:39.059> transmission<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:40.219> don't

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
this is a bigger transmission I don't

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.520 
this is a bigger transmission I don't
know<00:00:41.399> what<00:00:41.579> ton<00:00:41.790> about<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.750> sizes<00:00:43.230> are<00:00:43.410> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
know what ton about the sizes are the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.920 
know what ton about the sizes are the
numbers<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:43.890> what<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.789> trainee<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.390> but

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
numbers of what that that trainee is but

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.360 
numbers of what that that trainee is but
somebody<00:00:46.200> has<00:00:46.440> put<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.680> much<00:00:46.950> larger

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
somebody has put a much larger

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.459 
somebody has put a much larger
transmission<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.300> for<00:00:48.930> some<00:00:49.110> reason<00:00:49.140> I

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
transmission in this for some reason I

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.959 
transmission in this for some reason I
could<00:00:49.620> see<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.920> true<00:00:50.100> frame<00:00:50.430> has<00:00:50.579> been<00:00:50.760> beefed

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
could see the true frame has been beefed

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.240 
could see the true frame has been beefed
up<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.390> truck<00:00:51.660> also<00:00:51.870> I'll<00:00:52.649> show<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.039> to

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
up on this truck also I'll show that to

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.439 
up on this truck also I'll show that to
you<00:00:53.399> here<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.640> just<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.940> second<00:00:54.239> but<00:00:54.300> let's

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
you here in just a second but let's

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:04.609 
you here in just a second but let's
start<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.809> up<00:00:56.300> okay<00:01:02.449> not<00:01:03.449> too<00:01:03.629> good<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:03.899> sandals

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
start it up okay not too good in sandals

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.380 
start it up okay not too good in sandals
anyway<00:01:06.710> this<00:01:07.710> truck<00:01:07.950> step<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.610> six<00:01:08.970> bolt<00:01:09.240> by

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
anyway this truck step is six bolt by

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.770 
anyway this truck step is six bolt by
the<00:01:09.450> way<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:09.750> it's<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.530> slow<00:01:10.740> cranker<00:01:11.330> I<00:01:12.330> don't

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
the way so it's a slow cranker I don't

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.899 
the way so it's a slow cranker I don't
see<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.260> too<00:01:13.950> many<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.280> gauges<00:01:14.490> really

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
see that too many of the gauges really

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.899 
see that too many of the gauges really
work<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.330> can<00:01:15.869> tell<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.470> oil<00:01:16.500> gauge

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
work I can tell that the oil gauge

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.029 
work I can tell that the oil gauge
you<00:01:18.509> can<00:01:18.659> see<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.289> oil<00:01:19.469> gauge<00:01:19.829> is

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
you can see that that oil gauge is

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:25.340 
you can see that that oil gauge is
working<00:01:22.999> I'm<00:01:23.999> sorry<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.479> amperage<00:01:24.899> gauge<00:01:25.140> is

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
working I'm sorry the amperage gauge is

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.099 
working I'm sorry the amperage gauge is
working<00:01:25.679> the<00:01:26.490> oil<00:01:26.700> gauge<00:01:27.060> itself<00:01:27.539> I<00:01:27.719> barely

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:28.109 
working the oil gauge itself I barely

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:30.770 
working the oil gauge itself I barely
see<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.590> moving<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.789> I<00:01:29.819> believe<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.329> oil<00:01:30.509> gauge

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
see it moving so I believe the oil gauge

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.289 
see it moving so I believe the oil gauge
is<00:01:31.319> also<00:01:31.740> working<00:01:31.979> temperature<00:01:32.789> is<00:01:33.119> currently

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
is also working temperature is currently

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.599 
is also working temperature is currently
showing<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.380> no<00:01:34.469> cold<00:01:34.740> we'll<00:01:35.250> take<00:01:35.399> a<00:01:35.429> nap

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609 
showing you no cold we'll take a nap

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:36.800 
showing you no cold we'll take a nap
I'll<00:01:35.850> keep<00:01:36.000> an<00:01:36.090> eye<00:01:36.179> on<00:01:36.240> that<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.600> see<00:01:36.689> if<00:01:36.719> that

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
I'll keep an eye on that and see if that

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.800 
I'll keep an eye on that and see if that
does<00:01:37.140> work<00:01:37.700> and<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.849> have<00:01:39.090> no<00:01:39.450> idea<00:01:39.719> if<00:01:39.780> that

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
does work and I have no idea if that

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.969 
does work and I have no idea if that
fuel<00:01:40.170> gauge<00:01:40.349> is<00:01:40.380> correct

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
fuel gauge is correct

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.999 
fuel gauge is correct
obviously<00:01:41.459> the<00:01:41.579> speedo<00:01:41.909> doesn't<00:01:42.240> work<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.569> the

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
obviously the speedo doesn't work is the

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.339 
obviously the speedo doesn't work is the
little<00:01:44.009> indicator<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:45.149> busted<00:01:45.869> off<00:01:45.959> I<00:01:46.140> have<00:01:46.319> no

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:46.349 
little indicator is busted off I have no

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:48.160 
little indicator is busted off I have no
clue<00:01:46.979> how<00:01:47.189> many<00:01:47.250> miles<00:01:47.549> are<00:01:47.789> on<00:01:47.880> this

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
clue how many miles are on this

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.059 
clue how many miles are on this
considering<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.259> transmissions<00:01:49.859> been

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:50.069 
considering the transmissions been

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:54.169 
considering the transmissions been
changed<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.270> forth<00:01:52.250> it<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.429> a<00:01:53.459> cancer-free

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
changed and so forth it is a cancer-free

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.910 
changed and so forth it is a cancer-free
truck<00:01:55.879> Arizona<00:01:56.879> cancer-free<00:01:57.479> truck<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:58.319> know

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
truck Arizona cancer-free truck I know

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
wheels apart but here you can see on the

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.029 
wheels apart but here you can see on the
frame<00:04:19.609> where<00:04:19.880> it<00:04:19.910> was<00:04:20.150> braced<00:04:20.509> and<00:04:21.039> my

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
frame where it was braced and my

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:23.860 
frame where it was braced and my
assumption<00:04:22.520> is<00:04:22.639> is<00:04:22.850> I<00:04:23.000> expect<00:04:23.330> it's<00:04:23.449> probably

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
assumption is is I expect it's probably

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.570 
assumption is is I expect it's probably
not<00:04:23.990> factory<00:04:24.500> because<00:04:24.740> I<00:04:24.919> don't<00:04:25.070> see<00:04:25.250> rivets

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
not factory because I don't see rivets

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.820 
not factory because I don't see rivets
on<00:04:25.729> there<00:04:25.910> but<00:04:26.690> it<00:04:26.780> runs<00:04:26.960> the<00:04:27.259> entire<00:04:27.590> length

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
on there but it runs the entire length

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.040 
on there but it runs the entire length
of<00:04:28.310> that<00:04:28.430> of<00:04:28.759> that<00:04:28.970> frame<00:04:29.270> so<00:04:31.810> somebody<00:04:32.810> really

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
of that of that frame so somebody really

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.370 
of that of that frame so somebody really
beat<00:04:33.199> this<00:04:33.380> thing<00:04:33.440> up<00:04:33.770> to<00:04:33.949> haul<00:04:34.430> some<00:04:34.669> weight

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
beat this thing up to haul some weight

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.920 
beat this thing up to haul some weight
that's<00:04:36.380> my<00:04:36.560> guess

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
that's my guess

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.600 
that's my guess
so<00:04:38.930> there<00:04:39.080> you<00:04:39.110> have<00:04:39.380> it<00:04:41.800> 1953<00:04:42.800> idles<00:04:43.250> just<00:04:43.490> a

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
so there you have it 1953 idles just a

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:51.450 
so there you have it 1953 idles just a
little<00:04:43.849> bit<00:04:43.970> high<00:04:46.570> 1953<00:04:47.570> GMC<00:04:49.419> 4-speed<00:04:50.419> is<00:04:51.289> a

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
little bit high 1953 GMC 4-speed is a

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.650 
little bit high 1953 GMC 4-speed is a
