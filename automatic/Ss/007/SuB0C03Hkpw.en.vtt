kill um so I became a little concerned
uh<00:03:23.030> about<00:03:24.030> that<00:03:24.329> but<00:03:24.720> apparently<00:03:25.290> it<00:03:25.410> means

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
uh about that but apparently it means

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.780 
uh about that but apparently it means
good<00:03:25.709> luck<00:03:25.769> so<00:03:26.190> there's<00:03:26.400> quite<00:03:26.579> a<00:03:26.699> difference
