00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
for a cup of water we'll put in one

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.060 
for a cup of water we'll put in one
teaspoon<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.700> so<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.720> don't<00:03:10.410> measure<00:03:10.650> things

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
teaspoon and so I don't measure things

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.940 
teaspoon and so I don't measure things
very<00:03:11.370> much<00:03:11.610> I<00:03:11.790> just<00:03:12.030> guess<00:03:12.270> and<00:03:12.780> so<00:03:13.410> I<00:03:13.440> usually

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
very much I just guess and so I usually

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.580 
very much I just guess and so I usually
just<00:03:13.980> put<00:03:14.250> 1<00:03:14.640> spoon<00:03:14.670> full<00:03:15.480> tablespoon<00:03:16.200> full<00:03:16.410> of

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
just put 1 spoon full tablespoon full of

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.920 
just put 1 spoon full tablespoon full of
this<00:03:16.860> whenever<00:03:17.430> I<00:03:17.670> make<00:03:17.880> soup<00:03:18.269> and<00:03:18.540> if<00:03:18.840> you

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
this whenever I make soup and if you

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.870 
this whenever I make soup and if you
don't<00:03:19.140> get<00:03:19.320> enough<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:19.920> can<00:03:20.100> always<00:03:20.220> add<00:03:20.670> it

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
don't get enough you can always add it

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.240 
don't get enough you can always add it
in<00:03:21.060> at<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.360> end<00:03:21.600> and<00:03:21.870> so<00:03:22.530> you<00:03:22.590> don't<00:03:22.860> even<00:03:22.950> have

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
in at the end and so you don't even have

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.060 
in at the end and so you don't even have
to<00:03:23.310> add<00:03:23.580> salt<00:03:24.060> or<00:03:24.420> anything<00:03:25.230> when<00:03:25.440> we<00:03:25.560> add<00:03:25.739> this

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
to add salt or anything when we add this

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.430 
to add salt or anything when we add this
and<00:03:26.310> so<00:03:26.940> there<00:03:27.360> we<00:03:27.540> are<00:03:27.570> we're<00:03:28.019> done<00:03:28.230> i<00:03:28.260> think

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
and so there we are we're done i think

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.820 
and so there we are we're done i think
that<00:03:28.830> took<00:03:29.130> two<00:03:29.880> minutes<00:03:30.330> and<00:03:30.720> i'm<00:03:31.440> going<00:03:31.680> to

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.120 
the seasoning is a little too strong and
so<00:04:00.820> if<00:04:01.000> I<00:04:01.150> did<00:04:01.450> put<00:04:01.720> this<00:04:01.900> in<00:04:02.230> I<00:04:02.470> would<00:04:02.920> put<00:04:03.100> it

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
so if I did put this in I would put it

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.340 
so if I did put this in I would put it
in<00:04:03.340> at<00:04:03.550> the<00:04:03.640> end<00:04:03.820> and<00:04:04.060> I<00:04:04.180> probably<00:04:04.690> only<00:04:04.840> put<00:04:05.170> in

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
in at the end and I probably only put in

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.220 
in at the end and I probably only put in
half<00:04:05.890> as<00:04:06.100> much<00:04:06.280> as<00:04:06.520> they<00:04:06.700> say<00:04:07.030> and<00:04:07.360> then<00:04:07.930> taste

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
half as much as they say and then taste

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.050 
half as much as they say and then taste
it<00:04:08.560> and<00:04:08.710> then<00:04:08.830> decide<00:04:09.190> if<00:04:09.220> I<00:04:09.460> want<00:04:09.730> a<00:04:09.880> little

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
it and then decide if I want a little

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.600 
it and then decide if I want a little
bit<00:04:10.270> more<00:04:10.540> and<00:04:10.810> so<00:04:11.560> if<00:04:11.710> this<00:04:11.890> is<00:04:12.070> the<00:04:12.100> morning

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
bit more and so if this is the morning

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.420 
bit more and so if this is the morning
then<00:04:12.820> i'll<00:04:12.970> set<00:04:13.270> my<00:04:13.300> crock<00:04:13.720> pot<00:04:14.020> on<00:04:14.200> low

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
then i'll set my crock pot on low

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.340 
then i'll set my crock pot on low
because<00:04:15.430> these<00:04:15.940> beams<00:04:16.269> don't<00:04:16.720> really<00:04:17.109> take

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
because these beams don't really take

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.270 
because these beams don't really take
that<00:04:17.380> long<00:04:17.680> to<00:04:17.980> cook<00:04:18.400> so<00:04:19.239> low<00:04:19.810> would<00:04:20.140> be<00:04:20.320> enough

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
that long to cook so low would be enough

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.820 
that long to cook so low would be enough
and<00:04:21.870> depending<00:04:22.870> on<00:04:23.050> how<00:04:23.230> long<00:04:23.410> you're<00:04:23.620> gone

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
and depending on how long you're gone

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.740 
and depending on how long you're gone
during<00:04:24.220> the<00:04:24.460> day<00:04:24.640> too<00:04:24.700> if<00:04:25.180> you're<00:04:25.360> leaving<00:04:25.480> at

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
during the day too if you're leaving at

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.450 
during the day too if you're leaving at
six<00:04:25.990> o'clock<00:04:26.110> in<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.470> morning<00:04:26.860> you<00:04:27.010> don't<00:04:27.280> get

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
six o'clock in the morning you don't get

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.370 
six o'clock in the morning you don't get
home<00:04:27.640> until<00:04:27.670> six<00:04:28.030> o'clock<00:04:28.240> at<00:04:28.600> night<00:04:28.780> that

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
home until six o'clock at night that

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.770 
home until six o'clock at night that
would<00:04:29.560> be<00:04:29.770> too<00:04:30.010> long<00:04:30.280> for<00:04:30.910> these<00:04:31.060> beings<00:04:31.540> so

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
would be too long for these beings so

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.180 
would be too long for these beings so
depending<00:04:32.200> on<00:04:32.200> how<00:04:32.530> long<00:04:32.740> you're<00:04:32.920> going<00:04:33.040> to<00:04:33.100> be

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
depending on how long you're going to be

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.290 
depending on how long you're going to be
gone<00:04:33.810> you<00:04:34.810> might<00:04:35.050> not<00:04:35.410> be<00:04:35.770> able<00:04:35.800> to<00:04:36.100> do<00:04:37.000> them<00:04:37.180> in

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
gone you might not be able to do them in

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:38.700 
gone you might not be able to do them in
the<00:04:37.390> crockpot<00:04:37.660> you<00:04:37.960> might<00:04:38.140> need<00:04:38.290> to<00:04:38.440> do<00:04:38.560> this

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
the crockpot you might need to do this

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.800 
the crockpot you might need to do this
sometime<00:04:39.220> when<00:04:39.430> you're<00:04:39.550> at<00:04:39.700> home<00:04:39.760> like<00:04:40.570> for

sometime when you're at home like for

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.290 
sometime when you're at home like for
