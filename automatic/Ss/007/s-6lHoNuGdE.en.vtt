00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.980
 good evening with a raphael 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.180
 ibanez and we talked about this victory 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.700
 enhanced that could possibly 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.950
 take the bordelais ben in the 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.570
 european cutting margins it was us 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.799
 had said it a dream but it was not necessary 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.450
 especially not galvauder this game there 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.340
 had already won we'll see you 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.080
 re did the summary of this match where you 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.220
 did you start it well because 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.600
 that you immediately mark the 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.250
 first points after a minute in 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.050
 taking a penalty because bernard and then 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.060
 after this pass at the foot of Bernard 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.830
 for the first test that will be validated at 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.849
 the video with a young lonca had 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.650
 a lot of French as the French 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.880
 even in this line of three quarters to 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.829
 departure you have taken a good start 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.910
 even though behind the biarrots are going 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.860
 take orders is what you 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.920
 you're told for a moment that this match 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.390
 went wrong and that upon arrival 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.370
 baala the series of three defeats that 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.879
 you had to let it go on 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.640
 could have happened 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.100
 indeed it is true that we must salute 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.199
 the enterprising spirit players of the 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.520
 biarrots who was also able to 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.489
 take risks at times 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.170
 of the match and I think the merit of the 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.629
 baby's players is to have done 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.370
 evidence also of discipline having been a 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.830
 little more structured in the second 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.939
 part of the meeting but because the 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.590
 first quarter of an hour actually huh on 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.180
 sees biarrots trying things 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.979
 who will even manage to score a 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.810
 first try with this long long 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.939
 action this ball against the foot by 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.610
 eddie thomas who will flatten will allow 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.380
 to the roe sapwood to come back to 8 to 7 with 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.390
 the transformation of benoÃ®t baby who 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.979
 was playing at the opening today for 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.689
 biarritz and we see you a little bit 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.460
 annoyed because they even go 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.240
 biarrots manage to pass in front of the 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.890
 21st minute with a death 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.320
 desgourgues holds the gurus who 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.329
 will play with you next season 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.520
 and then gradually though this 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:39.100
 team of the bordeaux bÃ¨gles union which has 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.810
 managed to come back in this match has mostly 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.860
 to get your hands on the balloon we got it 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.329
 felt that all you 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.100
 had shown this season was good 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.840
 installed to know this ability to good 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.000
 carried the ball to good control and has 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.649
 weighed more and more on the defense 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.119
 adversary is behind has benefited even 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.470
 sometimes on balloons a little bit 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.640
 rendered but with a line of three 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.259
 quarters that makes the difference that this 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.549
 test of the bourhis you will notice 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.439
 3d and it's in stride in this 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:03.360
 first folds concluded half time yes it's 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:06.149
 a very nice party to finish so at 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.110
 chaban delmas with his great audience 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.260
 the players really cared 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.790
 to be enterprising to be in 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.980
 the advance is what we did to the six 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.569
 years in second half with with 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.790
 fronts that are shown conquering so 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.959
 that's it's also very very positive 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.850
 this is a big state race 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.160
 of spirit we saw them is the bourhis 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.450
 in the 27th minute two minutes after the 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.160
 before you talk to mrs harel 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.010
 which comes upside down three biarrots for 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.680
 to flatten the test that will bring the 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.680
 mark at 25 to 17 in favor of bordelais 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.150
 then 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.209
 we see again the tide that carries with him 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.310
 the defense of biarritz a few moments 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.409
 after under the eyes of vincent etcheto 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.510
 although almost the same action with 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:46.099
 a penalty played very quickly by 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.260
 by amy adams and this balloon is going to be 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.049
 recovered this time not by bruce who 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.540
 just flatten to bring the mark to 32 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.280
 at 17 that's it at that moment with four 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.750
 tests at 2 is that at that moment there is 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.799
 what is your speech in the 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.969
 cloakroom at half time you have to think 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.290
 now to the offensive bonus 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:01.939
 I think the players had it in 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.099
 head from the start of the match but 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:06.379
 it is true that the danger would have been 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.000
 too much rushing he had to find 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.409
 a little over six years in second 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.810
 half time doing simple things for 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:13.220
 then unlocked situation then you 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.329
 come out well because there is an essay 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.889
 refused to biarrots at the end of the first 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.959
 period 1 refuses the beginning of the second 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:19.519
 period we have seen dimitri's eyes 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.060
 yachvili imanol harinordoquy who did 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.409
 the business trip 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.669
 what effect the investments even if it does not 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.049
 not playing today we saw back 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:26.659
 damien traille who can not help 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:29.989
 here amy adams to go and finally mark this 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:31.639
 offensive bonus to lead 39 av ar bon 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.230
 the second period from that moment 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:34.730
 there was a little more confused in 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.530
 how far we guys had 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.329
 nothing else to gain you had done this 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.400
 that needed with a bonus that is going to be 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.169
 comforted with the fakate test 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.599
 granted to the video 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:46.190
 and then in the wake you will do 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.510
 enter your fatal weapon 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.180
 you got the balls that we had left to 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.430
 13 tests we will see both tests 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.199
 marked by were leaving the sludge on TV 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.639
 But this is also the sign of a 

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:57.620
 Bordeaux team that even manages to 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:58.639
 get out of the stars that's how you 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.799
 tell me about it before 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:03.109
 match but we think this team 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:05.209
 account for hen still in technical 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.590
 and for me in particular was done in 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.810
 so that all players give each other 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.709
 in the field without special status 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.319
 but you were a little inside since 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.450
 a few games and he 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.829
 very very nice answer with two 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.410
 tests late in the game and he has the secret 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:19.630
 and that's also very good for the 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.130
 yes yes the management of raphael 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.590
 ibanez who is a little stung his 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.840
 Fijian winger and and we leave you for 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.449
 pleasure the last try the eighth 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.870
 test marked by the Girondins 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:33.580
 with the pass to the foot and look at you 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.840
 the balls to we think that ball goes 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.729
 go out and plunge at the last moment 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.880
 the 80th minute an essay that will be granted 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:42.070
 to the video for a final victory 54 at 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.500
 20 here at chaban-delmas it was also 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.910
 the opportunity to show that 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.509
 relocations are not 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.280
 relocations 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:49.599
 it's almost now your home 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.860
 chaban delmas it will continue that 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:51.960
 works very very well there was 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.490
 thirty thousand spectators today 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.720
 exceptional it is a dirty property and she 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.820
 is magic for the players that's theirs 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.259
 allows you to transcend yourself and that's true 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.030
 that since the beginning of the season since the 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:02.710
 first game I asked them to be 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.099
 thoroughly and then from the month of 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.229
 January 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:06.639
 if we had a modest little chance of 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:07.930
 jostling the hierarchy to speed up 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:09.460
 so you imagine we spared them 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.389
 the guys so tonight and deserved 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.919
 to really have fun 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.660
 they took pleasure they did the 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.050
 pleasure pleasure to the public last 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.150
 question 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.900
 finally even if you're 8th it's 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.440
 a beautiful season for the union 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:22.389
 begles-bordeaux you must be worthy I 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.560
 believe one believes that one can be the 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.360
 players can be proud of their 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.560
 course they gave a lot they have 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.620
 been very brave throughout the 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.210
 season with their means with only one 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.970
 quite a huge workload 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.220
 so I wanted to greet congratulate them and 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.479
 then and then it's true that I think 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.949
 that it is really written of advanced but 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:39.970
 necessarily seen some 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:40.419
 logic also in the water in the 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.770
 ranking 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:43.509
 that's where we really are 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.340
 level I do not know it starts from scratch the 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:46.720
 next season but at the same time we have 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.190
 acquired a lot of experience and 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.940
 the players have been extraordinarily 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.229
 there what I have to say 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.229
 and then now there is the holidays
