on my life I have proof that I didn't

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.290 
on my life I have proof that I didn't
have<00:00:47.649> to<00:00:47.829> go<00:00:47.980> through<00:00:48.219> the<00:00:48.399> radiation<00:00:48.820> and<00:00:49.239> the

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
have to go through the radiation and the

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.619 
have to go through the radiation and the
chemo<00:00:49.809> therapy<00:00:50.649> to<00:00:51.309> kill<00:00:51.550> this<00:00:51.760> cancer<00:00:52.269> or<00:00:52.539> to

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
chemo therapy to kill this cancer or to

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.079 
chemo therapy to kill this cancer or to
get<00:00:52.780> rid<00:00:52.840> of<00:00:53.050> this<00:00:53.230> cancer<00:00:53.739> the<00:00:54.429> same<00:00:54.670> tests

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
get rid of this cancer the same tests

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:57.689 
get rid of this cancer the same tests
that<00:00:55.269> I<00:00:55.390> had<00:00:55.600> that<00:00:55.780> told<00:00:56.019> me<00:00:56.079> I<00:00:56.140> had<00:00:56.410> it<00:00:56.699> now

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
that I had that told me I had it now

00:00:57.699 --> 00:00:59.660 
that I had that told me I had it now
tells<00:00:58.059> me<00:00:58.269> I<00:00:58.449> don't<00:00:58.839> have<00:00:59.079> it<00:00:59.230> anymore

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
tells me I don't have it anymore

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.569 
tells me I don't have it anymore
so<00:01:00.670> I've<00:01:01.600> beat<00:01:01.929> this<00:01:02.199> with<00:01:02.769> alternative

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
so I've beat this with alternative

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.470 
so I've beat this with alternative
medicine<00:01:03.999> I<00:01:04.620> was<00:01:05.620> diagnosed<00:01:06.130> with<00:01:06.280> this

some<00:01:10.210> choices<00:01:10.450> to<00:01:10.689> make<00:01:10.840> on<00:01:11.229> how<00:01:11.439> I<00:01:11.470> was<00:01:11.680> going

lymphoma it took the time to show me the
research<00:02:14.640> on<00:02:14.910> what<00:02:15.120> causes<00:02:15.480> lymphoma<00:02:16.170> how<00:02:16.620> we

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
research on what causes lymphoma how we

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.880 
research on what causes lymphoma how we
can<00:02:17.280> combat<00:02:17.940> lymphoma<00:02:18.570> and<00:02:18.960> how<00:02:19.470> your<00:02:19.650> immune

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890
