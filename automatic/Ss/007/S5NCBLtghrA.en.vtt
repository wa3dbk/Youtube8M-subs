shock<00:01:11.930> at<00:01:12.080> the<00:01:12.110> rail<00:01:12.350> which<00:01:12.920> according<00:01:13.310> to

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
shock at the rail which according to

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.040 
shock at the rail which according to
baggage<00:01:13.700> is<00:01:13.850> the<00:01:13.910> first<00:01:14.119> for<00:01:14.330> the<00:01:14.390> country<00:01:14.720> and

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
baggage is the first for the country and

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.070 
baggage is the first for the country and
interestingly<00:01:16.040> it<00:01:16.490> uses<00:01:16.910> petal<00:01:17.720> disturb

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
interestingly it uses petal disturb

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.930 
interestingly it uses petal disturb
Putin's<00:01:19.420> neat-looking<00:01:20.420> a<00:01:20.780> lot<00:01:20.930> design<00:01:21.940> the

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
Putin's neat-looking a lot design the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.340 
Putin's neat-looking a lot design the
train<00:01:23.150> looks<00:01:23.300> pretty<00:01:23.570> similar<00:01:23.780> to<00:01:23.960> the<00:01:24.140> pulse

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
train looks pretty similar to the pulse

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.830 
train looks pretty similar to the pulse
of<00:01:24.470> 135<00:01:28.030> those<00:01:29.030> are<00:01:29.150> the<00:01:29.180> tail<00:01:29.390> light<00:01:29.570> switch

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
of 135 those are the tail light switch

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.240 
of 135 those are the tail light switch
again<00:01:30.259> remind<00:01:30.590> you<00:01:30.680> of<00:01:30.800> the<00:01:30.830> previous

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
again remind you of the previous

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:40.520 
again remind you of the previous
generation<00:01:31.280> also

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:50.490 

that's<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:42.160> other<00:01:42.280> side<00:01:42.550> of<00:01:42.580> the<00:01:42.790> engine<00:01:49.500> now

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
that's the other side of the engine now

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.290 
that's the other side of the engine now
this<00:01:50.680> engine<00:01:51.100> interestingly<00:01:51.340> uses<00:01:52.060> a<00:01:52.090> faux

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
this engine interestingly uses a faux

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.090 
this engine interestingly uses a faux
valve<00:01:52.540> head<00:01:52.780> and<00:01:53.140> other<00:01:53.620> side<00:01:53.860> it<00:01:53.950> has<00:01:54.040> a

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
valve head and other side it has a

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.060 
valve head and other side it has a
triple<00:01:54.370> spark<00:01:55.090> ignition<00:01:55.560> but<00:01:56.560> it<00:01:56.710> still<00:01:56.920> does

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
triple spark ignition but it still does

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.859 
triple spark ignition but it still does
not<00:01:57.220> get<00:01:57.400> fuel<00:01:57.580> injection<00:01:57.970> and<00:01:58.150> the<00:01:58.750> new

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
not get fuel injection and the new

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:08.249 
not get fuel injection and the new
pulser<00:01:59.229> gets<00:01:59.440> carburation<00:01:59.920> again<00:02:07.259> okay

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
pulser gets carburation again okay

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.520 
pulser gets carburation again okay
interesting<00:02:09.070> bits<00:02:09.280> are<00:02:10.350> all<00:02:11.350> right<00:02:11.590> I<00:02:11.890> see<00:02:13.530> why

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
interesting bits are all right I see why

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.760 
interesting bits are all right I see why
is<00:02:15.040> it<00:02:15.160> an<00:02:15.250> XYZ<00:02:15.870> what<00:02:16.870> I<00:02:16.900> can't<00:02:17.140> see<00:02:17.620> the

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
is it an XYZ what I can't see the

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.960 
is it an XYZ what I can't see the
connection<00:02:18.730> but<00:02:19.150> again<00:02:19.440> mind<00:02:20.440> that<00:02:20.970> using

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
connection but again mind that using

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.610 
connection but again mind that using
that<00:02:22.120> will<00:02:22.360> make<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.660> bite<00:02:22.810> more<00:02:23.020> expensive

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
that will make the bite more expensive

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.090 
that will make the bite more expensive
especially<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.520> fuel<00:02:24.700> injection<00:02:25.000> bit

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
especially the fuel injection bit

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.080 
especially the fuel injection bit
