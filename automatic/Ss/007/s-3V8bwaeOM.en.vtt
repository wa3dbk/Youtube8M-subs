so not a lot not a lot no did a lot of
autocrossing<00:01:49.790> I<00:01:50.060> believe<00:01:50.300> before<00:01:50.810> I<00:01:50.990> got<00:01:51.410> it

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
autocrossing I believe before I got it

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.040

the<00:01:52.370> guy<00:01:52.490> that<00:01:52.670> had<00:01:52.790> it<00:01:52.880> before<00:01:53.030> me

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
I think he took a pretty good care of it

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.610 
I think he took a pretty good care of it
it's<00:01:56.540> in<00:01:56.630> pretty<00:01:56.840> good<00:01:56.990> shape<00:01:57.050> now<00:01:57.380> and<00:01:57.560> I
