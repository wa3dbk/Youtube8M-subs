00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.610
 the long distance detection with 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.860
 electronic detectors is an invention 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.860
 bring the world's audience for a thousand euros 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.110
 this video will help you understand 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.510
 the use of this range of 90 or more 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.230
 f of 80 and technology that has been 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.780
 had not developed in Brazil since 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.270
 1985 that this manual serves to ensure 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.980
 that you will succeed in your quest 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.590
 and it is important that each step of the 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.950
 process is executed accurately 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.660
 and 100% correct 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.910
 your detector works from the 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.190
 search of fields and buses that interact 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.040
 with the electrostatic field generated by 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.480
 earth rotation 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.820
 the fields and look that spread in the 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.920
 space all the cardinal points 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.579
 the trace elements are detectable in the 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.010
 camera and unique locator 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.560
 ie your detector has a camera 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.780
 actively pursued today and seeks 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.180
 negative ions of objects buried there 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.080
 many years the soil detecting the long 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.540
 distance in great depth before 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.310
 It's important that you check the 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.600
 accessories that comes with your detector 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:30.710
 a directional locator of substances 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:33.350
 a center of a support for measuring a 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.790
 User manual of a briefcase 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.409
 transport a train 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.360
 remember to also always take with you 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.350
 a spare set with 12 non-standard batteries 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.860
 rechargeable 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.509
 always use alkaline batteries to worry about 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.250
 the relative humidity of the air 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.740
 the performance of your detector is 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.079
 proportional to it and the lower the 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.060
 humidity and improved detection is 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.619
 It is interesting that you have with you a 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.899
 digital hydrometer 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:03.670
 the ideal is that the relative humidity of the air 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.670
 is below 70% 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:10.179
 calibrating the detector is a process 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:12.550
 decisive and at the same time very simple 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.260
 it must be done on site in 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.069
 that you have chosen to accomplish your 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.560
 search 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.080
 preferably in the external environment and 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.330
 away from power grids 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.250
 place detector in upright position 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.670
 holding the right hand in the car. 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.010
 transport before connecting the conference 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.220
 venier or the mechanical counter of 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.620
 number 100 0 and then turn on the 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.430
 press the red test button on the 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.950
 stacks 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:43.140
 it marks the charge on your detector that 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.140
 should reach 13 and 18 volts 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.830
 the compass bridge to the south 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.290
 giovanni and until you hear a continuous beep 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.870
 slowly down counter until the 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.390
 detector mute stabilizing back 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.780
 then a minimum of ten units to 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.599
 that the detector is not very sensitive 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.910
 ready you can start the method 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.930
 of research 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.120
 we recommend that you walk with the 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.280
 coasts to the north to the south 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.380
 because the projection area of ​​the lines 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.750
 irradiated has the shape of an ellipse 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.239
 making the lines toward the 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.640
 north are larger 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:38.420
 so remember if you can 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.700
 walks north south 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.370
 walking zig zag movement 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.760
 right-angled 180-degree 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.500
 left and left to right 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.470
 this movement should not be too slow 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.130
 nor too fast should it be a second 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.130
 it's about 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:02.670
 when you hear a beep is a sign that 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.650
 something was detected 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.280
 pay close attention to the direction of the sound 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.049
 because your detector is directional and this 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.340
 will be the first indication on which 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:16.530
 direction follow this way 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.199
 following the orientation of bibi moving 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.750
 now the detector in the upright position and 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:23.699
 going against the location of the object 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.770
 from the moment you are 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:27.750
 approaching the public will be increasingly 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.000
 more result for the floor 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.850
 keep walking until it just comes 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.039
 exactly in the direction of your feet and 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:39.380
 means that you are positioned 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.380
 exactly on top of the object 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:48.870
 I marked an x ​​in this region to confirm 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.810
 the center and discover the depth of 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.510
 object you will need to use the 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:59.820
 understand that it comes with the 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:02.310
 detector detected on the 20 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.470
 centimeters of the center marked as it was 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.849
 pointed down and with the compass 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.849
 pointed north 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.690
 holding always had by the car of 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.450
 transport 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:21.120
 make cross movements to confirm 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.110
 and always marked by the detector at 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.980
 locate it 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:28.530
 the detector and take me out a minute later 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:31.140
 that the center is confirmed the movement 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:34.320
 slowly moving north 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:41.670
 away from the detector until the 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:43.860
 hear again a river market second 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:46.170
 point with a cross 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.080
 the distance between the two points is equal 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:51.150
 the depth of the object found 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.730
 remember that the object is where 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:58.320
 you marked the first cross and it is in this 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:06:00.030
 place you should escalate the withdrawal 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.940
 the object must also be very 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:06.930
 cautious since this may be small and 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:09.270
 easily lose yourself enough 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.040
 care when digging and use a 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.540
 ensure that you control the 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.540
 depth you are digging 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.629
 when you are at a distance 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.500
 10 or 15 centimeters before reaching 

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:26.810
 the object 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.879
 remove the last pass of land and 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:36.770
 place in a separate place 

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:39.199
 ensuring that the object is not lost with 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:44.259
 detector or with their own 

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:44.259
 find the object until you find it. 

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:58.699
 remember to keep your phone turned off 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:07:01.150
 when you are searching wear shoes 

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:03.530
 dry and with rubber soles 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.639
 avoid searching near networks 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.500
 electrical 

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:08.539
 this distance will depend on the intensity 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.789
 from the Web 

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:14.509
 the lower the ambient humidity 

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:17.560
 the highest performance of your day detector 

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:20.240
 provide easy immunization 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:23.720
 always carry the set of batteries 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:26.930
 non-rechargeable alkaline the best 

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:29.539
 hours for research between 8 and 6 and 11 and 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:33.199
 mid-morning or between one and five 

00:07:29.539 --> 00:07:35.479
 later no other accessory should be 

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:39.470
 added to the detector because it may 

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:43.310
 its performance does not approach the detector 

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:45.440
 connected to TV or 

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:49.220
 connected vehicles as this can 

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:51.650
 damage the equipment by following 

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:53.840
 correct all instructions and the 

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:58.060
 sale objects at the research site at 

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.060
