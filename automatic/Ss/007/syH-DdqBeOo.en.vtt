00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.549
 must go and first that all two 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.770
 simple ones that go in back down the court and 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.750
 Goes are not mine are they say plan your channel 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.400
 Enough in the scripting and today I 'm going to 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.309
 talk about the new game that will be 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.830
 replacing zombies in codes to be 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.680
 the jiennense specifically extinction ' 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.449
 bowl and nothing this we continue for the first 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.820
 once we saw it in I think it was the Maltese 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.350
 that added the trailer of squats and then 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.720
 We saw in the back end that the option 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.640
 is to play extinguish mobile they are going to 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.800
 iceberg candle very small so I do not know 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.570
 if they see it well but if this one there 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.730
 we saw the options and also having a 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.280
 zoom goes one hits buzzing nacho 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.500
 as event 30 achievements and then 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.260
 In that way, I had 10 things that I did not know 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.480
 they could see and this week they were lying down and 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.820
 they can be the archives that they have 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.649
 what to do with extinction move and they will see 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.660
 how the connection and how similar to 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.379
 zombie that basically the same but with 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.430
 the inss 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.590
 Nothing can teach you here what 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.230
 archive the first is kate with of 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.629
 world player was with the four 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.400
 players that will be there playing 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.309
 this second one is like 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.140
 get to this one 20 to save I imagine 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.000
 that seif is a place starts in the channel 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.980
 betis that get there and this one is 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.480
 too easy besides that it can be 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.250
 Well round you can take the pass from 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.680
 really like that the settings you can 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.410
 match up to 20 that will get there 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.690
 at 30 40 or if you want to have it infinite 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.610
 and get this you know you have a record 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.030
 world and compete with the others that is 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.730
 what I want this next to Kim 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.320
 skate using the ex honestly I do not know 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.810
 decades a rally that they heard some 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.840
 side by the important here in the image 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.670
 the 3 is between that of crossed we stopped 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.590
 front I do not know if he has any 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.930
 connect the aliens with something that has 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.020
 3 past golf know the 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.530

 point to all the gossip that are 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.500
 here behind after that make it to 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.270
 every time I get to it they fit that I imagine 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.090
 that there is manuel to see what 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.259
 yes I maybe to mature I do not know if because 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.230
 because we really have not seen 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.429
 no sign that they are safe has been 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.829
 that we know home 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.989
 zombie is going to be like a refuge in the 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:15.180
 that you can recover the tea and look 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.159
 things there next month 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.730

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:23.670
 the first time the next exam is every 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.980
 Forensic time without distinction game this way 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.680
 it seems that on top of the aliens such 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.719
 Once on iTunes Itunes Apple iTunes 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.000
 of the map I do not know how it's going to be can 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:35.189
 quote with the 40 in a single game to 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.829
 have that foundation so now 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:40.620
 all imagine what it is that get it the 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:42.989
 kids news and electric fest focus on 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.639
 five games are going to see the split plan 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.379
 of the map well that well if you give it to me 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:48.389
 they are going to see you cheat too 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.639
 like there and you will be able to kill the 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:52.980
 loe lienz with that with the traps that 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:56.040
 they will see around the map next 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.049
 regime is made it to the city so 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.859
 it's the same starts in the fuck and that 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.620
 the city 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:03.480
 I imagine it would be close to safed 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.130
 any pass that the last point that 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.100
 you are going to arrive 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.650
 reig de expal software with world mini 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.330
 interview that is love that says 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.430
 remaining and the dog 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.460
 so it looks like it's going to have a time 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.920
 at the beginning and 10 that legal before that 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.820
 time to get that gossip 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.250
 helicopter that older when you 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.650
 escape from that place and it will not come 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.450
 6 card that is the one they are talking about but 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.880
 if it's too much to me, this excites me 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.970
 by Kate are visually what does 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.500
 this is to create and here that they do as a 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.000
 imitation at least try 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.370
 even with the inss or that looks good 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.170
 tecato like I'm excited that he's 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.480
 trying something new and they have left 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.770
 too much but if this one other people 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.380
 are saying here goes today like there are 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.430
 some audios because the skins in mode are 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.500
 he thinks it's like when he 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.780
 they extinguished the dinosaurs but I think 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.610
 that it would not be like extinguishing the 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.230
 human race because the yen are being 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.630
 attacking the rest and not that we are going to win 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.730
 and that so with stiff does not have much 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.650
 but I'm excited that they are 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.840
 can these new December you know 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.120
 that you think about this when 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.760
 tell them a lot about the simple thing on the boat 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.800
 in the first was playing blitz that 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.280
 it's like with a new game studios that is 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.980
 as here 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.959
 and you get to the flag and he shoots you for 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.630
 back is not like bringing the tuba if you 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.609
 automatically said kick and this the 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.300
 second gameplay that also from now 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:26.520
 this against de chile 5th god is 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.990
 pretty cool car that implies I'm 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.000
 designing then nothing is basically 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.340
 everything is that in signal to start in your 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.870
 opinion on this new game or if it 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.790
 they go to constructive cost on why 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.260
 I do not know if they are going to buy or not but if 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.450
 there are both the immensities a 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.370
 information I hope you liked it if 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.500
 the taste of the aic subscribe have been 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.860
 still made with facebook a tweet in 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.300
 description in which if I have a facebook 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.000
 inside script I'm removed the 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.360
 equipped and swims the next video by 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.360
