you go down like this
come<00:03:45.230> on<00:03:45.380> I<00:03:45.740> need<00:03:46.490> to<00:03:46.700> say<00:03:47.060> has<00:03:47.210> evolved<00:03:47.600> in<00:03:47.690> my

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
come on I need to say has evolved in my

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:48.940 
come on I need to say has evolved in my

come on down

00:03:52.200 --> 00:04:05.760 
come on down
and<00:03:52.680> then<00:03:53.090> wanted<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.540> do<00:03:54.660> that

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.710 

it's<00:04:06.770> pretty<00:04:07.010> much<00:04:07.220> it<00:04:07.490> for<00:04:07.520> tamil<00:04:08.150> walls<00:04:08.510> you

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
it's pretty much it for tamil walls you

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.230 
it's pretty much it for tamil walls you
can<00:04:08.930> do<00:04:09.650> your<00:04:09.830> trick<00:04:10.040> pleasure<00:04:10.400> or<00:04:10.730> wall<00:04:10.970> take

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.010 
can do your trick pleasure or wall take
that<00:04:11.480> you<00:04:11.570> go<00:04:11.750> what<00:04:12.680> everyone<00:04:13.040> and<00:04:13.630> nama<00:04:14.630> shoyu

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
that you go what everyone and nama shoyu

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.720 
that you go what everyone and nama shoyu
running<00:04:15.620> up<00:04:15.770> a<00:04:15.890> wall<00:04:18.519> all<00:04:19.519> right<00:04:19.700> now

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
running up a wall all right now

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.710 
running up a wall all right now
you<00:04:20.910> running<00:04:21.840> with<00:04:21.960> the<00:04:22.020> wrong

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.250 

now<00:04:26.190> this<00:04:27.190> also<00:04:27.880> helps<00:04:28.420> with<00:04:28.480> arm<00:04:28.840> strength

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
now this also helps with arm strength

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.350 
now this also helps with arm strength
because<00:04:29.620> it<00:04:29.710> adds<00:04:29.860> a<00:04:30.010> couple<00:04:30.340> pounds<00:04:30.550> to<00:04:31.240> your

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
because it adds a couple pounds to your

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.180 
because it adds a couple pounds to your
legs<00:04:31.570> make<00:04:31.930> it<00:04:32.110> a<00:04:32.170> little<00:04:32.290> bit<00:04:32.500> harder<00:04:32.860> I<00:04:32.890> guess

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
legs make it a little bit harder I guess

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.380 
legs make it a little bit harder I guess
to<00:04:33.660> choose<00:04:34.660> a<00:04:34.900> little<00:04:35.650> climb<00:04:36.160> up<00:04:36.400> but<00:04:36.700> it

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
to choose a little climb up but it

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.000 
to choose a little climb up but it
shouldn't<00:04:37.840> really<00:04:37.870> be<00:04:38.080> that<00:04:38.380> badging<00:04:38.860> on

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
shouldn't really be that badging on

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.120 
shouldn't really be that badging on
things<00:04:39.400> and<00:04:40.300> this<00:04:40.510> will<00:04:40.690> help<00:04:40.720> you<00:04:41.080> put<00:04:41.890> in<00:04:41.980> to

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
things and this will help you put in to

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.740 
things and this will help you put in to
gain<00:04:42.370> height<00:04:42.730> more<00:04:43.060> because<00:04:43.480> it's<00:04:43.600> higher
