00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
for review before fresh impressions I

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.219 
for review before fresh impressions I
like<00:04:49.830> the<00:04:50.130> weight<00:04:50.940> I<00:04:51.180> like<00:04:51.419> the<00:04:51.600> compact

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
like the weight I like the compact

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.140 
like the weight I like the compact
nature<00:04:52.560> of<00:04:52.770> the<00:04:52.889> solo<00:04:53.070> twos<00:04:53.310> it<00:04:53.520> looks<00:04:53.759> like<00:04:53.970> at

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
nature of the solo twos it looks like at

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.760 
nature of the solo twos it looks like at
least<00:04:54.419> they've<00:04:54.600> done<00:04:54.810> something<00:04:55.199> where<00:04:55.350> they

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
least they've done something where they

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.500 
least they've done something where they
feel<00:04:55.949> much<00:04:56.160> smaller<00:04:56.520> and<00:04:56.669> more<00:04:56.820> portable<00:04:57.090> all

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
feel much smaller and more portable all

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.850 
feel much smaller and more portable all
together<00:04:57.660> I<00:04:57.900> don't<00:04:58.020> really<00:04:58.560> like<00:04:58.740> the

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
together I don't really like the

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.379 
together I don't really like the
glossiness<00:04:59.280> altogether<00:04:59.880> but<00:05:00.120> you<00:05:00.180> can<00:05:00.300> see

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
glossiness altogether but you can see

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.390 
glossiness altogether but you can see
traditional<00:05:00.870> beats<00:05:01.080> on<00:05:01.260> top<00:05:01.470> there<00:05:01.740> you<00:05:02.190> still

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
traditional beats on top there you still

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.830 
traditional beats on top there you still
got<00:05:02.520> that<00:05:02.550> classy<00:05:03.000> look<00:05:03.180> now<00:05:03.330> one<00:05:03.570> thing<00:05:03.720> I

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
got that classy look now one thing I

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.020 
got that classy look now one thing I
noticed<00:05:04.199> is<00:05:04.320> I<00:05:04.500> didn't<00:05:04.830> see<00:05:04.949> a<00:05:04.979> cleaning<00:05:05.910> cloth

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
noticed is I didn't see a cleaning cloth

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.850 
noticed is I didn't see a cleaning cloth
in<00:05:06.360> there<00:05:06.570> I<00:05:06.750> might<00:05:07.199> have<00:05:07.350> missed<00:05:07.530> it

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
in there I might have missed it

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.700 
in there I might have missed it
we'll<00:05:08.370> check<00:05:08.639> again<00:05:08.760> and<00:05:09.570> for<00:05:10.440> the<00:05:10.530> full

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.340 
we'll check again and for the full
review<00:05:10.889> but<00:05:11.280> overall<00:05:11.910> so<00:05:12.840> far<00:05:13.020> I<00:05:13.050> like<00:05:13.289> the

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
review but overall so far I like the

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.650 
review but overall so far I like the
look<00:05:13.740> and<00:05:13.979> feel<00:05:14.220> all<00:05:14.820> together<00:05:15.060> feels<00:05:15.479> more

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
look and feel all together feels more

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.510 
look and feel all together feels more
weighted<00:05:16.139> and<00:05:16.320> it's<00:05:16.470> got<00:05:16.590> that<00:05:16.710> studio<00:05:17.039> look

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
weighted and it's got that studio look
