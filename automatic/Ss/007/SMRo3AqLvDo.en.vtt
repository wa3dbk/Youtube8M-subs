00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
in this game stop too many drives in the

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.180 
in this game stop too many drives in the
first<00:00:12.179> half<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.509> penalties<00:00:13.320> their<00:00:13.530> face<00:00:13.830> mask

first half to penalties their face mask

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.540 
first half to penalties their face mask
and<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:15.920> late<00:00:16.920> hit<00:00:18.260> gave<00:00:19.260> them<00:00:19.590> tremendous

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
and a late hit gave them tremendous

and a late hit gave them tremendous
field<00:00:20.820> position<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.660> think<00:00:22.650> both<00:00:22.890> times<00:00:23.250> they

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
field position I think both times they

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.279 
field position I think both times they
went<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.730> scored<00:00:23.910> touchdowns<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.840> second

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
went and scored touchdowns the second

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.599 
went and scored touchdowns the second
half<00:00:26.119> we<00:00:27.119> turn<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.539> football<00:00:27.779> over<00:00:27.990> twice<00:00:28.650> we

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
half we turn the football over twice we

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.560 
half we turn the football over twice we
had<00:00:29.730> penalties<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:31.850> put<00:00:32.850> us<00:00:32.969> into<00:00:33.210> bad

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
had penalties that put us into bad

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.459 
had penalties that put us into bad
distant<00:00:34.140> down<00:00:34.320> distance<00:00:34.890> situations<00:00:36.440> with<00:00:37.440> a

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
distant down distance situations with a

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.619 
distant down distance situations with a
bad<00:00:37.710> snap<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.899> two-point<00:00:39.899> conversion<00:00:40.620> and

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
bad snap on a two-point conversion and

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.880 
bad snap on a two-point conversion and
so<00:00:42.629> we<00:00:42.930> we<00:00:43.559> didn't<00:00:43.800> execute<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.940> think<00:00:45.890> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
so we we didn't execute I think the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.299 
so we we didn't execute I think the
field<00:00:47.160> goal<00:00:47.430> games<00:00:47.730> there<00:00:47.969> at<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.210> end<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:49.410> we

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
field goal games there at the end so we

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.430 
field goal games there at the end so we
just<00:00:50.520> simply<00:00:50.789> made<00:00:51.210> too<00:00:51.480> many<00:00:51.629> mistakes<00:00:51.750> had

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
just simply made too many mistakes had

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.130 
just simply made too many mistakes had
too<00:00:52.590> many<00:00:52.770> penalties<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.660> too<00:00:54.660> many<00:00:54.899> missed

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
too many penalties and too many missed

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.569 
too many penalties and too many missed
opportunities<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:56.360> so<00:00:57.360> now<00:00:57.570> we<00:00:57.629> have<00:00:58.020> to

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
opportunities and so now we have to

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:05.750 
opportunities and so now we have to
fight<00:00:59.579> back<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:02.719> we've<00:01:03.719> got<00:01:04.309> to<00:01:05.309> deal<00:01:05.549> with

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
fight back and we've got to deal with

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.789 
fight back and we've got to deal with
some<00:01:05.909> adversity<00:01:06.240> we'll<00:01:06.600> find<00:01:06.900> out<00:01:07.049> what<00:01:07.619> we're

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
some adversity we'll find out what we're

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.820 
some adversity we'll find out what we're
made<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.970> big<00:01:09.180> plays<00:01:09.860> we<00:01:12.110> we<00:01:13.110> just<00:01:13.140> did<00:01:13.590> not

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
made of the big plays we we just did not

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.080 
made of the big plays we we just did not
execute<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.970> defense<00:01:15.770> you<00:01:16.770> know<00:01:16.890> we<00:01:17.070> let<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
execute the defense you know we let the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.740 
execute the defense you know we let the
ball<00:01:18.439> got<00:01:19.439> back<00:01:19.740> across<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:21.090> face<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.390> our

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
ball got back across the face of our

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.469 
ball got back across the face of our
safety<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.670> you<00:01:23.670> know<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.030> you've<00:01:24.180> got<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
safety and you know so you've got the

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.640 
safety and you know so you've got the
leverage<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:25.020> football

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
leverage of football

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
leverage of football
and<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:28.630> know<00:01:28.750> we<00:01:29.170> just<00:01:29.200> we<00:01:30.130> just<00:01:30.370> didn't

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
and you know we just we just didn't

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.140 
and you know we just we just didn't
execute<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:32.430> responsibilities<00:01:33.430> that<00:01:33.610> you

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
know in the first half and it's how you

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.899 
know in the first half and it's how you
get<00:01:38.920> people<00:01:39.100> open

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.510 

well<00:01:43.479> I<00:01:43.510> think<00:01:43.840> it's<00:01:44.200> I<00:01:44.439> think<00:01:44.530> it's<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:47.590> think

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.880 
well I think it's I think it's I think
it's<00:01:48.820> a<00:01:48.939> combination<00:01:49.180> I<00:01:49.810> think<00:01:50.080> you<00:01:50.560> know<00:01:50.680> an

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.720 

you<00:01:57.620> have<00:01:57.800> to<00:01:57.980> play<00:01:58.310> to<00:01:58.700> get<00:01:59.090> it<00:01:59.240> and<00:02:00.610> you<00:02:01.610> know

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 
you have to play to get it and you know
