some of our quality on the ball as good

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.190 
some of our quality on the ball as good
as<00:01:22.560> we'd<00:01:22.650> like<00:01:23.180> these<00:01:24.180> games<00:01:24.360> are<00:01:24.540> always<00:01:24.689> very

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
as we'd like these games are always very

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.920

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
very close games you know I think during

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.990 
very close games you know I think during
the<00:01:28.170> lead-up<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:28.799> week<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.220> lot<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.790> the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
the lead-up to this week a lot of the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.960 
the lead-up to this week a lot of the
charters<00:01:30.479> have<00:01:30.509> been<00:01:30.750> about<00:01:31.670> any<00:01:32.670> team<00:01:32.939> in

we got out here and saw the pitch and
everything<00:02:43.770> and<00:02:44.310> meeting<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.240> Prince<00:02:45.510> as<00:02:45.660> a

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
everything and meeting the Prince as a

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.880 
everything and meeting the Prince as a
few<00:02:45.930> nerves<00:02:46.110> flowing<00:02:46.440> around<00:02:46.650> but<00:02:46.800> I<00:02:46.860> think

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
few nerves flowing around but I think

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.010 
few nerves flowing around but I think
after<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.460> first<00:02:47.490> sort<00:02:47.850> of<00:02:47.880> 5-10<00:02:48.270> minutes<00:02:48.480> we

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
after the first sort of 5-10 minutes we

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.960 
after the first sort of 5-10 minutes we
all<00:02:49.110> settle<00:02:49.680> down<00:02:49.710> and<00:02:50.220> well<00:02:50.580> I<00:02:50.670> think<00:02:50.820> when<00:02:50.910> I

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
all settle down and well I think when I

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.790 
all settle down and well I think when I
score<00:02:51.240> to<00:02:51.360> open<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.690> game<00:02:51.840> up<00:02:51.870> we<00:02:52.020> actually<00:02:52.110> we

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.580 
good it was aggressive it's quite quick
my<00:02:57.330> standard<00:02:57.660> was<00:02:57.780> half<00:02:57.900> decent<00:02:58.110> as<00:02:58.350> of<00:02:58.470> you

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590

tie<00:02:58.710> and<00:02:58.860> legs<00:02:59.040> sort<00:02:59.460> of<00:02:59.490> running<00:02:59.640> around

tie and legs sort of running around
towards<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.240> end<00:03:00.360> but<00:03:00.840> I<00:03:01.140> think<00:03:01.770> it's<00:03:02.460> been<00:03:02.610> an

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
towards the end but I think it's been an

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.760 
towards the end but I think it's been an
incredible<00:03:03.060> day<00:03:03.150> like<00:03:03.750> I<00:03:03.870> you<00:03:04.170> know<00:03:04.290> struggle
