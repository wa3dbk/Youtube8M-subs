it's<00:02:15.710> not<00:02:16.010> super<00:02:16.700> loud<00:02:16.880> but<00:02:17.390> I<00:02:17.660> think<00:02:17.960> some<00:02:18.230> of

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
it's not super loud but I think some of

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.690 
it's not super loud but I think some of
the<00:02:18.440> grease<00:02:18.710> is<00:02:18.920> starting<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.310> kind<00:02:19.490> of<00:02:19.520> wear

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
the grease is starting to kind of wear

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.400 
the grease is starting to kind of wear
out<00:02:19.730> of<00:02:19.910> it<00:02:20.120> so<00:02:20.390> it's<00:02:20.660> been<00:02:20.840> getting<00:02:21.080> louder

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
out of it so it's been getting louder

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.860 
out of it so it's been getting louder
and<00:02:22.690> I<00:02:23.690> chains<00:02:24.140> pretty<00:02:24.440> tight<00:02:24.680> too<00:02:24.980> so<00:02:25.340> it's

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
and I chains pretty tight too so it's

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.270 
and I chains pretty tight too so it's
not<00:02:26.870> going<00:02:27.080> to<00:02:27.170> spin<00:02:27.470> very<00:02:27.680> freely<00:02:28.990> so<00:02:30.280> that's

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
not going to spin very freely so that's

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.370 
not going to spin very freely so that's
my<00:02:31.490> bike<00:02:31.670> check<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:32.360> I'll<00:02:32.660> get<00:02:32.870> some<00:02:33.020> updates

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
my bike check and I'll get some updates

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.970 
my bike check and I'll get some updates
and<00:02:33.560> I<00:02:33.650> get<00:02:33.800> some<00:02:34.010> actually<00:02:34.910> good<00:02:35.270> parts<00:02:35.660> on<00:02:35.840> it

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
and I get some actually good parts on it

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.130 
and I get some actually good parts on it
so<00:02:36.980> yeah
