00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
like a bit here as well because like

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.010 
like a bit here as well because like
there<00:01:35.920> was<00:01:36.040> a<00:01:36.070> bit<00:01:36.330> noticeable<00:01:37.330> there<00:01:37.570> and<00:01:37.750> so

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
there was a bit noticeable there and so

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.940 
there was a bit noticeable there and so
she<00:01:38.200> just

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
she just

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.310 
she just
it's<00:01:39.430> literally<00:01:39.820> like<00:01:40.000> one<00:01:40.479> pulse<00:01:40.869> of<00:01:41.200> the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
it's literally like one pulse of the

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.840 
it's literally like one pulse of the
lights<00:01:41.500> on<00:01:41.800> so<00:01:41.830> she<00:01:42.040> just<00:01:42.340> thought<00:01:42.490> up<00:01:42.640> for

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
lights on so she just thought up for

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.560 
lights on so she just thought up for
free<00:01:43.060> so<00:01:46.289> home<00:01:47.289> now<00:01:47.740> so<00:01:48.340> looking<00:01:49.149> into<00:01:49.479> the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
free so home now so looking into the

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.990 
free so home now so looking into the
mirror<00:01:49.780> like<00:01:50.289> just<00:01:50.500> before<00:01:50.830> I<00:01:51.100> could<00:01:51.520> say<00:01:51.700> like

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
mirror like just before I could say like

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.690 
mirror like just before I could say like
it<00:01:52.360> is<00:01:52.539> a<00:01:52.570> lot<00:01:52.840> more<00:01:53.020> you<00:01:54.009> can't<00:01:54.220> really<00:01:54.399> see<00:01:54.670> it

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
it is a lot more you can't really see it

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.520 
it is a lot more you can't really see it
on<00:01:54.820> camera<00:01:55.030> but<00:01:55.450> there's<00:01:55.690> a<00:01:55.869> lot<00:01:56.200> of<00:01:56.229> sort<00:01:56.500> of

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
on camera but there's a lot of sort of

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.400 
on camera but there's a lot of sort of
redness<00:01:56.979> around<00:01:57.390> those<00:01:58.390> areas<00:01:59.050> sort<00:01:59.350> of

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
redness around those areas sort of

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.969 
redness around those areas sort of
nicely

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
nicely

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.680

out<00:02:00.429> there<00:02:00.700> which<00:02:00.880> is<00:02:01.000> odd<00:02:01.210> because<00:02:01.420> it<00:02:01.660> was

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
out there which is odd because it was

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.249 
out there which is odd because it was
nicely<00:02:02.140> in<00:02:02.229> there<00:02:02.440> but<00:02:02.860> I<00:02:03.600> don't<00:02:04.600> know<00:02:04.690> weird
