00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
the other my tips for discovery is

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.150 
the other my tips for discovery is
really<00:01:04.260> just<00:01:04.379> learning<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.739> layout<00:01:04.980> of<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
really just learning the layout of the

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.890 
really just learning the layout of the
map<00:01:05.339> understanding<00:01:06.060> how<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.300> chasm<00:01:06.720> can

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
map understanding how that chasm can

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.600 
map understanding how that chasm can
impact<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.410> flow<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.800> the<00:01:07.950> game<00:01:07.980> play<00:01:08.370> and

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
impact the flow of the game play and

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.310 
impact the flow of the game play and
always<00:01:09.090> being<00:01:09.240> conscious<00:01:09.690> of<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.960> exposure

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
always being conscious of the exposure

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.170 
always being conscious of the exposure
that<00:01:10.440> you<00:01:10.620> have<00:01:10.800> to<00:01:11.070> long-range<00:01:11.400> weapons<00:01:11.940> you

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
that you have to long-range weapons you

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.210 
that you have to long-range weapons you
might<00:01:12.330> be<00:01:12.510> on<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.659> snow<00:01:13.200> bridge<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.920> somebody

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
might be on a snow bridge and somebody

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.130 
might be on a snow bridge and somebody

engagement distances are going to be
really<00:02:03.740> small<00:02:04.009> so<00:02:04.070> use<00:02:04.520> that<00:02:04.549> to<00:02:04.820> your

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
really small so use that to your
