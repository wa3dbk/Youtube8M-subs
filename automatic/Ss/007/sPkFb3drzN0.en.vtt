00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.990
 Hello my dear, I welcome you 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.770
 Welcome to a new project 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.330
 my channel 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.859
 This will be in the table tennis area 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.690
 I will take you there 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.080
 different strokes on care and 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.450
 things to the rules explain today in 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.510
 We discuss the first episode and 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.609
 I show you Bettina and settle in 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.590
 area table tennis a lot of fun 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.560
 and if you liked the result 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.560
 like this many thanks for the country 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.920
 why are you setting that down so far? 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.460
 the plate that is also forbidden or 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.390
 Not 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.320
 clearly one may or that one 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.900
 difficult case 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.360
 but no, you have the ball over the 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.739
 throw up the table edge and that at least 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.690
 16 cm 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.400
 Also, the ball should be off the flat 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.540
 Hand thrown and may not 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.489
 I'm holding you 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.620
 said that if that is not there yes 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.620
 Okay, I'll do it again 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:45.610
 However, the indication must be diagonal 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:49.170
 abroad or you do not have an organizer 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.170
 of course I have that or 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.060
 not even that 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.590
 but, of course, when it comes to the indication, no wise 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.630
 often from combination on real or natural 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.400
 it is forbidden even if the other 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.620
 the ball on your side twice 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.660
 comes up that means the ball 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.100
 liberated indication only on one 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.080
 side or on the same 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:38.770
 opponents and thus the other side 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:43.450
 the last thing comes up against it 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:45.880
 well then I'm sorry that's mine 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.470
 come no, that's anyway 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.420
 why should I have the ball 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.380
 not on the plate that's my point 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.850
 or not because the case may be smooth 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.340
 light issued without contact 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.470
 that means the forest has to go up once 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:05.130
 my plate is twice too 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.130
 not what we continue to play 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.110
 I'm not standing there back there 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.570
 as are wrong with you not a round lay 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:17.980
 for if you vollidiot na clear is always 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:20.350
 still my thing or clothes and that 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.050
 topic because when all sports come 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.090
 frequent conflicts abroad is 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.680
 but in all sports it is too 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.760
 in the table tennis so that you look 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.410
 Of course not offended and tried 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.690
 also apologize if the forest 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.230
 has come to an edge or the net 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.050
 touched 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:42.100
 that's why guys fit a bit better 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:44.410
 not so noticeable will be very clear 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:53.920
 each sure of ours anyway 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:55.840
 but I 'm banned now 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.430
 then it will be easy to play 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.180
 you do it and not forbidden 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.890
 that is allowed or of course it is not 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.570
 allowed to pose with the gentleman 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.880
 the same applies to the upper body as well 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.900
 example of the soon from now with the 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.910
 played bat 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.620
 of course there is an exception to that 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.940
 balda roman then played with thumb 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.940
 if I happen to do it 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.820
 and we can continue even if we do 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.820
 right again 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.160
 hey double booking is prohibited 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.910
 is not on special tricks 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.970
 it allows or funny of course allowed 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.770
 If you hit the ball then the ball should open 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:47.390
 have landed the opposing side 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:49.010
 also the same applies to contributions of the 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.690
 ball the network is touched or no 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:55.250
 page follows is a repetition or 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.660
 no there is a repetition if 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.500
 Meanwhile, unfortunately, leave an indication 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.060
 Touched when bursting the opponent if the 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.430
 ball touches the net and back into the 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.950
 own half falls back but if the 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.320
 just ball the net and then strip it up 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:16.870
 the opposing side goes then it is 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:16.870
 a repetition not said but only 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.930
 fast that they did not lose 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:26.700
 over the net na clear that allows it or 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.290
 here too, there are clear rules meanwhile 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:33.480
 must not be played across the net 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:35.280
 but also around it now is dying 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.320
 let them know about the most important 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.300
 Errors and rules in table tennis 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.070
