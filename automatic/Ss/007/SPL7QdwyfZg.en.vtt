00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.080
 hello everyone and welcome to the channel 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.970
 techno 01net if you are gamer you 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.400
 know the alienware brand 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.420
 the pc alienware is a little bit the 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.590
 rolls of pc gamer 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.139
 and yes it's power monsters 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.240
 is well tied ware that was bought back by 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.880
 dell a few years ago this has 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.590
 presented in recent days 3 pc 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.420
 portable that combines mobility 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.600
 and power to play your 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.600
 favorite games 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.750
 three new laptops 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.700
 alienware 14:17 and alienware 18 so 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.440
 that they are at the new generation of 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.110
 alienware laptops with a new 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.489
 new design chassis and a whole bunch of 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.300
 new technologies integrated with our 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.300
 laptop 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.340
 we are 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.750
 so there the blacks 14 it's a the 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.910
 better compromise between mobility and 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.070
 performance so this is the ideal for 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.180
 players who move often but 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.710
 who still want to keep a 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.990
 machine of a certain power 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.270
 the alienware 17 is a balance in 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.670
 does between performance and clutter 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.390
 he is much more powerful obviously 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.400
 that the 14 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.890
 in return it is a little heavier 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.600
 and it's ideal for players who are 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.770
 move relatively little but who 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.229
 want to keep a minimum 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.340
 mobility while retaining the 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.340
 maximum performance possible 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.570
 the glow 18 is the desktop replacement 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.470
 so basically he's here to replace a 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.500
 desktop computer 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.360
 he'll be more powerful than a big 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.160
 majority of desktop computers there 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.830
 comes delivered basic with a combination 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.450
 double graphics card so in italy and 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.610
 it is there really we will be able to see the 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:57.000
 ultimate performance in computers 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:58.960
 portable technical level it's simple 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.780
 fourth generation of processors 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.150
 intel core i7 so the processor 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.610
 haswell for obviously as usual 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.140
 so the really to continue the 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.030
 alienware philosophy which is the 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.730
 looking for the best performance 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.860
 possible and in addition obviously the 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.040
 latest nvidia graphics cards so 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.530
 the 7 series with a range that goes from 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.170
 the 750 m 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.890
 so on the liner 14 in cards 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.350
 basic graphics 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.830
 obviously with then a range of 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.220
 cards in option and up to a 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.890
 combination of dual graphics card in 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:39.040
 gtx 280m on the alienware 18 which 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.060
 so represents the the rolls in terms of 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.100
 graphical power 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.900
 here for this look on the pc 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.269
 alienware that will be coming out soon 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.650
 report of Aymeric Simeon ah yes there the 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.130
 Donkey fans will give it their all 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.860
 joy 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.300
 to note that of course alienware is not 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.150
 the only manufacturer to do high pc 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.860
 of range 1 specialized in the game 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.060
 look good at the builders we are going 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.150
 say traditional who they too 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.890
 come out of the laptops here are very 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.959
 powerful for the game that will be 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.519
 maybe cheaper than said ware that 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.410
 still keep a certain price 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.110
 because of the design of the machines that is 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.450
 rather successful in love most 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.310
 gamers with always the little 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.450
