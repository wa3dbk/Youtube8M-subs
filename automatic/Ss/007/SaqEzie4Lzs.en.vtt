00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.570 
think that needs to happen especially
after<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.840> first<00:01:10.110> fight<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
after the first fight and this is the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.190 
after the first fight and this is the
best<00:01:11.760> fight<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.330> can<00:01:12.510> make<00:01:12.720> out<00:01:12.930> there

Pacquiao and Timothy Bradley it's the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.219 
Pacquiao and Timothy Bradley it's the
best<00:01:26.880> fight<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.420> could<00:01:27.630> make
