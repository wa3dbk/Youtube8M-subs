 the word thousand 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.310

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.300
 the word million 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.300
 It is only used in the singular 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.930
 to talk about a million rolled 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.780
 one million is used 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.070

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.719
 million 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:12.699
 It's masculine 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:16.349
 and therefore the hundreds 300 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:18.579
 that precede it 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.579
 they always go in masculine 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.269
 when despres after one million or millions 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.259
 comes a noun 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:31.039
 population 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:34.039
 they carry the preposition 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.989
 How do you read a number in Spanish? 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.059
