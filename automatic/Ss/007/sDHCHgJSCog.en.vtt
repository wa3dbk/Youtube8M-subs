more so I don't use it all and I'll say

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.270 
more so I don't use it all and I'll say
the<00:03:08.430> ark<00:03:08.610> sights<00:03:08.940> aren't<00:03:09.300> all<00:03:09.510> that<00:03:09.540> bad<00:03:10.280> other

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
the ark sights aren't all that bad other

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.670 
the ark sights aren't all that bad other
decent<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.360> guess<00:03:12.630> I<00:03:12.870> mean<00:03:13.020> you<00:03:13.110> could<00:03:13.320> use<00:03:13.500> them

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
decent I guess I mean you could use them

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.190 
decent I guess I mean you could use them
and<00:03:13.890> I<00:03:14.490> mean<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:14.820> sometimes<00:03:15.300> use<00:03:15.690> them<00:03:15.900> you

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
and I mean I sometimes use them you

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.570 
and I mean I sometimes use them you
could<00:03:16.380> put<00:03:16.560> scope<00:03:16.770> on<00:03:16.920> here<00:03:17.070> but<00:03:17.310> it's<00:03:17.460> not

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
could put scope on here but it's not

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.140 
could put scope on here but it's not
required<00:03:18.060> also<00:03:18.600> also<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:19.880> accuracy<00:03:20.880> on<00:03:21.000> this

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
required also also the accuracy on this

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.840 
required also also the accuracy on this
weapon<00:03:21.510> isn't<00:03:21.750> all<00:03:22.320> that<00:03:22.740> amazing<00:03:23.100> it<00:03:23.640> is

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
weapon isn't all that amazing it is

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.240 
weapon isn't all that amazing it is
since<00:03:24.630> it<00:03:24.750> has<00:03:24.930> such<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.200> high<00:03:25.470> damage<00:03:25.710> in<00:03:26.130> a

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
since it has such a high damage in a

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.600 
since it has such a high damage in a
pretty<00:03:26.640> average<00:03:26.880> rate<00:03:27.480> of<00:03:27.600> fire<00:03:28.250> since<00:03:29.250> it<00:03:29.430> has

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
pretty average rate of fire since it has

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.850 
pretty average rate of fire since it has
that<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.480> accuracy<00:03:31.170> on<00:03:31.200> this<00:03:31.380> weapon<00:03:31.530> is

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
that the accuracy on this weapon is

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.500 
that the accuracy on this weapon is
worse<00:03:32.370> than<00:03:32.640> a<00:03:32.730> carbine<00:03:33.060> rifle<00:03:33.360> it's<00:03:33.480> not

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
worse than a carbine rifle it's not

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.140 
worse than a carbine rifle it's not
terrible<00:03:34.260> but<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:35.010> does<00:03:35.340> have<00:03:35.550> quite<00:03:35.760> a<00:03:35.850> bit<00:03:36.060> of

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
terrible but it does have quite a bit of

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.330 
terrible but it does have quite a bit of
spread<00:03:36.510> so<00:03:37.170> I<00:03:37.200> would<00:03:37.410> recommend<00:03:37.590> using<00:03:38.100> this

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
spread so I would recommend using this

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.640 
spread so I would recommend using this
weapon<00:03:38.550> for<00:03:39.150> not<00:03:39.480> necessary<00:03:39.960> gain<00:03:40.140> head<00:03:40.380> shots

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
weapon for not necessary gain head shots

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.890 
weapon for not necessary gain head shots
but<00:03:40.800> just<00:03:41.010> shooting<00:03:41.340> at<00:03:41.520> the<00:03:41.700> chest<00:03:42.030> since<00:03:42.750> you

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
but just shooting at the chest since you

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.320 
but just shooting at the chest since you
can<00:03:43.140> kill<00:03:43.350> an<00:03:43.470> enemy<00:03:43.590> quite<00:03:44.130> fast<00:03:44.460> in<00:03:45.060> the

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
can kill an enemy quite fast in the

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.480 
can kill an enemy quite fast in the
chest<00:03:45.600> i<00:03:45.750> mean<00:03:45.990> 500<00:03:46.290> rounds<00:03:46.680> per<00:03:46.950> minute<00:03:47.100> and

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
chest i mean 500 rounds per minute and

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.700 
chest i mean 500 rounds per minute and
if<00:03:47.970> you<00:03:48.090> if<00:03:48.450> you<00:03:48.660> hit<00:03:48.840> your<00:03:48.960> shots<00:03:49.230> if<00:03:49.530> you

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.710 
if you if you hit your shots if you

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.140 
if you if you hit your shots if you
can't<00:03:49.980> hit<00:03:50.160> that<00:03:50.340> edge<00:03:50.550> shot<00:03:50.850> with<00:03:51.000> this

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
can't hit that edge shot with this

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.030 
can't hit that edge shot with this
weapon<00:03:51.330> you<00:03:51.690> could<00:03:51.840> definitely<00:03:52.320> just<00:03:52.590> shoot

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
weapon you could definitely just shoot

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.410 
weapon you could definitely just shoot
them<00:03:53.130> at<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.370> chest<00:03:53.640> because<00:03:53.790> it<00:03:54.030> does<00:03:54.180> have

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
them at the chest because it does have

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.000 
them at the chest because it does have
that<00:03:54.570> high<00:03:54.780> damage<00:03:55.290> now<00:03:55.620> if<00:03:55.680> you're<00:03:55.800> wondering

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
that high damage now if you're wondering

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.400 
that high damage now if you're wondering
well<00:03:56.670> why<00:03:57.030> what<00:03:57.510> would<00:03:57.630> i<00:03:57.690> recommend<00:03:57.900> using

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
well why what would i recommend using

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.140 
well why what would i recommend using
this<00:03:58.620> weapon<00:03:58.830> for<00:03:59.220> i<00:03:59.490> would<00:04:00.000> honestly

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
this weapon for i would honestly

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.600 
this weapon for i would honestly
recommend<00:04:00.480> using<00:04:00.960> this<00:04:01.140> weapon<00:04:01.320> it's<00:04:02.220> not<00:04:02.430> as

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
recommend using this weapon it's not as

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.570 
recommend using this weapon it's not as
versatile<00:04:03.120> as<00:04:03.270> say<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.630> carbine<00:04:04.050> rifle<00:04:04.580> just

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
versatile as say the carbine rifle just

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.520 
versatile as say the carbine rifle just
because<00:04:05.850> of<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.060> accuracy<00:04:06.510> on<00:04:06.690> it<00:04:06.960> and<00:04:07.110> to

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
because of the accuracy on it and to

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.040 
because of the accuracy on it and to
spread<00:04:07.740> but<00:04:08.310> if<00:04:08.610> you<00:04:08.970> want<00:04:09.210> to<00:04:09.480> be<00:04:09.630> more

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
spread but if you want to be more

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.260 
spread but if you want to be more
close-range<00:04:10.800> if<00:04:11.100> you<00:04:11.190> want<00:04:11.310> to<00:04:11.400> be<00:04:11.550> have<00:04:12.240> a

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
close-range if you want to be have a

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.020 
close-range if you want to be have a
higher<00:04:12.660> damage<00:04:13.320> and<00:04:13.620> you<00:04:14.190> want<00:04:14.550> to<00:04:14.700> just<00:04:14.880> shoot

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
higher damage and you want to just shoot

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.670 
higher damage and you want to just shoot
them<00:04:15.150> at<00:04:15.300> the<00:04:15.420> chest<00:04:15.690> or<00:04:15.870> maybe<00:04:16.020> the<00:04:16.170> legs<00:04:16.410> not

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
them at the chest or maybe the legs not

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.229 
them at the chest or maybe the legs not
necessarily<00:04:17.160> get<00:04:17.340> a<00:04:17.370> head<00:04:17.580> shot<00:04:17.609> because<00:04:18.090> all
