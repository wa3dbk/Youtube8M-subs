00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.940
 Euro and welcome to be respected is Hirschhausen our motto runner 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.820
 Head against ORF German today the thrilling topic really has to be 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.240
 spend first 500 euros before I can start running and why do 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.940
 I also like that with Eckart von Hirschhausen who knows the Werders 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.530
 Torsten Gellner The weather Ennerich fatal to the placebo effect 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:25.689
 drugs 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.849
 There are always studies that it is that you have an economy SZ against 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.820
 something ineffective, namely a dextrose tablet 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.130
 and the live demo research is now so far that you can show 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.780
 that people believe they are taking an expensive grape sugar tablet 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.340
 Actually more effect citizen associations have been assigned to the associated 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.960
 far away - is represented 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.879
 So if I buy more Thon shoes 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.339
 which somehow disgustingly seemingly run by myself, I believe too 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:56.350
 paradoxical effect one i think i've already invested so much money now 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.440
 I always run Schumacher for me alone interesting question 

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:01.679
 the placebo effect works 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:04.929
 When I look at the suitcases in front of my case then I actually brain controlled 

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:08.840
 Maybe faster, I think it may be motivation for some people 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.740
 so I say I take the very serious the topic and seriousness and mostly 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.219
 only out of money if it is not a substitute but 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:19.560
 With the weighting bit of the absurdity of SUVs in the 

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:20.350
 Become a city 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.850
 Alisch clock we have incredibly valuable terrain camped in it though 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.009
 never come into the terrain 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.020
 Busybull completely ineffective 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.710
 I have at 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.910
 since I had become my product what the absurdity of SUVs on 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.200
 bring the point there is 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.050
 on tour 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.780
 the flames that now means that Real Madrid is lonely 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.510
 SUVs had come for every terrain Schulman kept British 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.790
 Country living ran so it looks like being on the net myself 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.890
 So that's what it does when I'm in Altermatt, but then I only have one 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.380
 rolled back to the bakery I'm wondering she doubts herself 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.700
 so that the neighbors have questions o running park 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.289
 Sproule mud and foot sweat that they lead the products of the future 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:01.990
 that we talked about it back to the studio
