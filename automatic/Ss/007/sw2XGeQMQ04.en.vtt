00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.890
 hi everyone today I propose you one 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.650
 tart with alimuri gelatin 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.570
 the search for annalisa that made it for me 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.970
 have on the facebook page of 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.040
 searches for terror splendor then a 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.949
 thanks especially to the nativity for 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.019
 I have only modified this recipe 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:38.180
 a mill in the ingredients but 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:41.180
 basically the basic recipe is 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.220
 let's go immediately to see how it goes 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.330
 go make this tart with 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.330
 lemon jelly 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:09.380
 I prepare the pastry I put the flour there 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:12.600
 sugar, yeast, lemon rind 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.840
 I start the trajectory and started 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.990
 to integrate the butter into small pieces 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:24.229
 as soon as the mixture has reached one 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.229
 sandy consistency I add the eggs 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.950
 I do the planetary until when 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.380
 I will not have obtained a compact compound 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.860
 the pastry has compacted I go to 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.440
 remove from the container to go to 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:47.210
 work briefly to form a 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:51.290
 stick after wash to be carried out in the 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.720
 transparent film and I do it 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.070
 rest in the fridge at least for 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.430
 30 minutes 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:02.810
 I prepare the lemon jelly I put it on 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:08.330
 sugar in a saucepan with potato starch 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:11.900
 of potatoes I'm going to mix them together 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:20.030
 I add lemon juice 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:22.700
 water and lemon zest 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.450
 now I'm going to put on the fire right away 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.690
 when the gelatin has not thickened 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.290
 I put the jelly on the fire 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:36.170
 stirring until you are 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:39.380
 thickened now I put it in a 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.170
 container I let it cool ho 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.370
 extract the pastry from the refrigerator 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:49.549
 I'm going to prepare the base of the company 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:53.269
 I'm going to get two thirds of pastry that 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:55.519
 I will need the other verse for the base 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.820
 instead I will need it to go cover 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:03.580
 the cake the cake and then move on 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.580
 I'm going to make a round loaf 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.380
 and began to form the disk 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.470
 one time 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:23.880
 Once the disc is made, I go to wrap it 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:28.020
 the rolling pin I take a cake pan from 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:32.730
 diameter of 26 buttered ed 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:35.930
 floured and I go to distribute the 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.930
 shortbread 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.710
 v 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.480
 the base 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:46.550
 of the tart with the prongs of one 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:49.000
 fork arrived at this point I put 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:53.510
 the jelly of monuments and pedica 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:58.400
 I put it away inside the tart 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:01.180
 a moment and I'm going to form the disk of 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.180
 coverage 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:13.540
 as soon as the disc is ready , give it to 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:17.230
 unwind in the rolling pin a 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.230
 unroll on the prostate 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:27.160
 now I try to put it more precisely 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:29.889
 possible going to bring down the 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:35.789
 shortcrust pastry in contact with gelatine 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:39.699
 of lemons and then I go to level 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:44.590
 removing excess pastry 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:48.449
 I'm going to seal well using prongs 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:51.310
 of the fork with the pastry 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:05:00.970
 advanced to make decorations 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:05:06.789
 to put on the tart I take a 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:10.659
 knife and trace its shape 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:13.080
 of the mines then I go to realize also 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:13.080
 of the leaves 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.000
 I put the decorations 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:47.080
 always with pasta 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.080
 I'm going to make strips 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:58.889
 the strips as a leandro decoration 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:06:04.080
 put on the edge of the tart by going 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:07.580
 to exert a slight pressure in 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.580
 so as to make it take root 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:22.379
 the whip is ready 

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:25.559
 cool and then I go to the right areas from the 

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:29.069
 container I put the tart of 

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:31.229
 lemon jelly in a tray now 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:33.709
 I'm going to powder it with 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:33.709
 icing sugar 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:47.030
 and here is how the tart looks with 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:50.210
 memory jelly once you are 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:51.320
 it is decorated to cool more 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:57.310
 quickly 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:57.310
 I put it in the fridge for an hour 

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:03.110
 I hope this recipe was too 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.970
 to your liking 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.820
 it's a really fresh tart and 

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:10.870
 delicious a hug to everyone and to 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.870
