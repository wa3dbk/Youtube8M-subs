00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 Nine people here is your victorias and 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.980
 Today I'll put you in a few matches 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.150
 Do you take that today or say 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.610
 we where you can hide well 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.680
 this unfortunately that was actually the 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.680
 best to tell you about two 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.960
 weeks to computer made a patch 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.130
 has and has unfortunately taken out and the 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.449
 Although you had something there must here 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.730
 complicated and although you go over here 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.830
 the ropes and actually you have to 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.809
 now here through the band just go through 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.690
 yes, everything will not be the wall because you 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.399
 just go through the wall and 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.910
 you are in a hidden room over 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.040
 we, so to speak, actually found it 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.000
 the really cool unfortunately has the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.090
 computer taken away 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.910
 too bad this way would have been on 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.070
 the map storm front but I find them 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.460
 actually also pretty cool for that 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.059
 infected to send it to lisa 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.080
 witt is on the map and seal 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.659
 you break up here 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.100
 it is very important that we down the 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.720
 and garbage that each from there on 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.909
 this bar is jumping under me here 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.880
 then this little tower still 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.100
 time on the tower and then jump jump jump 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.750
 made beautiful sprint then here in the 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.509
 here are little teddy at it 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.799
 you realize that your correctness 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.110
 and I find him very horny in front of everyone 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.360
 once infected and but 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.490
 also for team deathmatch mainly because of 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.310
 because you can actually pretty much here 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.509
 well over the whole map groups 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.700
 and yes that's actually right 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.329
 advantageous 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:44.630
 the next kitsch is at the fair 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:47.149
 chances are you have to get up here 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.429
 you have to jump those pipes 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:52.429
 squat down once lie down 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.450
 and backwards can be that's now 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.979
 was a bit fast 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.530
 you just have to do that a bit 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.829
 look at it and judge for yourself as he does 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.829
 finds 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.770
 and the next floods on the map 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:11.340
 it is such a small lantern here 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.440
 there we have to look because you have to be safe 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:18.930
 then jump out on these little 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:22.380
 Lantern overhang and then up here 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.790
 that's what we say on the headline that is 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.110
 actually quite simple here and indeed 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.540
 It has to be that one has to 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.340
 Imagine as if this was this air 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.440
 Whatever it is that I'm on right now 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.180
 as if it were just little ladder and there 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.410
 just have to go up as a heat conductor and 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.910
 It is also very good for infected 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.580
 but I have to say yes is already 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:47.210
 has become quite well known now and 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:49.250
 that one knows by that that yes 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:50.600
 that sometimes with some people 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.260
 chill out to hide 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:57.890
 which is on the map what's the name of the white 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:01.190
 out and there that is actually there 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.110
 Two ways to get up 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.090
 ye squander Just have a look 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.330
 That's how fast you have to go now 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.280
 actually go on the branch and on the 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:15.670
 So you jump on mass jumps from 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:20.750
 this little one from the bridge 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:22.460
 either he or she can jump out 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.100
 from behind you can jump on it 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.310
 open and printed on high 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.860
 go 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.630
 this kitsch I think is very good the 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.730
 not very good and that on this 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.730
 if possible philips prison break 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.180
 Refresh break is this one 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.010
 slippery and this one was perfect for that 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.510
 suitable either for infected plays 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.710
 or to play in the team deathmatch 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.860
 because as you can see here 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.630
 actually pretty good, so to speak 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.030
 protect through trees and into the other 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.920
 direction groups for example of it 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.250
 the other side is protected 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.739
 and yes and you have to be careful because you 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.840
 may be up to a certain one 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.340
 Do not pin at a certain point 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.349
 go on otherwise falls through somehow 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.510
 the night through is quite funny 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:11.510
 but you have to get in 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.800
 put so little in the game very well 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.300
 For infected simply would have to go outside 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.139
 and then you do not see you 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.880
 or most likely not that 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.010
 Just do not run any before with any app 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:34.610
 has that somehow under among those 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:39.380
 there is somebody and he finds that 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:43.669
 really good and you just have to 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:50.380
 which on the tree trunks what you unfortunately 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:53.289
 Also, many things just jump on the construction 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:57.520
 Of course it must look like that 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:58.820
 yes that is with the right one 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.180
 right 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:05.870
 couple with the powerful right one 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.070
 entrance, so to speak, and runs for 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.350
 which is actually quite good for the 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:13.640
 barrage is infected a bit yes 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:16.850
 Let's say that a little bit tricky 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:19.130
 you know that because you look better said 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.790
 is often upwards than downwards 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.639
 I think in any case personally and 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:25.680
 Yes 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.960
 Let's have a look 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.860
 Maybe you can 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.870
 These are a bit of a thing 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.139
 try was infected or even at 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:36.240
 team deathmatch or wherever no 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:37.710
 rest just buck has in front of all things 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.719
 I use those infected because I have it 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.029
 just love being infected if everyone 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:44.520
 somehow to have an addiction already 

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:46.060
 hid somewhere and that with 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.660
 Law 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.040
 so hopefully you enjoyed it 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.720
 if so then there nevertheless please a 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.130
 Thumb up thumb down if it stops 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.450
 did not like but not easy 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.430
 warm and the sun comment on what 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.960
 we better or what I do better 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.060
 can 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.760
 and yes as rain has fallen then
