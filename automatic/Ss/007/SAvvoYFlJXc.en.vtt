00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.320 

let's<00:00:06.280> talk<00:00:06.460> about<00:00:06.580> the<00:00:06.820> blend<00:00:07.060> shape<00:00:07.210> the

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:07.330 
let's talk about the blend shape the

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.450 
let's talk about the blend shape the
former<00:00:07.660> in<00:00:07.750> this<00:00:07.900> movie<00:00:08.230> the<00:00:08.980> blend<00:00:09.220> shape<00:00:09.370> the

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:09.460 
former in this movie the blend shape the

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.070 
former in this movie the blend shape the
former<00:00:09.760> in<00:00:09.850> my<00:00:10.030> allows<00:00:10.420> you<00:00:10.570> to<00:00:10.690> deform<00:00:10.990> a

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.080 
former in my allows you to deform a

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.170 
former in my allows you to deform a
surface<00:00:11.590> into<00:00:12.010> shape<00:00:12.370> of<00:00:12.520> other<00:00:12.730> surfaces

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.180 
surface into shape of other surfaces

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.209 
surface into shape of other surfaces
it's<00:00:13.900> an<00:00:14.110> amazing<00:00:14.469> tool<00:00:14.650> for<00:00:14.680> lip-sync

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:15.219 
it's an amazing tool for lip-sync

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:17.850 
it's an amazing tool for lip-sync
animation<00:00:15.760> and<00:00:15.940> a<00:00:16.059> lot<00:00:16.240> of<00:00:16.330> other<00:00:16.480> things<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.830> I

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860 
animation and a lot of other things so I

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.380 
animation and a lot of other things so I
have<00:00:17.949> a<00:00:18.010> simple<00:00:18.160> polygon<00:00:18.550> sphere<00:00:18.880> over<00:00:19.150> here

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
have a simple polygon sphere over here

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.090 
have a simple polygon sphere over here
what<00:00:19.869> I'm<00:00:19.930> gonna<00:00:20.050> do<00:00:20.230> is<00:00:20.380> simply<00:00:20.680> select<00:00:20.800> it

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.100 
what I'm gonna do is simply select it

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.050 
what I'm gonna do is simply select it
and<00:00:21.250> copy<00:00:22.180> it<00:00:23.040> I'm<00:00:24.040> gonna<00:00:24.190> make<00:00:24.400> another<00:00:24.790> copy

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
and copy it I'm gonna make another copy

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.830 
and copy it I'm gonna make another copy
then<00:00:25.630> select<00:00:26.020> these<00:00:26.140> two<00:00:26.440> and<00:00:27.450> simply<00:00:28.450> copy<00:00:28.660> it

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840 
then select these two and simply copy it

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.799 
then select these two and simply copy it
so<00:00:29.350> I'm<00:00:29.470> just<00:00:29.680> doing<00:00:31.950> shift<00:00:32.950> D<00:00:33.129> at<00:00:33.340> this<00:00:33.489> point

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
so I'm just doing shift D at this point

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.110 
so I'm just doing shift D at this point
which<00:00:34.809> is<00:00:34.989> duplicate<00:00:35.500> for<00:00:35.680> transform<00:00:36.160> the<00:00:36.969> one

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
which is duplicate for transform the one

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.430 
which is duplicate for transform the one
most<00:00:37.329> important<00:00:37.690> thing<00:00:37.809> about<00:00:37.899> blend<00:00:38.230> shape

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
most important thing about blend shape

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.590 
most important thing about blend shape
is<00:00:38.679> that<00:00:39.399> you<00:00:39.640> do<00:00:39.789> not<00:00:39.940> want<00:00:40.120> to<00:00:40.269> change<00:00:40.449> any

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
is that you do not want to change any

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.569 
is that you do not want to change any
poly<00:00:41.199> count<00:00:41.499> on<00:00:41.739> any<00:00:41.890> of<00:00:42.039> these<00:00:42.159> copied

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
poly count on any of these copied

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.209 
poly count on any of these copied
surfaces<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:44.079> now<00:00:44.379> that<00:00:44.559> these<00:00:44.679> are<00:00:44.859> copied

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
surfaces so now that these are copied

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.329 
surfaces so now that these are copied
let's<00:00:45.609> simply<00:00:46.329> change<00:00:46.719> them<00:00:47.620> a<00:00:47.649> little<00:00:47.949> bit<00:00:48.069> so

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:48.339 
let's simply change them a little bit so

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:50.340 
let's simply change them a little bit so
for<00:00:48.969> that<00:00:49.089> I'm<00:00:49.300> gonna<00:00:49.510> double<00:00:49.989> click<00:00:50.079> on<00:00:50.289> my

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
for that I'm gonna double click on my

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.750 
for that I'm gonna double click on my
move<00:00:51.069> tool<00:00:51.339> and<00:00:52.530> my<00:00:53.530> soft<00:00:53.829> selection<00:00:54.249> is<00:00:54.429> on

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
move tool and my soft selection is on

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.329 
move tool and my soft selection is on
over<00:00:55.030> here<00:00:55.409> so<00:00:56.409> let's<00:00:56.679> make<00:00:56.889> sure<00:00:56.920> that<00:00:57.219> the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.339 
over here so let's make sure that the

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:58.829 
over here so let's make sure that the
soft<00:00:57.550> selection<00:00:57.639> is<00:00:57.999> on<00:00:58.149> I'm<00:00:58.510> gonna<00:00:58.659> select

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
soft selection is on I'm gonna select

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:01.079 
soft selection is on I'm gonna select
this<00:00:59.079> one<00:00:59.139> and<00:00:59.559> let's<00:01:00.550> change<00:01:00.789> it<00:01:00.940> a<00:01:00.999> little

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
this one and let's change it a little

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.530 
this one and let's change it a little
bit<00:01:01.329> so<00:01:02.019> let's<00:01:02.379> select<00:01:02.859> a<00:01:03.100> few<00:01:03.370> points<00:01:04.150> on<00:01:04.239> top

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
bit so let's select a few points on top

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.170 
bit so let's select a few points on top
over<00:01:04.809> here<00:01:04.839> and<00:01:05.710> let's<00:01:05.979> quickly<00:01:07.290> move<00:01:08.290> up<00:01:09.180> and

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
over here and let's quickly move up and

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.230 
over here and let's quickly move up and
also<00:01:10.360> scale<00:01:10.840> them<00:01:11.490> let's<00:01:12.490> do<00:01:12.670> something<00:01:13.150> else

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
also scale them let's do something else

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.920 
also scale them let's do something else
to<00:01:13.420> this<00:01:13.570> one<00:01:15.210> I'm<00:01:16.210> gonna<00:01:16.390> make<00:01:16.570> sure<00:01:16.720> that<00:01:16.750> my

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
to this one I'm gonna make sure that my

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.770 
to this one I'm gonna make sure that my
reflection<00:01:17.560> is<00:01:17.680> on<00:01:17.830> at<00:01:18.100> X<00:01:18.450> I'm<00:01:19.450> gonna<00:01:19.600> select

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
reflection is on at X I'm gonna select

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.440 
reflection is on at X I'm gonna select
this<00:01:20.050> side<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:21.580> it<00:01:21.610> also<00:01:21.910> selects<00:01:22.180> the<00:01:22.300> other

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
this side so it also selects the other

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.010 
this side so it also selects the other
side<00:01:22.690> and<00:01:23.410> I'm<00:01:23.590> gonna<00:01:23.740> just<00:01:24.010> move<00:01:24.250> it<00:01:24.870> let's<00:01:25.870> do

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
side and I'm gonna just move it let's do

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.770 
side and I'm gonna just move it let's do
something<00:01:26.350> else<00:01:26.440> on<00:01:26.650> this<00:01:26.800> guy<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:28.270> let's<00:01:28.480> just

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
something else on this guy so let's just

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.270 
something else on this guy so let's just
select<00:01:28.900> it<00:01:29.340> points<00:01:30.340> in<00:01:30.400> the<00:01:30.490> middle<00:01:30.700> over<00:01:30.880> here

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
select it points in the middle over here

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.170 
select it points in the middle over here
and<00:01:33.280> simply<00:01:33.910> scale<00:01:34.630> it<00:01:34.780> down<00:01:34.810> and<00:01:35.970> finally<00:01:36.970> on

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
and simply scale it down and finally on

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.860 
and simply scale it down and finally on
this<00:01:37.570> one<00:01:37.810> I'm<00:01:38.050> simply<00:01:38.860> gonna<00:01:38.950> select<00:01:39.340> a<00:01:39.870> point

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
this one I'm simply gonna select a point

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.760 
this one I'm simply gonna select a point
over<00:01:41.050> here<00:01:41.320> I<00:01:41.470> can<00:01:41.950> also<00:01:43.650> increase<00:01:44.650> the

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
over here I can also increase the

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.700 
over here I can also increase the
fall-off<00:01:45.340> in<00:01:45.550> this<00:01:45.730> case<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:47.470> I'm<00:01:47.590> gonna

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
fall-off in this case and I'm gonna

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.570 
fall-off in this case and I'm gonna
simply<00:01:48.300> move<00:01:49.300> it<00:01:49.360> out<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.950> right<00:01:51.130> click<00:01:51.250> let's

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
simply move it out so right click let's

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.260 
simply move it out so right click let's
go<00:01:51.730> to<00:01:51.790> object<00:01:52.090> mode<00:01:53.490> now<00:01:54.490> to<00:01:54.550> apply<00:01:54.910> the<00:01:54.970> blend

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
go to object mode now to apply the blend

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.610 
go to object mode now to apply the blend
shapes<00:01:56.100> let's<00:01:57.100> go<00:01:57.340> here<00:01:57.550> and<00:01:57.760> close<00:01:58.000> this<00:01:58.620> I'm

00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
shapes let's go here and close this I'm

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.460 
shapes let's go here and close this I'm
simply<00:01:59.950> gonna<00:02:00.040> go<00:02:00.280> and<00:02:00.870> do<00:02:01.870> these<00:02:02.110> two<00:02:02.320> at

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
simply gonna go and do these two at

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.410 
simply gonna go and do these two at
first<00:02:02.770> so<00:02:03.220> I'm<00:02:03.580> first<00:02:03.880> gonna<00:02:03.970> select<00:02:04.210> this<00:02:04.360> one

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
first so I'm first gonna select this one

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.270 
first so I'm first gonna select this one
then<00:02:04.780> shifts<00:02:05.050> like<00:02:05.170> this<00:02:05.710> guy<00:02:05.890> over<00:02:06.010> here<00:02:06.250> and

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
then shifts like this guy over here and

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.029 
then shifts like this guy over here and
finally<00:02:06.730> our<00:02:07.000> main<00:02:07.240> sphere<00:02:07.630> and<00:02:07.900> then<00:02:08.830> go<00:02:08.979> to

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
finally our main sphere and then go to

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.160 
finally our main sphere and then go to
you<00:02:09.580> make<00:02:09.849> sure<00:02:10.030> in<00:02:10.179> the<00:02:10.300> animation<00:02:10.659> menu<00:02:10.810> said

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
you make sure in the animation menu said

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.250 
you make sure in the animation menu said
go<00:02:11.319> to<00:02:11.379> create<00:02:11.680> deformers<00:02:12.239> blend<00:02:13.239> shape<00:02:13.450> and

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
go to create deformers blend shape and

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.010 
go to create deformers blend shape and
let's<00:02:14.830> just<00:02:15.160> call<00:02:15.340> this<00:02:15.490> a<00:02:15.700> for<00:02:16.210> now<00:02:16.330> let's<00:02:16.900> say

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
let's just call this a for now let's say

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.360 
let's just call this a for now let's say
create<00:02:17.610> then<00:02:18.610> I'm<00:02:18.700> gonna<00:02:18.819> go

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
create then I'm gonna go

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.350 
create then I'm gonna go
and<00:02:19.459> do<00:02:19.720> this<00:02:20.720> one<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.140> then<00:02:22.040> this<00:02:22.220> one<00:02:22.360> so

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
and do this one and then this one so

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.649 
and do this one and then this one so
shifts<00:02:23.750> like<00:02:23.900> ii<00:02:24.440> create<00:02:25.190> deformers<00:02:25.659> blend

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:26.659 
shifts like ii create deformers blend

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:30.850 
shifts like ii create deformers blend
shape<00:02:26.900> let's<00:02:27.409> call<00:02:27.620> this<00:02:27.830> B<00:02:28.580> and<00:02:29.409> then<00:02:30.409> finally

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
shape let's call this B and then finally

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.559 
shape let's call this B and then finally
this<00:02:30.980> one<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:31.459> select<00:02:31.700> this<00:02:31.819> first<00:02:31.879> shift

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
this one to select this first shift

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.080 
this one to select this first shift
select<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:32.959> main<00:02:33.140> sphere<00:02:33.440> second<00:02:34.090> create

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
select the main sphere second create

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.080 
select the main sphere second create
deformers<00:02:35.420> blend<00:02:36.200> shape<00:02:36.500> and<00:02:36.769> let's<00:02:37.730> call<00:02:37.940> it

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
deformers blend shape and let's call it

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.199 
deformers blend shape and let's call it
C<00:02:38.299> and<00:02:39.459> now<00:02:40.459> if<00:02:40.549> you<00:02:40.640> want<00:02:40.819> to<00:02:40.879> see<00:02:41.000> what

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
C and now if you want to see what

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.839 
C and now if you want to see what
happened<00:02:41.540> we<00:02:41.780> can<00:02:41.930> go<00:02:42.110> to<00:02:42.170> window<00:02:42.980> animation

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
happened we can go to window animation

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.050 
happened we can go to window animation
editors<00:02:44.290> blend<00:02:45.290> shape<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:45.849> right<00:02:46.849> now<00:02:47.000> you

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
editors blend shape and right now you

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.819 
editors blend shape and right now you
can<00:02:47.299> see<00:02:47.450> that<00:02:47.629> that's<00:02:47.870> my<00:02:48.140> a<00:02:48.170> and<00:02:48.349> there's

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
can see that that's my a and there's

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.619 
can see that that's my a and there's
these<00:02:49.280> two<00:02:49.489> over<00:02:49.760> here<00:02:49.849> sphere<00:02:50.269> three<00:02:50.510> and

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
these two over here sphere three and

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.259 
these two over here sphere three and
three<00:02:50.780> or<00:02:50.870> four<00:02:50.900> there's<00:02:51.620> my<00:02:51.799> B<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:52.280> there's

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
three or four there's my B and there's

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.569 
three or four there's my B and there's
the<00:02:53.420> C<00:02:53.569> the<00:02:54.349> cool<00:02:54.530> thing<00:02:54.709> about<00:02:54.739> this<00:02:55.190> window

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
the C the cool thing about this window

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.160 
the C the cool thing about this window
is<00:02:55.790> it<00:02:55.940> also<00:02:56.090> gives<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:56.720> an<00:02:56.959> option

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
is it also gives you an option

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.860 
is it also gives you an option
orientation<00:02:58.099> as<00:02:58.310> horizontal<00:02:59.090> so<00:02:59.690> in<00:02:59.780> this

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
orientation as horizontal so in this

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.420 
orientation as horizontal so in this
case<00:03:00.079> in<00:03:00.230> fact<00:03:00.260> I'm<00:03:00.560> gonna<00:03:00.739> do<00:03:00.890> horizontal

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
case in fact I'm gonna do horizontal

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.479 
case in fact I'm gonna do horizontal
because<00:03:01.579> it<00:03:01.700> doesn't<00:03:01.970> fit<00:03:02.150> in<00:03:02.329> my<00:03:03.489> video

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
because it doesn't fit in my video

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.869 
because it doesn't fit in my video
resolution<00:03:05.030> so<00:03:05.659> that's<00:03:06.230> a<00:03:06.409> right<00:03:06.769> there<00:03:07.010> if<00:03:07.730> I

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
resolution so that's a right there if I

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.030 
resolution so that's a right there if I
move<00:03:08.180> this<00:03:08.329> you<00:03:08.540> can<00:03:08.659> see<00:03:08.810> it<00:03:08.900> nicely<00:03:09.140> goes

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
move this you can see it nicely goes

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.119 
move this you can see it nicely goes
into<00:03:10.310> that<00:03:10.430> shape<00:03:10.700> then<00:03:11.420> there's<00:03:11.720> the<00:03:12.709> second

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
into that shape then there's the second

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.259 
into that shape then there's the second
one<00:03:13.250> an<00:03:13.400> A<00:03:13.519> then<00:03:14.299> you<00:03:14.510> have<00:03:15.280> B<00:03:16.280> right<00:03:16.909> there<00:03:17.120> and

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
one an A then you have B right there and

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.229 
one an A then you have B right there and
then<00:03:17.690> you<00:03:17.810> have<00:03:18.019> C<00:03:18.890> right<00:03:19.280> there<00:03:19.459> and<00:03:19.609> the<00:03:20.090> cool

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
then you have C right there and the cool

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.509 
then you have C right there and the cool
thing<00:03:20.269> about<00:03:20.510> this<00:03:20.780> is<00:03:21.220> you<00:03:22.220> can<00:03:22.340> see<00:03:22.489> that

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
thing about this is you can see that

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.400 
thing about this is you can see that
these<00:03:22.790> sliders<00:03:23.030> only<00:03:23.359> go<00:03:23.450> from<00:03:23.569> zero<00:03:23.900> one<00:03:24.109> but

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
these sliders only go from zero one but

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.870 
these sliders only go from zero one but
you<00:03:24.500> can<00:03:24.650> also<00:03:24.769> type<00:03:25.069> in<00:03:25.220> a<00:03:25.280> value<00:03:25.489> over<00:03:25.760> here

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
you can also type in a value over here

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.879 
you can also type in a value over here
and<00:03:26.150> say<00:03:26.329> I<00:03:26.510> want<00:03:26.720> to<00:03:26.750> go<00:03:26.870> to<00:03:26.930> two<00:03:27.200> and<00:03:27.410> there

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 
and say I want to go to two and there

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:30.069 
and say I want to go to two and there
you<00:03:27.980> go
