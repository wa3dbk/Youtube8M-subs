00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 good afternoon with you irina vadimovna and 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.340
 I want to talk today about how to 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.030
 actually quite realistic 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.610
 your dream in just three months under we 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.770
 we live here it who has not heard and not 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.640
 I read my book of Montenegro already 9 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.220
 months this is the house we bought in 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.410
 which we now live Christmas trees like 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.769
 a reminder that we are in the Urals we 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.439
 love this our nature and today 6 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.160
 November is great weather and this 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.620
 what brings me here is a nice soft 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.219
 warm climate wonderful air 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.469
 beautiful nature and I did not believe at all 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.750
 that it is possible how can you move for 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.530
 frontier how can one live with such a nature and 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.860
 here in this 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.879
 heavenly completely nook that now 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:57.109
 I understood exactly what is important. 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.030
 take concrete steps and succeed 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:03.449
 when we moved here we had a very 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.680
 limited amount of money and despite 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.850
 we immediately bought a car and 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.060
 have traveled on it for almost all 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.250
 Montenegro we travel a lot 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.009
 around the country and my children are collecting now 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.770
 telling the cruise opens a lot 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.490
 we didnâ€™t even think about that 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.490
 did not assume and what is needed for this 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.670
 this first thing is important to have a dream 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.890
 is to have a very clear goal yes what are you 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.560
 want life 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.890
 the second is it is important to study financial 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.560
 programs about how to attract 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.110
 life is money what needs to be done which 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.630
 concrete steps are needed in order to 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.049
 money to be more close but you 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.140
 to manage them so as not to depend on 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:55.870
 amounts of money yes but still go to 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.030
 your dream and then everything works out 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.880
 and the third very important step is not 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.400
 surrender to not happen and for these 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.790
 9 months we had a lot here and 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.040
 difficulties and there were such thunderstorms 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.130
 there were such storms we seemed to us us 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.250
 demolish rain from these streams 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:18.520
 which we have not seen in our Urals 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:21.130
 there were still some difficulties in terms of 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.440
 strongly entering into this culture yes in 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.020
 this mentality we are still not very 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.510
 well still have learned the language yes and appeal 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.510
 communicate in such a very primitive 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.270
 level but what we got is where we 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.140
 we go it is all worth it and let us 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:40.350
 go to the house I invite you to the house and 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.350
 continue our conversation 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:56.040
 let's go here we have our business here 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.040
 in the grape already there was a lot 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.840
 here is the tyranny of which we sat and the link is not 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.250
 pay attention now not very 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.760
 we cleaned the autumn season anyway and 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.760
 let's go to the house 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.850
 this is where we work this is where 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:29.750
 we live enjoy develop and 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:32.150
 attract live dream conditions and how 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.880
 often we dream of something when we 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.250
 it get to this difficult with how 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.210
 got used and internal as far as we ourselves 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:43.550
 all time focused on problem solving and 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:47.720

 You are around you but that's who 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.570
 surrounds you with whom you are on this day 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.040
 what happens during the day you work 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.800

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.530
 so that you would like to live 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:21.260
 so that it completely coincides with 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:25.310
 your inner sense of happiness 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:27.200
 joy because it is very important 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.230

 the knowledge that I want is one of 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:49.730
 fundamental moments of its implementation 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:52.280
 and leave it in the comments here that my 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:56.440
