kind of emails popping up some quite
nice<00:01:35.130> presentation<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.420> kind<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.689> contract

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
nice presentation of kind of contract

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.319 
nice presentation of kind of contract
negotiations<00:01:37.860> as<00:01:38.250> well<00:01:38.520> as<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.640> lot<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.909> using

tickers<00:01:39.720> in<00:01:39.869> there<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.979> probably<00:01:41.820> the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
tickers in there and probably the

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.389

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
biggest part of it for me is the ability

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.310 
biggest part of it for me is the ability
to<00:01:44.790> actually<00:01:44.939> look<00:01:45.240> at<00:01:45.390> standings<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.079> delete
