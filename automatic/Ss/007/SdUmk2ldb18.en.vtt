you wouldn't necessarily think of doing
that<00:03:30.989> very<00:03:31.989> simple<00:03:32.379> to<00:03:32.530> check<00:03:32.709> those<00:03:32.950> when<00:03:33.190> you

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
that very simple to check those when you

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.000 
that very simple to check those when you
go<00:03:33.459> and<00:03:33.639> view<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:33.970> car<00:03:34.260> obviously<00:03:35.260> start<00:03:35.859> the

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
also while strong bodywork one of the

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:31.800 
also while strong bodywork one of the
areas<00:04:30.250> specifically<00:04:31.030> to<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.360> figure<00:04:31.660> right

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
areas specifically to the figure right

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.460 
areas specifically to the figure right
these<00:04:32.229> are<00:04:32.260> wheel<00:04:32.560> arches<00:04:32.950> they<00:04:33.850> can<00:04:34.150> actually

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
really awful examples of the figure out

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.310 
really awful examples of the figure out
with<00:04:39.610> some<00:04:39.790> very<00:04:40.000> very<00:04:40.120> bad<00:04:40.479> rusting<00:04:41.020> on<00:04:41.139> that
