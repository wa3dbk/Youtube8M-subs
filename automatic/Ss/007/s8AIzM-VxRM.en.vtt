00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.340 
who did um noticed a number but the
shipping<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.490> think<00:01:32.729> was<00:01:32.880> around<00:01:33.150> 9<00:01:34.049> or<00:01:34.079> 10

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
shipping I think was around 9 or 10

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.390 
shipping I think was around 9 or 10
dollars<00:01:34.500> or<00:01:35.630> some<00:01:36.630> were<00:01:36.720> at<00:01:36.780> 6<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.560> 10<00:01:37.799> mm<00:01:38.280> all

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400
