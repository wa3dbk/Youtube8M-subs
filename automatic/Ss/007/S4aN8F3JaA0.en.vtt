think it kind of sucks because you know

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.999 
think it kind of sucks because you know
like<00:01:56.549> they<00:01:56.700> pushed<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.180> thing<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:57.840> hard<00:01:58.259> and

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
like they pushed that thing so hard and

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.120 
like they pushed that thing so hard and

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:40.250 
the mono box set at the same time just

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.640 
the mono box set at the same time just
because<00:06:40.700> I<00:06:41.060> personally<00:06:41.720> have<00:06:41.900> never<00:06:42.260> had<00:06:42.500> one

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650 
because I personally have never had one

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.850 
because I personally have never had one
of<00:06:42.710> those<00:06:42.890> out<00:06:43.130> of<00:06:43.160> box<00:06:44.060> sets<00:06:44.300> I<00:06:44.450> mean<00:06:44.630> so<00:06:44.900> it's

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:45.860 
of those out of box sets I mean so it's

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.840 
of those out of box sets I mean so it's
a<00:06:46.130> it's<00:06:46.430> different<00:06:46.880> for<00:06:47.090> me<00:06:47.240> personally<00:06:48.850> but

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:49.850 
a it's different for me personally but

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.320 
a it's different for me personally but
anyway<00:06:50.450> I<00:06:51.220> don't<00:06:52.220> I've<00:06:52.610> never<00:06:52.880> had<00:06:53.090> one<00:06:53.270> before

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.330

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:55.040 
so I don't feel like I got cheated

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.800 
so I don't feel like I got cheated
because<00:06:55.880> those<00:06:56.060> people<00:06:56.390> who<00:06:56.450> bought<00:06:56.660> the

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:56.810 
because those people who bought the

this<00:07:01.790> version<00:07:02.030> come<00:07:02.300> out<00:07:02.480> that<00:07:02.690> most<00:07:03.260> would

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:03.500 
this version come out that most would

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.990 
this version come out that most would
say<00:07:03.530> is<00:07:03.860> better<00:07:04.160> because<00:07:04.580> you<00:07:04.730> know<00:07:04.760> the

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.000 
say is better because you know the

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.550 
say is better because you know the
Beatles<00:07:05.180> themselves<00:07:05.420> preferred<00:07:06.050> it<00:07:06.200> on<00:07:06.320> mono

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 
Beatles themselves preferred it on mono

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.120 
Beatles themselves preferred it on mono
so<00:07:06.980> I<00:07:07.330> don't<00:07:08.330> know<00:07:08.420> just<00:07:08.900> my<00:07:09.050> thoughts<00:07:09.740> on<00:07:09.950> that

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:10.130 
so I don't know just my thoughts on that

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:11.950 
so I don't know just my thoughts on that
about<00:07:10.490> how<00:07:10.640> that<00:07:10.850> kind<00:07:11.090> of<00:07:11.150> sucks<00:07:11.450> for<00:07:11.570> people

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:11.960 
about how that kind of sucks for people

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.160 
about how that kind of sucks for people
who<00:07:12.110> might<00:07:12.350> have<00:07:12.380> gotten<00:07:12.710> the<00:07:12.920> stereo<00:07:13.250> box<00:07:13.550> set

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:14.170 
who might have gotten the stereo box set

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.480 
who might have gotten the stereo box set
but<00:07:15.170> like<00:07:15.200> I<00:07:15.560> said<00:07:15.620> some<00:07:15.950> people<00:07:16.070> might<00:07:16.340> not

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:16.490 
but like I said some people might not

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.220 
but like I said some people might not
even<00:07:16.640> care<00:07:16.970> but<00:07:17.210> I<00:07:17.270> know<00:07:17.390> there's<00:07:17.690> a<00:07:17.750> few<00:07:17.990> that

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:18.230 
even care but I know there's a few that

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.480 
even care but I know there's a few that
probably<00:07:18.530> pissed<00:07:18.740> off<00:07:18.920> about<00:07:19.070> it<00:07:20.050> anyway

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:21.490
