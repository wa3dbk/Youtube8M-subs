foundation<00:00:32.489> used<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.910> be<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.180> Maybelline<00:00:33.630> fit

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
foundation used to be the Maybelline fit

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.930 
foundation used to be the Maybelline fit
me<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.170> original<00:00:34.350> formulation<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.700> only

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
me the original formulation the only

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.910 
me the original formulation the only
reason<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.360> stopped<00:00:36.660> because<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.469> the

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
reason I stopped because of the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.490 
reason I stopped because of the
longevity<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.670> then<00:00:39.210> it's<00:00:39.420> transferring<00:00:40.110> so

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
longevity and then it's transferring so

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.920 
longevity and then it's transferring so
price<00:00:40.829> point<00:00:41.219> it's<00:00:41.520> still<00:00:41.820> inexpensive<00:00:42.690> it's

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
price point it's still inexpensive it's

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.470 
price point it's still inexpensive it's
under<00:00:43.460> $6<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:44.730> I'm<00:00:44.879> all<00:00:45.090> for<00:00:45.300> that

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
under $6 so I'm all for that

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.209 
under $6 so I'm all for that
the<00:00:45.750> coverage<00:00:46.110> wise<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.649> believe<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:47.160> is

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
the coverage wise I believe this is

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.639 
the coverage wise I believe this is
medium<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.510> people<00:00:48.960> claim<00:00:49.140> it's<00:00:49.320> buildable

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
medium to people claim it's buildable

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.130 
medium to people claim it's buildable
full<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.280> don't<00:00:50.820> think<00:00:51.059> it's<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.660> full<00:00:51.930> coverage

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
full I don't think it's a full coverage

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.049 
full I don't think it's a full coverage
foundation<00:00:52.320> it's<00:00:53.070> just<00:00:53.250> between<00:00:53.399> medium<00:00:53.910> and

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
foundation it's just between medium and

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.000 
foundation it's just between medium and
full<00:00:54.449> it's<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:54.780> right<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.350> center<00:00:55.800> I

is<00:01:35.939> that<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.210> longevity<00:01:36.390> for<00:01:36.960> this

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
is that the longevity for this

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.280 
is that the longevity for this
foundation<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.890> longer<00:01:38.759> than<00:01:39.180> four<00:01:39.570> hours<00:01:39.600> I'm

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
foundation is longer than four hours I'm

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.530 
foundation is longer than four hours I'm
proud<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.979> say<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.400> I've<00:01:41.790> used<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.240> for

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
proud to say that I've used this for

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.780 
proud to say that I've used this for
over<00:01:42.720> eight<00:01:43.020> hours<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:44.430> know<00:01:44.460> it's

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
over eight hours and you know it's

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.850 
over eight hours and you know it's
starting<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.210> fade<00:01:45.570> but<00:01:45.930> it's<00:01:46.079> not<00:01:46.290> as<00:01:46.530> patchy

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
starting to fade but it's not as patchy

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.700 
starting to fade but it's not as patchy
as<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.549> used<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.970> be<00:01:48.119> because<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:49.290> older

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
as it used to be because the older

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.800 
as it used to be because the older
formulation<00:01:50.430> after<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.939> fourth<00:01:51.210> hour<00:01:51.450> I

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
formulation after the fourth hour I

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.050 
formulation after the fourth hour I
would<00:01:52.229> feel<00:01:52.439> like<00:01:52.590> my<00:01:52.890> makeup<00:01:53.310> would<00:01:53.490> start<00:01:53.850> to

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
would feel like my makeup would start to

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.810 
would feel like my makeup would start to
melt<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:55.409> don't<00:01:55.680> even<00:01:55.770> have<00:01:56.009> oily<00:01:56.490> skin<00:01:56.790> I

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
melt and I don't even have oily skin I

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.819 
melt and I don't even have oily skin I
don't<00:01:57.149> understand<00:01:57.540> how<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.750> was<00:01:58.229> happening

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
don't understand how that was happening

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.590 
don't understand how that was happening
but<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.430> also<00:01:59.549> helps<00:01:59.909> if<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.090> have<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.240> nice

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
but it also helps if you have a nice

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.359 
but it also helps if you have a nice
makeup<00:02:01.110> setting<00:02:01.530> spray<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.860> use<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.219> one<00:02:02.340> from

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
makeup setting spray I use the one from

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.789 
makeup setting spray I use the one from
urban<00:02:02.909> decay<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.570> spray<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.290> this<00:02:04.530> as<00:02:04.770> a

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
urban decay and spray and this as a

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.649 
urban decay and spray and this as a
combo<00:02:05.310> works<00:02:05.610> really<00:02:05.880> really<00:02:06.000> well<00:02:06.270> if<00:02:06.630> you

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
combo works really really well if you

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.449 
combo works really really well if you
want<00:02:06.960> your<00:02:07.110> makeup<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.439> last<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.890> really<00:02:08.069> really

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
want your makeup to last a really really

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.150 
want your makeup to last a really really
long<00:02:08.640> time<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:09.330> didn't<00:02:10.140> even<00:02:10.319> have<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.860> spot

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
long time I didn't even have to spot

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.830 
long time I didn't even have to spot
conceal<00:02:11.580> any<00:02:11.849> more<00:02:12.000> because<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.330> believe

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
conceal any more because I believe

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.750 
conceal any more because I believe
after<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.380> you-know-who<00:02:14.160> layers<00:02:14.370> of<00:02:14.640> the

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
a little bit dewy and that's what we dry

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.300 
a little bit dewy and that's what we dry
skin<00:02:23.790> people<00:02:24.240> need<00:02:24.569> and<00:02:25.170> it's<00:02:25.470> not<00:02:25.740> that<00:02:26.100> it's

I have severely dry skin so almost all

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.449 
I have severely dry skin so almost all
of<00:02:42.180> my<00:02:42.420> foundations<00:02:43.200> will<00:02:43.470> accentuate<00:02:43.950> my<00:02:44.069> dry

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
of my foundations will accentuate my dry

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.670 
of my foundations will accentuate my dry
patches<00:02:44.730> on<00:02:45.090> my<00:02:45.120> foreman<00:02:45.720> but<00:02:46.170> this<00:02:46.440> one

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
patches on my foreman but this one

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.770 
patches on my foreman but this one
doesn't<00:02:46.980> I<00:02:47.220> feel<00:02:47.250> like<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.700> even<00:02:48.060> flattens<00:02:48.630> it

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
doesn't I feel like it even flattens it

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.440 
doesn't I feel like it even flattens it
out<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.380> when<00:02:49.560> it<00:02:49.680> claims<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:50.040> be<00:02:50.130> dewy<00:02:50.519> and<00:02:50.940> it

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
out so when it claims to be dewy and it

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.960 
out so when it claims to be dewy and it
looks<00:02:51.660> dewy<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.230> smooth<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.459> smoothing

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
looks dewy and smooth the smoothing

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.580 
looks dewy and smooth the smoothing
portion<00:02:54.390> of<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.660> is<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.989> one<00:02:55.110> that<00:02:55.320> smooths

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
portion of it is the one that smooths

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.430 
portion of it is the one that smooths
out<00:02:55.830> your<00:02:56.400> dry<00:02:56.850> patches<00:02:57.090> which<00:02:57.450> is<00:02:57.600> great<00:02:57.840> so

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
out your dry patches which is great so

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.350 
out your dry patches which is great so
it<00:02:58.890> doesn't<00:02:59.160> accentuate<00:02:59.430> it<00:02:59.850> and<00:03:00.030> that's<00:03:00.180> what

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
it doesn't accentuate it and that's what

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.780 
it doesn't accentuate it and that's what
I<00:03:00.390> love<00:03:00.690> about<00:03:00.840> this<00:03:01.260> foundation<00:03:01.500> so<00:03:02.190> overall

over<00:03:10.530> again<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:11.100> only<00:03:11.310> downside<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.819> this<00:03:12.090> one

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
over again the only downside to this one

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.840 
over again the only downside to this one
is<00:03:12.569> that<00:03:12.720> it<00:03:12.870> doesn't<00:03:13.170> have<00:03:13.290> pump<00:03:13.920> how<00:03:14.640> come<00:03:14.819> I

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
is that it doesn't have pump how come I
