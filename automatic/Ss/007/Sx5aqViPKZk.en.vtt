00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
severe deep part in that's absolutely

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:48.619 
severe deep part in that's absolutely
straight<00:00:41.239> so<00:00:42.239> section<00:00:42.690> up<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.960> hair<00:00:47.629> think

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
straight so section up the hair think

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.410 
straight so section up the hair think
about<00:00:48.829> this<00:00:49.829> appliance<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.210> is

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
about this appliance is is that this is

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.290 
about this appliance is is that this is
a<00:00:51.960> straightening<00:00:52.739> iron<00:00:52.770> but<00:00:53.280> also<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.910> very

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
a straightening iron but also a very

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.779 
a straightening iron but also a very
very<00:00:54.570> good<00:00:54.840> curling<00:00:55.260> iron<00:00:55.440> as<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.770> can<00:00:55.949> see<00:00:56.250> it

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
very good curling iron as you can see it

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.790 
very good curling iron as you can see it
actually<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.239> very<00:00:57.449> curved<00:00:58.230> here<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.649> it's

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
actually is very curved here and it's

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.860 
actually is very curved here and it's
also<00:00:58.949> heated<00:00:59.699> on<00:01:00.000> two-thirds<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.750> other

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
also heated on two-thirds of the other

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.490 
also heated on two-thirds of the other
side<00:01:01.170> as<00:01:01.379> well<00:01:01.559> all<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.520> have<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.879> do<00:01:03.110> is<00:01:04.110> slide

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
side as well all you have to do is slide

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.039 
side as well all you have to do is slide
down<00:01:07.159> here's<00:01:08.159> your<00:01:08.250> curl<00:01:08.760> now<00:01:09.390> depending<00:01:09.630> on

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
down here's your curl now depending on

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.170 
down here's your curl now depending on
how<00:01:10.200> big<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.500> section<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.220> how<00:01:11.760> long<00:01:12.030> you

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
how big the section is how long you

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.929 
how big the section is how long you
leave<00:01:12.420> here<00:01:12.689> will<00:01:13.650> really<00:01:13.950> determine<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
leave here will really determine the

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.270 
leave here will really determine the
kind<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.450> finished<00:01:16.080> look<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.590> how<00:01:16.740> tight<00:01:17.040> you

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
kind of finished look and how tight you

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.249 
kind of finished look and how tight you
want<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:18.390> I'm<00:01:18.479> going<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.720> run<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:19.049> through

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
want to so I'm going to run this through

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:26.990 
want to so I'm going to run this through
one<00:01:19.560> more<00:01:19.710> time<00:01:20.930> so<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.020> can<00:01:22.320> see<00:01:25.250> and<00:01:26.250> again

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
one more time so you can see and again

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.539 
one more time so you can see and again
all<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.360> way<00:01:27.450> through<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.869> end<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.320> just

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
all the way through the end and just

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.270 
all the way through the end and just
leave<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.790> its<00:01:29.939> curl<00:01:30.799> and<00:01:31.799> we<00:01:31.979> can<00:01:32.159> then

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
leave it in its curl and we can then

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.560 
leave it in its curl and we can then
take<00:01:32.490> on<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.970> next<00:01:33.180> one<00:01:35.299> and<00:01:36.299> we<00:01:36.450> don't

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
take on to the next one and we don't

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.450 
take on to the next one and we don't
want<00:01:36.689> too<00:01:37.079> much<00:01:37.229> body<00:01:37.530> in<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.829> roots<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.250> can

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
want too much body in the roots I can

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.010 
want too much body in the roots I can
afford<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.820> just<00:01:39.060> drag<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:39.540> down<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.840> little

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
afford to just drag this down a little

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.210 
afford to just drag this down a little
bit<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:42.810> thickness<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.860> hair<00:01:44.009> will

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
bit the thickness of the hair will

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.730 
bit the thickness of the hair will
determine<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.200> section<00:01:46.200> as<00:01:46.350> well<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:46.680> I'm

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
determine the section as well so I'm

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.120 
determine the section as well so I'm
going<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:46.950> take<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.159> fairly<00:01:48.090> biggish<00:01:49.130> section

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
going to take a fairly biggish section

00:01:50.130 --> 00:02:09.230 
going to take a fairly biggish section
there

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.670 

having<00:02:10.240> curled<00:02:10.510> all<00:02:10.690> of<00:02:10.840> this<00:02:11.020> you<00:02:11.230> can<00:02:11.440> see

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
having curled all of this you can see

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.440 
having curled all of this you can see
the<00:02:11.860> formation<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:12.460> this<00:02:12.610> is<00:02:12.760> already<00:02:12.970> taken

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
the formation that this is already taken

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.350 
the formation that this is already taken
the<00:02:14.140> best<00:02:14.350> way<00:02:14.590> is<00:02:14.650> really<00:02:15.160> to<00:02:15.340> just<00:02:15.370> get<00:02:16.330> a

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
the best way is really to just get a

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.950 
the best way is really to just get a
wide<00:02:16.630> tooth<00:02:16.870> comb<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.470> just<00:02:18.130> start<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:19.720> comb

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
wide tooth comb and just start to comb

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.440 
wide tooth comb and just start to comb
that<00:02:20.170> through<00:02:20.530> now<00:02:21.490> a<00:02:21.520> lot<00:02:21.760> of<00:02:21.790> this<00:02:22.060> actually

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
that through now a lot of this actually

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.320 
that through now a lot of this actually
really<00:02:22.720> depends<00:02:23.230> upon<00:02:23.400> maybe<00:02:24.400> just<00:02:24.700> using<00:02:25.120> a

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
really depends upon maybe just using a

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.700 
really depends upon maybe just using a
little<00:02:25.720> bit<00:02:26.080> of<00:02:26.200> finishing<00:02:27.100> cream<00:02:27.570> or<00:02:28.570> a

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
little bit of finishing cream or a

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.530 
little bit of finishing cream or a
little<00:02:29.710> bit<00:02:29.890> of<00:02:29.980> argan<00:02:30.670> oil<00:02:30.850> something<00:02:31.420> is

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
little bit of argan oil something is

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.810 
little bit of argan oil something is
just<00:02:31.810> going<00:02:31.960> to<00:02:32.050> smooth<00:02:32.890> away<00:02:33.010> those<00:02:33.370> kind<00:02:33.730> of

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
just going to smooth away those kind of

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.780 
just going to smooth away those kind of
flyaways<00:02:34.360> you<00:02:35.350> could<00:02:35.530> exaggerate<00:02:36.190> this<00:02:36.400> even

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
flyaways you could exaggerate this even

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:44.460
