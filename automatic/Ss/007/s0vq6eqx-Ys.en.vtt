blu-ray<00:00:19.859> players<00:00:20.220> here<00:00:20.760> in<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.939> back<00:00:21.119> of<00:00:21.300> the

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
blu-ray players here in the back of the

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.230 
blu-ray players here in the back of the
headrests<00:00:21.930> for<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.529> back<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.970> seats

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
headrests for the back of the the seats

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.019 
headrests for the back of the the seats
here<00:00:24.539> mounted<00:00:25.350> from<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.619> factory<00:00:26.010> there<00:00:26.910> are

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
here mounted from the factory there are

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.349 
here mounted from the factory there are
some<00:00:27.180> inputs<00:00:27.660> here<00:00:28.050> on<00:00:28.260> both<00:00:28.710> seats<00:00:29.179> and<00:00:30.179> I'm

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
some inputs here on both seats and I'm

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.389 
some inputs here on both seats and I'm
seeing<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:30.960> has<00:00:31.109> two<00:00:31.529> inputs<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.309> I'm

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
seeing that it has two inputs so I'm

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.000 
seeing that it has two inputs so I'm
assuming<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:33.210> hadn't<00:00:33.750> try<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:33.989> get<00:00:34.290> I'm

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
assuming I hadn't try to get I'm

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.280 
assuming I hadn't try to get I'm
assuming<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:35.940> HDMI<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.870> those

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
assuming that that HDMI and those

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.639 
assuming that that HDMI and those
auxiliary<00:00:37.890> inputs<00:00:38.340> there<00:00:38.640> AV<00:00:39.120> inputs<00:00:39.649> will

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
auxiliary inputs there AV inputs will

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.229 
auxiliary inputs there AV inputs will
play<00:00:40.860> separately<00:00:41.399> on<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:42.300> one<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.829> this<00:00:43.829> one

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
play separately on this one and this one

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.540 
play separately on this one and this one
so<00:00:45.239> because<00:00:45.719> why<00:00:45.960> would<00:00:46.110> they<00:00:46.230> have<00:00:46.379> two<00:00:46.620> but

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
so because why would they have two but

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.979 
so because why would they have two but
anyway<00:00:47.820> let<00:00:48.090> me<00:00:48.180> go<00:00:48.270> ahead<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.450> flip<00:00:48.660> them<00:00:48.840> up

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
anyway let me go ahead and flip them up

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.860 
anyway let me go ahead and flip them up
so<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.140> can<00:00:49.289> see<00:00:49.410> what<00:00:49.530> I'm<00:00:49.590> talking<00:00:49.649> about

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
so you can see what I'm talking about

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.220 
so you can see what I'm talking about
you<00:00:51.870> can<00:00:52.020> see<00:00:52.199> here<00:00:53.539> the<00:00:54.539> back<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:54.989> seat

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
you can see here the back of the seat

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.439 
you can see here the back of the seat
has<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> DVD<00:00:55.920> player<00:00:56.039> let's<00:00:56.820> say<00:00:57.000> an<00:00:57.090> insert

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
has a DVD player let's say an insert

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.830 
has a DVD player let's say an insert
disc<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.500> there's<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.340> seat<00:00:59.930> and<00:01:01.460> there's<00:01:02.460> no

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
disc and there's the seat and there's no

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.010 
disc and there's the seat and there's no
there's<00:01:03.840> none<00:01:03.989> for<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.260> third<00:01:04.470> row

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
there's none for the third row

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.060 
there's none for the third row
passengers<00:01:07.020> so<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.470> guess<00:01:07.650> they're<00:01:07.799> not<00:01:07.920> to

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
passengers so I guess they're not to

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.410 
passengers so I guess they're not to
look<00:01:08.189> over<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.549> shoulders<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.119> second

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
look over the shoulders of the second

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.289 
look over the shoulders of the second
row<00:01:09.619> but<00:01:10.619> um<00:01:12.080> there's<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.409> screens<00:01:14.299> pretty

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
row but um there's the screens pretty

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.310 
row but um there's the screens pretty
decent<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.830> pretty<00:01:16.830> decent<00:01:17.659> you<00:01:18.659> know<00:01:18.689> image<00:01:19.140> on

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
decent a pretty decent you know image on

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.690 
decent a pretty decent you know image on
the<00:01:19.409> screen<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.830> everything<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.400> small

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
the screen and everything it is a small

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.070 
the screen and everything it is a small
screen<00:01:21.000> but<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.299> course<00:01:21.509> you're<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:21.780> close<00:01:22.020> to

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
screen but of course you're so close to

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.670 
screen but of course you're so close to
it<00:01:22.549> and<00:01:23.549> also<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.000> can't<00:01:24.210> be<00:01:24.299> really<00:01:24.630> too<00:01:25.530> much

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
it and also it can't be really too much

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.230 
it and also it can't be really too much
bigger<00:01:25.920> than<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.280> headrest<00:01:26.670> because<00:01:27.000> that

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
bigger than the headrest because that

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.170 
bigger than the headrest because that
way<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.450> might<00:01:27.680> impede<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:29.009> view<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
way it might impede the view of the the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.789 
way it might impede the view of the the
driver<00:01:32.299> so<00:01:33.299> there's<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.810> says<00:01:34.110> insert<00:01:34.470> disc

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
driver so there's that says insert disc

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.929 
driver so there's that says insert disc
so<00:01:35.490> there's<00:01:36.360> no<00:01:36.570> disc<00:01:37.250> place<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.549> put<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> book

it is a interesting it's kind of like
back<00:03:40.490> the<00:03:40.700> backlit<00:03:41.150> because<00:03:41.480> let's<00:03:41.630> get<00:03:41.780> a

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
back the backlit because let's get a

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.660 
back the backlit because let's get a
little<00:03:41.900> bit<00:03:42.050> dark<00:03:42.290> out<00:03:42.530> when<00:03:43.250> I<00:03:43.280> push<00:03:43.520> the

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
little bit dark out when I push the

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.030 
little bit dark out when I push the
button<00:03:44.110> the<00:03:45.110> little<00:03:45.320> lights<00:03:45.500> in<00:03:45.710> them<00:03:45.860> I

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
button the little lights in them I

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.290 
button the little lights in them I
control<00:03:46.400> it<00:03:46.610> up<00:03:47.440> okay<00:03:48.440> so<00:03:48.500> right<00:03:49.460> now<00:03:49.670> we<00:03:50.090> can

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
control it up okay so right now we can

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:57.630 
control it up okay so right now we can
scroll<00:03:50.900> up<00:03:51.230> and<00:03:51.620> down<00:03:52.930> get<00:03:53.930> there<00:03:54.380> okay<00:03:55.160> and

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.430 

then<00:03:58.640> I<00:03:58.670> guess<00:03:58.970> you<00:03:59.150> go<00:03:59.630> ahead<00:03:59.870> and<00:03:59.990> it<00:04:00.230> plays
