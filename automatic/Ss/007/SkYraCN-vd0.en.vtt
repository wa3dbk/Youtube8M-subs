00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.360 
there's six inches of diameter aluminum
and<00:02:18.680> this<00:02:19.519> particular<00:02:20.030> path<00:02:20.300> it<00:02:20.599> takes<00:02:20.840> up

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
and this particular path it takes up

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.470 
and this particular path it takes up
anywhere<00:02:22.370> from<00:02:22.519> three<00:02:22.849> and<00:02:22.879> a<00:02:23.000> half<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.269> four

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
anywhere from three and a half to four

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.150 
anywhere from three and a half to four
minutes<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:24.110> warm<00:02:24.890> up<00:02:25.099> five<00:02:26.170> cups<00:02:27.170> of<00:02:27.379> water

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
minutes to warm up five cups of water

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.100 
minutes to warm up five cups of water
and<00:02:30.099> but<00:02:31.099> this<00:02:31.489> is<00:02:31.640> just<00:02:31.790> an<00:02:32.000> basically<00:02:32.480> on<00:02:32.959> the

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
and but this is just an basically on the

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.070 
and but this is just an basically on the
kind<00:02:33.709> of<00:02:33.799> low<00:02:34.190> to<00:02:34.250> medium<00:02:34.610> setting<00:02:35.209> but<00:02:35.870> this

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
kind of low to medium setting but this

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.009 
kind of low to medium setting but this
thing<00:02:36.319> actually<00:02:36.769> goes<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:39.340> crank<00:02:40.340> it<00:02:40.549> out<00:02:41.019> the

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
thing actually goes to crank it out the

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.680 
thing actually goes to crank it out the
flame

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
flame

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.930

support<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:45.010> we<00:02:45.220> could<00:02:45.370> probably<00:02:45.550> cook

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
support and we could probably cook

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.230 
support and we could probably cook
something<00:02:46.360> up<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:47.620> 12<00:02:47.920> inches<00:02:48.130> as<00:02:48.580> far<00:02:48.820> as<00:02:48.970> the
