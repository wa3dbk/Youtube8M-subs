00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:10.950
 my friends this state 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.719
 I'll get back to you here 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.789
 my little redstone test world i 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.670
 now have a cool design for 1 8 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.590
 routes from voter so network selector 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.949
 found and wanted to show it to me 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:30.720
 because i may be in the future for 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.489
 a new redstone creation from me 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.140
 I need to say 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.190
 I have such a head look if I 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.680
 that can be realized and I show myself 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.329
 I would have to take care of that 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.960
 Imagine that is the principle I can 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:49.079
 here with this case eight different ones 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.719
 select things with simply no 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.739
 I know a little bit about you 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.870
 clarify 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.160
 so that somehow different 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.250
 things could be 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.379
 for my sake different redstone 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.640
 Outputs or something look misses me 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:10.020
 we take even a color still red 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:11.909
 even two are missing me a profi now 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.780
 but i know here with the arrow 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:19.530
 select right click what I like 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.960
 would have and for better clarification 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.950
 I take another lever and grabbed 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.990
 then instead of the button just do it 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.750
 but now loads many people the 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.450
 first lamp so say I say 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.270
 number one yes I turn the fire now 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.470
 then easily number two number three 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.610
 number four number five number 6 and 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.079
 always so on there are eight 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.570
 different ways and then 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:49.049
 jump again to 1 and here I have 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.090
 had the turn on yes I say 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.210
 say a redstone pulse 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.189
 we now take number four press 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.619
 once on it and then it will be in redstone 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.409
 pulse sent here to the number 4 the 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.930
 whole is relatively simple 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.540
 that's why there is no such thing now 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.700
 tutorial for we want to copy this 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.760
 It's not like that at all 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.110
 hard that here but only optional 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.390
 We do not just need it on the slopes 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.740
 then 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.840
 is always on, I wanted that too 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.290
 others can made feasible this is the 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.310
 what i have changed in the design 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.480
 otherwise remember that 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.520
 complete here 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.200
 I'll get rid of you, we'll sit down 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.450
 you have to click right again 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.770
 so that we light the lamp in front 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.750
 so that the whole thing works because 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.530
 otherwise the whole thing will not work 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.480
 I hope you can do something with it 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.140
 And I hope I can do it in the future 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.280
 also what to do 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.020
 which video you liked then you have 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.310
 a positive rating 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.770
 mini comment if you like that 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.200
 could help me for something 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.190
 could imagine for example 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.140
 station if I'm here now 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.700
 I have different goals once 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.380
 on it clique and accordingly then 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.900
 the soft ones are put or something 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.360
 but I think you have so much more 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.070
 Ideas what you can do there as I said 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.180
 Write the comments what you are here 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.400
 could expand 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.160
 and I would say we'll see each other 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.550
 next time again for his wife 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.550
 is
