I<00:01:36.380> have<00:01:36.529> a<00:01:36.560> horrible<00:01:36.829> sin<00:01:37.159> schemer<00:01:37.369> it<00:01:38.240> looks

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
I have a horrible sin schemer it looks

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.080 
I have a horrible sin schemer it looks
exactly<00:01:38.840> like<00:01:39.109> the<00:01:39.409> storm<00:01:39.740> two<00:01:40.069> but<00:01:40.939> the

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
exactly like the storm two but the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.339 
exactly like the storm two but the
really<00:01:41.329> smaller<00:01:41.779> version<00:01:42.289> of<00:01:42.380> it<00:01:43.869> so<00:01:44.869> if<00:01:45.139> one

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:45.349 
really smaller version of it so if one

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:47.319 
really smaller version of it so if one
day<00:01:45.560> they<00:01:45.709> want<00:01:45.859> to<00:01:45.919> make<00:01:46.009> a<00:01:46.039> storm<00:01:46.459> nano<00:01:46.759> this

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
day they want to make a storm nano this

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:48.580 
day they want to make a storm nano this
is<00:01:47.450> what<00:01:47.599> it's<00:01:47.719> going<00:01:47.840> to<00:01:47.899> look<00:01:47.959> like<00:01:48.139> and<00:01:48.499> it's

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
is what it's going to look like and it's

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.949 
is what it's going to look like and it's
going<00:01:48.709> to<00:01:48.770> be<00:01:48.859> a<00:01:48.889> touch<00:01:49.099> screen<00:01:49.389> so<00:01:50.389> Ram<00:01:50.779> I

00:01:50.949 --> 00:01:50.959 
going to be a touch screen so Ram I

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:52.359 
going to be a touch screen so Ram I
already<00:01:51.139> patent<00:01:51.649> that<00:01:51.770> so<00:01:52.009> forget<00:01:52.340> about

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
already patent that so forget about

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.830 
already patent that so forget about
using<00:01:52.880> my<00:01:53.209> idea<00:01:54.549> but<00:01:55.549> as<00:01:55.849> you<00:01:55.969> can<00:01:56.090> tell<00:01:56.149> that's

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
using my idea but as you can tell that's

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.399 
using my idea but as you can tell that's
how<00:01:56.990> big<00:01:57.229> it<00:01:57.349> is<00:01:58.419> you<00:01:59.419> see<00:01:59.569> the<00:01:59.719> bugs<00:02:00.139> are

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
how big it is you see the bugs are

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.010 
how big it is you see the bugs are
basically<00:02:01.399> the<00:02:01.459> same<00:02:01.700> distance<00:02:02.149> that<00:02:02.539> are<00:02:02.779> in

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
basically the same distance that are in

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.209 
basically the same distance that are in
the<00:02:03.109> storm<00:02:03.439> and<00:02:03.739> the<00:02:05.109> smart<00:02:06.109> thing<00:02:06.349> here<00:02:06.380> is

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:07.219 
the storm and the smart thing here is

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:08.669 
the storm and the smart thing here is
that<00:02:07.279> when<00:02:07.669> you're<00:02:07.789> charging<00:02:08.270> your<00:02:08.300> phone

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
that when you're charging your phone

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.280 
that when you're charging your phone
you're<00:02:09.679> charging<00:02:10.250> ports<00:02:11.240> right<00:02:11.540> here<00:02:11.600> and<00:02:12.080> not

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
you're charging ports right here and not

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.930 
you're charging ports right here and not
down<00:02:12.530> here<00:02:12.560> so<00:02:13.190> when<00:02:13.340> you're<00:02:13.490> texting<00:02:13.820> you're

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
down here so when you're texting you're

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:14.350 
down here so when you're texting you're
going<00:02:14.060> to<00:02:14.120> have

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
going to have

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.550 
going to have
problems<00:02:16.540> but<00:02:17.540> it's<00:02:17.900> basically<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.320> same

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
problems but it's basically the same

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.400 
problems but it's basically the same
line<00:02:18.770> can<00:02:19.010> you<00:02:19.040> tell<00:02:19.250> by<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.490> sights<00:02:20.410> the

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
line can you tell by the sights the

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.240 
line can you tell by the sights the
upper<00:02:21.830> part<00:02:25.030> right<00:02:26.030> here<00:02:26.060> on<00:02:26.390> the<00:02:26.480> sides<00:02:26.750> and

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
upper part right here on the sides and

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.080 
upper part right here on the sides and
right<00:02:28.250> here<00:02:30.160> battery<00:02:31.160> cover<00:02:31.430> before<00:02:31.730> we<00:02:31.970> get

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
right here battery cover before we get

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.910 
right here battery cover before we get
into<00:02:32.390> it<00:02:32.510> because<00:02:32.630> a<00:02:32.780> lot<00:02:32.960> of<00:02:32.990> people<00:02:33.110> ask<00:02:33.560> me

into it because a lot of people ask me

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.170 
into it because a lot of people ask me
through<00:02:34.130> his<00:02:34.220> metal<00:02:34.520> or<00:02:34.640> not<00:02:34.790> he's<00:02:34.910> just

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
through his metal or not he's just

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.320 
through his metal or not he's just
plastic<00:02:35.570> a<00:02:35.660> hundred<00:02:35.960> percent<00:02:36.080> and<00:02:37.240> this<00:02:38.240> is

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
plastic a hundred percent and this is

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.430 
plastic a hundred percent and this is
what<00:02:38.480> your<00:02:38.630> battery<00:02:38.960> looks<00:02:39.200> like<00:02:39.500> right<00:02:39.770> now

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
what your battery looks like right now

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.220 
what your battery looks like right now
that's<00:02:42.440> where<00:02:42.590> your<00:02:42.709> SD<00:02:43.070> card<00:02:43.100> goes<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:44.060> if<00:02:45.020> I

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
that's where your SD card goes and if I

that's where your SD card goes and if I
take<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.709> battery<00:02:46.100> out<00:02:48.280> this<00:02:49.280> is<00:02:49.430> where<00:02:49.580> your

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
take the battery out this is where your

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.830 
take the battery out this is where your
sin<00:02:49.940> card<00:02:49.970> goes<00:02:52.209> so<00:02:53.209> there<00:02:53.390> you<00:02:53.510> have<00:02:53.540> it<00:02:53.690> you

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
sin card goes so there you have it you

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.590 
sin card goes so there you have it you
put<00:02:54.020> it<00:02:54.110> back<00:02:54.290> in<00:02:55.989> battery<00:02:56.989> back<00:02:57.170> on<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:58.600> the
