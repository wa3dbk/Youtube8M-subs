00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
probably not the best profit we've made

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.780 
probably not the best profit we've made
what<00:03:13.049> is<00:03:13.139> still<00:03:13.379> over<00:03:13.650> one<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.280> a<00:03:14.400> half<00:03:14.430> k

what is still over one and a half k
profit<00:03:15.180> about<00:03:15.450> then<00:03:16.379> we<00:03:16.439> got<00:03:16.590> there<00:03:16.769> 2morrow

day or so whose prices what keeps going
up<00:03:22.379> and<00:03:22.530> down<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:23.310> be<00:03:23.370> brought<00:03:23.519> in<00:03:23.669> for<00:03:23.849> 18.2

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
up and down to be brought in for 18.2

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.860 
up and down to be brought in for 18.2
and<00:03:24.720> listen<00:03:24.959> for<00:03:25.639> 22.2<00:03:26.639> i<00:03:26.669> think<00:03:26.970> it<00:03:27.060> was<00:03:27.209> we

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
and listen for 22.2 i think it was we

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.379 
and listen for 22.2 i think it was we
got<00:03:27.989> another<00:03:28.079> one<00:03:28.319> for<00:03:28.379> 18.25<00:03:29.280> oh<00:03:29.879> and<00:03:30.150> we<00:03:30.209> list

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
got another one for 18.25 oh and we list

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:32.509 
got another one for 18.25 oh and we list
him<00:03:30.419> up<00:03:30.569> this<00:03:30.780> one<00:03:30.959> not<00:03:31.049> for<00:03:31.260> exactly<00:03:31.650> 22<00:03:32.489> i

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
him up this one not for exactly 22 i

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.869 
him up this one not for exactly 22 i
think<00:03:32.909> so<00:03:33.900> that's<00:03:33.930> probably<00:03:34.260> about<00:03:34.590> 3k<00:03:35.400> profit

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
think so that's probably about 3k profit

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.629 
think so that's probably about 3k profit
on<00:03:36.000> two<00:03:36.419> and<00:03:36.659> two<00:03:37.349> to<00:03:37.530> 3k<00:03:37.739> profit<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.370> both<00:03:38.489> of

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
on two and two to 3k profit and both of

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.990 
on two and two to 3k profit and both of
those<00:03:38.790> two<00:03:39.090> which<00:03:39.750> is<00:03:39.780> nice<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:40.729> you<00:03:41.729> can<00:03:41.849> see

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
those two which is nice and you can see
