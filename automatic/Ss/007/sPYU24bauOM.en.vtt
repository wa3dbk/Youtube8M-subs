00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
kind of been discovering this past year

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.519 
kind of been discovering this past year
as<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.560> do<00:00:19.619> this<00:00:20.539> obviously<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.630> have<00:00:21.960> hyper

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
as I do this obviously I have hyper

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.630 
as I do this obviously I have hyper
mobile<00:00:23.090> shoulder<00:00:24.090> blades<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:24.720> they<00:00:25.500> they<00:00:26.430> pop

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
mobile shoulder blades so they they pop

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.849 
mobile shoulder blades so they they pop
out<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.210> everything<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.930> technically<00:00:28.680> it's

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
out and everything and technically it's

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.580 
out and everything and technically it's
called<00:00:28.890> winging<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.939> I've<00:00:30.779> been<00:00:31.019> just<00:00:31.080> doing

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
called winging so I've been just doing

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.090 
called winging so I've been just doing
research<00:00:31.710> on<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.279> see<00:00:32.489> how<00:00:33.559> that<00:00:34.559> will<00:00:34.890> or

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
research on that to see how that will or

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.100 
research on that to see how that will or
will<00:00:35.190> not<00:00:35.250> affect<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.910> bone<00:00:36.030> breaking<00:00:36.480> the

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
will not affect the bone breaking the

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.240 
will not affect the bone breaking the
bone<00:00:37.350> breaking<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.040> bringing<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.149> shoulder

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
bone breaking is bringing this shoulder

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.580 
bone breaking is bringing this shoulder
bone<00:00:41.250> forward<00:00:41.989> so<00:00:42.989> two<00:00:43.110> totally<00:00:43.530> different

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
bone forward so two totally different

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.470 
bone forward so two totally different
things<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:45.270> be<00:00:45.300> honest<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:47.270> the<00:00:48.270> bone

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
things and to be honest the the bone

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.139 
things and to be honest the the bone
breaking<00:00:48.960> for<00:00:49.860> me<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.370> lot<00:00:50.610> more<00:00:50.789> painful

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
breaking for me is a lot more painful

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.439 
breaking for me is a lot more painful
and<00:00:52.399> okay<00:00:53.399> I've<00:00:53.520> been<00:00:53.640> discovering<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.270> more

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
and okay I've been discovering the more

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.180 
and okay I've been discovering the more
and<00:00:54.660> more<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.840> researched<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.530> whole<00:00:55.710> concept

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
and more I researched the whole concept

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.760 
and more I researched the whole concept
of<00:00:56.370> bone<00:00:56.579> breaking<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.350> you<00:00:58.350> kind<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.620> have<00:00:58.739> to

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
of bone breaking is you kind of have to

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.920 
of bone breaking is you kind of have to
choose<00:00:59.340> your<00:00:59.550> your<00:01:00.000> poison<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.719> want<00:01:00.870> to

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
choose your your poison that you want to

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.240 
choose your your poison that you want to
deal<00:01:01.050> with<00:01:01.199> later<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.500> life<00:01:01.680> because<00:01:02.219> I

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
deal with later in life because I

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.160 
deal with later in life because I
haven't<00:01:02.670> been<00:01:02.850> able<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.059> find<00:01:03.329> anything<00:01:03.690> about

know so it stays in same over here keep
that<00:02:12.980> bone<00:02:13.280> down<00:02:13.600> I'm<00:02:14.600> a<00:02:14.660> lot<00:02:15.080> better<00:02:15.320> on<00:02:15.380> the

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
that bone down I'm a lot better on the

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.380 
that bone down I'm a lot better on the
left<00:02:15.710> on<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:15.980> right<00:02:16.160> there's<00:02:16.820> some<00:02:17.000> reason

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
left on the right there's some reason

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.710 
left on the right there's some reason
the<00:02:17.510> right<00:02:17.720> it's<00:02:17.990> just<00:02:18.580> this<00:02:19.580> bone<00:02:19.850> does<00:02:20.450> not

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
the right it's just this bone does not

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.660 
the right it's just this bone does not
feel<00:02:21.110> good<00:02:21.350> at<00:02:21.590> all

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
feel good at all

the<00:02:23.600> shoulders<00:02:23.990> are<00:02:24.020> fine<00:02:24.320> though<00:02:24.560> the

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
the shoulders are fine though the

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.690

shoulders don't hurt at all and the

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.060 
shoulders don't hurt at all and the
reason<00:02:32.240> for<00:02:32.270> that

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
reason for that

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.690 
reason for that
I've<00:02:34.280> been<00:02:34.520> strengthening<00:02:36.400> been<00:02:37.400> doing<00:02:37.610> this

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
I've been strengthening been doing this

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.210 
I've been strengthening been doing this
exercise<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.390> strengthen<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:39.560> muscles<00:02:40.010> on

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
exercise to strengthen the muscles on

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.330 
exercise to strengthen the muscles on
top<00:02:40.430> of<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.760> shoulder<00:02:41.150> blade<00:02:41.420> so<00:02:42.080> that<00:02:42.260> my<00:02:42.560> my

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
top of the shoulder blade so that my my

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.850 
top of the shoulder blade so that my my
shoulders<00:02:43.820> always<00:02:44.030> stay<00:02:44.620> it's<00:02:45.620> like<00:02:45.709> you're

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
shoulders always stay it's like you're

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.350 
shoulders always stay it's like you're
balancing<00:02:46.340> out<00:02:46.520> what<00:02:46.760> you're<00:02:46.880> using<00:02:47.030> so<00:02:47.270> if

balancing out what you're using so if
I'm<00:02:47.510> sticking<00:02:47.870> my<00:02:47.930> shoulder<00:02:48.350> blade<00:02:48.500> out<00:02:48.650> like

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
I'm sticking my shoulder blade out like

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.810 
I'm sticking my shoulder blade out like
this

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
this

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.500 
this
I'm<00:02:50.860> strengthening<00:02:51.860> this<00:02:52.070> muscle<00:02:52.520> a<00:02:52.610> lot<00:02:52.850> but

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
I'm strengthening this muscle a lot but

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.420 
I'm strengthening this muscle a lot but
if<00:02:53.600> I<00:02:53.990> balance<00:02:54.590> it<00:02:54.680> out<00:02:54.770> by<00:02:54.830> strengthening

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
if I balance it out by strengthening

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.730 
if I balance it out by strengthening
this<00:02:55.550> muscle<00:02:58.090> one<00:02:59.090> won't<00:02:59.990> take<00:03:00.260> over<00:03:00.560> and

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
this muscle one won't take over and

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.770 
this muscle one won't take over and
easily<00:03:01.040> tear<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.580> rest<00:03:01.730> of<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:01.880> muscles<00:03:02.209> so

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
easily tear the rest of the muscles so

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.070 
easily tear the rest of the muscles so
one<00:03:03.080> exercise<00:03:03.380> that<00:03:03.560> I<00:03:03.650> use<00:03:03.890> a<00:03:03.920> lot<00:03:04.900> for<00:03:05.900> that

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
one exercise that I use a lot for that

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.990 
one exercise that I use a lot for that

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
now is when I do the actual bone

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.800 
now is when I do the actual bone
breaking<00:03:45.920> and<00:03:46.100> you<00:03:47.060> know<00:03:47.150> of<00:03:47.240> course<00:03:47.300> any<00:03:47.630> time

breaking and you know of course any time

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.400 
breaking and you know of course any time
you<00:03:47.900> do<00:03:48.050> it<00:03:48.610> it's<00:03:49.610> gonna<00:03:49.730> hurt<00:03:50.000> as<00:03:50.270> you<00:03:51.200> begin

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
you do it it's gonna hurt as you begin

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.670 
you do it it's gonna hurt as you begin
to<00:03:51.530> do<00:03:51.680> it<00:03:51.710> but<00:03:52.100> I<00:03:52.900> just<00:03:53.900> don't<00:03:54.260> know<00:03:54.440> how<00:03:54.650> much

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
to do it but I just don't know how much

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.860 
to do it but I just don't know how much
of<00:03:55.280> this<00:03:55.760> I<00:03:56.060> actually<00:03:56.240> want<00:03:56.600> to<00:03:56.690> manipulate

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
of this I actually want to manipulate

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.250 
of this I actually want to manipulate
because<00:03:57.500> I<00:03:58.330> don't<00:03:59.330> want<00:03:59.690> to<00:03:59.810> be<00:03:59.870> in<00:03:59.990> severe

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
because I don't want to be in severe

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:10.740 
because I don't want to be in severe
pain<00:04:00.530> as<00:04:00.740> I<00:04:00.830> get<00:04:00.980> older<00:04:01.100> you<00:04:01.610> know<00:04:01.730> so<00:04:02.080> I<00:04:05.740> guess

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.020 

again<00:04:11.750> like<00:04:12.350> this<00:04:12.680> you<00:04:13.430> know<00:04:13.520> it<00:04:13.910> keeps

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
again like this you know it keeps

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.320 
again like this you know it keeps
getting<00:04:14.330> easier<00:04:14.450> it's<00:04:15.230> just<00:04:15.500> that<00:04:16.060> so<00:04:17.060> you<00:04:17.150> can

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
getting easier it's just that so you can

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:24.810 
getting easier it's just that so you can
see<00:04:17.359> my<00:04:17.750> neck<00:04:18.970> muscle<00:04:19.970> right<00:04:20.090> there<00:04:20.260> it's<00:04:21.260> not

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.800 

yes<00:04:25.820> this<00:04:26.030> is<00:04:26.210> getting<00:04:26.510> better<00:04:28.420> yeah<00:04:29.420> see<00:04:29.660> this

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
yes this is getting better yeah see this

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:39.740 
yes this is getting better yeah see this
right<00:04:29.990> side<00:04:30.290> this<00:04:30.950> right<00:04:31.190> side<00:04:31.370> is<00:04:31.490> no<00:04:31.670> fun

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.190 

now<00:04:40.530> cannot<00:04:41.400> jump<00:04:41.700> broke<00:04:41.990> don't<00:04:42.990> know<00:04:43.050> if<00:04:43.140> I

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
now cannot jump broke don't know if I

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.750 
now cannot jump broke don't know if I
want<00:04:43.470> to<00:04:43.590> jump<00:04:43.770> rope<00:04:43.980> that's<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:44.340> thing<00:04:44.520> it's

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
want to jump rope that's the thing it's

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.190 
want to jump rope that's the thing it's
like<00:04:44.880> I<00:04:45.150> don't<00:04:45.510> know<00:04:45.630> you<00:04:45.690> just<00:04:45.840> kind<00:04:46.050> of<00:04:46.080> have

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
like I don't know you just kind of have

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.360 
like I don't know you just kind of have
to<00:04:46.230> figure<00:04:46.350> out<00:04:46.560> what's<00:04:46.710> right<00:04:46.890> for<00:04:47.040> you

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
to figure out what's right for you

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.300 
to figure out what's right for you
so<00:04:47.730> I'm<00:04:48.600> experimenting<00:04:49.440> a<00:04:49.770> lot<00:04:49.920> more<00:04:50.100> with<00:04:50.190> my

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
so I'm experimenting a lot more with my

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.620 
so I'm experimenting a lot more with my
shoulder<00:04:50.610> blades<00:04:50.790> because<00:04:51.030> those<00:04:51.210> don't<00:04:51.450> hurt

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
shoulder blades because those don't hurt

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.130 
shoulder blades because those don't hurt
and<00:04:51.870> I'm<00:04:53.270> utilizing<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:54.390> bone<00:04:54.510> breaking<00:04:54.930> but
