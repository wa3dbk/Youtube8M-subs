of rubber and it just kind of flails all
over<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.800> place<00:01:50.040> like<00:01:50.869> it<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.170> just<00:01:52.560> bad

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
over the place like it is just bad

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.130 
over the place like it is just bad
looking<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:56.180> one<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.360> worst<00:01:57.570> things<00:01:57.750> that

are<00:02:02.490> kind<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.229> awkward<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:05.030> Sonic<00:02:06.030> games<00:02:06.270> when

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
are kind of awkward and Sonic games when

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.520 
are kind of awkward and Sonic games when
you<00:02:07.470> jump<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.130> hold<00:02:08.399> forward<00:02:08.929> you<00:02:09.929> generally

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
you jump and hold forward you generally

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.050 
you jump and hold forward you generally
go<00:02:10.709> farther<00:02:11.040> and<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:11.400> one<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.670> kind<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:11.910> like

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
go farther and this one it kind of like

go farther and this one it kind of like
holds<00:02:12.390> you<00:02:12.510> back<00:02:12.860> which<00:02:13.860> is<00:02:14.070> odd<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:15.320> it<00:02:16.320> just

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.090 
holds you back which is odd and it just
makes<00:02:16.890> for<00:02:16.980> bad<00:02:17.250> timing<00:02:17.730> on<00:02:18.030> jumps<00:02:18.540> at<00:02:18.690> you

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
makes for bad timing on jumps at you

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.160 
makes for bad timing on jumps at you
sometimes<00:02:20.100> you<00:02:20.489> jump<00:02:20.760> too<00:02:20.970> far<00:02:21.000> sometimes<00:02:21.840> you

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
sometimes you jump too far sometimes you

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.390 
sometimes you jump too far sometimes you
jump<00:02:22.410> to<00:02:22.590> saw<00:02:22.830> like<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.550> close<00:02:24.470> it's<00:02:25.470> just<00:02:25.800> bad

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
jump to saw like to close it's just bad

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.080 
jump to saw like to close it's just bad
controls<00:02:28.820> so<00:02:29.820> I<00:02:30.180> mean<00:02:30.860> this<00:02:31.860> had<00:02:32.220> potential<00:02:32.940> to

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
controls so I mean this had potential to

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.870 
controls so I mean this had potential to
be<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.209> great<00:02:33.300> bootleg<00:02:34.020> and<00:02:34.670> although<00:02:35.670> it's<00:02:35.820> not

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
be a great bootleg and although it's not

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.000 
be a great bootleg and although it's not
the<00:02:36.299> worst<00:02:36.630> game<00:02:37.350> on<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.680> NES<00:02:38.660> it's<00:02:39.660> still<00:02:40.110> bad

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
the worst game on the NES it's still bad

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.340
