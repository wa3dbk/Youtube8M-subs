00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.769
 Almost everyone here is the Achilles heel of him 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:19.030
 is the rs3 at first by the way 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:24.220
 Sorry so you say youtube that 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:26.980
 three celebs yes that's it 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.140
 achilles heel for s3 is once 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.750
 several is the intercooler 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.980
 that's a pretty sweet thing 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:38.230
 little thing what gives the ride 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.300
 not like the highway then so 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.960
 Colleagues like they are flying right now 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.239
 follow clap here and then 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.610
 he tries to cool his colleagues 68 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.460
 liter volume 8 liter volume so we 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:58.270
 Almost 7 milk cartons can be used here 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:01:03.130
 Tilt wait something built competition 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:06.159
 three series of 4star accumulated table 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.929
 but brought alone alone 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:13.450
 you can see the other points here 

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:14.469
 the sweet thing is the series and till 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.829
 the online 

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:19.440
 this is big big cinema we have 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:27.060
 here in comparison 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:28.740
 16 5 liter 16 5 liter volume is our name 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.890
 can have a lot of fridge here 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.370
 Play like fridge 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:38.760
 the following 91 degrees air temperature goes 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.460
 pure land 90 degrees comes in here as 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:46.290
 for what you value krimi 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:55.620
 So to answer 91 degree go in here 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:02:02.520
 and 24 come out and the air is 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:05.610
 not that they let off the air but the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:10.320
 they simply break through and 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.800
 comes outside about 24 degrees comes from 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.100
 now in 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:20.880
 that looks like something 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:24.630
 pretty pretty and then next 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.209
 theme of the next Achilles heel of the 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.150
 prank so it goes on in the text in 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.720
 our audi rs3 audi rs3 sounds like that 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.720
 already from more 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.480
 So when I hear something three I hear 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.480
 quasi names more 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:47.060
 exactly the colleague should be so right 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:49.340
 Federal Council has really wilms itself 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.320
 Of course first in it is to predict 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.090
 is always difficult the box and load 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.090
 just once always write now 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.180
 took time because I have to I 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.180
 Toilet 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.230
 now you think so looks cool 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.030
 gerÃ¤dert not nice and clean but the vague 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.720
 It's no shit in this car 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.720
 because 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.790
 and now they all yell and scream 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:52.510
 say stop there is not so we have 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.099
 now 480 ps 700 newtonmeter the thing 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.159
 is dark inside and so on inside 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:04:02.859
 Brill is quasi the cave hell 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:05.400
 both together the thing must be synonymous 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.400
 accordingly 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.599
 but 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.750
 kik must always wants the healing 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.490
 is human just all together 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.320
 make dolls or we can too 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:35.540
 go picking strawberries or something 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:35.540

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.070
 my pink rabbit but it is cool 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:07.520
 actually can not look much more 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:09.920
 I'm laughing less for laughing today 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.920
 you can imagine each car 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:15.050

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:24.080
 she lowers her exhaust abs properly 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.710
 it 's also correct but quick 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.720
 to change 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.610
 endemol end of tube lunz about here 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.890
 to imagine that you are in one 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.980
 leisure Park 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:36.410

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.870
 then fall into the scouring degree and 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.810
 then comes this typical roller coaster 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.280
 Divide where you sit and then come 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.520

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.780
 nadelÃ¶hr where this goes through collects 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.350
 The whole thing then has to be here 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.820
 then we have to share again 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.700
 yes two bloody goes through two 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:03.110
 Caricatures through the look like that 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:12.710
 are for audi cases to one 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:14.590
 cheap once a block 2 but there 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.240
 must also march through again 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:21.350
 but now honestly how should 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:23.780

00:06:48.759 --> 00:07:04.830
 A dream pass from Wagner
