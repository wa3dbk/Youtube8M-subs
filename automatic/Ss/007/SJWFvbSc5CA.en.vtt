the film as well and I think it will be

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.319

something<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.289> look<00:00:49.710> out<00:00:49.950> for<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.550> something

something to look out for and something
that<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.899> already<00:00:52.110> enjoy<00:00:54.110> I'm<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.100> proud

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
of the film to be really honest because

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.380 
of the film to be really honest because
it<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.510> meaningful<00:01:00.510> film<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:02.180> it<00:01:03.180> comes

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
it is the meaningful film it's it comes

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.299 
it is the meaningful film it's it comes
from<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.780> heart<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.379> director<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
from the heart the director and the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.609 
from the heart the director and the
producers<00:01:05.760> have<00:01:05.970> put<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> lot<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.659> soul<00:01:07.229> into<00:01:07.590> it
