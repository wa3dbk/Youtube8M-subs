00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.780
 bit about what you exchanged 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.179
 because everything can do around this entire 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.430
 colds swearing around everywhere 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.380
 Escape and not absolutely everything 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.750
 capture what is buzzing around somewhere 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.000
 and there are so many incredible 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.070
 good things to do and we can 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 just share ours with you today 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.000
 favorite tips 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.160
 In winter I like to drink 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.640
 a homemade ginger lemon tea 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.950
 It strengthens the immune system and tastes good 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.690
 also totally delicious and not 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.280
 just some kind of tea bag and then 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.080
 kind of water over it or something 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.170
 but really with fresh lemon 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.630
 to give her all the vitamin c vitamin c 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.250
 all the vitamin c gets and fresh 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.330
 ginger and honey are still in there too 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.100
 I would say we just go 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.900
 together in the kitchen and I'll show you 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.300
 I do everything you like me 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.710
 honey is a piece of ginger and needs 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:06.100
 fresh lemons and they do not see that 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.710
 fresh from you are rock hard you nina 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:14.790
 do you have a lemon to mature 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:17.259
 a lemon for you always great 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.820
 you need the juice from the lemon 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.759
 means you just squeeze the whole 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.979
 lemon so have a press from when you 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.030
 for it and better equipped than me 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.130
 then it feels better I believe behind 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.660
 always those whole cores in there and 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.970
 then had to fork out again with the 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.229
 collect but it is also so if you 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.229
 No lemon squeezer has 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.470
 from sometime you need about like that 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.680
 So, two fingers are about the same size 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.680
 piece 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.770
 and of that you cut intestines all around 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.770
 the whole scale 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.439
 and then you cut that piece 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.810
 just another smaller sophie 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.149
 and the dice then just do it to you 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.799
 the lemon your cup feels the whole 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.799
 Then you open with boiling water 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.690
 and then just let it take ten minutes 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.210
 pull and then it could be with honey 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.560
 Sweet as sweet or sour as it is with 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.600
 of course you do not have to honey in 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.160
 but I'm personally is then a 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.880
 a little too angry with the whole 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.880
 becomes lemons 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.670
 I know homeopathy is not for 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.410
 everybody some people believe in it and 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.120
 others just do not if you to the people 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.310
 Believe it, then I can 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.320
 recommend echinacea if you can 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.790
 not already knows I knew that 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.910
 all my life because I used to be 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.840
 a family doctor always had that 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.090
 homeopathic remedies prescribed 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.830
 and somehow I have that over the 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.900
 forget years and then I will be back 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.850

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.350

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.270
 more by chance then at some point 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.040
 times added and now I notice 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.380
 really every winter when I take that 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.910

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.280
 or if I just kind of scratch that 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.890

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.180
