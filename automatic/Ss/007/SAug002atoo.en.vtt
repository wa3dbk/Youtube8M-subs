hello and welcome to my first video

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.070 
hello and welcome to my first video
tutorial<00:00:04.819> in<00:00:05.819> this<00:00:05.970> tutorial<00:00:06.029> I'm<00:00:06.839> going<00:00:06.990> to

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
tutorial in this tutorial I'm going to

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.750 
tutorial in this tutorial I'm going to
show<00:00:07.140> you<00:00:07.350> how<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:07.740> make<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.010> landscape<00:00:08.580> using

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
show you how to make a landscape using

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.749 
show you how to make a landscape using
the<00:00:09.000> displace<00:00:09.450> modifier<00:00:09.860> and<00:00:10.860> an<00:00:11.280> additional

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
the displace modifier and an additional

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.530 
the displace modifier and an additional
secret<00:00:12.210> later<00:00:12.420> well<00:00:13.170> let's<00:00:13.500> get<00:00:13.620> started

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
secret later well let's get started

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.340 
secret later well let's get started
first<00:00:15.540> add<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.020> plane<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.920> scale<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.970> up<00:00:18.090> big<00:00:18.449> go

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
first add a plane and scale it up big go

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.200 
first add a plane and scale it up big go
to<00:00:19.410> edit<00:00:19.830> mode<00:00:20.039> and<00:00:20.520> add<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.760> bunch<00:00:21.060> of

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
to edit mode and add a bunch of

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.089 
to edit mode and add a bunch of
subdivisions<00:00:23.060> okay<00:00:24.060> now<00:00:24.840> we<00:00:24.900> need<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.619> add<00:00:25.769> a

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
subdivisions okay now we need to add a

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.749 
subdivisions okay now we need to add a
yet<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:27.029> UV<00:00:27.510> unwrap<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:30.920> open<00:00:31.920> an<00:00:32.099> image<00:00:32.279> I'm

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
yet to UV unwrap it open an image I'm

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.310 
yet to UV unwrap it open an image I'm
going<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.940> post<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.510> description<00:00:33.840> of

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
going to post it in the description of

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.990 
going to post it in the description of
the<00:00:34.410> video<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:35.390> yeah<00:00:36.829> UV<00:00:37.829> unwrap<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.250> for<00:00:38.790> the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
the video and yeah UV unwrap it for the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.160 
the video and yeah UV unwrap it for the
top<00:00:39.270> view<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:40.550> under<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.579> project<00:00:42.239> from<00:00:42.510> bounds

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
top view and under a project from bounds

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.479 
top view and under a project from bounds
and<00:00:45.140> yeah<00:00:47.930> now<00:00:48.930> if<00:00:49.200> you're<00:00:49.379> going<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.800> touch

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
and yeah now if you're going to touch

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.459 
and yeah now if you're going to touch
driven<00:00:50.910> mode<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.449> can<00:00:51.600> see<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.020> there<00:00:52.850> so

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
driven mode you can see it's there so

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.709 
driven mode you can see it's there so
I'm<00:00:55.469> going<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.039> now<00:00:56.309> add<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.579> material<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.420> make

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
I'm going to now add a material to make

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:06.080 
I'm going to now add a material to make
it<00:00:57.899> show<00:00:58.050> up<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.469> render<00:01:04.070> set<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.519> image

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
it show up in the render set it to image

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.450 
it show up in the render set it to image
at<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.780> same<00:01:06.810> image<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.619> an<00:01:07.710> image<00:01:08.010> texture

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
at the same image and an image texture

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.330 
at the same image and an image texture
and<00:01:09.240> I'll<00:01:09.299> set<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.659> coordinates<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.500> UV<00:01:10.979> and

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
and I'll set the coordinates to UV and

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.960 
and I'll set the coordinates to UV and
then<00:01:11.490> Sue's<00:01:11.970> UV<00:01:12.479> text<00:01:13.220> now<00:01:14.220> it'll<00:01:14.490> show<00:01:14.670> up<00:01:14.790> in

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
then Sue's UV text now it'll show up in

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.039 
then Sue's UV text now it'll show up in
the<00:01:15.060> render<00:01:15.450> now<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.409> add<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.680> now<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.850> make

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
the render now to add the now that make

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.090 
the render now to add the now that make
landscape<00:01:19.049> we<00:01:19.259> need<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.590> have<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.830> same

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
landscape we need to have the same

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.570 
landscape we need to have the same
texture<00:01:20.549> click<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.689> redo<00:01:22.590> or<00:01:22.920> make<00:01:23.430> it

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
texture click the to to redo or make it

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.870 
texture click the to to redo or make it
into<00:01:23.790> another<00:01:23.820> one<00:01:24.360> or<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.740> unlink<00:01:26.400> them<00:01:26.640> and

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
into another one or to unlink them and

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.580 
into another one or to unlink them and
make<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.720> separate<00:01:28.650> texture<00:01:29.360> now<00:01:30.360> change<00:01:31.350> it

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
make it a separate texture now change it

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.289 
make it a separate texture now change it
back<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.950> UV<00:01:32.670> &amp;<00:01:33.119> UV<00:01:33.659> text<00:01:34.490> uncheck<00:01:35.490> color<00:01:35.820> and

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
back to UV &amp; UV text uncheck color and

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.969 
back to UV &amp; UV text uncheck color and
shut<00:01:36.540> RGB<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.320> intensity

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
shut RGB to intensity

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.819 
shut RGB to intensity
this<00:01:38.520> will<00:01:38.820> make<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.350> converted<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> black

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
this will make it converted to a black

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.730 
this will make it converted to a black
and<00:01:40.860> white<00:01:41.189> image<00:01:41.460> which<00:01:42.180> can<00:01:42.509> be<00:01:42.630> used<00:01:42.930> by<00:01:43.710> the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
and white image which can be used by the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.980 
and white image which can be used by the
displacement<00:01:44.399> modifier<00:01:44.689> doesn't<00:01:45.689> show<00:01:45.840> up

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
displacement modifier doesn't show up

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.740 
displacement modifier doesn't show up
here<00:01:46.290> but<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:47.220> works<00:01:48.200> so<00:01:49.200> now<00:01:49.380> go<00:01:49.740> here<00:01:50.070> add<00:01:50.460> a

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
here but it works so now go here add a

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.380 
here but it works so now go here add a
displace<00:01:51.750> modifier<00:01:52.130> choose<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.610> texture

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
displace modifier choose this texture

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.510 
displace modifier choose this texture
and<00:01:55.229> as<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.040> see<00:01:56.310> it's<00:01:56.759> done<00:01:57.329> this<00:01:58.460> way<00:01:59.460> to

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
and as you see it's done this way to

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.310 
and as you see it's done this way to
this<00:01:59.909> value<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.420> strength<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.810> way<00:02:00.930> too<00:02:00.990> high

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
this value the strength is way too high

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.649 
this value the strength is way too high
turn<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.670> 0.1<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:05.060> you<00:02:06.060> might<00:02:06.240> want<00:02:06.509> to

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
turn that to 0.1 and you might want to

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.730 
turn that to 0.1 and you might want to
change<00:02:07.079> this

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
change this

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.360 
change this
to<00:02:07.829> UV<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.700> cheese<00:02:08.970> uuv<00:02:09.569> text<00:02:10.130> next<00:02:11.130> you

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
to UV and cheese uuv text next you

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.030 
to UV and cheese uuv text next you
should<00:02:11.550> smooth<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.300> and<00:02:12.569> add<00:02:13.319> a<00:02:13.349> subsurf

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
should smooth it and add a subsurf

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.850 
should smooth it and add a subsurf
modifier<00:02:14.870> you<00:02:15.870> could<00:02:16.170> also<00:02:16.349> increase<00:02:16.770> the

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
modifier you could also increase the

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.490 
modifier you could also increase the
strength<00:02:17.250> for<00:02:17.459> a<00:02:17.520> little<00:02:17.760> bit<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:21.319> I'm<00:02:22.319> gonna

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
strength for a little bit and I'm gonna

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.830 
strength for a little bit and I'm gonna
turn<00:02:22.709> this<00:02:22.920> off<00:02:23.160> so<00:02:23.400> at<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.150> screen<00:02:24.450> perhaps

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
turn this off so at the screen perhaps

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.820 
turn this off so at the screen perhaps
your<00:02:25.019> program<00:02:25.440> captures<00:02:26.250> good<00:02:26.459> quality<00:02:26.940> and

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
your program captures good quality and

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.690 
your program captures good quality and
now<00:02:28.830> if<00:02:29.840> well<00:02:30.840> yeah<00:02:31.530> if<00:02:32.069> you<00:02:32.280> were<00:02:32.400> going<00:02:32.640> to

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
now if well yeah if you were going to

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:40.090 
now if well yeah if you were going to
textured<00:02:33.300> you<00:02:34.260> can<00:02:34.530> see<00:02:35.630> that<00:02:36.630> you<00:02:37.380> now<00:02:37.560> have<00:02:38.510> a

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
textured you can see that you now have a

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.309 
textured you can see that you now have a
landscape<00:02:41.100> based<00:02:41.430> on<00:02:41.700> it<00:02:41.910> so<00:02:42.690> I'll<00:02:42.780> turn<00:02:43.049> these

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
landscape based on it so I'll turn these

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.650 
landscape based on it so I'll turn these
two<00:02:43.620> off<00:02:43.799> and<00:02:44.160> now<00:02:44.400> I'll<00:02:44.580> render<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.239> so<00:02:45.600> you

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
two off and now I'll render it so you

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.199 
two off and now I'll render it so you
can<00:02:45.900> see<00:02:46.140> what<00:02:46.350> it<00:02:46.440> looks<00:02:46.590> like<00:02:47.060> there's<00:02:48.060> all

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
can see what it looks like there's all

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.880 
can see what it looks like there's all
these<00:02:48.360> white<00:02:48.630> spots<00:02:48.870> here<00:02:49.380> that<00:02:49.560> are<00:02:49.650> caused

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
these white spots here that are caused

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.090 
these white spots here that are caused
by<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.160> specularity<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:51.480> don't<00:02:51.870> look<00:02:52.019> good

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
by the specularity that don't look good

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.309 
by the specularity that don't look good
so<00:02:53.100> we<00:02:53.310> need<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:53.640> turn<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.150> specularity<00:02:54.750> down

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
so we need to turn the specularity down

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.180 
so we need to turn the specularity down
and<00:02:55.860> if<00:02:56.310> we<00:02:56.459> were<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:56.700> be<00:02:56.850> render<00:02:57.209> it<00:02:57.330> again

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
and if we were to be render it again

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.370 
and if we were to be render it again
it's<00:02:59.190> gone<00:02:59.610> because<00:03:00.000> you<00:03:00.750> should<00:03:00.989> get<00:03:01.170> rid<00:03:01.260> of

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
it's gone because you should get rid of

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.080 
it's gone because you should get rid of
them<00:03:01.530> because<00:03:01.830> in<00:03:01.980> reality<00:03:02.190> there<00:03:02.670> does<00:03:02.880> not

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
them because in reality there does not

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.390 
them because in reality there does not
shine<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:05.090> now<00:03:06.090> I'll<00:03:06.269> show<00:03:06.450> you<00:03:06.480> another<00:03:06.870> cool

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
shine so now I'll show you another cool

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
shine so now I'll show you another cool
feature<00:03:08.400> that<00:03:10.280> you<00:03:11.280> can<00:03:11.489> use<00:03:11.549> to<00:03:12.030> adjust<00:03:12.120> the

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
feature that you can use to adjust the

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.539 
feature that you can use to adjust the
height<00:03:12.540> in<00:03:12.870> different<00:03:13.230> areas<00:03:13.590> like<00:03:14.220> what<00:03:14.459> if

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
height in different areas like what if

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.280 
height in different areas like what if
you<00:03:14.640> want<00:03:14.820> to<00:03:14.910> have<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.209> be<00:03:15.390> extra<00:03:15.810> tall<00:03:16.019> in<00:03:16.200> the

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
you want to have it be extra tall in the

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.140 
you want to have it be extra tall in the
center<00:03:16.769> and<00:03:17.120> shorter<00:03:18.120> around<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.540> edges<00:03:18.989> so

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
center and shorter around the edges so

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.849 
center and shorter around the edges so
I'll<00:03:21.150> show<00:03:21.359> you<00:03:21.390> how<00:03:21.570> to<00:03:21.690> do<00:03:21.900> that<00:03:22.109> first<00:03:22.680> we

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
I'll show you how to do that first we

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.949 
I'll show you how to do that first we
need<00:03:23.100> to<00:03:23.220> create<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.549> vertex<00:03:24.090> group<00:03:24.420> I'm<00:03:24.810> going

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
need to create a vertex group I'm going

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.789 
need to create a vertex group I'm going
to<00:03:25.019> call<00:03:25.230> it<00:03:25.500> I<00:03:25.680> I<00:03:26.810> need<00:03:27.810> to<00:03:27.930> go<00:03:28.019> to<00:03:28.079> edit<00:03:28.530> mode

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
to call it I I need to go to edit mode

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:34.819 
to call it I I need to go to edit mode
select<00:03:29.640> all<00:03:30.209> vertices<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:31.470> click<00:03:31.650> assign<00:03:33.829> now

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
select all vertices and click assign now

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.720 
select all vertices and click assign now
we<00:03:34.890> go<00:03:35.640> into<00:03:36.000> weight<00:03:36.569> now<00:03:37.350> I'm<00:03:37.530> just<00:03:37.920> I'm<00:03:38.519> gonna

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
we go into weight now I'm just I'm gonna

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.150 
we go into weight now I'm just I'm gonna
turn<00:03:39.000> these<00:03:39.209> on<00:03:39.450> just<00:03:39.480> so<00:03:40.230> you<00:03:40.319> can<00:03:40.620> see<00:03:40.980> what

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
turn these on just so you can see what

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.590 
turn these on just so you can see what
it<00:03:41.280> looks<00:03:41.459> like<00:03:41.579> and<00:03:41.970> I'll<00:03:42.030> turn<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.299> strength

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
it looks like and I'll turn the strength

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.590 
it looks like and I'll turn the strength
up<00:03:42.900> so<00:03:43.230> you<00:03:43.319> can<00:03:43.590> see<00:03:43.769> better<00:03:44.069> now<00:03:44.400> if<00:03:45.299> we<00:03:45.450> were

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
up so you can see better now if we were

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:52.750 
up so you can see better now if we were
to<00:03:45.720> go<00:03:45.870> into<00:03:46.079> weight<00:03:46.560> paint<00:03:46.920> mode

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.290 

you<00:03:53.240> would<00:03:53.450> see<00:03:53.750> that<00:03:54.910> everything<00:03:55.910> is<00:03:56.000> red

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
you would see that everything is red

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.410 
you would see that everything is red
that<00:03:56.510> means<00:03:56.630> it<00:03:56.930> has<00:03:57.050> a<00:03:57.080> weight<00:03:57.380> of<00:03:57.410> one<00:03:57.950> and<00:03:58.420> we

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
that means it has a weight of one and we

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.410 
that means it has a weight of one and we
were<00:03:59.540> to<00:03:59.600> lower<00:03:59.900> the<00:04:00.200> way<00:04:00.550> like<00:04:01.550> to<00:04:01.820> zero<00:04:02.120> you

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
were to lower the way like to zero you

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.860 
were to lower the way like to zero you
would<00:04:02.570> see<00:04:02.870> that<00:04:03.610> it<00:04:04.610> doesn't<00:04:05.600> get<00:04:05.720> affected

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
would see that it doesn't get affected

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.160 
would see that it doesn't get affected
as<00:04:06.590> much<00:04:06.620> I<00:04:07.250> returned<00:04:08.030> the<00:04:08.120> strength<00:04:08.450> up<00:04:08.720> so<00:04:09.020> we

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
as much I returned the strength up so we

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.560 
as much I returned the strength up so we
can<00:04:09.350> see<00:04:12.220> it<00:04:13.220> doesn't<00:04:13.490> get<00:04:13.580> affected<00:04:13.670> yet<00:04:14.270> I

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
can see it doesn't get affected yet I

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.510 
can see it doesn't get affected yet I
have<00:04:14.930> to<00:04:15.080> select<00:04:15.290> the<00:04:15.560> vertex<00:04:15.890> group<00:04:16.160> to<00:04:16.310> hide

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:16.520 
have to select the vertex group to hide

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:22.930 
have to select the vertex group to hide
now<00:04:17.450> you<00:04:17.510> can<00:04:17.840> see<00:04:18.050> as<00:04:18.320> I<00:04:18.620> reduce<00:04:19.160> the<00:04:19.400> way<00:04:21.940> yeah

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
now you can see as I reduce the way yeah

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.830 
now you can see as I reduce the way yeah
it<00:04:23.510> gets<00:04:23.690> smoother<00:04:24.880> we<00:04:25.880> did<00:04:26.090> get<00:04:26.360> into<00:04:26.510> there

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
it gets smoother we did get into there

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.790 
it gets smoother we did get into there
again<00:04:27.230> you<00:04:27.470> go<00:04:27.680> to<00:04:27.710> here<00:04:28.520> wait<00:04:29.120> paint<00:04:29.540> and<00:04:29.930> if

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
again you go to here wait paint and if

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.200 
again you go to here wait paint and if
you<00:04:30.920> don't<00:04:31.100> know<00:04:31.160> the<00:04:31.280> vertex<00:04:31.640> spirit<00:04:32.030> made

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
you don't know the vertex spirit made

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.630 
you don't know the vertex spirit made
then<00:04:35.210> it<00:04:35.750> you<00:04:36.080> don't<00:04:36.530> make<00:04:36.710> one<00:04:36.980> but<00:04:37.370> you

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
then it you don't make one but you

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.310 
then it you don't make one but you
should<00:04:37.820> make<00:04:37.970> one<00:04:38.030> just<00:04:38.570> so<00:04:38.660> you<00:04:38.690> can<00:04:38.930> name<00:04:39.140> an

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
should make one just so you can name an

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.280 
should make one just so you can name an
info<00:04:39.680> organization<00:04:40.460> and<00:04:41.450> you<00:04:41.750> can<00:04:41.930> all<00:04:42.050> you

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
info organization and you can all you

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.470 
info organization and you can all you
set<00:04:42.560> the<00:04:42.680> weight<00:04:42.890> here<00:04:43.370> that<00:04:43.790> you<00:04:43.940> want<00:04:44.180> it<00:04:44.300> to

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
set the weight here that you want it to

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:52.770 
set the weight here that you want it to
be<00:04:44.690> and<00:04:45.760> now<00:04:46.760> if<00:04:47.090> we<00:04:47.150> were<00:04:47.510> to<00:04:47.570> go<00:04:49.390> back<00:04:50.390> out

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
be and now if we were to go back out

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.630 
be and now if we were to go back out
yeah<00:04:53.780> we<00:04:54.410> were<00:04:54.530> to<00:04:54.650> go<00:04:54.740> back<00:04:54.890> out<00:04:55.100> back<00:04:55.340> into

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
yeah we were to go back out back into

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.930 
yeah we were to go back out back into
object<00:04:55.790> mode<00:04:56.770> we<00:04:57.770> return<00:04:58.310> respect<00:04:58.640> on<00:04:58.790> this

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
object mode we return respect on this

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:05.080 
object mode we return respect on this
real<00:04:59.180> point<00:04:59.450> to<00:05:00.850> turn<00:05:01.850> this<00:05:02.030> back<00:05:02.390> on<00:05:03.880> you<00:05:04.880> can

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
real point to turn this back on you can

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:11.140 
real point to turn this back on you can
see<00:05:05.390> that<00:05:07.270> in<00:05:08.270> the<00:05:08.540> distance<00:05:09.080> it's<00:05:10.150> smoother

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
see that in the distance it's smoother

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.130 
see that in the distance it's smoother
than<00:05:11.330> it<00:05:11.480> is<00:05:11.630> up<00:05:11.840> here<00:05:12.200> and<00:05:12.970> so<00:05:13.970> yeah<00:05:14.570> that

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
than it is up here and so yeah that

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:18.490 
than it is up here and so yeah that
allows<00:05:15.890> you<00:05:16.160> to<00:05:16.190> do<00:05:17.050> that<00:05:18.050> allows<00:05:18.260> you<00:05:18.410> to

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
allows you to do that allows you to

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.740 
allows you to do that allows you to
control<00:05:18.890> these<00:05:19.250> so<00:05:19.790> that's<00:05:20.000> vertex<00:05:20.450> groups

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
control these so that's vertex groups

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.110 
control these so that's vertex groups
and<00:05:20.960> the<00:05:21.080> displacement<00:05:21.680> modifier<00:05:21.850> I'll<00:05:22.850> post

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
and the displacement modifier I'll post

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.520 
and the displacement modifier I'll post
the<00:05:23.270> link<00:05:23.510> to<00:05:23.540> the<00:05:23.720> images<00:05:24.230> in<00:05:24.440> the

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
the link to the images in the

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.000
