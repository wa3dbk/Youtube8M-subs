00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
the center of your crosshairs to about a

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.719 
the center of your crosshairs to about a
little<00:01:05.939> little<00:01:06.659> bit<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.500> right<00:01:07.530> just<00:01:08.520> a

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
little little bit to the right just a

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.770 
little little bit to the right just a
tad<00:01:09.240> bit<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.900> right<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.320> about<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.390> half<00:01:12.390> so

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
tad bit to the right and about a half so

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.120 
tad bit to the right and about a half so
are<00:01:12.900> between<00:01:13.110> halfway<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.590> three<00:01:13.799> quarter<00:01:14.070> of

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
are between halfway to three quarter of

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.789 
are between halfway to three quarter of
the<00:01:14.189> way<00:01:14.340> through<00:01:15.229> should<00:01:16.229> be<00:01:16.380> able<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.590> see<00:01:16.710> it

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
the way through should be able to see it

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.620 
the way through should be able to see it
and<00:01:17.009> if<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.640> do<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.880> right<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.119> should<00:01:18.600> be

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
and if you do it right you should be

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.179 
and if you do it right you should be
able<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.960> noobtube<00:01:19.320> straight<00:01:19.920> into<00:01:20.159> that

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
able to noobtube straight into that

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.020 
able to noobtube straight into that
building<00:01:20.520> like<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:22.400> well<00:01:23.400> not<00:01:23.640> like<00:01:23.820> those

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
building like so well not like those

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.260 
building like so well not like those
like<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:24.890> by<00:01:25.890> doing<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.340> run<00:01:27.000> up<00:01:27.119> and

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
like so by doing this run up and

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.670 
like so by doing this run up and
sometimes<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.990> can<00:01:28.080> get<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.380> little<00:01:28.500> bit

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
sometimes you can get it a little bit

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.440 
sometimes you can get it a little bit
low<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.490> what<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.700> do<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:29.850> your<00:01:30.000> aim<00:01:30.150> up<00:01:30.299> a

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
low so what you do is your aim up a

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.710 
low so what you do is your aim up a
little<00:01:30.750> bit<00:01:30.900> aim<00:01:31.799> up<00:01:32.009> go<00:01:32.729> back<00:01:32.909> down<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.360> you

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720
