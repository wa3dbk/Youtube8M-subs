00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
I got to build a plane that could be up

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.880 
I got to build a plane that could be up
to<00:04:39.590> a<00:04:39.650> year<00:04:39.710> why<00:04:40.160> do<00:04:40.370> the<00:04:40.460> competitions<00:04:41.890> maybe

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890
