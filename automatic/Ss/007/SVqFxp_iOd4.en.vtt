okay<00:00:01.500> I'm<00:00:01.680> going<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:01.890> teach<00:00:02.040> you<00:00:02.190> how<00:00:02.250> to<00:00:02.340> do

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
okay I'm going to teach you how to do

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.420 
okay I'm going to teach you how to do
the<00:00:03.000> rubik's<00:00:03.330> cube<00:00:03.570> blindfolded<00:00:04.290> first<00:00:05.279> you

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
the rubik's cube blindfolded first you

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.040 
the rubik's cube blindfolded first you
need<00:00:05.580> to<00:00:05.640> know<00:00:05.850> is<00:00:05.910> how<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.210> actually<00:00:06.600> do<00:00:06.839> it<00:00:07.250> so

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.050 
need to know is how to actually do it so

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.120 
need to know is how to actually do it so
you're<00:00:10.050> gonna<00:00:10.200> have<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.469> start<00:00:10.710> off<00:00:10.860> with<00:00:11.099> a

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
you're gonna have to start off with a

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.270 
you're gonna have to start off with a
short<00:00:11.490> top<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:12.000> ash<00:00:12.269> or<00:00:12.540> sign<00:00:13.170> in<00:00:13.469> front<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.070> I

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
short top and ash or sign in front and I

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.560 
short top and ash or sign in front and I
start<00:00:14.549> off<00:00:14.610> with<00:00:14.730> Korea<00:00:15.000> normally<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.450> can

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
start off with Korea normally you can

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.420 
start off with Korea normally you can
start<00:00:15.780> off<00:00:15.870> with<00:00:15.990> anything<00:00:16.289> else<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.160> start

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
start off with anything else and I start

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.650 
start off with anything else and I start
off<00:00:17.520> with<00:00:17.699> these<00:00:17.910> two<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.980> so<00:00:20.390> now<00:00:21.390> what<00:00:21.570> you

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
off with these two and so now what you

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.810 
off with these two and so now what you
need<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.930> do<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.380> need<00:00:22.410> to<00:00:22.710> orient<00:00:23.039> all<00:00:23.699> the

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
need to do is you need to orient all the

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.870 
need to do is you need to orient all the
corners<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.449> they're<00:00:24.600> facing<00:00:24.810> up<00:00:25.730> here<00:00:26.730> and

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
corners so they're facing up here and

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.870 
corners so they're facing up here and
down<00:00:27.720> down<00:00:28.109> here<00:00:29.330> so<00:00:30.330> by<00:00:30.570> doing<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:31.700> you<00:00:32.700> need

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
down down here so by doing that you need

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.299 
down down here so by doing that you need
to<00:00:33.030> use<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.600> certain<00:00:33.960> algorithm<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:34.710> switches

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
to use a certain algorithm that switches

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.369 
to use a certain algorithm that switches
this<00:00:35.989> so<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.290> only<00:00:37.440> moves<00:00:37.710> these<00:00:38.010> two<00:00:38.370> and

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
this so it only moves these two and

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.330 
this so it only moves these two and
you're<00:00:40.379> just<00:00:40.559> going<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.860> use<00:00:41.010> just<00:00:41.160> going<00:00:41.280> to

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
you're just going to use just going to

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.360 
you're just going to use just going to
do<00:00:41.520> all<00:00:41.700> these<00:00:42.829> but<00:00:43.829> all<00:00:44.040> these<00:00:44.809> and<00:00:46.070> if<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.190> do

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
do all these but all these and if you do

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.100 
do all these but all these and if you do
all<00:00:47.520> them<00:00:47.730> than<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.000> one<00:00:48.300> will<00:00:48.539> just<00:00:48.750> come<00:00:48.899> to

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
all them than this one will just come to

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:58.160 
all them than this one will just come to
it<00:00:49.610> welcome<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:51.680> be<00:00:52.680> facing<00:00:52.949> up<00:00:53.660> so<00:00:55.969> to<00:00:57.170> orient

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
it welcome to be facing up so to orient

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.280 
it welcome to be facing up so to orient
it<00:00:58.410> clockwise<00:00:59.510> you<00:01:00.510> use<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.960> algorithm<00:01:01.789> are<00:01:03.290> u

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
it clockwise you use the algorithm are u

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:13.219 
it clockwise you use the algorithm are u

are you i RI l and so now that's facing
up<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:20.240> when<00:01:21.240> you're<00:01:21.479> doing<00:01:21.750> when<00:01:22.049> you're

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
up and when you're doing when you're

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.429 
up and when you're doing when you're
getting<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.560> piece<00:01:22.830> each<00:01:23.700> piece<00:01:24.150> into<00:01:24.509> this

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
getting the piece each piece into this

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.649 
getting the piece each piece into this
spot<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.670> need<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.909> get<00:01:27.060> each<00:01:27.210> piece<00:01:27.450> into

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
spot is you need to get each piece into

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.789 
spot is you need to get each piece into
this<00:01:27.869> spot<00:01:29.030> to<00:01:30.030> make<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:31.049> do<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.320> algorithm

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
this spot to make it to do the algorithm

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.399 
this spot to make it to do the algorithm
but<00:01:32.460> if<00:01:32.700> it's<00:01:32.909> like<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.360> say<00:01:33.900> flip<00:01:34.170> like<00:01:34.350> that

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
but if it's like this say flip like that

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.770 
but if it's like this say flip like that
you<00:01:35.310> still<00:01:35.579> need<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.759> do<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.000> algorithm<00:01:36.600> views

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
you still need to do the algorithm views

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.330 
you still need to do the algorithm views
when<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:36.930> flip<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.290> back<00:01:37.500> into<00:01:37.770> its<00:01:37.890> spot

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
when you flip it back into its spot

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.499 
when you flip it back into its spot
it'll<00:01:38.790> be<00:01:38.909> wrong<00:01:40.310> so<00:01:42.409> by<00:01:43.579> what<00:01:44.579> by<00:01:44.880> making<00:01:45.360> it

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
it'll be wrong so by what by making it

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.600 
it'll be wrong so by what by making it
by<00:01:45.750> getting<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.320> into<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.680> spot<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.310> can't

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
by getting it into the spot you can't

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.350 
by getting it into the spot you can't
move<00:01:48.000> this<00:01:48.869> piece<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:50.310> has<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.640> stay<00:01:50.850> here<00:01:51.119> so

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
move this piece it has to stay here so

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.300 
move this piece it has to stay here so
say<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.600> want<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.840> get<00:01:51.930> this<00:01:52.110> piece<00:01:52.380> up<00:01:53.070> to

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
say you want to get this piece up to

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.280 
say you want to get this piece up to
here<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.700> can't<00:01:53.939> flip<00:01:54.149> this<00:01:54.299> twice<00:01:54.570> you'll

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
here you can't flip this twice you'll

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.010 
here you can't flip this twice you'll
mess<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.740> up<00:01:55.770> you'll<00:01:56.759> have<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.119> do<00:01:57.270> like<00:01:57.479> this

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
mess that up you'll have to do like this

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.950 
mess that up you'll have to do like this
and<00:01:58.350> then<00:01:58.530> flip<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.460> once<00:01:59.700> like<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.000> ok<00:02:01.549> so

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
and then flip it once like that ok so

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.830 
and then flip it once like that ok so
now<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.020> need<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.469> make<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:04.890> one<00:02:05.159> go

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
now you need to make this one go

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.999 
now you need to make this one go
anti-clockwise<00:02:06.840> remember<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:07.920> is

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
anti-clockwise remember it is

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.279 
anti-clockwise remember it is
anti-clockwise<00:02:08.459> Idol<00:02:09.209> holbrook<00:02:09.569> it'll<00:02:10.110> help

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
anti-clockwise Idol holbrook it'll help

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.980 
anti-clockwise Idol holbrook it'll help
later<00:02:11.160> with<00:02:11.819> remembering

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
later with remembering

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.180 
later with remembering
so<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.770> need<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:14.070> go<00:02:15.380> so<00:02:16.380> this<00:02:16.530> is<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:16.860> new<00:02:16.980> a

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
so you need to go so this is the new a

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.310 
so you need to go so this is the new a
new<00:02:17.220> algorithm<00:02:17.700> for<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.240> you<00:02:18.780> need<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:19.050> get<00:02:19.200> it

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
new algorithm for it you need to get it

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.250 
new algorithm for it you need to get it
in<00:02:19.410> place<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.920> then<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.130> go<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:21.120> are<00:02:21.480> you<00:02:22.230> i

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
in place and then you go you are you i

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
RI UI l and so you float back into place

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.750 
RI UI l and so you float back into place
and<00:02:33.540> this<00:02:34.110> is<00:02:34.290> good<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.740> this<00:02:34.890> is<00:02:35.070> good<00:02:35.280> but

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
and this is good and this is good but

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.170 
and this is good and this is good but
you<00:02:35.880> might<00:02:36.030> have<00:02:36.180> seen<00:02:36.420> this<00:02:37.100> not<00:02:38.100> it<00:02:38.670> was<00:02:38.910> good

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
you might have seen this not it was good

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.000 
you might have seen this not it was good
and<00:02:39.270> that<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.510> wasn't<00:02:39.900> well<00:02:40.470> in<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.740> end<00:02:40.770> it's

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
and that it wasn't well in the end it's

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.010 
and that it wasn't well in the end it's
going<00:02:41.130> to<00:02:41.190> come<00:02:41.340> together<00:02:41.640> like<00:02:41.850> as<00:02:42.240> i<00:02:42.510> said

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
going to come together like as i said

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.720 
going to come together like as i said
before<00:02:43.370> so<00:02:44.370> this<00:02:44.520> goes<00:02:44.760> clockwise<00:02:46.550> so<00:02:47.550> it<00:02:47.640> has

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
before so this goes clockwise so it has

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.110 
before so this goes clockwise so it has
to<00:02:47.760> go<00:02:48.000> like<00:02:48.390> that<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:48.930> then<00:02:49.440> like<00:02:49.620> that<00:02:50.120> even

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
to go like that and then like that even

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.490 
to go like that and then like that even
though<00:02:51.210> it<00:02:51.300> looks<00:02:51.330> good<00:02:51.690> it's<00:02:51.960> not<00:02:52.260> really

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
though it looks good it's not really

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.360 
though it looks good it's not really
when<00:02:52.800> you<00:02:52.860> flip<00:02:53.070> it<00:02:53.160> back<00:02:53.340> so<00:02:54.150> you<00:02:54.210> do<00:02:54.420> are<00:02:55.200> u<00:02:55.980> RI

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
when you flip it back so you do are u RI

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:11.490 
when you flip it back so you do are u RI
UI<00:02:57.530> and<00:02:58.530> you<00:02:58.890> do<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.160> algorithm

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.710 

okay<00:03:12.500> so<00:03:12.560> now<00:03:12.800> the<00:03:12.860> top<00:03:13.250> oriented<00:03:13.910> you<00:03:14.480> need<00:03:14.630> to

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
okay so now the top oriented you need to

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.480 
okay so now the top oriented you need to
get<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:14.960> bottom<00:03:15.320> and<00:03:15.470> by<00:03:15.710> getting<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:16.160> bottom

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
get the bottom and by getting the bottom

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.060 
get the bottom and by getting the bottom
you<00:03:17.330> just<00:03:17.600> flip<00:03:18.050> them<00:03:18.230> both<00:03:18.470> up<00:03:18.680> into<00:03:18.980> the

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
you just flip them both up into the

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.420 
you just flip them both up into the
buffering<00:03:19.460> zone<00:03:19.760> you<00:03:20.090> don't<00:03:20.270> redo<00:03:20.690> it<00:03:21.430> you

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
buffering zone you don't redo it you

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.220 
buffering zone you don't redo it you
don't<00:03:22.610> get<00:03:22.730> another<00:03:23.060> undisturbed<00:03:23.960> and

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
don't get another undisturbed and

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.920 
don't get another undisturbed and
buffering<00:03:24.530> zone<00:03:24.860> so<00:03:25.850> and<00:03:26.380> yeah<00:03:27.380> and<00:03:28.360> so<00:03:29.360> now

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
buffering zone so and yeah and so now

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.510 
buffering zone so and yeah and so now
this<00:03:30.170> needs<00:03:30.500> to<00:03:30.620> go<00:03:31.450> clockwise<00:03:33.070> so<00:03:34.070> you<00:03:34.160> go

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
this needs to go clockwise so you go

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.790 
this needs to go clockwise so you go
like<00:03:34.550> that<00:03:34.970> flip<00:03:35.300> it<00:03:35.450> in<00:03:35.570> the<00:03:35.690> spot<00:03:35.990> then<00:03:36.650> you

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
like that flip it in the spot then you

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:50.020 
like that flip it in the spot then you
go<00:03:36.920> you<00:03:36.980> are<00:03:37.580> you<00:03:37.940> I<00:03:37.970> are<00:03:47.290> put<00:03:48.290> back<00:03:48.590> and<00:03:49.040> we

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
go you are you I are put back and we

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.670 
go you are you I are put back and we
leave<00:03:50.240> one<00:03:50.480> piece<00:03:50.660> left<00:03:50.870> it<00:03:51.140> needs<00:03:51.350> to<00:03:51.560> go

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
leave one piece left it needs to go

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.210 
leave one piece left it needs to go
anti-clockwise<00:03:52.570> so<00:03:53.570> you<00:03:54.560> put<00:03:54.770> it<00:03:54.860> into<00:03:55.100> the

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
anti-clockwise so you put it into the

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.460 
anti-clockwise so you put it into the
zone<00:03:55.540> even<00:03:56.540> though<00:03:56.750> it<00:03:56.840> looks<00:03:56.990> right<00:03:57.200> it

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
zone even though it looks right it

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.050 
zone even though it looks right it
really<00:03:57.590> is<00:03:57.830> it<00:03:57.980> when<00:03:58.100> you<00:03:58.190> flip<00:03:58.400> back<00:03:58.610> I<00:03:58.820> can't

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
really is it when you flip back I can't

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.630 
really is it when you flip back I can't
stress<00:03:59.390> that<00:03:59.420> more<00:03:59.810> and<00:04:01.600> then<00:04:02.600> you<00:04:02.840> go<00:04:03.250> you<00:04:04.250> are

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
stress that more and then you go you are

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:18.250 
stress that more and then you go you are
you<00:04:05.000> i<00:04:05.030> RI<00:04:15.459> okay<00:04:16.510> now<00:04:17.510> we've<00:04:17.720> got<00:04:17.900> all<00:04:18.140> the

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
you i RI okay now we've got all the

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.400 
you i RI okay now we've got all the
corners<00:04:18.910> all<00:04:19.910> the<00:04:20.359> corners<00:04:20.690> oriented<00:04:21.260> so

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
corners all the corners oriented so

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:28.330 
corners all the corners oriented so
they're<00:04:21.530> all<00:04:21.620> facing<00:04:21.890> up<00:04:22.190> and<00:04:22.390> down<00:04:23.390> and<00:04:24.280> so<00:04:27.340> by

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
they're all facing up and down and so by

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.440 
they're all facing up and down and so by

move<00:04:59.600> pieces<00:04:59.810> into<00:05:00.260> the<00:05:00.380> buffering<00:05:00.710> zone<00:05:00.980> so

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
move pieces into the buffering zone so

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.270 
move pieces into the buffering zone so
they<00:05:01.340> sort<00:05:02.000> of<00:05:02.180> switch<00:05:02.770> so<00:05:03.770> this<00:05:03.919> goes

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
they sort of switch so this goes

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.020 
they sort of switch so this goes
clockwise<00:05:05.320> this<00:05:06.320> goes<00:05:06.500> counterclockwise

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
clockwise this goes counterclockwise

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.230 
clockwise this goes counterclockwise

it<00:05:18.590> up<00:05:18.680> a<00:05:18.800> little<00:05:18.830> so<00:05:19.430> I<00:05:19.460> have<00:05:19.610> a<00:05:19.669> better

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
it up a little so I have a better

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.580 
it up a little so I have a better
example<00:05:21.940> okay<00:05:22.940> so

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
example okay so

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.690 
example okay so
like<00:05:25.490> that<00:05:25.870> so<00:05:26.870> how<00:05:27.110> I<00:05:27.140> remember<00:05:27.620> it<00:05:27.650> is<00:05:28.010> this

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
like that so how I remember it is this

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.400 
like that so how I remember it is this
needs<00:05:28.970> to<00:05:29.030> go<00:05:29.180> counter<00:05:29.660> this<00:05:29.930> needs<00:05:30.170> to<00:05:30.260> go

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
needs to go counter this needs to go

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.280 
needs to go counter this needs to go
clockwise<00:05:30.770> see<00:05:31.390> clockwise<00:05:32.390> to<00:05:32.900> get<00:05:33.020> on<00:05:33.170> the

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
clockwise see clockwise to get on the

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.370 
clockwise see clockwise to get on the
top<00:05:33.470> so<00:05:34.040> you<00:05:34.100> remember<00:05:34.460> that<00:05:34.610> as<00:05:34.790> see<00:05:35.380> this

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
top so you remember that as see this

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.720 
top so you remember that as see this
doesn't<00:05:36.800> need<00:05:36.860> to<00:05:36.920> move<00:05:37.130> at<00:05:37.250> all<00:05:37.370> so<00:05:37.640> you

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:37.730 
doesn't need to move at all so you

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:40.240 
doesn't need to move at all so you
remember<00:05:38.060> that<00:05:38.180> as<00:05:38.390> X<00:05:38.710> this<00:05:39.710> needs<00:05:40.010> to<00:05:40.100> go

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
remember that as X this needs to go

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.510 
remember that as X this needs to go
clockwise<00:05:40.520> so<00:05:40.940> it's<00:05:41.090> see<00:05:41.330> you<00:05:41.480> again<00:05:41.690> and<00:05:42.520> you

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520 
clockwise so it's see you again and you

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.130 
clockwise so it's see you again and you
got<00:05:43.670> the<00:05:43.700> going<00:05:44.000> like<00:05:44.180> a<00:05:44.210> certain<00:05:44.570> order<00:05:44.780> so<00:05:45.050> it

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
got the going like a certain order so it

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.800 
got the going like a certain order so it
goes<00:05:45.290> like<00:05:45.790> this<00:05:46.790> then<00:05:47.300> that<00:05:47.330> then<00:05:47.780> that

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
goes like this then that then that

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.830 
goes like this then that then that
corner<00:05:48.260> then<00:05:48.620> that<00:05:48.830> one<00:05:49.480> that<00:05:50.480> one<00:05:50.660> then<00:05:50.810> that

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
corner then that one that one then that

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:57.700 
corner then that one that one then that
one<00:05:50.990> and<00:05:51.410> then<00:05:51.470> that<00:05:51.680> one<00:05:51.940> so<00:05:52.940> it's<00:05:53.300> c<00:05:54.080> XC<00:05:54.940> x<00:05:56.710> c

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
one and then that one so it's c XC x c

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.940 
one and then that one so it's c XC x c
XC<00:05:58.070> x<00:05:59.080> and<00:06:00.310> then<00:06:01.310> it<00:06:01.430> needs<00:06:01.580> to<00:06:01.850> go

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:02.950 
XC x and then it needs to go

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:21.150 
XC x and then it needs to go
anti-clockwise<00:06:04.450> so<00:06:05.450> a<00:06:06.310> so<00:06:07.310> c<00:06:09.730> c<00:06:10.730> XC<00:06:12.370> x<00:06:13.370> ay<00:06:14.230> ay<00:06:17.920> ay

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.160 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:27.270 

yeah<00:06:22.160> CX<00:06:23.230> that's<00:06:24.230> easy<00:06:24.470> to<00:06:24.620> remember<00:06:24.650> it<00:06:25.330> c<00:06:26.330> XC

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 
yeah CX that's easy to remember it c XC

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.620 
yeah CX that's easy to remember it c XC
x<00:06:28.280> ay<00:06:28.820> ay<00:06:29.210> ay<00:06:30.460> so<00:06:31.460> if<00:06:31.760> you<00:06:31.940> just<00:06:32.060> remember<00:06:32.360> that

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:32.630 
x ay ay ay so if you just remember that

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.840 
x ay ay ay so if you just remember that
by<00:06:33.590> c<00:06:34.160> is<00:06:34.520> starting<00:06:34.970> off<00:06:35.240> with<00:06:35.600> all<00:06:35.960> our<00:06:36.560> u<00:06:37.430> RI

UI na starting off with you are you i RI

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.170 
UI na starting off with you are you i RI
and<00:06:42.050> you<00:06:42.890> just<00:06:43.040> put<00:06:43.220> them<00:06:43.370> all<00:06:43.550> into<00:06:43.700> the<00:06:43.940> zone

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:44.180 
and you just put them all into the zone

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.700 
and you just put them all into the zone
these<00:06:44.480> you<00:06:44.570> just<00:06:44.780> can't<00:06:44.990> do<00:06:45.200> it<00:06:45.230> without<00:06:45.500> them

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:45.710 
these you just can't do it without them

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.180 
these you just can't do it without them
there<00:06:46.070> and<00:06:46.820> orient<00:06:47.480> them<00:06:47.690> all<00:06:47.930> so<00:06:48.800> they're<00:06:49.040> all

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:49.190 
there and orient them all so they're all

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:54.100 
there and orient them all so they're all
in<00:06:49.340> the<00:06:49.430> right<00:06:49.550> spot<00:06:50.890> so<00:06:52.300> that's<00:06:53.300> the<00:06:53.540> end<00:06:53.810> of
