on us shores and that seemed to have
opened<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.759> floodgates<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.479> think<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.350> media

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
opened the floodgates I think the media

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.920 
opened the floodgates I think the media
is<00:01:58.979> by<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.850> large<00:01:59.909> not<00:02:00.420> blowing<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.810> out<00:02:00.869> of

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
is by and large not blowing it out of

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.149 
is by and large not blowing it out of
proportion<00:02:01.020> they're<00:02:01.619> actually<00:02:01.920> under

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
proportion they're actually under

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.830 
proportion they're actually under
estimating<00:02:02.579> how<00:02:02.670> serious<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.810> I

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
estimating how serious it is so I

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.330 
estimating how serious it is so I
believe<00:02:04.020> we<00:02:04.229> have<00:02:04.259> multiple<00:02:04.710> causes<00:02:04.890> but

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
believe we have multiple causes but

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.609 
believe we have multiple causes but
basically<00:02:05.759> they<00:02:06.060> all<00:02:06.210> mean<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.290> entire
