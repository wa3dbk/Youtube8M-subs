00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.350 
on top
whisk<00:03:19.990> away<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:20.470> make<00:03:20.650> it<00:03:20.800> more<00:03:20.980> foolproof<00:03:21.670> I

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
whisk away to make it more foolproof I

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.050 
whisk away to make it more foolproof I
mean<00:03:22.720> you<00:03:22.900> can<00:03:23.170> do<00:03:23.380> without<00:03:23.800> this<00:03:24.130> stuff<00:03:24.370> but

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
mean you can do without this stuff but

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.910 
mean you can do without this stuff but
you<00:03:25.150> could<00:03:25.270> add<00:03:25.420> half<00:03:25.930> a<00:03:25.960> tablespoon<00:03:26.350> of<00:03:26.530> water

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
you could add half a tablespoon of water

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.800 
you could add half a tablespoon of water
so<00:03:27.280> if<00:03:27.340> using<00:03:27.640> four<00:03:27.790> eggs<00:03:27.970> you<00:03:28.300> can<00:03:28.420> use<00:03:28.600> half<00:03:28.780> a

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
so if using four eggs you can use half a

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.810 
so if using four eggs you can use half a
tape<00:03:29.080> I<00:03:29.200> mean<00:03:29.380> usable<00:03:29.800> tablespoon<00:03:30.280> so<00:03:30.700> they

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
tape I mean usable tablespoon so they

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.950 
tape I mean usable tablespoon so they
give<00:03:31.210> this<00:03:31.330> and<00:03:31.510> burn<00:03:31.630> and<00:03:32.940> and<00:03:33.940> whisk<00:03:34.750> your
