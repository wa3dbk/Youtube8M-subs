00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:29.970 
twin sheet thermoforming or TST allows
us<00:00:28.720> to<00:00:28.840> make<00:00:28.960> a<00:00:28.990> kayak<00:00:29.380> that<00:00:29.530> is<00:00:29.650> lighter<00:00:29.890> and

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
us to make a kayak that is lighter and

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.389 
us to make a kayak that is lighter and

one<00:00:33.399> reason<00:00:33.730> for<00:00:33.760> this<00:00:33.999> is<00:00:34.179> that<00:00:34.269> TST<00:00:35.019> allows

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
one reason for this is that TST allows

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.930 
one reason for this is that TST allows
us<00:00:35.469> to<00:00:35.589> use<00:00:35.710> a<00:00:35.739> higher<00:00:36.010> grade<00:00:36.280> of<00:00:36.309> plastic<00:00:36.789> than

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940
