00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.010 
abuse that what they've done now
actually<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:38.940> change<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.420> spawn<00:00:39.629> so<00:00:39.870> that

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
actually is the change the spawn so that

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.869 
actually is the change the spawn so that
if<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.590> push<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.100> enemy<00:00:41.190> spawn<00:00:41.520> too<00:00:41.700> much

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
if you push the enemy spawn too much

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.940 
if you push the enemy spawn too much
it's<00:00:42.180> kind<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.750> like<00:00:42.840> domination<00:00:43.530> or<00:00:43.680> team

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
it's kind of like domination or team

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.260 
it's kind of like domination or team
deathmatch<00:00:44.309> rule<00:00:44.520> small<00:00:44.850> on<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:44.969> other<00:00:45.120> side

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.810 
deathmatch rule small on the other side
of<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.420> map<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.809> it's<00:00:46.530> good<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.829> bad<00:00:46.950> for<00:00:47.760> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
of the map and it's good and bad for the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.400 
of the map and it's good and bad for the
people<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.180> are<00:00:48.210> receiving<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.899> spawn<00:00:49.110> trap

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
people that are receiving the spawn trap

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.590 
people that are receiving the spawn trap
it's<00:00:50.039> fantastic<00:00:50.850> because<00:00:50.879> they<00:00:51.360> will<00:00:51.510> no

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
it's fantastic because they will no

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.450 
it's fantastic because they will no
longer<00:00:51.629> be<00:00:52.020> spawn<00:00:52.230> trapped<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.770> download

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
longer be spawn trapped and download

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.439

your<00:00:53.550> spot<00:00:53.789> on<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.969> other<00:00:54.059> side<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.329> map

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
your spot on the other side of the map

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.470 
your spot on the other side of the map
however<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.530> completely<00:00:56.309> destroys<00:00:56.879> objective

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
however it completely destroys objective

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.150 
however it completely destroys objective
play<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.960> then<00:00:58.500> let<00:00:58.680> me<00:00:58.739> get<00:00:58.859> into<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.070> a

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
play and then let me get into that a

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.130 
play and then let me get into that a
little<00:00:59.219> bit<00:00:59.370> more<00:00:59.579> so<00:01:00.180> there's<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.930> lot<00:01:01.079> of

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
little bit more so there's a lot of

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.510 
little bit more so there's a lot of
times<00:01:01.410> when<00:01:01.649> my<00:01:01.770> teammates<00:01:02.100> will<00:01:02.190> just<00:01:02.370> you

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
times when my teammates will just you

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.160 
times when my teammates will just you

know we're all pretty rush happy we're
just<00:01:04.350> gonna<00:01:04.439> bum-rush<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.309> enemy<00:01:05.519> spawn<00:01:05.760> and

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
just gonna bum-rush the enemy spawn and

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.390 
just gonna bum-rush the enemy spawn and
the<00:01:06.780> problem<00:01:07.170> with<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.979> nowadays

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
the problem with that is that nowadays

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.250 
the problem with that is that nowadays
in<00:01:08.880> demolition<00:01:09.510> when<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.689> when<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:09.869> rush<00:01:10.110> the

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
in demolition when you when you rush the

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.289 
in demolition when you when you rush the
enemy<00:01:10.470> spawn<00:01:10.710> it'll<00:01:11.580> completely<00:01:11.909> change<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
enemy spawn it'll completely change the

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.300 
enemy spawn it'll completely change the
other<00:01:12.390> side<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.689> map<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.439> let's<00:01:13.920> say<00:01:14.100> that

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
other side of the map so let's say that

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.039 
other side of the map so let's say that
um<00:01:14.460> we're<00:01:14.790> on<00:01:14.909> offense<00:01:15.450> okay<00:01:15.570> we're<00:01:15.810> trying<00:01:15.990> to

it<00:01:50.820> was<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.939> huge<00:01:51.180> issue<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.509> demolition<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.020> I

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
it was a huge issue and demolition and I

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.499 
it was a huge issue and demolition and I
obviously<00:01:52.649> loved<00:01:52.950> abusing<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.399> so<00:01:53.579> uh<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:54.000> think

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
obviously loved abusing it so uh I think

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.429 
obviously loved abusing it so uh I think
they'd<00:01:54.600> be<00:01:54.750> great<00:01:54.899> if<00:01:54.990> they<00:01:55.049> bring<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.320> back

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
they'd be great if they bring it back

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.289 
they'd be great if they bring it back
but<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:55.680> don't<00:01:56.070> think<00:01:56.219> they<00:01:56.310> ever<00:01:56.340> will<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:57.149> be

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
but I don't think they ever will it be

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.459 
but I don't think they ever will it be
