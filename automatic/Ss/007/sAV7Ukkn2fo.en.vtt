00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
not going to die while most of the time

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.980 
not going to die while most of the time
it's<00:02:16.730> pretty<00:02:16.940> easy<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.240> play<00:02:17.480> you're<00:02:17.780> just

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
it's pretty easy to play you're just

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.520 
it's pretty easy to play you're just
like<00:02:18.250> you<00:02:19.250> name<00:02:19.430> how<00:02:19.610> much<00:02:19.790> you<00:02:19.940> think<00:02:19.970> if<00:02:20.930> they

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
like you name how much you think if they

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.900 
like you name how much you think if they
pay<00:02:21.920> that<00:02:22.160> more<00:02:22.370> than<00:02:22.400> that<00:02:22.700> they're<00:02:22.880> just

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
pay that more than that they're just

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.690 
pay that more than that they're just
going<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.180> lose<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.510> game<00:02:23.660> and<00:02:24.340> then<00:02:25.340> you<00:02:25.490> just

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
going to lose the game and then you just

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.580 
going to lose the game and then you just
kill<00:02:25.940> them<00:02:26.090> with<00:02:26.270> the<00:02:26.450> three-card<00:02:26.930> to<00:02:27.080> draw<00:02:27.320> is

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
kill them with the three-card to draw is

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.280 
kill them with the three-card to draw is
just<00:02:27.800> going<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:27.950> be<00:02:28.040> burned<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:28.840> for<00:02:29.840> the

end of each player's turn aside this

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.720 
end of each player's turn aside this
almost<00:02:42.050> every<00:02:42.320> round<00:02:42.530> it<00:02:42.770> was<00:02:42.890> only<00:02:43.010> only<00:02:43.580> time

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
almost every round it was only only time

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.220 
almost every round it was only only time
I<00:02:43.760> played<00:02:44.000> it<00:02:44.120> was<00:02:44.209> once<00:02:44.390> in<00:02:44.570> top<00:02:44.750> 8<00:02:44.989> and<00:02:45.170> then

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
I played it was once in top 8 and then

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.370 
I played it was once in top 8 and then
won<00:02:45.500> me<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:45.680> game<00:02:45.880> but<00:02:46.880> I<00:02:46.940> sided<00:02:47.300> more<00:02:47.690> but<00:02:48.110> I

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
won me the game but I sided more but I

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.770 
won me the game but I sided more but I
probably<00:02:49.070> would<00:02:49.400> just<00:02:49.550> play<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:50.030> fourth<00:02:50.420> copy

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
probably would just play the fourth copy

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.870 
probably would just play the fourth copy
of<00:02:50.959> cane<00:02:51.230> because<00:02:51.560> King<00:02:51.860> isn't<00:02:52.160> that<00:02:52.550> great

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
of cane because King isn't that great

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.460 
of cane because King isn't that great
but<00:02:53.360> sometimes<00:02:53.570> if<00:02:53.959> you're<00:02:54.080> like<00:02:54.230> on<00:02:54.380> the

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
but sometimes if you're like on the

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.870 
but sometimes if you're like on the
early<00:02:54.739> aggressive<00:02:55.040> plan<00:02:55.370> you<00:02:55.489> have<00:02:55.580> a<00:02:55.610> ton<00:02:55.850> of

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
early aggressive plan you have a ton of

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.759 
early aggressive plan you have a ton of
one<00:02:56.120> drops<00:02:56.420> and<00:02:56.690> you<00:02:56.750> flip<00:02:56.959> the<00:02:57.080> ruler<00:02:57.380> early

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
one drops and you flip the ruler early

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.259 
one drops and you flip the ruler early
and<00:02:57.950> then<00:02:58.370> you<00:02:58.489> attack<00:02:58.730> with<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:58.970> rule<00:02:59.120> dude

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
and then you attack with the rule dude

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:00.460 
and then you attack with the rule dude
next<00:02:59.420> to<00:02:59.570> him<00:02:59.690> then<00:02:59.780> you<00:02:59.810> just<00:02:59.959> drop<00:03:00.110> this<00:03:00.260> guy

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
next to him then you just drop this guy

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.350 
next to him then you just drop this guy
and<00:03:00.650> swinging<00:03:00.980> in<00:03:01.070> he's<00:03:01.250> a<00:03:01.640> lot<00:03:01.820> better<00:03:01.970> in<00:03:02.239> the

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
and swinging in he's a lot better in the

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.570 
and swinging in he's a lot better in the
cane<00:03:02.570> version<00:03:03.019> but<00:03:03.290> he<00:03:04.040> still<00:03:04.250> gets<00:03:04.430> in

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
cane version but he still gets in

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.520 
cane version but he still gets in
sometimes<00:03:06.430> that's<00:03:07.430> pretty<00:03:07.670> much<00:03:07.790> it<00:03:07.850> I<00:03:08.530> don't

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
sometimes that's pretty much it I don't

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.050 
sometimes that's pretty much it I don't
