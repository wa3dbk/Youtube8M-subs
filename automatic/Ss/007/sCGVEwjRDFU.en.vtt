something<00:00:34.460> common<00:00:35.059> throughout<00:00:35.390> all<00:00:35.629> of<00:00:35.690> these

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
something common throughout all of these

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.740 
something common throughout all of these
is<00:00:36.379> the<00:00:36.890> hardware<00:00:37.400> that<00:00:37.520> is<00:00:37.670> included<00:00:38.239> you<00:00:38.360> get

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
is the hardware that is included you get

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.070 
is the hardware that is included you get
for<00:00:39.260> mounting<00:00:40.100> screws<00:00:40.430> you<00:00:41.150> also<00:00:41.660> get<00:00:41.870> a

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080 
for mounting screws you also get a

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.930 
for mounting screws you also get a
monk's<00:00:42.500> connector<00:00:42.980> so<00:00:43.190> you<00:00:43.280> can<00:00:43.460> connect<00:00:43.820> the

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
monk's connector so you can connect the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.420 
monk's connector so you can connect the
fans<00:00:44.210> directly<00:00:44.690> into<00:00:45.379> this<00:00:45.530> and<00:00:45.739> then<00:00:46.220> this

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
fans directly into this and then this

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.790 
fans directly into this and then this
goes<00:00:46.610> into<00:00:46.879> your<00:00:46.909> power<00:00:47.239> supply<00:00:47.540> or<00:00:47.960> of<00:00:48.530> course

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
goes into your power supply or of course

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.799 
goes into your power supply or of course
you<00:00:48.920> can<00:00:49.070> just<00:00:49.250> plug<00:00:49.519> these<00:00:49.699> stands<00:00:50.150> directly

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809

fan<00:04:04.190> and<00:04:04.489> reduce<00:04:05.389> it<00:04:05.599> to<00:04:05.780> maybe<00:04:06.319> six<00:04:06.739> volts

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:07.159 
fan and reduce it to maybe six volts

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:09.039 
fan and reduce it to maybe six volts
that's<00:04:07.670> another<00:04:07.970> option<00:04:08.209> you<00:04:08.629> could<00:04:08.810> do

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
that's another option you could do
