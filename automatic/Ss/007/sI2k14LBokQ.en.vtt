00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 okay we are here at the beurer 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:08.340
 ifa on the beach and interesting for us 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.980
 is the new kitchen scale in january 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.660
 probably around 99 euros uvp on the 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.280
 market come which has a bluetooth 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.299
 smart connection i could maybe 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.980
 to live a bit 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.070
 nice is she has integrated her battery 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.390
 I can load it via micro usb as he 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.779
 no more fumbling with the little ones 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.580
 button occurred at the wm kent 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.320
 with battery level indicator here so whether 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.050
 It's full at the moment and I can do that thing 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.279
 needs to use as a normal kitchen scale 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.710
 no ipad nothing to it and that 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.870
 Everything works well, too 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.399
 this is is a recipe app respect the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.020
 surely will not be the only one 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.670
 and now I have a choice of 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.710
 kienberg we make marzipan tart 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.649
 then say I like that 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.239
 we look at ingredients here would be so 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.039
 normal features like shopping center 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.899
 same as one scans from recipes app 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.309
 And this recipe is also possible 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.289
 Just do not even look at the scales 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.559
 on it and then should have a bluetooth 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.820
 be built connection 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.940
 we look and work seems to be working 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.940
 fold 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.010
 completely received the recipe okay now 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.200
 I have a recipe for him and me 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.520
 could say okay start and that is 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.200
 nice i need the ipad actually 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.580
 no longer such a goal short and sweet 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.300
 the instruction what I have to do so 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.840
 oven then preheat my bakeware 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:25.650
 grease and now where he first 200 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.970
 km soft butter in the former now 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.080
 here 87 grams per rack exist 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.440
 is not enough we take one in 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.979
 200 grams on it goes now at 100 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.289
 grams of sugar 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.780
 because 400 grams of sugar is a type one 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.060
 with knowledge and so on, so is one 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.070
 quite nice feature I think of everything 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.600
 that I have my recipe right here on the 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.340
 level and if I have a lot of cooking and 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.979
 have the possibility in america too 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.610
 It can not be very nice 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.800
 to use that in the kitchen 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.720
 from January I already said the vp 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.830
 99 euros on the road is safe then 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.830
 times 10 20 euros cheaper
