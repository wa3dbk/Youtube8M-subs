the purple but the other one was like a

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.249 
the purple but the other one was like a
light<00:02:04.680> pink<00:02:05.540> so<00:02:06.540> maybe<00:02:06.719> if<00:02:06.869> they<00:02:06.990> come<00:02:07.140> out

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
light pink so maybe if they come out

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.080 
light pink so maybe if they come out
with<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.409> tall<00:02:07.560> black<00:02:07.860> one<00:02:08.190> or<00:02:08.580> something<00:02:08.879> like

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.050 
with a tall black one or something like

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
that maybe we might

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.910 
that maybe we might

which but for now she's happy with

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.699 
which but for now she's happy with
purple<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:13.780> she<00:02:14.020> likes<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.290> fact<00:02:14.440> that<00:02:14.530> it's

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709

different color inside gray and this

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.080 
different color inside gray and this
seems<00:02:17.680> like<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:17.890> inside<00:02:18.340> of<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.550> Smart<00:02:18.849> Cover
