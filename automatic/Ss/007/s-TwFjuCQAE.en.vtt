is<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:31.080> just<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.529> hit<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.070> bladder<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:33.739> pump

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
is is just a hit the bladder and pump

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.500 
is is just a hit the bladder and pump
and<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.730> want<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:35.940> make<00:00:36.000> sure<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.270> hook<00:00:36.360> up

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
and you want to make sure you hook up

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.930 
and you want to make sure you hook up
your<00:00:36.660> drain<00:00:36.960> here<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.500> contain<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.520> something

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
your drain here to contain to something

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.270 
your drain here to contain to something
to<00:00:39.030> catch<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.360> because<00:00:39.600> when<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.809> pump<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.140> up

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
to catch it because when you pump it up

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.040 
to catch it because when you pump it up
eventually<00:00:41.390> initially<00:00:42.390> you're<00:00:42.750> going<00:00:42.989> to

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
eventually initially you're going to

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.299 
eventually initially you're going to
lose<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.200> little<00:00:43.379> bit<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.649> brake<00:00:43.860> fluid<00:00:43.890> out<00:00:44.280> of

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
lose a little bit of brake fluid out of

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.380 
lose a little bit of brake fluid out of
there<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.700> want<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.910> make<00:00:44.940> sure<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.270> got

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
there so you want to make sure you got

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.630 
there so you want to make sure you got
enough<00:00:45.450> break<00:00:46.230> food<00:00:46.500> in<00:00:46.770> their<00:00:47.190> first<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.579> all

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
enough break food in their first of all

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.700 
enough break food in their first of all
and<00:00:47.760> make<00:00:47.879> sure<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.180> can<00:00:48.440> complete<00:00:49.440> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
and make sure you can complete the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.450 
and make sure you can complete the
bleeding<00:00:50.129> process<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:51.500> my<00:00:52.500> camera<00:00:52.920> down<00:00:53.100> here

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
bleeding process so my camera down here

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.610 
bleeding process so my camera down here
and<00:00:55.070> see<00:00:56.090> I'll<00:00:57.090> see<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.600> got<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.260> little<00:00:58.379> thumb

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
and see I'll see you got a little thumb

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.760 
and see I'll see you got a little thumb
screw<00:00:58.949> back<00:00:59.160> here<00:00:59.629> then<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.809> turn<00:01:01.260> one<00:01:01.559> way<00:01:01.590> to

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
screw back here then you turn one way to

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.799 
screw back here then you turn one way to
tighten<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.579> other<00:01:02.699> way<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.879> loosen<00:01:03.270> when<00:01:03.750> you

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
tighten the other way to loosen when you

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.500 
tighten the other way to loosen when you
push<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:04.700> your<00:01:05.700> pumping<00:01:06.030> up<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.299> bladder

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
push it in your pumping up the bladder

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.480 
push it in your pumping up the bladder
when<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.140> pop<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.799> back<00:01:07.830> out<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.310> other<00:01:08.400> way

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
when you pop it back out the other way

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.730 
when you pop it back out the other way
then<00:01:08.700> you're<00:01:08.880> building<00:01:09.270> pressure<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:10.020> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
then you're building pressure in the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.170 
then you're building pressure in the
reservoir<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.460> first<00:01:11.670> thing<00:01:11.760> we'll<00:01:12.000> do

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
reservoir so the first thing we'll do

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.140 
reservoir so the first thing we'll do
here<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.570> well<00:01:12.810> make<00:01:13.439> sure<00:01:13.470> that's<00:01:13.710> tight

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
here is well make sure that's tight

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:24.700 
here is well make sure that's tight
we'll<00:01:15.150> push<00:01:15.360> you're<00:01:15.600> in

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.680 

I'll<00:01:25.280> pump<00:01:25.520> her<00:01:25.670> up<00:01:25.700> and<00:01:25.970> you<00:01:26.060> can<00:01:26.210> see<00:01:26.360> here<00:01:26.570> on

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
I'll pump her up and you can see here on

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.140 
I'll pump her up and you can see here on
got<00:01:27.500> a<00:01:27.530> gauge<00:01:27.799> on<00:01:28.040> the<00:01:28.100> pump<00:01:28.430> here<00:01:28.700> get<00:01:28.940> out<00:01:29.119> of

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
got a gauge on the pump here get out of

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.640 
got a gauge on the pump here get out of
the<00:01:29.330> light<00:01:29.510> and<00:01:30.970> you<00:01:31.970> can<00:01:32.150> see<00:01:32.470> the<00:01:33.470> orange

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
the light and you can see the orange

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.310 
the light and you can see the orange
mark<00:01:33.950> there<00:01:34.190> is<00:01:34.369> for<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:34.760> is<00:01:35.300> where<00:01:36.080> you<00:01:36.200> want

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
the reservoir which reservoir can take

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.410 
the reservoir which reservoir can take
that<00:01:45.740> kind<00:01:45.979> of<00:01:46.040> pressure<00:01:46.250> I<00:01:46.580> gonna<00:01:47.149> blow<00:01:47.390> it

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
that kind of pressure I gonna blow it

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.660 
that kind of pressure I gonna blow it
off<00:01:47.659> the<00:01:47.840> mountain<00:01:47.960> or<00:01:48.350> anything<00:01:48.680> you<00:01:49.430> know<00:01:49.520> we

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.820 
and I got a wrench here on the bleeder
hopefully<00:02:05.600> you<00:02:05.690> can<00:02:05.810> see<00:02:05.990> that<00:02:06.020> now<00:02:06.440> crack<00:02:06.800> a

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
hopefully you can see that now crack a

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.949 
hopefully you can see that now crack a
bleeder<00:02:07.190> open<00:02:07.610> you<00:02:08.269> could<00:02:08.420> hear<00:02:08.600> the<00:02:08.780> air

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
bleeder open you could hear the air

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.940 
bleeder open you could hear the air
escape<00:02:10.989> and<00:02:11.989> we'll<00:02:12.200> see<00:02:12.350> how<00:02:12.410> long<00:02:12.620> and

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
escape and we'll see how long and

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.550 
escape and we'll see how long and
there's<00:02:13.340> our<00:02:13.430> brake<00:02:13.640> fluid<00:02:13.970> already<00:02:14.209> is<00:02:14.840> just

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
there's our brake fluid already is just

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.040 
there's our brake fluid already is just
that<00:02:15.709> fast<00:02:16.010> and<00:02:16.370> she's<00:02:16.970> probably<00:02:17.360> about<00:02:17.810> blood

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
that fast and she's probably about blood

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.949 
that fast and she's probably about blood
oh<00:02:18.080> I<00:02:18.640> don't<00:02:19.640> know<00:02:19.760> hopefully<00:02:20.060> you<00:02:20.630> can<00:02:20.750> see

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
oh I don't know hopefully you can see

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.130 
oh I don't know hopefully you can see
that<00:02:21.170> I<00:02:21.410> know<00:02:22.130> I<00:02:22.670> put<00:02:23.269> this<00:02:23.420> on<00:02:23.630> youtube<00:02:23.780> the

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
that I know I put this on youtube the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.470 
that I know I put this on youtube the
light<00:02:24.319> will<00:02:24.470> kill<00:02:25.000> but<00:02:26.000> that's<00:02:26.209> about<00:02:26.420> all

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
light will kill but that's about all

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.180 
light will kill but that's about all
long<00:02:26.959> as<00:02:27.050> it<00:02:27.170> takes<00:02:27.350> to<00:02:27.530> fill<00:02:27.800> up<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:27.980> brake

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
long as it takes to fill up a brake

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.500 
long as it takes to fill up a brake
caliper<00:02:28.610> when<00:02:28.760> she<00:02:28.880> got<00:02:28.970> pressure<00:02:29.239> on<00:02:29.420> your

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
caliper when she got pressure on your

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.110 
caliper when she got pressure on your
master<00:02:29.690> cylinder<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:30.980> push<00:02:31.160> it<00:02:31.340> flew<00:02:31.549> through

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
master cylinder to push it flew through

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.060 
master cylinder to push it flew through
before<00:02:32.390> I<00:02:32.600> did<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:33.350> video<00:02:33.590> I<00:02:33.650> had<00:02:33.799> to<00:02:33.890> brake

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
before I did the video I had to brake

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
before I did the video I had to brake
hose<00:02:34.340> off<00:02:34.579> over<00:02:34.940> here<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:36.519> drained<00:02:37.519> her<00:02:37.670> out<00:02:37.820> I

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
hose off over here and drained her out I

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.120 
hose off over here and drained her out I
took<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.870> brake<00:02:39.049> hose<00:02:39.200> off<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:39.739> open<00:02:39.829> up<00:02:40.070> the

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
took the brake hose off and open up the

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.910 
took the brake hose off and open up the
bleeder<00:02:40.430> so<00:02:40.700> she'd<00:02:41.000> all<00:02:41.390> run<00:02:41.630> out<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:42.530> that's

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
bleeder so she'd all run out and that's

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.240 
bleeder so she'd all run out and that's
about<00:02:43.040> all<00:02:43.220> I<00:02:43.400> gotta<00:02:43.610> do<00:02:44.380> just<00:02:45.380> do<00:02:45.680> that<00:02:45.860> crack

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
about all I gotta do just do that crack

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.120 
about all I gotta do just do that crack
open<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.850> leader<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:47.570> all<00:02:47.750> comes<00:02:47.989> the<00:02:48.260> brake

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
open the leader and all comes the brake

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.800 
open the leader and all comes the brake
fluid<00:02:49.840> okay<00:02:50.840> got<00:02:51.260> all<00:02:51.410> four<00:02:51.650> wheels<00:02:51.829> to<00:02:52.070> bleed

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
fluid okay got all four wheels to bleed

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.030 
fluid okay got all four wheels to bleed
that's<00:02:53.810> about<00:02:54.019> all<00:02:54.079> it<00:02:54.200> takes<00:02:54.500> we<00:02:54.769> can<00:02:54.920> see

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
that's about all it takes we can see

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.640 
that's about all it takes we can see
here<00:02:55.340> we<00:02:55.940> lost<00:02:56.090> a<00:02:56.329> few<00:02:56.480> pounds<00:02:56.540> on<00:02:57.110> we<00:02:57.500> had

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
here we lost a few pounds on we had

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.500 
here we lost a few pounds on we had
about<00:02:57.829> 18<00:02:58.250> now<00:02:58.430> we're<00:02:58.610> down<00:02:58.760> to<00:02:58.820> about<00:02:59.030> 15

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
about 18 now we're down to about 15

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.440 
about 18 now we're down to about 15
pounds<00:02:59.750> on<00:03:00.079> the<00:03:00.200> pressure<00:03:01.130> bleeder<00:03:01.459> so<00:03:02.269> that's

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
pounds on the pressure bleeder so that's

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:03.729 
pounds on the pressure bleeder so that's
about<00:03:02.570> all<00:03:02.690> it<00:03:02.840> takes<00:03:03.079> i<00:03:03.230> know<00:03:03.350> once<00:03:03.560> you're

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
about all it takes i know once you're

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.580 
about all it takes i know once you're
done<00:03:04.269> just<00:03:05.269> release<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:06.049> pressure<00:03:06.230> line

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
done just release the pressure line

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.800 
done just release the pressure line
release<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:09.799> pressure<00:03:09.950> on<00:03:10.160> the<00:03:10.310> bladder<00:03:10.810> and

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
release the pressure on the bladder and

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.800 
release the pressure on the bladder and
pull<00:03:12.170> her<00:03:12.260> off<00:03:12.320> and<00:03:13.070> that's<00:03:14.030> about<00:03:14.299> how<00:03:14.750> much

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
pull her off and that's about how much

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.920 
pull her off and that's about how much
we<00:03:15.140> lost<00:03:15.320> in<00:03:15.790> out<00:03:16.790> of<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.000> reservoir<00:03:17.359> this

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
we lost in out of the reservoir this

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.880 
we lost in out of the reservoir this
will<00:03:18.109> port<00:03:18.410> here<00:03:18.799> when<00:03:19.670> you<00:03:19.760> pump<00:03:19.910> up<00:03:20.060> your

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
will port here when you pump up your

it's designed to that when you pump up

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.690 
it's designed to that when you pump up
the<00:03:23.480> bladder<00:03:25.239> if<00:03:26.239> you're<00:03:26.540> over<00:03:26.840> Phil<00:03:27.140> if<00:03:27.380> your

pressure testing it'll come up through

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.289 
pressure testing it'll come up through
there<00:03:33.769> and<00:03:33.949> go<00:03:34.310> out<00:03:34.459> through<00:03:34.489> here<00:03:34.910> so<00:03:35.150> if<00:03:35.269> you

there and go out through here so if you
go<00:03:35.449> we<00:03:35.570> will<00:03:35.630> catch

going brake fluid all over the place oh
that's<00:03:40.080> about<00:03:40.319> it
