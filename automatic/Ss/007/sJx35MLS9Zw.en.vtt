00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:14.010
 It is a molecular problem First from the other side of the cloud 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.420
 Originally there are expressions of the clouds 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.730
 The expression from the other side is 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.330
 from 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.450
 behind 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:26.280
 It can be expressed by using this process 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:31.090
 If only from from clouds in a from from clouds 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:36.040
 Only the sun edition is behind you in the cloud 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:37.150
 for the first time from the other side of the cloud of spiders in from behind the clouds 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.090
 Backwards 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.390
 It becomes 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.460
 After it is pointing the light 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:52.530
 The light is coming in liquor motherness when thinking about giving selection and thinking 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:57.270
 Shinozuka Mick This seems to be a predicate verb in the present progressive form 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:01.100
 Just and head of choices and in this way I think that will be left over 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.100
 Then what should I think ? 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:11.620
 Originally light is a guardian ness light 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:15.910
 is coming is the present progressive form and the predicate verb v 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.900
 from behind the clouds is a total adverbial phrase of noun + noun 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.050
 I will 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:23.600
 Now the light is coming out 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:26.710
 Where the spider back is crisp 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:31.330
 I do not make another mistake if it is this word order 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:33.250
 But there's a head and the back is sv 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.180
 I think at that time 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:40.860
 Originally guardian lights and post operative is is upset 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.860
 Bus ride there is here. 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:51.469
 Izu comes out to this person 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.469
 Well risk over necessarily predicate verb is the first to come you can is subject to after the 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.560
 Then there is a light with fair Slight 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.700
 Then what kind of light 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:04.280
 It is coming from di Fine dark lance 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:11.690
 It was light coming from behind the clouds 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:13.400
 Thus, originally the starting point is just the current progress form of the first group, but in English jre s 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.680
 With present participle 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:24.560
 may use the expression what s does 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:29.030
 Since Again present participle of this coming has modified the Kurushima of business card 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:37.319
 What do the expressions do between the business card and the present participle 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:42.890
 Please make sure that the active relationship of the Meiji Era is firmly established 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.890
 Let's listen to the sound of the problem statement that was finally completed 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.940
 Devil's curiosity b is not a car
