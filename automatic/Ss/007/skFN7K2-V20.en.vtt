person's<00:02:12.680> entire<00:02:12.980> genome<00:02:13.489> and<00:02:13.730> sequence<00:02:14.180> it

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
person's entire genome and sequence it

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.080 
person's entire genome and sequence it
and<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:15.530> that<00:02:15.560> only<00:02:15.890> has<00:02:16.099> to<00:02:16.250> be<00:02:16.280> done<00:02:16.489> once<00:02:16.790> in

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
and and that only has to be done once in

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.570 
and and that only has to be done once in
a<00:02:17.540> lifetime<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:18.230> once<00:02:18.739> it's<00:02:18.920> in<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.129> computer

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
a lifetime and once it's in the computer

a lifetime and once it's in the computer
then<00:02:19.730> every<00:02:19.940> time<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.360> doctor<00:02:20.510> goes<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:21.049> that
