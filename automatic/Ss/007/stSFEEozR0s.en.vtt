 in his opinion dreaming Kudriavtsev 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:30.839
 how does it 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:32.149
 using no 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.000
 invested in his repertoire 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.010
 regular season 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.520
 so if you are interested to see 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.260
 as 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.760
 For example, the deputy and as instituted 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.969
 of the turn said traditionally of course 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.210
 researchers creating to 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.870
 make her broken 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:49.860
 it's just 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.080
 vi century live normally 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.330
 but the voice is longer and can be 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.710
 difficulty more 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.910
 lend we will need not yet 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.550
 clear 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.750
 and just calculations to solve your 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.500
 hair and everything basically more 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.790
 do not need anything 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.780
 let's start initially of course 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.430
 can be considered voices that was not there was 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.820
 no halftones 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.740
 determined that 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.260
 there is nothing in it 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.990
 all will not lead 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.590
 ways sco 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.220
 nothing 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.220
 and here it was 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.360
 Russian steel 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.080
 car owner 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.880
 in parallel if they are a little bit not 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.320
 should nothing scary because when first 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.200
 nothing gerasichkin does not affect, so 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.050
 nothing 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.270
 ron hubbard 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.770
 because he first thing does not have to 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.040
 but not going to understand and started 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.630
 play 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.120
 the hosts scored two goals 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.880
 and further 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.110
 all their effective umbrellas 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.000
 just sharing lose 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.730
 it was seen in the example 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:04.770
 in section 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.939
 and starts to lose twist the same 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:07.700
 there are jokes 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.569
 for this quite complex 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.839
 because 

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:13.999
 the company has a small then went out 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:16.999
 to freedom 

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:21.609
 the stronger than the more because 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:24.609
 hold on 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.549
 get to the end 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.299
 in teacher's college 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.499
 and then worry 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:34.279
 the station will receive gifts 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:36.579
 such a program 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.919
 what to write about and in malta according to the program 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:40.959
 because 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.859
 they each floor of Moscow 4 8 if earlier 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:46.179
 this is the second time 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:48.509
 finish and always when straight by 

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:50.659
 did it happen so if the hair 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:52.639
 continues as usual and 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:53.539
 at all 

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:55.229
 like step 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:57.430
 we must do our best to help 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.639
 why not 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.199
 In general, something like when it is possible 

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:03.199
 it turns out 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.249
 confused 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:07.509
 if you color 

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:08.650
 young voices 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.849
 In Sevastopol, we are a little bit twice 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.829
 Ukraine want it important someday 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.169
 more 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:17.259
 so long 

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:19.289
 and not even all the possibilities in order 

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:21.739
 to let you do this often 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:22.429
 so that 

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:24.809
 former US Senate for one side 

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:27.629
 safety and quality 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.309
 south china residents 

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:30.759
 If you 

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:33.389
 percentage will make calculations not over first 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.589
 came up with that just significantly 

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:36.669
 p.i 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:38.039
 and everyone will 

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:40.069
 get hurt 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.559
 thus the matter managed to survive 

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:45.969
 he could have horns 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:47.090
 if 5 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.090
 epidemic 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.059
 but here is what a novel about spectacularly 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:57.439
 there are a few children 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:00.439
 if you want the december 21st to expire 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.949
 and won 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:05.549
 let's say if in graduate school 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.509
 happened again did 

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:09.149
 but for the state 

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:10.829
 well, in the third period 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.519
 I, though very simply the USA, are sure that such 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:14.799
 so on 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.799
 what's with them and ideally sleep long 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.019
 as well as they to us 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.389
 display size we adopt two three 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.449
 minutes no more cleaned up there 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:25.879
 successes and really honest 

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:28.099
 word bedrooms very much because 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:29.620
 unique and i'm very strong 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.469
 it turned out because much 

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:34.189
 they and velvet riot training can 

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.600
 of course 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.630
 Indian such taxes others 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.480
 in the same place with them to play one of them 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.990
 It turns out I had the last day 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.940
 and really give it there was no 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.240
 not a damn thing noted 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.860
 urgency stressed that not 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.099
 changing 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:50.419
 in the opinion no problem so so 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:53.050
 often a lot of grief appears clear divers 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.780
 company data editions natalia and 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.729
 let's see what we get 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.729
 and 

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:04.379
 according to his version 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:11.559
 what is so far is not the limit of cost 

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:14.330
 flight Petrov 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.430
 however, when there is no 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.639
 today number 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:22.639
 ooo bravo 

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:25.270
 correction 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.909
 yes magadan 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:28.389
 but i think he 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:31.389
 paint on the contrary good 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:44.949
 while this is the main star of the team 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:01.039
 according to 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.039
 still young and 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.099
 it's great for us 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:12.240
 in August, Yevgeny Gorbenko Bank 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.119
 never 

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:15.089
 it was important for us for the first time because they 

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:18.050
 that Kharkiv quickly dried fresh aroma 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.389
 I do not know well hope in the future 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:23.360
 because if only that means 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.800
 my case is no place for such a path in 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.580
 I don't like the head at all 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.650
 so everything is business and usually so simple 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:30.400
 little fingers 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.330
 Avramenko come 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.120
 everyone says a little bit and inject 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.949
 that shape but look at that 

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:38.900
 the result of them is very, very relevant 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:39.759
 and 

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:41.379
 I do not know I really like 

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:43.029
 such a way 

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:45.989
 he may not have a suit 

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:48.989
 we want time 

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:52.809
 as reported today in Abakan 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.189
 Vladimir Filatov 

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:56.759
 they visited alexander on 

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:58.899
 distance of about 20 incidents is not ours 

00:06:58.899 --> 00:07:00.319
 tactic to keep 

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:02.919
 and then we are proceeding from real Alexey 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:05.090
 pesegova as out of guilt 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.340
 they say if you believe that the final of the team 

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:11.189
 And this kind of moreover Alexander 

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:13.100
 keep unpretentious recently 

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.990
 arrived in recent years is very nice 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.180
 and supposedly shrink with you today 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.370
 great mood and see 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:21.759
 they are basically me bye
