00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
there's a lot of hydrous and wow I don't

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:02.960 
there's a lot of hydrous and wow I don't
know<00:00:02.040> if<00:00:02.159> he's<00:00:02.250> gonna<00:00:02.340> be<00:00:02.429> able<00:00:02.490> to<00:00:02.639> hold<00:00:02.730> again

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
know if he's gonna be able to hold again

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.690 
know if he's gonna be able to hold again
so<00:00:03.120> even<00:00:03.389> with<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:03.689> speed<00:00:03.899> upgrade<00:00:04.700> although

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
so even with the speed upgrade although

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.490 
so even with the speed upgrade although
the<00:00:05.879> ramp<00:00:06.089> here<00:00:06.330> plus<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.750> cannons<00:00:07.109> may<00:00:07.290> have

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
the ramp here plus the cannons may have

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.680 
the ramp here plus the cannons may have
just<00:00:07.770> saved<00:00:07.950> his<00:00:08.160> hide<00:00:08.370> there<00:00:08.639> for<00:00:09.300> I<00:00:09.330> think<00:00:09.450> I

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
just saved his hide there for I think I

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.410 
just saved his hide there for I think I
think<00:00:10.050> this<00:00:10.170> is<00:00:10.230> on<00:00:10.590> it's<00:00:11.550> early<00:00:11.849> i<00:00:11.880> think<00:00:12.330> i'm

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
think this is on it's early i think i'm

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.640 
think this is on it's early i think i'm
getting<00:00:12.630> into<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.960> habit<00:00:13.019> of<00:00:13.200> calling<00:00:13.410> games

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
getting into the habit of calling games

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.890 
getting into the habit of calling games
early<00:00:13.980> but<00:00:14.130> at<00:00:14.219> this<00:00:14.309> point<00:00:14.549> 8<00:00:14.849> 15<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.450> expanded

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
early but at this point 8 15 is expanded

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.230 
early but at this point 8 15 is expanded
at<00:00:16.080> will<00:00:16.320> he's<00:00:16.920> got<00:00:17.160> what<00:00:17.400> three<00:00:17.430> gas<00:00:17.820> now<00:00:18.060> and

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
at will he's got what three gas now and

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.790 
at will he's got what three gas now and
he's<00:00:18.420> going<00:00:18.449> for<00:00:18.810> lots<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.170> lots<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.380> hydras

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
he's going for lots and lots of hydras

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.830 
he's going for lots and lots of hydras
you<00:00:20.310> know<00:00:20.430> photon<00:00:20.820> cannons<00:00:21.119> pop<00:00:21.300> like<00:00:21.510> nothing

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
you know photon cannons pop like nothing

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.810 
you know photon cannons pop like nothing
against<00:00:22.140> haja<00:00:22.320> lists<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:23.400> bass<00:00:23.640> right

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
against haja lists and that bass right

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.310 
against haja lists and that bass right
there<00:00:23.880> is<00:00:24.240> even<00:00:24.510> though<00:00:24.600> it's<00:00:24.720> evolved<00:00:24.990> on<00:00:25.170> the

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
there is even though it's evolved on the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.960 
there is even though it's evolved on the
ramp<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.710> was<00:00:25.859> getting<00:00:26.070> another<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:26.849> he

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
ramp and I was getting another so he

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.759 
ramp and I was getting another so he
might<00:00:27.090> be<00:00:27.240> going<00:00:27.330> for<00:00:27.539> higher<00:00:27.840> attack<00:00:28.109> but<00:00:28.740> I

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
might be going for higher attack but I

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.019 
might be going for higher attack but I
think<00:00:28.980> he's<00:00:29.070> just<00:00:29.130> gonna<00:00:29.250> be<00:00:29.429> able<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.609> go<00:00:29.730> over

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
think he's just gonna be able to go over

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.490 
think he's just gonna be able to go over
with<00:00:30.150> hydro<00:00:30.480> Stephen<00:00:30.869> he<00:00:30.960> doesn't<00:00:31.199> even<00:00:31.260> need

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
with hydro Stephen he doesn't even need

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.560 
with hydro Stephen he doesn't even need
higher<00:00:31.980> tech<00:00:32.250> yeah<00:00:32.940> I<00:00:32.969> would<00:00:33.180> agree<00:00:33.270> he's

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
higher tech yeah I would agree he's

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.790 
higher tech yeah I would agree he's
definitely<00:00:33.930> in<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.050> lead<00:00:34.170> however<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.649> think

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
definitely in the lead however I think

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.830 
definitely in the lead however I think
if<00:00:34.980> he<00:00:35.100> doesn't<00:00:35.430> go<00:00:35.520> up<00:00:35.730> if<00:00:36.180> he<00:00:36.239> doesn't<00:00:36.570> go<00:00:36.690> in

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
if he doesn't go up if he doesn't go in

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.510 
if he doesn't go up if he doesn't go in
the<00:00:36.930> offense<00:00:37.410> um<00:00:37.890> she<00:00:38.040> could<00:00:38.250> come<00:00:38.399> back

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
the offense um she could come back

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.430 
the offense um she could come back
fairly<00:00:39.300> easily<00:00:39.540> because<00:00:39.899> he<00:00:40.020> is<00:00:40.140> getting<00:00:40.379> a

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
fairly easily because he is getting a

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.869 
fairly easily because he is getting a
second<00:00:40.710> expansion<00:00:40.950> this<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.460> problem<00:00:41.700> i<00:00:41.850> see

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
second expansion this is a problem i see

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.110 
second expansion this is a problem i see
a<00:00:42.030> lot<00:00:42.300> from<00:00:42.510> from<00:00:43.500> mediocre<00:00:44.040> Zerg<00:00:44.520> players<00:00:44.850> is

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
a lot from from mediocre Zerg players is

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.250 
a lot from from mediocre Zerg players is
that<00:00:45.270> they're<00:00:45.450> very<00:00:45.690> good<00:00:45.750> at<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.079> build

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
that they're very good at the build

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.690 
that they're very good at the build
warriors<00:00:46.559> they're<00:00:46.739> very<00:00:46.950> good<00:00:47.190> with<00:00:47.309> macro

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
warriors they're very good with macro

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.979 
warriors they're very good with macro
but<00:00:47.879> they<00:00:47.940> just<00:00:48.059> don't<00:00:48.270> have<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.420> game<00:00:48.600> plan<00:00:48.629> for

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
but they just don't have a game plan for

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.479 
but they just don't have a game plan for
winning<00:00:49.140> they're<00:00:49.680> just<00:00:49.710> basically<00:00:50.219> waiting

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
winning they're just basically waiting

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.160 
winning they're just basically waiting
for<00:00:50.730> their<00:00:50.820> opponent<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.329> lose<00:00:51.539> for<00:00:51.870> them<00:00:51.989> I

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
for their opponent to lose for them I

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.900 
for their opponent to lose for them I
think<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.739> was<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.860> problem<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.340> 0<00:00:53.670> had

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
think that was a problem that 0 had

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.910 
think that was a problem that 0 had
against<00:00:54.149> flash<00:00:54.420> going<00:00:55.379> back<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.680> game<00:00:55.890> a

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
against flash going back to that game a

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.950 
against flash going back to that game a
little<00:00:56.100> bit<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.430> think<00:00:56.910> euros<00:00:57.300> problem<00:00:57.750> again

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
little bit I think euros problem again

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.900

probes<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.490> wish<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.700> lurker<00:01:54.000> was<00:01:54.119> there<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.299> stop

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
probes I wish a lurker was there a stop

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.959 
probes I wish a lurker was there a stop
position<00:01:55.079> lurker<00:01:55.380> was<00:01:55.530> there<00:01:55.759> because<00:01:56.759> I

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
position lurker was there because I

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.410 
position lurker was there because I
think<00:01:57.149> I'm<00:01:57.270> she's<00:01:57.420> gonna<00:01:57.540> lose<00:01:57.780> so

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
and now spotting this new expansion at

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.350 
and now spotting this new expansion at
the<00:02:04.070> center<00:02:05.070> left<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.430> guess<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.820> what<00:02:05.850> i<00:02:06.090> call

as quickly as possible while building as
many<00:03:06.060> cannons<00:03:06.420> as<00:03:06.540> possible<00:03:06.989> and<00:03:07.530> I<00:03:07.590> don't

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
many cannons as possible and I don't

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.440 
many cannons as possible and I don't
think<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.430> don't<00:03:08.850> think<00:03:08.970> it's<00:03:09.060> gonna<00:03:09.150> work<00:03:09.209> can

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
think I don't think it's gonna work can

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.819 
think I don't think it's gonna work can
you<00:03:09.480> get<00:03:09.660> some<00:03:09.810> solid<00:03:10.109> storms<00:03:10.470> though<00:03:10.560> I<00:03:10.590> mean

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
you get some solid storms though I mean

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.050 
you get some solid storms though I mean
you<00:03:10.890> made<00:03:11.040> me<00:03:11.160> think<00:03:11.280> of<00:03:11.400> counter-strike<00:03:11.910> with

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
you made me think of counter-strike with

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.610 
you made me think of counter-strike with
the<00:03:12.150> AWP<00:03:12.690> where<00:03:12.900> you<00:03:13.049> got<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.260> leave<00:03:13.470> your

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
the AWP where you got to leave your

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.380 
the AWP where you got to leave your
targets<00:03:14.010> he<00:03:14.340> led<00:03:14.549> those<00:03:14.670> agile<00:03:15.000> as<00:03:15.060> well<00:03:15.269> and

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
targets he led those agile as well and

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.849 
targets he led those agile as well and
now<00:03:15.480> you<00:03:15.540> see<00:03:15.720> is<00:03:15.780> he<00:03:16.079> coming<00:03:16.380> up<00:03:16.440> for<00:03:16.560> him<00:03:16.650> I'm

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
now you see is he coming up for him I'm

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.590 
now you see is he coming up for him I'm
not<00:03:17.430> sure<00:03:17.640> what<00:03:17.820> he's<00:03:18.030> going<00:03:18.269> to<00:03:18.329> the<00:03:18.480> new

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
not sure what he's going to the new

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.970 
not sure what he's going to the new
expansion<00:03:18.900> of<00:03:19.200> course<00:03:19.410> because<00:03:19.650> obviously

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
expansion of course because obviously

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.830 
expansion of course because obviously
it's<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.489> least<00:03:20.609> a<00:03:20.790> straight<00:03:21.030> expansion<00:03:21.570> ever

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
it's the least a straight expansion ever

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.380 
it's the least a straight expansion ever
see<00:03:22.230> a<00:03:22.260> chance<00:03:22.500> of<00:03:22.709> 8<00:03:23.130> 15<00:03:23.609> s<00:03:23.700> reaction<00:03:23.850> time

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
see a chance of 8 15 s reaction time

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.479 
see a chance of 8 15 s reaction time
here<00:03:24.630> I<00:03:24.660> agree<00:03:25.200> about<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.440> ada<00:03:25.620> APA<00:03:25.829> analogy

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
here I agree about the ada APA analogy

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.699 
here I agree about the ada APA analogy
and<00:03:26.640> he<00:03:27.030> has<00:03:27.150> responded<00:03:27.540> he<00:03:28.200> definitely<00:03:28.440> sees

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
and he has responded he definitely sees

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.410 
and he has responded he definitely sees
it<00:03:28.799> but<00:03:28.829> it's<00:03:29.010> a<00:03:29.070> little<00:03:29.370> bit<00:03:29.519> late<00:03:29.670> now<00:03:29.700> you

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
it but it's a little bit late now you

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.940 
it but it's a little bit late now you
need<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.660> build<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:30.989> movement<00:03:31.590> Overlord

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
need to build that movement Overlord

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.860 
need to build that movement Overlord
there<00:03:32.130> to<00:03:32.310> make<00:03:32.790> sure<00:03:32.850> that<00:03:33.120> expansion<00:03:33.570> gets

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
there to make sure that expansion gets

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.000 
there to make sure that expansion gets
saved<00:03:34.079> ok<00:03:34.530> oh<00:03:34.910> and<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.030> doom<00:03:36.269> drop<00:03:36.570> wow<00:03:37.320> you

hydras down meanwhile though an attack

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.130 
hydras down meanwhile though an attack
coming<00:03:47.370> in<00:03:47.579> his<00:03:47.700> frontier<00:03:48.120> so<00:03:48.510> I<00:03:48.540> grab<00:03:48.930> sheet

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
coming in his frontier so I grab sheet

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.410 
coming in his frontier so I grab sheet
going<00:03:49.380> all<00:03:49.560> in<00:03:49.590> here<00:03:49.950> he's<00:03:50.220> a<00:03:50.250> basically<00:03:51.120> lose

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
going all in here he's a basically lose

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.789 
going all in here he's a basically lose
a<00:03:51.540> lot<00:03:51.810> of<00:03:51.840> stuff<00:03:52.079> in<00:03:52.109> his<00:03:52.290> made<00:03:52.470> basically

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
a lot of stuff in his made basically

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.819 
a lot of stuff in his made basically
going<00:03:53.040> to<00:03:53.160> lose<00:03:53.310> now<00:03:53.549> uh<00:03:54.109> what<00:03:55.109> depends<00:03:55.440> events

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
going to lose now uh what depends events

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.349 
going to lose now uh what depends events
is<00:03:55.920> a<00:03:55.950> breakthrough<00:03:56.220> he<00:03:56.760> is<00:03:56.850> managing<00:03:57.209> that

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
is a breakthrough he is managing that

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.030 
is a breakthrough he is managing that
gets<00:03:57.540> do<00:03:58.170> some<00:03:58.410> damage<00:03:58.560> to<00:03:58.739> his<00:03:58.920> natural

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
gets do some damage to his natural

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.069 
gets do some damage to his natural
expansion<00:03:59.430> but<00:03:59.730> more<00:04:00.329> lurkers<00:04:00.600> coming<00:04:00.989> out

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
expansion but more lurkers coming out

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.890 
expansion but more lurkers coming out
here<00:04:01.260> for<00:04:01.489> 815<00:04:02.489> yeah<00:04:03.150> I<00:04:03.269> think<00:04:03.480> once<00:04:03.810> she

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
here for 815 yeah I think once she

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.569 
here for 815 yeah I think once she
definitely<00:04:04.230> this<00:04:04.440> is<00:04:04.560> a<00:04:04.590> very<00:04:04.980> strong<00:04:05.250> attack

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
definitely this is a very strong attack

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:06.740 
definitely this is a very strong attack
but<00:04:05.819> I<00:04:05.850> think<00:04:06.150> there's<00:04:06.329> just<00:04:06.450> too<00:04:06.630> many

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
but I think there's just too many

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.930 
but I think there's just too many
hatcheries<00:04:07.260> and<00:04:07.260> units<00:04:07.950> coming<00:04:08.220> in<00:04:08.430> an<00:04:08.549> intake

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
hatcheries and units coming in an intake

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.940 
hatcheries and units coming in an intake
of<00:04:09.150> mineral<00:04:09.569> and<00:04:09.720> gas<00:04:10.140> for

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
of mineral and gas for

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.160 
of mineral and gas for
815<00:04:12.819> at<00:04:12.940> this<00:04:13.030> point<00:04:13.270> yeah<00:04:13.480> he's<00:04:13.660> running

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
815 at this point yeah he's running

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.920 
815 at this point yeah he's running
visited<00:04:14.650> and<00:04:15.069> grim<00:04:15.730> she<00:04:15.910> retreating<00:04:16.630> a<00:04:16.720> little

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
visited and grim she retreating a little

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.569 
visited and grim she retreating a little
bit<00:04:17.049> now<00:04:17.169> he<00:04:17.709> might<00:04:17.859> be<00:04:18.010> able<00:04:18.070> pick<00:04:18.280> off<00:04:18.430> this

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
bit now he might be able pick off this

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.520 
bit now he might be able pick off this
hatchery<00:04:18.790> though<00:04:19.090> uh<00:04:19.570> but<00:04:19.840> he<00:04:20.049> oh<00:04:20.079> wow<00:04:20.290> he's

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
hatchery though uh but he oh wow he's

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.320 
hatchery though uh but he oh wow he's
gonna<00:04:20.650> lose<00:04:20.769> his<00:04:20.829> mean<00:04:21.130> Nexus<00:04:21.489> actly<00:04:21.760> yeah<00:04:22.060> he

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
gonna lose his mean Nexus actly yeah he

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.840 
gonna lose his mean Nexus actly yeah he
had<00:04:22.419> nothing<00:04:22.630> back<00:04:22.990> yet<00:04:23.020> no<00:04:23.350> or<00:04:23.500> me<00:04:23.740> yeah<00:04:24.490> this

space trade definitely 815 is is gonna

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.270 
space trade definitely 815 is is gonna
be<00:04:27.639> happy<00:04:27.940> trading<00:04:28.150> here<00:04:28.419> I<00:04:29.010> think<00:04:30.010> it's<00:04:30.160> not

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
be happy trading here I think it's not

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.860 
be happy trading here I think it's not
really<00:04:30.520> a<00:04:30.550> base<00:04:30.729> for<00:04:30.910> dat<00:04:31.090> mean<00:04:31.210> basically<00:04:31.450> you

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
really a base for dat mean basically you

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.090 
really a base for dat mean basically you
should<00:04:32.020> have<00:04:32.110> gone<00:04:32.200> for<00:04:32.380> the<00:04:32.500> temple<00:04:32.800> archives

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
should have gone for the temple archives

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.400 
should have gone for the temple archives
at<00:04:33.370> least<00:04:33.580> but<00:04:34.120> out<00:04:34.240> he<00:04:34.360> didn't<00:04:34.690> yeah<00:04:35.229> I<00:04:35.260> mean

that's unfortunate because we could have

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.950 
that's unfortunate because we could have
built<00:05:03.580> so<00:05:03.850> many<00:05:03.940> more<00:05:04.150> three<00:05:04.389> blocks<00:05:04.630> for<00:05:04.870> the

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
the look especially with that little

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.580 
the look especially with that little
bush<00:05:31.030> between<00:05:31.479> that<00:05:31.630> little<00:05:31.840> invincible<00:05:32.350> bush

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
bush between that little invincible bush

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.830 
bush between that little invincible bush
between<00:05:33.010> the<00:05:33.160> workers<00:05:33.700> and<00:05:33.850> the<00:05:33.940> UH<00:05:34.479> the

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
between the workers and the UH the

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.010 
between the workers and the UH the
mineral<00:05:35.229> there<00:05:35.789> yeah<00:05:36.789> I<00:05:37.000> think<00:05:37.120> basically

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
mineral there yeah I think basically

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.230 
mineral there yeah I think basically
what<00:05:38.560> a<00:05:38.770> 50<00:05:39.250> needs<00:05:39.430> to<00:05:39.520> do<00:05:39.639> is<00:05:39.760> follow<00:05:39.910> this<00:05:40.120> up

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
what a 50 needs to do is follow this up

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.520 
what a 50 needs to do is follow this up
with<00:05:40.300> another<00:05:40.630> big<00:05:40.840> attack<00:05:41.110> and<00:05:41.320> I<00:05:41.350> think

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
with another big attack and I think

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.170 
with another big attack and I think
you'll<00:05:41.620> have<00:05:41.770> your<00:05:41.889> gone<00:05:42.130> yeah<00:05:42.490> your<00:05:42.729> drop
