8-inch<00:00:20.849> mower<00:00:21.329> rims<00:00:21.689> for<00:00:22.020> now<00:00:22.110> anyways

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
8-inch mower rims for now anyways

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.769 
8-inch mower rims for now anyways
they're<00:00:25.050> not<00:00:25.340> bad<00:00:26.340> but<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.119> think<00:00:27.360> I<00:00:27.480> want<00:00:27.720> to

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
they're not bad but I think I want to

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.280 
they're not bad but I think I want to
find<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.200> slightly<00:00:28.559> wider<00:00:29.300> lower<00:00:30.300> rim<00:00:30.720> just<00:00:31.110> a

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:31.290 
find a slightly wider lower rim just a

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.170 
find a slightly wider lower rim just a
slightly<00:00:31.619> wider<00:00:31.980> rim<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.550> can<00:00:32.700> stretch<00:00:32.940> the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
slightly wider rim so I can stretch the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.360 
slightly wider rim so I can stretch the
tire<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.630> just<00:00:33.899> have<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.079> little<00:00:34.350> bit<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.739> little

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
tire and just have a little bit a little

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.030 
tire and just have a little bit a little
bit<00:00:35.550> less<00:00:35.880> sidewall<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:37.020> profile<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.560> not<00:00:37.710> bad

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
bit less sidewall the profile is not bad

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.620 
bit less sidewall the profile is not bad
but<00:00:38.310> I<00:00:38.340> think<00:00:38.400> I<00:00:38.700> can<00:00:38.880> do<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> little<00:00:39.240> bit<00:00:39.450> better

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:39.630 
but I think I can do a little bit better

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
but I think I can do a little bit better
I'll<00:00:40.590> have<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.890> see<00:00:41.070> when<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.280> time<00:00:41.460> comes

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
I'll have to see when the time comes

wheel<00:00:49.350> which<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.860> better<00:00:50.070> anyways<00:00:50.630> um<00:00:51.630> hi

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 
wheel which is better anyways um hi

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.220 
wheel which is better anyways um hi
tikka<00:00:53.060> now<00:00:54.060> the<00:00:54.600> other<00:00:54.720> thing<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.050> have<00:00:55.140> been

tikka now the other thing that have been
messing<00:00:55.530> with<00:00:55.560> is<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.489> front<00:00:56.730> wheels<00:00:57.020> it's

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
messing with is the front wheels it's

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
messing with is the front wheels it's
kind<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.230> thinking<00:00:58.470> about<00:00:58.560> something<00:00:58.890> tall

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
kind of thinking about something tall

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.510 
kind of thinking about something tall
and<00:00:59.220> skinny<00:00:59.460> for<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.730> front<00:01:00.649> so<00:01:01.649> again<00:01:02.220> mocked

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
and skinny for the front so again mocked

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.260 
and skinny for the front so again mocked
up<00:01:03.049> what<00:01:04.049> we<00:01:04.170> have<00:01:04.379> here<00:01:04.649> are<00:01:04.799> some<00:01:04.860> 480<00:01:05.519> by<00:01:05.820> 800

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
up what we have here are some 480 by 800

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.770 
up what we have here are some 480 by 800
I'll<00:01:07.040> utility<00:01:08.040> trailer<00:01:08.580> tires<00:01:09.000> well<00:01:09.390> one

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
I'll utility trailer tires well one

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.380 
I'll utility trailer tires well one
anyways<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.530> did<00:01:10.740> for<00:01:10.920> mock<00:01:11.100> up<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.550> it<00:01:12.270> is

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
anyways that I did for mock up and it is

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.990 
anyways that I did for mock up and it is
mounted<00:01:12.840> for<00:01:13.620> the<00:01:13.710> moment<00:01:14.070> on<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.310> wheelbarrow

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
mounted for the moment on a wheelbarrow

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.690 
mounted for the moment on a wheelbarrow
rim<00:01:15.500> now<00:01:16.500> I've<00:01:16.770> got<00:01:17.040> some<00:01:17.250> better<00:01:17.430> wheel

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
rim now I've got some better wheel

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.300 
rim now I've got some better wheel
barrow<00:01:18.000> rims<00:01:18.300> that<00:01:18.750> have<00:01:19.260> a<00:01:19.290> larger<00:01:19.770> bore<00:01:20.010> and

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
barrow rims that have a larger bore and

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.820 
barrow rims that have a larger bore and
high<00:01:20.850> speed<00:01:21.150> bearings<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:22.290> if<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.470> decide<00:01:22.799> I

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
high speed bearings so if I decide I

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.800 
high speed bearings so if I decide I
like<00:01:23.130> these<00:01:23.280> idea<00:01:23.640> I'll<00:01:23.850> actually<00:01:24.090> use<00:01:24.330> those

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
like these idea I'll actually use those

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.980 
like these idea I'll actually use those
but<00:01:25.500> for<00:01:25.830> now<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.729> was<00:01:27.299> just<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.630> quick<00:01:27.810> little

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
but for now it was just a quick little

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.020 
but for now it was just a quick little
grab<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.890> rim<00:01:29.070> grab<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.460> tires<00:01:29.670> throw<00:01:29.909> them

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
grab the rim grab the tires throw them

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.780 
grab the rim grab the tires throw them
together<00:01:30.120> see<00:01:30.450> what<00:01:30.570> happens<00:01:31.010> so<00:01:32.010> together

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
together see what happens so together

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.399 
together see what happens so together
hang<00:01:33.510> on<00:01:33.630> let<00:01:33.780> me<00:01:33.810> just<00:01:33.869> straighten<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.350> out

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
hang on let me just straighten that out

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.940 
hang on let me just straighten that out
a<00:01:34.530> little<00:01:34.680> bit<00:01:36.590> doesn't<00:01:37.590> want<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.770> stay

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
a little bit doesn't want to stay

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.789 
a little bit doesn't want to stay
together<00:01:39.500> they<00:01:40.500> don't<00:01:40.680> look<00:01:40.770> too<00:01:40.830> bad

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
together they don't look too bad

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.830 
together they don't look too bad
ultimately<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:45.030> trailer<00:01:45.299> tires<00:01:45.600> are<00:01:45.810> a

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
ultimately the trailer tires are a

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.539 
ultimately the trailer tires are a
little<00:01:46.020> bit<00:01:46.200> taller<00:01:46.470> than<00:01:46.650> the<00:01:46.920> racing<00:01:47.280> slicks

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
little bit taller than the racing slicks

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.030 
little bit taller than the racing slicks
and<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.630> don't<00:01:48.900> necessarily<00:01:49.170> have<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.950> problem

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
and I don't necessarily have a problem

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.580 
and I don't necessarily have a problem
with<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.850> I'm<00:01:51.110> still<00:01:52.110> playing<00:01:52.350> with<00:01:52.409> all

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
with that I'm still playing with all

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.990 
with that I'm still playing with all
concepts<00:01:53.130> still<00:01:53.310> trying<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.549> figure<00:01:53.700> out<00:01:53.880> what

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
concepts still trying to figure out what

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.080 
concepts still trying to figure out what
I<00:01:54.030> wanted<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.450> do<00:01:55.189> the<00:01:56.189> wheelbarrow<00:01:56.729> tires

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
I wanted to do the wheelbarrow tires

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.320 
I wanted to do the wheelbarrow tires
themselves<00:01:57.360> didn't<00:01:57.930> look<00:01:58.110> too<00:01:58.290> bad<00:01:58.320> but

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
themselves didn't look too bad but

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.850 
themselves didn't look too bad but
wheelbarrow<00:02:00.330> tires<00:02:00.600> are<00:02:00.810> crap<00:02:01.259> let's<00:02:01.650> face<00:02:01.830> it

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
wheelbarrow tires are crap let's face it

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.820 
wheelbarrow tires are crap let's face it
so<00:02:02.850> I'm<00:02:03.090> not<00:02:03.330> gonna<00:02:03.600> use<00:02:03.780> those<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.320> I<00:02:04.409> still

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
so I'm not gonna use those and I still

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.730 
so I'm not gonna use those and I still
am<00:02:05.130> gonna<00:02:05.310> play<00:02:05.520> with<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.820> stance<00:02:06.170> so<00:02:07.170> don't

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740
