00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.879
 only through stem one sees at one 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.839
 autumn walk in the 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.050
 County Passau 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.960
 Here is the cradle of corn cultivation reads 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.710
 one on the posters at the edges of the field 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.109
 that sounds exciting 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.150
 but why is the corn not long ago ? 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.939
 harvested why the farmers let 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.720
 dry up and become dry or is it 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.180
 once again a new disease 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.460
 no, the corn must now be through 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.689
 the plants are healthy and the pistons 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.480
 splendidly guessed 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.700
 now belongs to the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.250
 Mai is mature was just middle 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.399
 is october and around this time is the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.570
 corn rice why did he have that is now the 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.940
 swiveling shrinks 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.239
 There are different varieties there 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.430
 then hard white and proportion and this is 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.949
 random then usually that's why 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.760
 So on the horse days very similar 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:00.750
 sees the number that shows that the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.699
 grains are right drive 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.189
 remain so-called hard masters against 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.229
 the grains in april worldwide are available 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.670
 not just two but hundreds of 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.979
 different corn variations in october 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.049
 the harvest is in full swing 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:21.030
 is bitten with a so-called corn 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:23.100
 introduced on the normal combine harvester 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.159
 the corn was in this country because he as 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.049
 particularly effective field crop applies after 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.340
 In the war there were workers in the 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.009
 agriculture shortage 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.630
 a professor from Weihenstephan and one 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.610
 land economic advisor from landshut 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.070
 therefore have to work 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.630
 looking for a saving alternative and doing so 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.570
 invented the bullmast 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.290
 so the corn can be used as feed source 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.170
 Bayern have tried the inventor 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.479
 the new culture in the red valley because of the 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.659
 optimal climates for example on the 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.969
 courts speak 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.579
 Those were still times there was none 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:00.969
 suitable varieties no experience and 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:06.310
 no matching technique it was difficult 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:10.149
 we have this hamadi sio 65 we have 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:15.040
 only a first june see child wise 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:17.280
 limited and december prevails east and 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.510
 it has it fast 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.450
 coffee machine or body tables 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.420
 seeder had kim at the easy and 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.030
 two charter flight back request thanks 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.549
 hangs then have a furrow pulled like that 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.400
 end of may and then we have in the 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:36.400
 surface by hand hammer then but the 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.620
 usually the corn harvest sprinkled into the 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.019
 The 60s lasted many weeks 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.849
 until the winter but the harvest 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:46.109
 were good and most of the place 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:51.359
 Halver is not only in demand as animal feed 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:55.620
 the hardt corn is predominantly for the 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:58.720
 Mills industry for the crisis 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.500
 yield is the ideal 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:06.250
 The Rottal corn is from the sun 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:08.600
 spoiled say the mill rows and and 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.230
 they are especially sought after 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.660
 the great boom came in 1969 with the 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.820
 Construction in the drying plant for the 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.390
 Corn kernels from the field are not without them 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.760
 durable 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.220
 with the drying then became the gold 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:27.050
 the rottal he brought the farmers in 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:29.570
 prosperity 2012 was the quality 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:33.500
 Excellent with a sample is the 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:36.710
 humidity of the cologne determines 24 to 25 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.730
 percent water content that sounds high 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.400
 but a top value 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:44.180
 It used to be mostly 50 percent water 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:46.520
 harvested through intensive breeding work 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.760
 in the last decades are varieties 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.890
 they were created almost everywhere in bavaria 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.870
 to mature in good time a good grain 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.220
 yield and low 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.220
 bring moisture content 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.060
 after drying, the cows have only 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.160
 still a residual moisture of a maximum of 13 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.490
 percent and then several years 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.560
 storable around 90,000 tonnes of grain maize 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.630
 from the drying cooperative in 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.550
 reading is going on all over the world 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.980
 starch production for the tablets 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.989
 manufacture of textiles as animal feed 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.260
 and as a basis for the 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:25.900
 Food industry over 50 years corn 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.900
 in bavaria so far a success story
