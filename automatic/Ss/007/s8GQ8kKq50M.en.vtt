00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.049
 and my sister was very careful to polish the 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.000
 and this is arranged very easy 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.480
 Y 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.480
 what I did 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:24.520
 and hope to give it a second if you do not 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:26.230
 You dare to touch her but even if you already 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.670
 you got angry 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.670
 of course yes 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.970
 today 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:50.969
 but I can not believe it for you 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.489
 the last thing I want is to listen to their 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.489
 claims very seriously and that's how it is 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:02.129
 and how long without seeing anything 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.710
 what's wrong with you why so sad 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.070
 tell us you had an argument with your 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.070
 girlfriend 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:17.520
 that you speak seriously if this is very 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.110
 delicate I see is the rebellious boyfriend you 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.880
 cheat again with that woman then yes 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.850
 but because of the situation it's something 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.530
 inevitable wait if I walk with you 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.700
 two means that you have not decided yet 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.700
 with whom to stay 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.320
 decide with whom of the twelve what 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.790
 I know very well that there are many people 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:47.240
 because I want but it was my decision 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:50.140
 I want to continue by his side and I thought 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.260
 that over time things would change 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.360
 as long as you do not decide it's fine but if 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.770
 prefers more to one face to another then 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.900
 if it will be a tragedy 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.340
 you mean you have plates of 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:05.179
 first and second table 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.640
 now I understand explain us well ahome you 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:12.680
 you should know how is the situation between 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:15.319
 you two is true then you will see if 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.310
 I analyze things well I think I am 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.310
 the second table plate 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.939
 Being a second table dish is not about 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.609
 of something serious and say that sometimes 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:31.099
 they happen to be the most appetizing you know 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:33.909
 by the type of seasoning but the first 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.909
 It is always the best 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.099
 although the pitcher gives more importance 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.080
 the catcher is also fundamental 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:51.190
 posters of a work are also 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:53.080
 essential is true but hey do not you think 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.130
 that it is best that they be separated by a 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.130
 time to where 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.100
 that option seems reasonable to me that's 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.020
 impossible 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.430
 has the nerve to follow me to my 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:11.719
 house as it happened today in the morning 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.719
 and still in your house 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.060
 very well 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.260
 look, I brought you this for quick opens 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:38.080
 you can fix that I think 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.030
 jaume told me that this was the replacement 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.120
 the other carriage is steel 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:47.020
 broke during the trip if our 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.990
 neighbor gave it to us so sorry 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:52.510
 a lot I did not want to break it down but you're going 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.700
 to fix the certain 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.629
 yes 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.629
 I wish you luck 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.189
 do not 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:14.049
 Y 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.049
 The first thing I have to do is 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:23.410
 this thing died not 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.020
 that does not want to be fixed 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.770
 you 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:32.449
 and now that you let me know you want me 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.449
 let go and you want to fight 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.669
 let's see what you think about this steel claws 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.220
 I will not let me win artifact 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.479
 two wheels do not think you're going to make fun 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.479
 of my damn 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:56.499
 I wonder how is that rebellious boy 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:59.319
 violent and unfaithful and I'm dying to meet him 

00:04:56.499 --> 00:05:00.990
 I can not believe they are following me 

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:03.990
 I told them it would not be worth it 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.990
 know him 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.890
 hear that you do not have to attend your 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.840
 classes I think it's waste of time you 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:16.140
 do not worry this is more important 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.750
 what else we have to tell you 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.460
 that does not make you suffer so much ahome not for 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.490
 please if they tell you that it will be like 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.380
 crazy like crazy what a man so 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.010
 detestable that's why we should 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.010
 to intervene 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:33.390
 I can not let you know me anymore 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.550
 it's about a man half beast and if 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:39.610
 they discover it will go very badly but that 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:42.610
 I say he is the one that causes all this 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:45.099
 today he earns a month he has worried again not 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:48.099
 do you think that you spoke of more thirst and that 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:50.469
 they think I was at fault, I think what 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:52.240
 we did feel bad it 's true but 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:55.090
 after all she was the one who 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:59.639
 interested in that boy do not believe as his 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.639

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:08.780
 we will always be on your side ahome 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:12.310
 no matter how aggressive is not 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.310
 it matters how unfaithful to be 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:15.989
 well I 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.630
 others 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:29.220
 and cheerful dog's ear 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:32.460
 after the steel carriage because it is 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:36.450
 worse than in the morning 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:40.639

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:43.729

 you were talking to me 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:55.420
 if it is that this is a diamond ring 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.420
 with it you can buy many bicycles 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:01.940
 neglect I will take care with this sword 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:08.020

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:08.020
 you can seriously make them look good 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.870
 diamond spears 

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:35.830
 but it can not continue to destroy the 

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:39.600
 you are no longer bothering 

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:39.600
