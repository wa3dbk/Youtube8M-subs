almost<00:02:02.610> brand-new<00:02:03.030> on<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.330> bottom<00:02:03.890> but<00:02:04.890> what

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
almost brand-new on the bottom but what

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.419 
almost brand-new on the bottom but what
you<00:02:05.130> do<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:06.410> you<00:02:07.410> clean<00:02:07.650> it<00:02:07.830> off<00:02:07.920> first<00:02:08.130> off<00:02:08.340> I
