00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.640
 they have to do is buy the newspaper 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:37.190

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.649
 smart force and also remember that the 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.600
 prices and rates change as well as 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.690
 It also changes the value of coupons 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:54.050
 the value of the coupons does not come 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.969
 same in all tasks so for 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.059
 all the new ones that you have no idea of 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.670
 how to buy here in civilians the first thing 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:06.320
 what you have to do is request a 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:09.380
 civilians card there in the store with 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.830
 the cashier they give it to him and he does not have to 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.440
 buy anything to ask for a card 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.630
 after you have your card already 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.390
 You can do your shopping for 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.930
 so you can get the savings 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.149
 and offers that although it has and 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.159
 also already with time you are going to 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.939
 scan your card in the red machine 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.649
 to give you coupons and you can 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:38.030
 combine with manufacturing coupons 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:40.970
 that come in the newspaper so here 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.880
 you can buy what you like what 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.810
 need no problem you do not have 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.549
 to do many transactions or not 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.860
 you have to make a few transactions 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.229
 because you are starting you can 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.580
 make the purchases that you want a 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:00.590
 transaction is a purchase when we say 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.929
 a the first transaction is a purchase 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.869
 when we say second transaction is the 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.909
 Second purchase you can make two or 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.030
 three or four five or six transactions 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.910
 here in civilians on the same day in a 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.600
 same moment there is no problem always and 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.360
 when you have well 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.290
 planned their transactions that is going to be 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.970
 here in civilians so take note in 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.340
 this week we are going to do two 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.400
 transactions so that you are not 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.830
 complicate and it is much easier to learn 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.900
 to compose here on sib and that's how I take 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.790
 note of the first transaction that we're going 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.950
 to do 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.920
 in our first transaction we are going to 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.280
 buy these products or these 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.560
 medicines exceeding these are in the 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.530
 purchase of 20 return 10 dollars 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.739
 you can buy what you like if 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.470
 you believe that this needs it or not 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.750
 I bought it but if you want to buy and 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.200
 start composing you can buy 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:07.310
 these and what you have to buy are 4 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.019
 because they are each well 499 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.439
 that they have to buy 4 is going to be a 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:15.019
 1996 total here is missing 4 cents 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:17.750
 for the 20 dollars but here in civilians 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:20.210
 no problem when you are missing 5 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.870
 cents 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:26.960
 down for example a penny two or 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.240
 three or four or five still come out 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.690
 his is ten dollars civil but if you 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:36.650
 six cents left up then 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.450
 it does not come out let's say six seven eight already 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.270
 he does not get the ten dollars they have to 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.850
 complete with another product or with another 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:47.360
 box of this product and then here 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.010
 are 1996 I was going to use four coupons from a 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.040
 dollar each one that comes for this 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.890
 Sunday 12 15 in the smart force after 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.310
 of the coupons we're going to pay 15 96 and you 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:01.220
 they return 10 dollars if you make an account 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.600
 this transaction comes out for 596 because 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:07.190
 they are returning 10 dollars so 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.530
 I always do the transactions for 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.100
 the beginners with the coupons that 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.720
 they leave for example this coming Sunday 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.060
 because I know they do not have coupons 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.739
 other weeks ago so that's why I do 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.250
 the transactions with the coupons that 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:25.120
 come for this Sunday 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:28.090
 and got nothing more from the specials that 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.920
 they are so here we are going to spend 15 96 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.190
 and they return us 10 with that we are going to 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.890
 start let's pay 15 96 bad rates 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.020
 and they return us 10 and with these 10 dollars 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.480
 let's make the second transaction or 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.100
 the second buys the second purchase what 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.320
 let's do with these products from 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.360
 hardwicke these are in the purchase of 20 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.210
 they return 10 dollars this nothing else is 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.950
 it can be once per card that they have 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.750
 to see also that nothing else can be 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.760
 do once per card there's there 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.460
 offers that can be made twice 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:00.520
 by card or three times but here nothing 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:03.520
 more lets us once per card here 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.520
 let's buy this product these 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.910
 oils that come two in a packet 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:13.960
 these are at 699 we are going to buy three 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:16.780
 because it's going to be a total of 20 97 here 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.669
 we spent more than 20 dollars so we did not 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.550
 there is a problem that we get out of the 10 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:23.890
 civilian dollars so here we go to 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.110
 use three coupons of one dollar each 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.249
 who comes for this Sunday 12 15 in the 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.549
 smart source 

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:33.939
 after the coupons we will pay 

00:05:29.549 --> 00:05:36.789
 1797 but here we are going to use the 10 

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:39.869
 dollars of civil of the first purchase 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:43.629
 that they gave us and with those 10 dollars 

00:05:39.869 --> 00:05:45.219
 our balance here is going to go down to 797 

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:48.689
 that's what he's going to pay here for his 

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:51.249
 797 bag and they will return 10 dollars 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:53.949
 that's how easy we make our 

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:57.069
 transactions in civilians nothing more than two 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:06:00.309
 let's do it because there's no more with 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:02.049
 coupons for this week but you will 

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:03.969
 is left with ten dollars these ten 

00:06:02.049 --> 00:06:06.699
 dollars can use it for the next 

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:08.529
 week in case you need 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:10.389
 other things for example if you want 

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:14.259
 buy these bags you can buy 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:16.119
 this says buy 15 you get back 5 these 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:18.729
 10 dollars here can be spent for 

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:21.969
 here if you do not have coupons here you 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:24.039
 nothing else would spend 5 and return you in 5 

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:27.489
 so this is totally free 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:29.979
 that's an example just because this one 

00:06:27.489 --> 00:06:32.709
 there are no coupons for this for this 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:33.880
 Sunday there are coupons but they are coupons that 

00:06:32.709 --> 00:06:37.030
 they left from 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:39.030
 many weeks ago so that's why 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:42.400
 I do this transaction in another way 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:44.830
 because I know they do not have the coupons that 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.560
 we have from many weeks ago 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:50.500
 and for example if you wanted to buy 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.840
 Christmas products here are in the 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.080
 purchase of 30 they return 10 dollars for 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:58.300
 this there are no coupons but if you 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:02.740
 need some product here Christmas 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:04.810
 here is more you can buy it here 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:07.480
 up and more you can buy it 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.190
 buy what is 30 dollars and 10 

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.590
 dollars that they gave him in the second 

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.660
 transaction you can use here I would pay 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:16.030
 you 20 dollars but they return you 10 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:19.870
 dollars in this way you are going to 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:23.410
 rolando their exhibits and so will pay 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:24.940
 less and is gaining more so like that 

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:27.190
 it's all down here from this video les 

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:30.160
