the<00:03:28.280> same<00:03:28.489> time<00:03:28.700> so<00:03:28.909> it's<00:03:29.030> kind<00:03:29.150> of<00:03:29.180> a<00:03:29.299> jamming

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
the same time so it's kind of a jamming

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.199

situation<00:03:30.620> that<00:03:31.159> we<00:03:31.310> liked<00:03:31.549> it<00:03:31.669> and<00:03:31.760> it's<00:03:32.000> not

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
situation that we liked it and it's not

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:33.550 
situation that we liked it and it's not
really<00:03:32.480> happening<00:03:32.599> when<00:03:33.139> you're<00:03:33.230> on<00:03:33.379> your<00:03:33.439> own

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
really happening when you're on your own

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.619 
really happening when you're on your own
I<00:03:33.829> mean<00:03:34.010> you<00:03:34.310> say<00:03:34.489> can<00:03:34.669> enjoy<00:03:34.909> music<00:03:35.150> very<00:03:35.510> much

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
I mean you say can enjoy music very much

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.690 
I mean you say can enjoy music very much
in<00:03:35.989> what<00:03:36.169> you're<00:03:36.319> doing<00:03:36.349> but<00:03:36.739> it's<00:03:37.040> just<00:03:37.549> very

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
in what you're doing but it's just very

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:44.259 
in what you're doing but it's just very
difficult<00:03:37.879> to<00:03:40.000> to<00:03:41.000> use<00:03:41.290> to<00:03:42.430> work<00:03:43.430> on<00:03:43.609> two<00:03:43.969> cents

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
difficult to to use to work on two cents

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.209 
difficult to to use to work on two cents
at<00:03:44.389> the<00:03:44.480> same<00:03:44.659> time<00:03:44.900> because<00:03:45.169> you<00:03:45.889> just<00:03:46.069> have

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:46.219 
at the same time because you just have

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:48.550 
at the same time because you just have
two<00:03:46.400> hands<00:03:46.579> I<00:03:47.030> kind<00:03:47.959> of<00:03:48.079> like<00:03:48.230> all<00:03:48.409> the

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
two hands I kind of like all the

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.709 
two hands I kind of like all the
sessions<00:03:48.769> they've<00:03:49.669> all<00:03:49.819> been<00:03:50.030> different<00:03:50.510> and

sessions they've all been different and

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:54.119 
sessions they've all been different and
I<00:03:51.939> was<00:03:52.939> very<00:03:53.000> excited<00:03:53.239> about<00:03:53.599> everyone<00:03:54.019> and

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:54.129
