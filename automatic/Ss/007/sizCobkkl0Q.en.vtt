own aides have no problem in filing and

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.310 
own aides have no problem in filing and
our<00:02:24.370> argument<00:02:24.820> is<00:02:24.910> that<00:02:24.970> they're<00:02:25.390> not<00:02:25.570> part<00:02:26.170> of

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
the executive branch which is curious I

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.990 
the executive branch which is curious I
mean<00:02:29.290> I'm<00:02:29.530> not<00:02:29.710> a<00:02:29.770> constitutional<00:02:30.160> lawyer<00:02:30.730> but

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
mean I'm not a constitutional lawyer but

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.900 
mean I'm not a constitutional lawyer but
say<00:02:31.300> I<00:02:31.330> was<00:02:31.660> a<00:02:31.690> strict<00:02:32.290> constructionist<00:02:33.130> it

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
say I was a strict constructionist it

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.670 
say I was a strict constructionist it
would<00:02:34.090> be<00:02:34.180> pretty<00:02:34.360> easy<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.780> frame<00:02:35.530> the

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
would be pretty easy to frame the

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.620 
would be pretty easy to frame the
argument<00:02:36.220> that<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.520> founders<00:02:36.910> wanted<00:02:37.210> there

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
argument that the founders wanted there

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.870 
argument that the founders wanted there
to<00:02:37.660> be<00:02:37.780> checks<00:02:38.050> and<00:02:38.200> balances<00:02:38.790> obviously<00:02:39.790> it

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
to be checks and balances obviously it

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.180 
to be checks and balances obviously it
doesn't<00:02:40.000> apply<00:02:40.210> to<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.540> vice<00:02:40.840> president<00:02:41.190> and

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
doesn't apply to the vice president and

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.160 
doesn't apply to the vice president and
if<00:02:42.490> mr.<00:02:42.790> Cheney<00:02:43.030> succeeded<00:02:43.570> in<00:02:43.720> Legally

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
if mr. Cheney succeeded in Legally

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.810 
if mr. Cheney succeeded in Legally
carving<00:02:44.620> himself<00:02:44.980> out<00:02:45.190> of<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.400> executive

carving himself out of the executive

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.600 
carving himself out of the executive
branch<00:02:45.850> we<00:02:46.210> not<00:02:46.420> also<00:02:47.130> necessarily<00:02:48.130> abdicate

branch we not also necessarily abdicate

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.070 
branch we not also necessarily abdicate
many<00:02:48.820> of<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.060> protections<00:02:49.570> of<00:02:49.660> that<00:02:49.810> branch

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
many of the protections of that branch

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.390 
many of the protections of that branch
they're<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.470> ones<00:02:50.650> that<00:02:50.709> have<00:02:50.890> shielded<00:02:51.250> him

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
they're the ones that have shielded him

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.550 
they're the ones that have shielded him
in<00:02:51.520> this<00:02:51.640> cone<00:02:51.790> of<00:02:51.940> silence<00:02:52.380> well<00:02:53.380> that's<00:02:53.500> a

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
in this cone of silence well that's a

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.140 
in this cone of silence well that's a
very<00:02:53.590> good<00:02:53.770> point<00:02:53.890> I<00:02:54.250> mean<00:02:54.400> if<00:02:54.610> this<00:02:54.820> is

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
very good point I mean if this is

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.550 
very good point I mean if this is
obviously<00:02:55.360> a<00:02:55.660> sort<00:02:55.900> of<00:02:55.930> Guantanamo<00:02:56.440> Bay

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
obviously a sort of Guantanamo Bay

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.820 
obviously a sort of Guantanamo Bay
situation<00:02:57.160> and<00:02:57.940> it<00:02:58.720> has<00:02:59.020> come<00:02:59.320> up<00:02:59.440> for

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
situation and it has come up for

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:00.990 
situation and it has come up for
instance<00:03:00.190> in<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.430> whole<00:03:00.580> debate<00:03:00.820> about

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
instance in the whole debate about

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000 
instance in the whole debate about
deleted<00:03:01.570> emails<00:03:01.990> if<00:03:02.230> you're<00:03:02.650> going<00:03:02.800> to<00:03:02.860> run

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
deleted emails if you're going to run

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.530 
deleted emails if you're going to run
government<00:03:03.280> business<00:03:03.940> through<00:03:04.180> your<00:03:04.360> private

government business through your private

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.540 
government business through your private
accounts<00:03:05.260> but<00:03:05.740> you<00:03:05.860> can't<00:03:06.100> then<00:03:06.280> claim

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
accounts but you can't then claim

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.920 
accounts but you can't then claim
executive<00:03:07.120> privilege<00:03:07.480> so<00:03:07.630> your<00:03:07.780> only

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
executive privilege so your only

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.850 
executive privilege so your only
possibility<00:03:08.770> is<00:03:08.800> while<00:03:09.670> deleting<00:03:10.030> everything

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
possibility is while deleting everything

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.590 
possibility is while deleting everything
this<00:03:11.860> is<00:03:12.040> this<00:03:12.280> is<00:03:12.430> a<00:03:12.459> very<00:03:12.850> very<00:03:13.180> rocky

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
this is this is a very very rocky

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.180 
this is this is a very very rocky
pattern<00:03:14.200> and<00:03:14.380> frankly<00:03:14.830> if<00:03:15.010> its

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
pattern and frankly if its

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.050 
pattern and frankly if its
constitutional<00:03:16.150> then<00:03:16.330> I'm<00:03:16.750> a<00:03:16.810> banana<00:03:17.170> it's<00:03:18.060> we

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
constitutional then I'm a banana it's we

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.270 
constitutional then I'm a banana it's we

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
that too was about classified

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.530 
that too was about classified

how<00:03:33.010> fair<00:03:33.190> is<00:03:33.310> that<00:03:33.340> charge<00:03:33.760> I<00:03:34.980> think<00:03:35.980> it's

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
how fair is that charge I think it's

strange and again it's something that

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.360 
strange and again it's something that
even<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.780> president<00:04:05.290> even<00:04:05.739> the<00:04:05.950> president's
