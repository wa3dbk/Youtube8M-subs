complaints like you know my battery goes
flat<00:00:11.460> after<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:12.090> couple<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:12.420> days<00:00:12.570> can<00:00:12.900> be<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.049> bit

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
flat after a couple of days can be a bit

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.289 
flat after a couple of days can be a bit
troublesome<00:00:13.559> so<00:00:13.920> there's<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.460> couple<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:14.790> quick

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
troublesome so there's a couple of quick

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.370 
troublesome so there's a couple of quick
steps<00:00:16.400> to<00:00:17.400> make<00:00:17.609> finding<00:00:18.210> parasitic<00:00:18.840> drains<00:00:19.140> a

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
steps to make finding parasitic drains a

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.859 
steps to make finding parasitic drains a
little<00:00:19.619> less<00:00:19.740> painful<00:00:20.039> as<00:00:20.640> always<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.689> first

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
little less painful as always the first

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.450 
little less painful as always the first
thing<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.320> want<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.500> do<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:22.830> confirm<00:00:23.250> the

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
thing that you want to do is confirm the

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.660 
thing that you want to do is confirm the
fault<00:00:24.019> so<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.109> need<00:00:25.289> fully<00:00:25.859> charged<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.519> load

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
fault so you need fully charged and load

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.880 
fault so you need fully charged and load
tested<00:00:27.150> battery<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.199> vehicle<00:00:28.560> needs<00:00:28.740> to

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
tested battery and the vehicle needs to

tested battery and the vehicle needs to
be<00:00:29.039> asleep<00:00:29.820> as<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:31.080> know<00:00:31.199> all<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.470> modules

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
be asleep as in you know all the modules

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.030 
be asleep as in you know all the modules
in<00:00:32.040> ECU's<00:00:32.730> need<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.180> be<00:00:33.270> asleep<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.920> know

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
in ECU's need to be asleep so you know

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.920 
in ECU's need to be asleep so you know
all<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.460> vehicles<00:00:35.850> this<00:00:35.969> can<00:00:36.270> take<00:00:36.510> between

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
all the vehicles this can take between

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.400 
all the vehicles this can take between
35<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.469> 45<00:00:38.219> minutes<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.850> on<00:00:39.480> newer<00:00:39.960> vehicles

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
35 and 45 minutes and on newer vehicles

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.520 
35 and 45 minutes and on newer vehicles
anywhere<00:00:40.800> up<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:40.950> about<00:00:41.250> 2<00:00:41.550> hours<00:00:42.140> so<00:00:43.140> what<00:00:43.469> you

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
anywhere up to about 2 hours so what you

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.779 
anywhere up to about 2 hours so what you
want<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.710> do<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:43.950> see<00:00:44.100> how<00:00:44.280> much<00:00:44.370> current

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
want to do is see how much current

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.440 
want to do is see how much current
drawer<00:00:44.969> there<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:46.399> the<00:00:47.399> total<00:00:48.059> amount<00:00:48.300> of

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
drawer there is so the total amount of

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.290 
drawer there is so the total amount of
current<00:00:49.110> drawn<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.500> vehicle<00:00:49.920> that's<00:00:50.070> asleep

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
current drawn a vehicle that's asleep

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.810 
current drawn a vehicle that's asleep
can<00:00:51.600> vary<00:00:51.840> across<00:00:52.140> manufacturer<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.340> years

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
can vary across manufacturer and years

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.630 
can vary across manufacturer and years
so<00:00:54.210> on<00:00:54.390> an<00:00:54.510> older<00:00:54.840> vehicle<00:00:55.260> i<00:00:55.680> would<00:00:55.980> i<00:00:56.399> would

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
so on an older vehicle i would i would

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.580 
so on an older vehicle i would i would
expect<00:00:57.239> anything<00:00:57.539> up<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.930> about<00:00:58.170> 100

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
expect anything up to about 100

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.880 
expect anything up to about 100
milliamps<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.760> be<00:00:59.940> acceptable<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.649> on<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
milliamps to be acceptable and on the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.560 
milliamps to be acceptable and on the
current<00:01:02.219> motor<00:01:02.370> vehicle<00:01:02.879> i<00:01:03.059> would<00:01:03.239> expect

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
current motor vehicle i would expect

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.810 
current motor vehicle i would expect
anything<00:01:03.899> up<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.260> about<00:01:04.470> 200<00:01:05.100> milliamps<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.700> be

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
anything up to about 200 milliamps to be

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.420 
anything up to about 200 milliamps to be
acceptable<00:01:06.260> and<00:01:07.260> always<00:01:07.799> obviously<00:01:08.250> we

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
acceptable and always obviously we

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.609 
acceptable and always obviously we
wanted<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.760> check<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.180> easy<00:01:09.390> basics<00:01:09.990> first<00:01:10.229> so

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
wanted to check the easy basics first so

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.640 
wanted to check the easy basics first so
make<00:01:11.520> sure<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.880> there's<00:01:12.150> no<00:01:12.720> interior<00:01:13.350> or

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
make sure that there's no interior or

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.530 
make sure that there's no interior or
lights<00:01:14.130> staying<00:01:14.580> on<00:01:14.790> like<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.180> know<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.360> boot

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
lights staying on like you know the boot

something<00:01:25.259> with<00:01:25.380> staying<00:01:25.680> energized<00:01:26.390> because

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
something with staying energized because

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.390 
something with staying energized because
it's<00:01:27.720> hard<00:01:27.930> white<00:01:28.200> powdery<00:01:28.799> when<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.159> key<00:01:29.369> is

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
it's hard white powdery when the key is

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.090 
it's hard white powdery when the key is
on<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:30.150> how<00:01:30.420> do<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.570> measure<00:01:30.720> control<00:01:31.470> well

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
on so how do you measure control well

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.760 
on so how do you measure control well
there's<00:01:32.880> two<00:01:33.390> methods<00:01:33.750> first<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.470> all<00:01:34.560> you

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
there's two methods first of all you

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.490 
there's two methods first of all you
could<00:01:34.950> use<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.490> current<00:01:36.299> plan<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.110> negative

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
could use a current plan on the negative

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.730 
could use a current plan on the negative
battery<00:01:37.680> terminal<00:01:38.400> or<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:39.720> digital<00:01:40.409> multimeter

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
battery terminal or a digital multimeter

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.120 
battery terminal or a digital multimeter
on<00:01:41.210> measuring<00:01:42.210> milliamps<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:43.049> series<00:01:43.799> with

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
on measuring milliamps in series with

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.389 
on measuring milliamps in series with
the<00:01:44.280> with<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.700> negative<00:01:45.119> battery<00:01:45.450> cable

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
the with the negative battery cable

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.490 
the with the negative battery cable
then<00:01:47.399> quite<00:01:48.060> simply<00:01:48.479> measure<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.259> current

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
then quite simply measure the current

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.590 
then quite simply measure the current
flowing<00:01:49.770> see<00:01:50.040> if<00:01:50.100> it's<00:01:50.280> above<00:01:50.579> or<00:01:50.850> below<00:01:51.240> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
flowing see if it's above or below the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.880 
flowing see if it's above or below the
limits<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.079> are<00:01:52.229> suitable<00:01:52.619> for<00:01:52.860> that

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
limits that are suitable for that

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.020 
limits that are suitable for that
vehicle<00:01:54.229> so<00:01:55.229> how<00:01:55.590> do<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:55.770> identify<00:01:56.030> which

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
vehicle so how do you identify which

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.600 
vehicle so how do you identify which
circuit<00:01:57.689> has<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.380> current<00:01:58.680> flaw<00:01:58.979> well

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
circuit has the current flaw well

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.020 
circuit has the current flaw well
there's<00:01:59.939> two<00:02:00.240> really<00:02:00.659> easy<00:02:01.140> ways<00:02:01.759> the<00:02:02.759> first

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
there's two really easy ways the first

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.510 
there's two really easy ways the first
is<00:02:03.390> with<00:02:03.840> your<00:02:03.960> current<00:02:04.380> clamp<00:02:04.619> or<00:02:04.860> your

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
is with your current clamp or your

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.809 
is with your current clamp or your
digital<00:02:06.060> meter<00:02:06.479> installed<00:02:07.020> in<00:02:07.170> series<00:02:07.789> go<00:02:08.789> to

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
digital meter installed in series go to

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.580 
digital meter installed in series go to
the<00:02:09.000> fuse<00:02:09.239> panel<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:10.160> remove

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
the fuse panel and remove

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.160 
the fuse panel and remove
users<00:02:11.860> taking<00:02:12.700> note<00:02:13.120> when<00:02:13.569> each<00:02:13.690> fuse<00:02:14.019> is

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
users taking note when each fuse is

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.280 
users taking note when each fuse is
removed<00:02:14.530> if<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.489> count<00:02:15.879> drops<00:02:16.239> and<00:02:16.540> number

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
removed if the count drops and number

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.350 
removed if the count drops and number
two<00:02:17.500> how<00:02:18.160> much<00:02:18.340> current<00:02:18.819> drop<00:02:19.000> there<00:02:19.239> is

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
two how much current drop there is

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.089 
two how much current drop there is
you're<00:02:19.569> obviously<00:02:19.690> going<00:02:20.080> to<00:02:20.170> be<00:02:20.379> looking<00:02:20.890> for

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
you're obviously going to be looking for

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.699 
you're obviously going to be looking for
the<00:02:21.220> circuit<00:02:21.790> when<00:02:22.510> disabled<00:02:23.110> that<00:02:23.290> causes

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
the circuit when disabled that causes

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.089 
the circuit when disabled that causes
the<00:02:23.860> greatest<00:02:24.220> drop<00:02:24.819> in<00:02:25.000> current<00:02:25.390> flow<00:02:26.099> okay

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
the greatest drop in current flow okay

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.400 
the greatest drop in current flow okay
so<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.489> second<00:02:27.879> method<00:02:28.030> is<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.599> use<00:02:28.660> a<00:02:29.140> digital

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
so the second method is to use a digital

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.460 
so the second method is to use a digital
multimeter<00:02:30.010> reading<00:02:30.849> voltage<00:02:31.299> millivolts<00:02:32.260> if

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
multimeter reading voltage millivolts if

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.289 
multimeter reading voltage millivolts if
it's<00:02:32.680> non<00:02:33.160> auto-ranging

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
it's non auto-ranging

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.650 
it's non auto-ranging
and<00:02:34.959> measure<00:02:35.349> the<00:02:35.860> voltage<00:02:36.040> drop<00:02:36.640> across<00:02:36.849> the

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
and measure the voltage drop across the

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.850 
and measure the voltage drop across the
element<00:02:37.870> of<00:02:38.319> the<00:02:38.470> fuse<00:02:38.830> so<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:40.629> circuit<00:02:41.620> that

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
element of the fuse so a circuit that

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.089 
element of the fuse so a circuit that
has<00:02:42.250> current<00:02:42.819> flow<00:02:43.090> will<00:02:43.690> have<00:02:44.140> voltage<00:02:44.590> drop

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
has current flow will have voltage drop

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:46.920 
has current flow will have voltage drop
across<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.610> fuse<00:02:45.849> you<00:02:45.880> can't<00:02:46.239> have<00:02:46.480> voltage

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
across the fuse you can't have voltage

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.640 
across the fuse you can't have voltage
drop<00:02:47.260> without<00:02:47.500> current<00:02:48.040> flow<00:02:48.370> so<00:02:49.530> you're<00:02:50.530> only

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
drop without current flow so you're only

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.470 
drop without current flow so you're only
going<00:02:50.890> to<00:02:50.980> see<00:02:51.099> two<00:02:51.519> readings<00:02:52.150> when

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
going to see two readings when

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.530 
going to see two readings when
performing<00:02:53.440> this<00:02:53.620> test<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:55.060> that's<00:02:55.299> how<00:02:55.420> they

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
performing this test and that's how they

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.839 
performing this test and that's how they
either<00:02:55.810> going<00:02:56.049> to<00:02:56.110> be<00:02:56.290> zero<00:02:56.709> point<00:02:57.250> zero<00:02:57.459> zero

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
either going to be zero point zero zero

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.270 
either going to be zero point zero zero
zero<00:02:58.329> volts<00:02:59.170> meaning<00:02:59.680> that<00:02:59.890> there's<00:03:00.129> no

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
zero volts meaning that there's no

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.710 
zero volts meaning that there's no
current<00:03:00.610> flow<00:03:00.819> there's<00:03:01.120> no<00:03:01.269> difference<00:03:01.629> in

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
current flow there's no difference in

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.839 
current flow there's no difference in
voltage<00:03:02.079> between<00:03:02.140> each<00:03:02.739> side<00:03:03.010> there's<00:03:03.700> no

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
voltage between each side there's no

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.449 
voltage between each side there's no
voltage<00:03:04.090> drop<00:03:04.480> across<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.989> fuse<00:03:05.310> or<00:03:06.310> you're

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
voltage drop across the fuse or you're

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.550 
voltage drop across the fuse or you're
going<00:03:06.549> to<00:03:06.640> see<00:03:06.730> a<00:03:06.760> voltage<00:03:07.269> drop<00:03:07.690> in

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
going to see a voltage drop in

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.539 
going to see a voltage drop in
millivolts<00:03:09.129> so<00:03:09.569> once<00:03:10.569> you've<00:03:10.750> identified

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
millivolts so once you've identified

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.440 
millivolts so once you've identified
which<00:03:12.549> circuits<00:03:13.260> have<00:03:14.260> voltage<00:03:14.860> drop<00:03:15.489> across

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
which circuits have voltage drop across

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.670 
which circuits have voltage drop across
the<00:03:17.290> fuse<00:03:18.150> then<00:03:19.150> you<00:03:19.569> can<00:03:19.750> measure<00:03:20.260> the

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
the fuse then you can measure the

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.379 
the fuse then you can measure the
current<00:03:20.859> flow<00:03:21.069> in<00:03:21.220> that<00:03:21.310> circuit<00:03:21.730> by<00:03:21.880> removing

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
current flow in that circuit by removing

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:25.729 
current flow in that circuit by removing
the<00:03:22.480> fuse<00:03:22.810> installing<00:03:23.799> your<00:03:23.889> meter<00:03:24.660> and

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
the fuse installing your meter and

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.589 
the fuse installing your meter and
reading<00:03:27.480> current<00:03:28.480> flow<00:03:28.660> in<00:03:29.440> that<00:03:29.680> circuit

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
reading current flow in that circuit

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.210 
reading current flow in that circuit
okay<00:03:31.599> so<00:03:31.660> we've<00:03:31.989> identified<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.799> total

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
okay so we've identified the total

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.710 
okay so we've identified the total
amount<00:03:33.489> of<00:03:33.670> current<00:03:34.060> flow<00:03:34.239> in<00:03:34.359> this<00:03:34.510> system

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
amount of current flow in this system

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.020 
amount of current flow in this system
we've<00:03:35.440> identified<00:03:35.680> which<00:03:36.340> circuits<00:03:36.849> are

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
we've identified which circuits are

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.759 
we've identified which circuits are
energized<00:03:37.480> and<00:03:37.780> how<00:03:37.989> much<00:03:38.200> current<00:03:38.560> flow

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
energized and how much current flow

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.650 
energized and how much current flow
there<00:03:39.069> is<00:03:39.099> in<00:03:39.370> each<00:03:39.579> of<00:03:39.790> those<00:03:39.970> circuits<00:03:40.450> and

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
there is in each of those circuits and

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.770 
there is in each of those circuits and
all<00:03:41.410> you're<00:03:41.560> looking<00:03:41.739> for<00:03:41.919> is<00:03:42.130> any

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
all you're looking for is any

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.509 
all you're looking for is any
irregularity<00:03:43.780> so<00:03:44.049> you<00:03:44.919> know<00:03:45.040> obviously

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
irregularity so you know obviously

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:46.620 
irregularity so you know obviously
you're<00:03:45.669> going<00:03:45.760> to<00:03:45.849> see<00:03:45.970> a<00:03:46.000> small<00:03:46.299> amount<00:03:46.450> of

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
you're going to see a small amount of

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.319 
you're going to see a small amount of
current<00:03:46.900> flow<00:03:47.109> on<00:03:47.380> the<00:03:48.190> radio<00:03:48.489> fuse<00:03:48.910> and<00:03:49.150> maybe

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
current flow on the radio fuse and maybe

on you know the parking lights you know

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.009 
on you know the parking lights you know
that<00:03:54.790> there's<00:03:55.000> obviously<00:03:55.180> a<00:03:55.510> Fault<00:03:55.840> in<00:03:55.870> that

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
that there's obviously a Fault in that

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.930 
that there's obviously a Fault in that
system<00:03:56.230> is<00:03:56.530> there<00:03:56.769> shouldn't<00:03:57.160> be<00:03:57.250> any<00:03:57.639> current

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
system is there shouldn't be any current

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.289 
system is there shouldn't be any current
rule<00:03:58.209> there<00:03:58.389> when<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:58.599> vehicles<00:03:58.959> asleep<00:03:59.349> so

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
rule there when the vehicles asleep so

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.210 
rule there when the vehicles asleep so
taking<00:04:01.299> you<00:04:01.389> to<00:04:01.510> step<00:04:01.720> three<00:04:02.079> which<00:04:02.560> is<00:04:02.620> fix<00:04:03.040> it

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
taking you to step three which is fix it

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.270 
taking you to step three which is fix it
so<00:04:03.519> that's<00:04:04.000> not<00:04:04.260> watching<00:04:05.260> me<00:04:05.680> that's<00:04:06.099> out
