00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
that I came when we're out there

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.219 
that I came when we're out there
throwing<00:01:55.939> and<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.659> know<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:57.810> do<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.049> same

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
throwing and you know I do the same

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.230 
throwing and you know I do the same
thing<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.500> them<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:58.860> think<00:01:59.000> you<00:02:00.000> know<00:02:00.119> the

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
thing to them so I think you know the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.730 
thing to them so I think you know the
receivers<00:02:00.630> working<00:02:00.899> with<00:02:01.020> me<00:02:01.140> they<00:02:01.350> pushed<00:02:01.619> me

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
receivers working with me they pushed me

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.550 
receivers working with me they pushed me

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.380 
I pushed them

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
this is obviously a broad question but

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.730 
this is obviously a broad question but
one<00:02:05.869> that<00:02:05.960> you<00:02:06.049> probably<00:02:06.200> haven't<00:02:06.409> asked<00:02:06.619> too

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
think of it excites me to be completely

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:03.970 
think of it excites me to be completely
honest<00:03:01.610> or<00:03:01.700> your<00:03:01.970> arm<00:03:02.090> you<00:03:02.660> know<00:03:02.690> they've<00:03:02.980> like

I've said they work extremely hard and I

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.800 
I've said they work extremely hard and I
think<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.700> experience<00:03:07.910> that<00:03:08.239> they<00:03:08.420> now<00:03:08.570> have

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
think the experience that they now have

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.650 
think the experience that they now have
bringing<00:03:09.380> that<00:03:09.470> into<00:03:09.620> camp<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:11.450> knowledge

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
bringing that into camp the knowledge

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.630 
bringing that into camp the knowledge
they<00:03:12.019> now<00:03:12.170> have<00:03:12.440> a<00:03:12.709> lot<00:03:12.890> especially<00:03:12.980> a<00:03:13.370> lot<00:03:13.549> of

they now have a lot especially a lot of

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.680 
they now have a lot especially a lot of
the<00:03:13.730> young<00:03:13.820> guys<00:03:14.000> that<00:03:14.030> were<00:03:14.269> forced<00:03:14.540> to<00:03:14.570> play

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
the young guys that were forced to play

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.860 
the young guys that were forced to play
last<00:03:14.930> year<00:03:15.519> super<00:03:16.519> excited<00:03:16.940> for<00:03:17.480> them<00:03:17.660> and

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.569 
last year super excited for them and
their<00:03:17.989> opportunities<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:18.890> I<00:03:18.950> think<00:03:19.459> it's

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
their opportunities and I think it's

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.240 
their opportunities and I think it's
just<00:03:19.700> going<00:03:19.819> to<00:03:19.850> help<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:20.150> team<00:03:20.390> and<00:03:20.720> help<00:03:21.260> the

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
always talks about maximizing each day

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.220 
always talks about maximizing each day
when<00:03:28.730> you<00:03:28.819> head<00:03:28.940> into<00:03:29.120> a<00:03:29.209> camp<00:03:29.480> obviously<00:03:30.109> of

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
when you head into a camp obviously of

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.289 
when you head into a camp obviously of
29<00:03:30.709> practices<00:03:31.310> in<00:03:31.459> front<00:03:31.760> of<00:03:31.850> you<00:03:31.940> how<00:03:32.150> do<00:03:32.209> you

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
29 practices in front of you how do you

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.090 
29 practices in front of you how do you
make<00:03:32.510> sure<00:03:32.540> that<00:03:32.900> you<00:03:32.989> keep<00:03:33.200> it<00:03:33.410> to<00:03:33.980> the

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
make sure that you keep it to the

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.680 
make sure that you keep it to the
moments<00:03:34.549> that<00:03:34.700> you're<00:03:34.970> doing<00:03:35.299> the<00:03:35.389> things<00:03:35.569> you

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
moments that you're doing the things you

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.629 
moments that you're doing the things you
need<00:03:35.810> to<00:03:35.840> do<00:03:35.989> right<00:03:36.019> now<00:03:36.500> so<00:03:37.100> that<00:03:37.220> tomorrow<00:03:37.489> is

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
need to do right now so that tomorrow is

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:38.860 
need to do right now so that tomorrow is
better<00:03:37.880> and<00:03:38.090> then<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:38.299> next<00:03:38.329> day<00:03:38.569> is<00:03:38.720> better

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
better and then the next day is better

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.120 
better and then the next day is better
and<00:03:39.049> so<00:03:39.170> on<00:03:39.290> down<00:03:39.410> the<00:03:39.470> line<00:03:39.650> yeah<00:03:39.980> I<00:03:40.010> think

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
and so on down the line yeah I think

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.800 
and so on down the line yeah I think
it's<00:03:40.340> just<00:03:40.489> a<00:03:40.609> mindset<00:03:40.940> that<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.299> team<00:03:41.480> has<00:03:41.660> to

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
it's just a mindset that the team has to

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.949 
it's just a mindset that the team has to
adopt<00:03:42.489> you<00:03:43.489> know<00:03:43.609> very<00:03:43.850> process-oriented<00:03:44.690> i

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
adopt you know very process-oriented i

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.000 
adopt you know very process-oriented i
think<00:03:45.170> is<00:03:45.260> one<00:03:45.410> of<00:03:45.440> the<00:03:45.560> words<00:03:45.709> that<00:03:45.799> Coach

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
think is one of the words that Coach

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.640 
think is one of the words that Coach
Franklin<00:03:46.370> uses<00:03:46.670> a<00:03:46.700> lot<00:03:46.940> and<00:03:47.810> it's<00:03:47.989> it's<00:03:48.350> true

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
Franklin uses a lot and it's it's true

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.170 
Franklin uses a lot and it's it's true
you<00:03:48.920> know<00:03:49.040> you<00:03:49.100> have<00:03:49.310> to<00:03:49.340> you<00:03:49.819> have<00:03:49.850> to<00:03:49.970> make

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
you know you have to you have to make

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.629 
you know you have to you have to make
sure<00:03:50.209> that<00:03:50.660> that<00:03:50.900> each<00:03:51.470> moment<00:03:51.799> is<00:03:52.010> not<00:03:52.190> wasted

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:52.639 
sure that that each moment is not wasted

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:54.069 
sure that that each moment is not wasted
each<00:03:52.790> day<00:03:53.030> is<00:03:53.090> now<00:03:53.269> wasted<00:03:53.750> and<00:03:53.840> you're<00:03:53.930> trying

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
each day is now wasted and you're trying

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.080 
each day is now wasted and you're trying
to<00:03:54.200> get<00:03:54.319> better<00:03:54.549> when<00:03:55.549> when<00:03:55.760> that's<00:03:55.940> your

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
to get better when when that's your

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.120 
to get better when when that's your
focus<00:03:56.480> and<00:03:56.510> right<00:03:56.780> now<00:03:56.930> you<00:03:57.440> know<00:03:57.560> camp<00:03:57.829> that's

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
focus and right now you know camp that's

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.340 
focus and right now you know camp that's
our<00:03:58.280> focus<00:03:58.400> is<00:03:58.700> making<00:03:58.880> sure<00:03:59.000> we<00:03:59.299> can<00:03:59.420> be<00:03:59.569> the

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
our focus is making sure we can be the

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.410 
our focus is making sure we can be the
best<00:04:00.590> product<00:04:01.040> we<00:04:01.160> can<00:04:01.310> become<00:04:01.730> weak<00:04:01.940> one<00:04:02.150> and

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
best product we can become weak one and

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.940 
best product we can become weak one and
then<00:04:02.630> continue<00:04:03.049> to<00:04:03.139> build<00:04:03.319> off<00:04:03.500> that<00:04:03.530> and<00:04:03.859> get

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
then continue to build off that and get

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.789 
then continue to build off that and get
better<00:04:04.069> than<00:04:04.280> that<00:04:04.340> so<00:04:05.440> you<00:04:06.440> know<00:04:06.530> I<00:04:06.560> think

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
better than that so you know I think

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.280 
better than that so you know I think
it's<00:04:06.920> just<00:04:06.980> a<00:04:07.280> mindset<00:04:08.000> and<00:04:08.209> I<00:04:08.269> think<00:04:08.480> you<00:04:09.200> know

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
it's just a mindset and I think you know

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.240 
it's just a mindset and I think you know
we're<00:04:09.440> doing<00:04:09.590> a<00:04:09.650> pretty<00:04:09.769> good<00:04:09.859> job<00:04:09.980> of<00:04:10.130> that

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
we're doing a pretty good job of that

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.100 
we're doing a pretty good job of that
right<00:04:10.430> now<00:04:10.459> coach<00:04:11.090> Donovan<00:04:11.450> was<00:04:11.629> here<00:04:11.810> earlier

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
right now coach Donovan was here earlier

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.990 
right now coach Donovan was here earlier
and<00:04:12.200> he<00:04:12.290> talked<00:04:12.530> about<00:04:12.799> how<00:04:13.159> so<00:04:13.610> many<00:04:13.730> of<00:04:13.849> the

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
and he talked about how so many of the

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.110 
and he talked about how so many of the
guys<00:04:14.150> outside

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
guys outside

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.729 
guys outside
play<00:04:15.330> so<00:04:15.540> many<00:04:15.629> different<00:04:15.900> spots<00:04:16.320> when<00:04:16.620> your

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
play so many different spots when your

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.140 
play so many different spots when your
multiple<00:04:17.250> like<00:04:17.430> that<00:04:17.639> you're<00:04:17.820> in<00:04:17.910> a<00:04:17.940> huddle

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
multiple like that you're in a huddle

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.819 
multiple like that you're in a huddle
obviously<00:04:18.780> a<00:04:18.810> defense<00:04:19.260> is<00:04:19.380> more<00:04:19.560> comfortable

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
obviously a defense is more comfortable

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.170 
obviously a defense is more comfortable
when<00:04:20.130> they<00:04:20.250> kind<00:04:20.459> of<00:04:20.519> know<00:04:20.639> what<00:04:20.790> you're<00:04:20.910> doing

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
when they kind of know what you're doing

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.370 
when they kind of know what you're doing
where<00:04:21.329> the<00:04:21.419> personnel<00:04:21.780> is<00:04:21.900> going<00:04:22.049> to<00:04:22.109> line<00:04:22.229> up

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
where the personnel is going to line up

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.930 
where the personnel is going to line up
when<00:04:22.770> you<00:04:22.889> have<00:04:23.040> a<00:04:23.070> number<00:04:23.250> of<00:04:23.400> guys<00:04:23.580> that<00:04:23.610> can

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
when you have a number of guys that can

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
a person that would do so and it

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.850 
a person that would do so and it
definitely<00:04:48.449> creates<00:04:48.750> problems<00:04:49.110> for<00:04:49.289> defenses
