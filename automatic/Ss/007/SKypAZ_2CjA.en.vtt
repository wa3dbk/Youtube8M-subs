away<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.070> visible<00:00:17.520> vertices<00:00:17.970> so<00:00:18.390> I'm<00:00:18.480> gonna

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
away the visible vertices so I'm gonna

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.019 
away the visible vertices so I'm gonna
do<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.470> operation<00:00:19.980> again<00:00:20.220> so<00:00:20.490> sometimes<00:00:20.670> must

do the operation again so sometimes must

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.420 
do the operation again so sometimes must
remember<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.420> turn<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:21.900> off<00:00:22.140> so<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:22.920> delete

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
remember to turn this off so you delete

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.339 
remember to turn this off so you delete
the<00:00:23.580> vertices<00:00:23.880> behind<00:00:24.560> so<00:00:25.560> more<00:00:26.099> time<00:00:26.310> and

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
the vertices behind so more time and

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.679 
the vertices behind so more time and
delete<00:00:28.349> what<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.039> says<00:00:29.250> so<00:00:29.939> now<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.210> got<00:00:30.570> exactly

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
and I'm just going to delete it away

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.640 
and I'm just going to delete it away
three<00:01:46.160> way<00:01:46.370> the<00:01:46.430> faces<00:01:46.820> and<00:01:47.350> you'll<00:01:48.350> see<00:01:48.620> that

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
three way the faces and you'll see that

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.470 
three way the faces and you'll see that
all<00:01:48.800> now<00:01:49.130> we<00:01:49.190> have<00:01:49.370> a<00:01:49.400> gaping<00:01:49.670> hole<00:01:49.790> yet<00:01:50.150> so

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
all now we have a gaping hole yet so

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.730 
all now we have a gaping hole yet so
i'll<00:01:50.840> switch<00:01:50.990> over<00:01:51.230> the<00:01:51.260> vertices<00:01:53.440> it<00:01:54.440> has<00:01:54.560> one

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
i'll switch over the vertices it has one

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.370 
i'll switch over the vertices it has one
face<00:01:55.070> here<00:01:55.430> do<00:01:55.610> not<00:01:55.640> delete<00:01:56.120> get<00:01:57.080> rid<00:01:57.200> of<00:01:57.230> this

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
face here do not delete get rid of this

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.100 
face here do not delete get rid of this
and<00:01:58.150> then<00:01:59.150> I'm<00:01:59.420> going<00:01:59.510> to<00:01:59.570> switch<00:01:59.750> over<00:01:59.930> the

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
and then I'm going to switch over the

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.900 
and then I'm going to switch over the
vertices<00:02:00.710> mode<00:02:02.860> okay<00:02:03.860> for<00:02:04.130> places<00:02:04.490> like<00:02:04.520> these

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
vertices mode okay for places like these

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.330 
vertices mode okay for places like these
we<00:02:05.390> have<00:02:05.420> like<00:02:05.840> four<00:02:06.170> more<00:02:06.500> vertices<00:02:06.830> you<00:02:07.160> can

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
we have like four more vertices you can

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.820 
we have like four more vertices you can
collapse<00:02:07.880> all<00:02:08.030> these<00:02:08.179> vertices<00:02:08.479> together<00:02:08.960> so

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
collapse all these vertices together so

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.620 
collapse all these vertices together so
I'm<00:02:09.920> going<00:02:09.979> to<00:02:10.130> hit<00:02:10.460> be<00:02:10.759> slight<00:02:11.360> all<00:02:11.510> these

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
I'm going to hit be slight all these

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.710 
I'm going to hit be slight all these
vertices<00:02:11.990> and<00:02:13.720> much<00:02:14.720> time<00:02:14.990> together<00:02:15.140> so<00:02:15.650> alt<00:02:16.250> M

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
vertices and much time together so alt M

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.610 
vertices and much time together so alt M
which<00:02:17.720> type<00:02:17.990> of<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.170> center<00:02:18.820> so<00:02:19.820> you<00:02:20.620> can

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
which type of the center so you can

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.050 
which type of the center so you can
sometimes<00:02:21.980> do<00:02:22.100> some<00:02:22.280> cleanup<00:02:22.520> like<00:02:22.730> this<00:02:22.910> one

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
sometimes do some cleanup like this one

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:32.680 
sometimes do some cleanup like this one
as<00:02:23.180> well<00:02:28.060> oops<00:02:30.100> do<00:02:31.100> that<00:02:31.310> I<00:02:31.520> need<00:02:31.940> to<00:02:32.270> decide

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
as well oops do that I need to decide

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.480 
as well oops do that I need to decide
those<00:02:32.930> vertices<00:02:33.640> and<00:02:35.080> yeah<00:02:36.080> okay

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
those vertices and yeah okay

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.850 
those vertices and yeah okay
and<00:02:38.610> what<00:02:39.090> about<00:02:39.210> this<00:02:39.600> one<00:02:39.900> I<00:02:40.140> think<00:02:40.680> we<00:02:40.740> can

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
and what about this one I think we can

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.030 
and what about this one I think we can
collab<00:02:41.190> these<00:02:41.400> guys<00:02:41.640> together<00:02:41.990> a<00:02:42.990> 2d<00:02:43.800> slight

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
mirror to mirror it so I'm going to add

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.450 
mirror to mirror it so I'm going to add
a<00:05:10.000> modifier<00:05:10.750> mirror<00:05:11.590> modifier<00:05:11.830> and<00:05:14.460> instead

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
a modifier mirror modifier and instead

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.160 
a modifier mirror modifier and instead
of<00:05:15.550> x<00:05:15.790> axis<00:05:16.120> i'm<00:05:16.300> going<00:05:16.450> to<00:05:16.510> move<00:05:16.630> along<00:05:17.020> the

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.170 
of x axis i'm going to move along the

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.280 
of x axis i'm going to move along the
y-axis<00:05:17.910> all<00:05:18.910> right<00:05:19.060> so<00:05:19.240> it<00:05:19.390> Nidal's<00:05:19.840> for<00:05:20.200> you

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
y-axis all right so it Nidal's for you

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.360 
y-axis all right so it Nidal's for you
okay<00:05:20.590> but<00:05:21.340> this<00:05:21.610> very<00:05:21.910> looks<00:05:22.650> pretty<00:05:23.650> bad<00:05:23.920> so

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 
okay but this very looks pretty bad so

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.090 
okay but this very looks pretty bad so
how<00:05:24.790> do<00:05:24.850> we<00:05:24.940> fix<00:05:25.240> that<00:05:25.360> now<00:05:25.720> one<00:05:26.680> of<00:05:26.710> the<00:05:26.890> best

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
how do we fix that now one of the best

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.730 
how do we fix that now one of the best
modifiers<00:05:27.580> I've<00:05:27.880> discovered<00:05:28.330> is<00:05:28.600> this<00:05:28.870> edge

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
modifiers I've discovered is this edge

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.850 
modifiers I've discovered is this edge
split<00:05:30.220> now<00:05:31.120> we<00:05:31.180> turn<00:05:31.450> on<00:05:31.600> this<00:05:31.720> edge<00:05:31.870> bit<00:05:32.230> now<00:05:32.830> I

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
split now we turn on this edge bit now I

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.010 
split now we turn on this edge bit now I
can<00:05:33.070> see<00:05:33.900> our<00:05:34.900> bishop<00:05:35.560> is<00:05:35.680> done<00:05:36.630> all<00:05:37.630> right<00:05:37.810> you

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
can apply this to make it permanent now

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.560 
can apply this to make it permanent now
if<00:05:41.080> you're<00:05:41.770> shadings<00:05:42.730> to<00:05:42.970> doesn't<00:05:43.300> look<00:05:43.420> right

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
if you're shadings to doesn't look right

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.530 
if you're shadings to doesn't look right
you<00:05:43.750> might<00:05:43.870> want<00:05:44.050> to<00:05:44.110> change<00:05:44.790> the<00:05:45.790> angle<00:05:46.180> value

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 
you might want to change the angle value

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.330 
you might want to change the angle value
to<00:05:46.720> split<00:05:46.960> angle<00:05:47.260> value<00:05:47.530> so<00:05:47.680> when<00:05:47.830> it<00:05:47.920> changes

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
to split angle value so when it changes

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.710 
to split angle value so when it changes
maybe<00:05:48.550> to<00:05:48.730> the<00:05:48.760> ball<00:05:49.410> 60<00:05:50.410> degrees<00:05:51.570> all<00:05:52.570> right

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 
maybe to the ball 60 degrees all right

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.280 
maybe to the ball 60 degrees all right
so<00:05:54.390> essentially<00:05:55.390> that's<00:05:55.630> it<00:05:55.840> so<00:05:55.990> once<00:05:56.170> you're

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.290 
so essentially that's it so once you're

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:59.610 
so essentially that's it so once you're
happy<00:05:56.410> with<00:05:56.590> this<00:05:56.910> just<00:05:57.910> hit<00:05:58.500> apply<00:05:59.500> the

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
happy with this just hit apply the

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:05.340 
happy with this just hit apply the
mirror<00:06:02.040> okay<00:06:03.040> so<00:06:03.240> I'm<00:06:04.240> gonna<00:06:04.420> do<00:06:04.630> that<00:06:04.810> for

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.350 
mirror okay so I'm gonna do that for

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.490 
mirror okay so I'm gonna do that for
short<00:06:05.620> well<00:06:05.950> now<00:06:06.520> if<00:06:06.730> you're<00:06:07.300> too<00:06:07.750> half<00:06:08.050> right

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
short well now if you're too half right

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.400 
short well now if you're too half right
are<00:06:08.710> not<00:06:08.770> merging<00:06:09.160> properly<00:06:10.020> you<00:06:11.020> might<00:06:11.200> want

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
are not merging properly you might want

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.830 
are not merging properly you might want
to<00:06:11.470> increase<00:06:11.860> the<00:06:11.920> merch<00:06:12.310> limit<00:06:12.730> just<00:06:13.690> a

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
to increase the merch limit just a

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.800 
to increase the merch limit just a
little<00:06:13.990> bit<00:06:14.370> and<00:06:15.370> then<00:06:15.490> you<00:06:15.610> apply<00:06:15.790> all<00:06:16.630> right

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
little bit and then you apply all right

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.560 
little bit and then you apply all right
then<00:06:17.050> finally<00:06:17.590> you<00:06:17.740> apply<00:06:18.160> the<00:06:18.220> edge<00:06:19.150> split

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:19.570 
then finally you apply the edge split

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.850 
then finally you apply the edge split
modifier<00:06:20.290> and<00:06:22.080> essentially<00:06:23.080> that's<00:06:23.320> it<00:06:23.500> this

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 
modifier and essentially that's it this

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.940 
modifier and essentially that's it this
is<00:06:24.010> how<00:06:24.220> you<00:06:24.280> create<00:06:24.820> your<00:06:27.420> Bishop<00:06:28.420> and<00:06:28.950> slot

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:29.950 
is how you create your Bishop and slot

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.679 
is how you create your Bishop and slot
looks<00:06:30.190> pretty<00:06:30.520> right<00:06:30.790> and

00:06:31.679 --> 00:06:31.689 
looks pretty right and

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:35.820 
looks pretty right and
the<00:06:32.049> mesh<00:06:32.379> this<00:06:33.569> looks<00:06:34.569> pretty<00:06:34.839> reasonably

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:35.830 
the mesh this looks pretty reasonably

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:42.779 
the mesh this looks pretty reasonably
okay<00:06:38.999> and<00:06:40.919> sometimes<00:06:41.919> boolean<00:06:42.339> operations

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:42.789 
okay and sometimes boolean operations

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:44.759 
okay and sometimes boolean operations
doesn't<00:06:43.119> work<00:06:43.209> that<00:06:43.360> well<00:06:43.539> and<00:06:43.839> I<00:06:44.199> feel<00:06:44.589> you

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:44.769 
doesn't work that well and I feel you

00:06:44.769 --> 00:06:47.669 
doesn't work that well and I feel you
you<00:06:45.129> have<00:06:45.339> to<00:06:45.489> model<00:06:45.999> the<00:06:46.179> slot<00:06:46.569> or<00:06:46.779> whatever

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:47.679 
you have to model the slot or whatever

00:06:47.679 --> 00:06:50.959 
you have to model the slot or whatever
bullying's<00:06:48.219> onto<00:06:48.489> your<00:06:48.639> model<00:06:48.909> directly<00:06:49.329> and

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:50.969 
bullying's onto your model directly and

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:54.119 
bullying's onto your model directly and
this<00:06:51.969> is<00:06:52.119> how<00:06:52.239> you<00:06:52.269> model<00:06:52.689> a<00:06:52.839> bishop<00:06:53.559> using<00:06:53.919> a

00:06:54.119 --> 00:06:54.129 
this is how you model a bishop using a

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:57.209 
this is how you model a bishop using a
bishop<00:06:54.939> chess<00:06:55.179> piece<00:06:55.389> in<00:06:55.659> blender<00:06:56.110> hope<00:06:57.099> you

00:06:57.209 --> 00:06:57.219 
bishop chess piece in blender hope you

bishop chess piece in blender hope you
enjoy<00:06:57.459> this<00:06:57.579> video<00:06:57.759> and<00:06:58.029> I<00:06:58.719> hope<00:07:01.259> that<00:07:02.259> you<00:07:02.469> try
