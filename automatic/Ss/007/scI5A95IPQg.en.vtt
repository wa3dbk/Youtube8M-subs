off<00:04:34.160> the<00:04:34.310> ball<00:04:34.430> skill<00:04:34.760> moves<00:04:34.970> that<00:04:35.120> you<00:04:35.180> can<00:04:35.330> do

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
off the ball skill moves that you can do

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.000

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
to so to me I mean I guess the future is

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.600 
to so to me I mean I guess the future is
constantly<00:05:03.170> flipping<00:05:03.500> between<00:05:03.710> games<00:05:04.310> and

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
constantly flipping between games and

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:06.400 
constantly flipping between games and
you<00:05:04.670> want<00:05:04.820> to<00:05:04.880> be<00:05:04.970> an<00:05:05.060> xbox<00:05:05.630> one<00:05:05.810> party<00:05:06.170> playing

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
you want to be an xbox one party playing

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.710 
you want to be an xbox one party playing
your<00:05:06.590> 360<00:05:07.430> titles<00:05:07.700> that<00:05:07.940> could<00:05:08.180> be<00:05:08.270> a<00:05:08.300> big<00:05:08.360> deal

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
your 360 titles that could be a big deal

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.450 
your 360 titles that could be a big deal
but<00:05:08.870> to<00:05:09.020> me<00:05:09.110> that<00:05:09.260> that's<00:05:09.620> nothing<00:05:10.130> too<00:05:10.280> crazy

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
but to me that that's nothing too crazy

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.460 
but to me that that's nothing too crazy
now<00:05:11.030> as<00:05:11.180> I<00:05:11.330> say<00:05:11.540> that<00:05:11.750> this<00:05:11.870> is<00:05:12.020> kind<00:05:12.200> of<00:05:12.260> crazy

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
now as I say that this is kind of crazy

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.260 
now as I say that this is kind of crazy
because<00:05:12.710> I<00:05:12.860> wish<00:05:13.040> Sony<00:05:13.430> would<00:05:13.700> have<00:05:13.880> backwards

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
because I wish Sony would have backwards

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.970 
because I wish Sony would have backwards
compatibility<00:05:14.900> sony<00:05:15.140> has<00:05:15.380> some<00:05:15.650> digital

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
compatibility sony has some digital

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.340 
compatibility sony has some digital
streaming<00:05:16.310> service<00:05:16.760> for<00:05:17.180> the<00:05:17.240> OU<00:05:17.480> game<00:05:17.510> at<00:05:18.260> the

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
streaming service for the OU game at the

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.440 
streaming service for the OU game at the
moment<00:05:18.680> i<00:05:18.710> think<00:05:18.950> is<00:05:19.070> pretty<00:05:19.310> ass<00:05:19.580> so<00:05:20.060> then

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
moment i think is pretty ass so then

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:21.880 
moment i think is pretty ass so then
that<00:05:20.600> during<00:05:20.870> backwards<00:05:21.170> compatibility<00:05:21.800> but

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
that during backwards compatibility but

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.260 
that during backwards compatibility but
i<00:05:21.950> wish<00:05:22.100> they<00:05:22.250> did<00:05:22.490> cuz<00:05:22.700> they<00:05:22.820> got<00:05:22.970> a<00:05:23.000> lot<00:05:23.240> of

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
i wish they did cuz they got a lot of

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.480 
i wish they did cuz they got a lot of

new users they weren't on the
PlayStation<00:05:30.830> 3<00:05:31.040> so<00:05:31.220> to<00:05:31.280> me<00:05:31.520> it<00:05:31.790> just<00:05:32.210> makes<00:05:32.510> so

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
PlayStation 3 so to me it just makes so

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.300 
PlayStation 3 so to me it just makes so
much<00:05:32.840> sense<00:05:32.900> for<00:05:33.200> sony<00:05:33.500> to<00:05:33.680> have<00:05:33.860> like<00:05:34.100> some

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
much sense for sony to have like some

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.430 
much sense for sony to have like some
backwards<00:05:34.670> compatibility<00:05:35.420> and<00:05:35.780> they<00:05:36.200> don't

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
backwards compatibility and they don't

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.500 
backwards compatibility and they don't
so<00:05:36.770> kind<00:05:37.130> of<00:05:37.220> let<00:05:37.370> down<00:05:37.520> by<00:05:37.700> Sony<00:05:37.970> I<00:05:38.180> didn't<00:05:38.450> get

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
so kind of let down by Sony I didn't get

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:39.490 
so kind of let down by Sony I didn't get
a<00:05:38.570> chance<00:05:38.780> to<00:05:38.990> watch<00:05:39.050> the<00:05:39.230> press<00:05:39.470> conference
