heat can dry and age the rubber which
would<00:02:05.700> lead<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:05.910> not<00:02:06.270> only<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.599> shorter

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
would lead to not only a shorter

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.160 
would lead to not only a shorter
lifespan<00:02:07.229> but<00:02:07.830> shrinking<00:02:08.369> cracking<00:02:08.910> and

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
lifespan but shrinking cracking and

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.900 
lifespan but shrinking cracking and
deformation<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.920> buff<00:02:11.130> your<00:02:11.370> boots<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.760> make

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
deformation to buff your boots to make

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.710 
deformation to buff your boots to make
them<00:02:12.120> look<00:02:12.239> great

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
them look great

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.930 
them look great
I<00:02:12.750> recommend<00:02:13.590> going<00:02:13.739> out<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.190> picking<00:02:14.370> up<00:02:14.670> a

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
I recommend going out and picking up a

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.890 
I recommend going out and picking up a
bottle<00:02:15.330> of<00:02:15.989> hunter<00:02:16.980> boot<00:02:17.280> buffer<00:02:17.790> again<00:02:18.599> I

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
bottle of hunter boot buffer again I

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.710 
bottle of hunter boot buffer again I
normally<00:02:19.680> don't<00:02:19.920> say<00:02:20.280> by<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.700> company<00:02:21.390> stuff

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
normally don't say by the company stuff

normally don't say by the company stuff
if<00:02:21.930> I<00:02:22.050> can<00:02:22.230> think<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.650> better<00:02:22.830> solution<00:02:23.220> but

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
if I can think of a better solution but

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000 
if I can think of a better solution but
in<00:02:24.150> this<00:02:24.300> case<00:02:24.569> I'd<00:02:25.080> stick<00:02:25.470> with<00:02:25.650> what<00:02:25.860> the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
in this case I'd stick with what the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.100 
in this case I'd stick with what the
company<00:02:26.310> has<00:02:26.550> told<00:02:27.270> you<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.510> use<00:02:27.660> pretty

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
company has told you to use pretty

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.750 
company has told you to use pretty
straightforward<00:02:28.890> we'll<00:02:29.099> give<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.400> bottle<00:02:29.550> a

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
straightforward we'll give the bottle a

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.309 
straightforward we'll give the bottle a
quick<00:02:30.000> shake

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.890 

and<00:02:34.040> then<00:02:34.400> we'll<00:02:34.579> just<00:02:34.610> take<00:02:34.969> a<00:02:35.209> clean<00:02:35.569> dry

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
and then we'll just take a clean dry

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.289 
and then we'll just take a clean dry
cloth<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.560> we'll<00:02:36.829> start<00:02:37.129> buffing<00:02:37.519> it<00:02:37.819> in<00:02:40.299> what

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
cloth and we'll start buffing it in what

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.289 
cloth and we'll start buffing it in what
if<00:02:41.420> your<00:02:41.629> boot<00:02:41.870> has<00:02:42.140> scuff<00:02:42.769> marks<00:02:43.159> on<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:43.609> well

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
if your boot has scuff marks on it well

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.660 
if your boot has scuff marks on it well
your<00:02:44.840> boots<00:02:45.079> are<00:02:45.319> more<00:02:45.829> than<00:02:45.950> likely<00:02:46.010> rubber

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
your boots are more than likely rubber

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.899 
your boots are more than likely rubber
so<00:02:47.299> some<00:02:48.290> scuff<00:02:48.680> marks<00:02:49.010> you<00:02:49.159> won't<00:02:49.459> be<00:02:49.609> able<00:02:49.730> to

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:49.909 
so some scuff marks you won't be able to

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:51.940 
so some scuff marks you won't be able to
get<00:02:50.150> out<00:02:50.359> but<00:02:50.720> for<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.019> ones<00:02:51.260> that<00:02:51.500> you<00:02:51.620> can

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950
