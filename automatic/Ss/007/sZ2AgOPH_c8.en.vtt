00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.180 
trying he's not going to get there 10
times<00:03:30.519> you<00:03:31.030> know<00:03:31.150> but<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:32.590> more<00:03:32.829> he<00:03:32.860> gets

there<00:03:33.430> run<00:03:34.239> was<00:03:34.420> going<00:03:34.600> to<00:03:34.660> be<00:03:34.750> a<00:03:34.780> good<00:03:34.959> three

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
there run was going to be a good three

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.039 
there run was going to be a good three
free<00:03:35.350> throws<00:03:35.380> that's<00:03:35.920> my<00:03:36.100> belief<00:03:36.340> obviously

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
free throws that's my belief obviously

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.270 
free throws that's my belief obviously
he's<00:03:38.049> got<00:03:38.230> to<00:03:38.320> prove<00:03:38.470> that<00:03:38.500> everybody<00:03:39.100> else

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
he's got to prove that everybody else

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.060 
he's got to prove that everybody else
but<00:03:40.239> I<00:03:40.299> believe<00:03:40.630> that<00:03:40.840> and<00:03:41.049> I<00:03:41.320> just<00:03:41.680> think<00:03:41.920> the

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
but I believe that and I just think the

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.890 
but I believe that and I just think the
only<00:03:42.220> way<00:03:42.400> he<00:03:42.519> can<00:03:42.640> do<00:03:42.820> that<00:03:42.850> is<00:03:43.209> by<00:03:43.269> getting<00:03:43.510> to

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
only way he can do that is by getting to

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.440 
only way he can do that is by getting to
the<00:03:43.989> lot<00:03:44.140> and<00:03:45.010> that's<00:03:45.250> why<00:03:45.549> that's<00:03:46.239> what

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
the lot and that's why that's what

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.079 
the lot and that's why that's what
behind<00:03:46.780> all<00:03:46.930> that
