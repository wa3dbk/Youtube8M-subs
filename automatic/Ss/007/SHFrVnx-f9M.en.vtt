crating<00:02:36.720> into<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.080> but<00:02:37.860> it's<00:02:38.040> never<00:02:38.190> enough

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
crating into it but it's never enough

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.320

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.690 
I addressed it from the point of view if
you<00:03:42.959> are<00:03:43.140> taking<00:03:43.560> steroids<00:03:44.450> for<00:03:45.450> me<00:03:45.540> anyway

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
you are taking steroids for me anyway

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.070 
you are taking steroids for me anyway
well<00:03:47.700> whilst<00:03:47.880> I<00:03:48.090> was<00:03:48.120> on<00:03:48.299> cycle<00:03:48.660> I<00:03:48.810> was<00:03:48.840> very

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
well whilst I was on cycle I was very

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.780 
well whilst I was on cycle I was very
hungry<00:03:49.290> all<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.590> time<00:03:49.650> so<00:03:50.010> my<00:03:50.160> appetite<00:03:50.459> shut

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
hungry all the time so my appetite shut

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:51.289 
hungry all the time so my appetite shut
up

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
up

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.300 
up
so<00:03:52.140> taking<00:03:52.500> something<00:03:52.650> like<00:03:52.739> a<00:03:52.830> weight<00:03:53.070> gainer

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
so taking something like a weight gainer

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.190 
so taking something like a weight gainer
which<00:03:53.489> had<00:03:53.730> plenty<00:03:54.390> of<00:03:54.510> calories<00:03:54.900> in<00:03:55.019> there's

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
which had plenty of calories in there's

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.410 
which had plenty of calories in there's
probably<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:55.560> good<00:03:55.650> idea<00:03:55.769> because<00:03:56.580> it's<00:03:57.180> hard

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
probably a good idea because it's hard

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.479 
probably a good idea because it's hard

three and a scoop post the serving size
is<00:04:35.009> two<00:04:35.340> but<00:04:35.610> I'd<00:04:35.669> never<00:04:35.789> put<00:04:36.030> two<00:04:36.210> in<00:04:36.360> there

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419
