00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.750
 hi guys that something you are 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.100
 welcome to point 5 x 1 I'm Fernando 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.810
 of the moral you already know that you can me 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.670
 find on my personal twitter at 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.650
 fernando 5 x 1 if you want to talk with me 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.660
 directly and if you want to follow all the 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.510
 topic of news and information you have the 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.249
 official account on twitter a little 5 x 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.220
 1 today I want to talk about my 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:27.130
 impressions about there are 28 after a 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.960
 week of use of this beta specifically 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.410
 I have tested it on my two devices 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.920
 apple ipad and iphone 5 printing 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.199
 in both, it is very logical, it is not 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.750
 a beta has class os apps that do not 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.850
 they work and something that to me especially the 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.219
 ipad hurts me a lot because the 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.530
 motive to the best of a non-developer 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.809
 that you can have when installing 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.300
 a beta is the fact of being able to 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.649
 try the new ones work 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.629
 functionalities that can have in the 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.410
 ipad is practically all layered be 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:01.030
 everything of siri I have not found like this 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.540
 great news about it 7.1 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.700
 point 1 except that you gràcia everything much and 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.780
 respect that the quick time keyboard does not 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.040
 it works and that is an inconvenience 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.170
 because on the ipad applications like page 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.810
 I use it daily for scripts not 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.310
 the keyboard works well to highlight 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.290
 the capitals and so on does not work like this 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.180
 that on the iPad er at least in the 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.680
 ipad I do not advise installing the first 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.600
 beta because as I say in beta one 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.400
 it's all busy on the ipad in the 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.900
 iphone yes you have all the 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.420
 functionalities as you want to say what 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:33.460
 that we were seeing in the wwdc 2014 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.049
 in whatsapp you have already heard and read 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.060
 by many places that much fails 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.320
 whatsapp and it's something that many 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.790
 users have complained but it is not 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.530
 it's appple thing is thing of the 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.939
 application itself that is not rewritten 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.950
 the new language and does that may or may not 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.409
 is adapted in an operating system not 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.740
 the first note highlighted because maybe 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.119
 at 8 is flawed compared to 7.1 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.850
 point 1 if it really has not changed 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.590
 both visually not precisely so 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.720
 I say because it is visually what is not 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.970
 has changed because internally the 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.500
 language in which the new one is written 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.869
 year is totally different with the 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.460
 new language suite what makes the 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.380
 final all this respect díaz although 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.750
 visually it seems the same inside 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.340
 it's completely different besides the 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.980
 developers are going to have a very 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.830
 important that's why I say that the best 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.540
 is to come in years 8 years 8 is a 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.890
 basis of what they will be able to do 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.660
 developers with their fantastic 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.830
 applications from now on with your 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.750
 widgets that they will be able to develop 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.940
 themselves and be able to implement in the 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.920
 Notification center and more 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.170
 functionalities such as 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.790
 apis of the cache and in short that is that a 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.769
 them on the doors to the imagination 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.670
 guys really it's very important what 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.910
 they have done 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.500
 in next veins it has been seen that in addition 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.450
 they will be uncovering new functions 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.040
 that are hidden right now in the 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.840
 beta 1 may therefore be present 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.599
 as a post for example something that I missed 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.380
 unless it was the possibility of 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.050
 customize them you see from the center of 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.340
 control has been discovered something that is not 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.530
 public can not see it to someone who does not 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.750
 be a new menu developer in the 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.790
 what theory can you activate and deactivate 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.440
 options for the control center something 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.989
 necessary and that it seems that in 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.630
 next sales will be available on 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.489
 famous way to record the screen of the 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.290
 iphone or the ipad seems to be that too 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.360
 will be available soon in 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.269
 next betas and here in pointed five 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.000
 for a we will be willing to try it 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:21.790
 guys the last question would I try the 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.010
 beta if it was not a world youtuber 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.840
 of apple that is if I were a user 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.200
 normal how can you be would try 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.319
 the beta does not 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.849
 according to the beta is unstable and although 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.830
 with native applications do not fail 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.269
 too much third - party applications 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.160
 yes they fail and that is the main 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.140
 problem that you are going to find the ones that 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.940
 surely you use apps that force you 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.340
 precisely to have to use others or 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.860
 directly back to 7.1 point 1 so 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.690
 that if you are normal users do not 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.160
 install jce we installed it for 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.410
 teach you functions but not for 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.840
 promote the installation according to that 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.250
 you have to make it clear so nothing 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.980
 guys when beta 2 will come out 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.540
 possibly to see if hit 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.190
 possibly early next 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.790
 week of agreement 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.720
 we have started week now possibly 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.299
 next week 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.920
 June 16, 17 we could see the 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.599
 update to beta 2 and here 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.880
 we will be in app 15 for some ready to 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.019
 tell you everything so guys I hope that 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.310
