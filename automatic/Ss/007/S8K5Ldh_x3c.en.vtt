00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.369
 huge hello to all dear friends 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.349
 Swami I pull on today we'll talk about 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:24.640
 new premium soviet sixth tank 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:26.439
 level t-34 85 guns or red he 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.150
 already familiar to many in the Polish TV series 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.759
 four troopers and a dog 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.270
 and yes guys in the crew members here have 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.390
 peach 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.059
 the ball is dedicated to all dog lovers 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.040
 as the developers say all of Berlin 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:43.570
 three and this one 485 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.520
 IS-2 guns and SU-122 will be weak 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.589
 differ from their pumped 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.170
 analogs or almost never will 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.399
 To be different it will please many now 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.190
 because everyone is used to that 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.140
 premium tanks are worse than pumped to 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.039
 don't be unfounded let's look at 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.120
 specifications 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:03.850
 red and compare with t-34 85 so here 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.610
 horses against engine 500 and at 600 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.120
 pumps over thirty four is not 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:14.110
 very good however cannon 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:19.840
 comes down faster 2 and 2 against 2 and 3 that 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:21.460
 already red pleases a little faster 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.659
 spinning in place and has 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:29.979
 Overview 365 meters and I want t-34 85 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:32.469
 360dp fill as much cash flow the same 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.049
 maximum speed is the same tanchiki 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:37.869
 each other just repeat armor 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:41.920
 absolutely no different except on 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:44.049
 turret t-34 85 turret turret 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.829
 a little more but who will be in it 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:50.439
 I do n't even know what to shoot next guys 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:53.520
 I propose to look at the fight to understand 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:56.409
 is it worth it a day by the way about the price 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.909
 Tanchik will cost 14 dollars 20 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.520
 cents will be available in premium 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.679
 store about a month then he forever 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.869
 all will disappear from the sale 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:08.330
 collectors hurry and the rest 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:11.540
 think you need it or not 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.990
 I repeat once again that the little tank is essentially not enough 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:18.620
 what is the difference from the t-34 85 engine a little 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:21.410
 a little worse and it is felt only then 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.780
 when tanchiki from uphill on a straight he 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.690
 Essentially picks up speed also tool 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:31.160
 more pleasant as it is reduced faster dbn 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.050
 the same break through the same review better 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.940
 who will tell us only 5 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.620
 meters however I want to notice if you 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.380
 pump over the eagle eye put and 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.270
 optics are still up to and who are these five meters 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.660
 will give you a sickly extra bonus 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.850
 which is in some kind of responsible 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.560
 moment when you on t-34 85 can not 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.390
 enough review here you suddenly it 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.930
 enough but you know what it is 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.670
 wbr how does it affect the game and how can 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:00.220
 affect the most filing reviews 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:03.320
 moment by the way t-34 85 is considered by many 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.980
 best medium tank so 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.380
 all lovers of t-34 85 who left u 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.350
 yourself in his hangar 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:15.410
 Definitely they will be given this tanchik but 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.209
 Now I think t-34 85 pass 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.530
 and since I rarely play sixth 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.209
 except for the levels except 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.110
 hellcat my time but even now I have it 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:26.989
 threw something red I probably would have bought 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.239
 just for the sake of the dog because it is the first 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:32.150
 and the only crew girls tank 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:35.209
 there is a dog but again all lovers 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.400
 dogs is dedicated and yes guys u also have 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:40.910
 Tanchika there is camouflage 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.890
 unique camouflage and by the way if suddenly 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.459
 you are a fan of the series four tankers and 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.090
 dog 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:50.269
 then ponastalgirovat and how on it 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.790
 play well if we win t-34 85 then 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.860
 the gameplay is no different except on 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.150
 maps like Himmelsdorf you have a little 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.590
 more time is needed to 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.750
 climb the mountain 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.910
 acts and tanchiki accounts carefully 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.430
 not particularly posing for his armor 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.739
 no gun mask will save you but not 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.739
 always a big com turret in principle 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:12.320
 will allow even a tank of fine level you 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.800
 punch there need to get a tanchik 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.100
 still immediate therefore 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:20.160
 it will not be difficult to get into corners 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.690
 may not be enough but if you played on 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.550
 Soviet tanks or on the same 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.840
 pumped over monologues then you have problems 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.330
 no will arise 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.160
 review is very very good it even 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.410
 stop playing with levels eight 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.260
 especially if you put optics 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.880
 and faster mixing tool 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.680
 affects the gameplay you require 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.050
 less time to come down 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.240
 and that means you will be eligible for the first 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.360
 shot when you meet the same 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.550
 t-34 85 basically on this review came up 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.440
 end write your opinion in the comments 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.090
 write who will buy it and who will not 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.220
 also do not forget to subscribe to 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.890
 channel and put huskies because it's like you 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.750
 know the best reward don't forget 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.500
 of course watching advertising is my 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:05.060
 the bread is on the screen 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.060
 bend over guys and happily
