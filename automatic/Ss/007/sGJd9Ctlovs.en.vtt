00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.130
 trophy that might compete for the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.130
 first places but after that 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.380

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.540

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.320
 for many parts very situations 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.020
 complicated for ranchers so 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.360
 you have to be very careful after we 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.640
 we moved back to the community of 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.460
 Yécora where it was already installed 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.520

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.690
 the turkeys are judged to see which 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.119
 are those that are in the first 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.720
 places are through a system of 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.780
 measurements first the weight of the animal in 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.970

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.420
 turkey and third the size of 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.600
 the spur the sum of all this we 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.180
 throws amounts of points that way 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.670
 individual are added together and this is why 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.119
 that the turkeys are regularly 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.740
 they put the good ones between 50 and 60 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.780
 points that are the ones that regularly 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.940
