00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
take a while for me to do it so that's a

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.400 
take a while for me to do it so that's a
lot<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.910> time<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.570> don't<00:00:45.899> want<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.140> spend

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
so I'm thinking about just kind of

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.799 
so I'm thinking about just kind of
letting<00:00:52.320> then<00:00:52.559> go<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.980> letting<00:00:53.190> my<00:00:53.430> hair<00:00:53.640> just

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809

you<00:00:54.809> know<00:00:54.930> lock<00:00:55.199> on<00:00:55.410> its<00:00:55.559> own<00:00:55.710> at<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.980> roots

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
you know lock on its own at the roots

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.430 
you know lock on its own at the roots
been<00:00:57.000> doing<00:00:57.270> some<00:00:57.420> research<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:58.230> thing

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
been doing some research the thing

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.260 
been doing some research the thing
that's<00:00:58.739> kind<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.219> holding<00:00:59.550> me<00:00:59.670> back<00:00:59.879> isn't

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
that's kind of holding me back isn't

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.119 
that's kind of holding me back isn't
right<00:01:00.420> now<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.530> found<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.890> about

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
right now is that I found it about

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.880 
right now is that I found it about
slapping<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.910> so<00:01:03.660> flapping<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.500> when<00:01:04.739> your

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
slapping and so flapping is when your

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.800 
slapping and so flapping is when your
locks<00:01:05.159> go<00:01:05.549> flat<00:01:06.030> because<00:01:06.390> you're<00:01:06.659> not

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
locks go flat because you're not

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.310 
locks go flat because you're not
manipulating<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.860> anymore<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.880> way<00:01:09.320> so

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
manipulating it anymore in that way so

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.469 
manipulating it anymore in that way so
I'm<00:01:10.979> going<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.189> do<00:01:11.310> some<00:01:11.490> more<00:01:11.520> research<00:01:11.820> to

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
I'm going to do some more research to

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.499 
I'm going to do some more research to
find<00:01:13.020> out<00:01:13.229> more<00:01:13.619> about<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.490> then<00:01:14.820> kind

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
find out more about that and then kind

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.300 
find out more about that and then kind
of<00:01:15.630> make<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.810> decision<00:01:16.409> as<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.680> whether<00:01:16.920> i<00:01:17.070> want

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.670 
of make a decision as to whether i want
to<00:01:17.369> do<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.729> or<00:01:17.970> not<00:01:19.850> another<00:01:20.850> thing<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:22.259> i

don't<00:01:53.220> know<00:01:53.340> if<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.549> can<00:01:53.610> show<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:55.850> have<00:01:56.850> a

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
don't know if I can show you I have a

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.569 
don't know if I can show you I have a
lot<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.119> fries<00:01:57.509> at<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.840> end<00:01:58.079> ons<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:59.159> lot<00:01:59.369> of

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
lot of fries at the end ons a lot of

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.639 
lot of fries at the end ons a lot of
them<00:01:59.759> but<00:02:00.450> here's<00:02:00.659> one<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.200> doesn't<00:02:01.619> have

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
them but here's one that doesn't have

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.480 
them but here's one that doesn't have
very<00:02:01.979> much<00:02:02.250> frizz<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:03.500> you<00:02:04.500> can<00:02:04.680> see<00:02:04.979> just<00:02:05.009> how

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
very much frizz and you can see just how

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.109 
very much frizz and you can see just how
it's<00:02:05.820> locking<00:02:06.180> up<00:02:06.450> on<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.689> in<00:02:06.869> there<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:08.119> think

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
it's locking up on the in there I think

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.960 
it's locking up on the in there I think
from<00:02:09.479> now<00:02:09.509> on

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
from now on

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.340 
from now on
since<00:02:11.970> I've<00:02:12.090> reached<00:02:12.330> my<00:02:12.510> two<00:02:12.570> years<00:02:13.050> that<00:02:13.230> I

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
since I've reached my two years that I

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.350 
since I've reached my two years that I
probably<00:02:13.620> won't<00:02:13.980> do<00:02:14.220> another<00:02:14.520> update<00:02:14.940> until<00:02:15.240> I

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
probably won't do another update until I

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.000 
probably won't do another update until I
my<00:02:15.510> three<00:02:15.750> years<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.350> just<00:02:16.500> do<00:02:16.680> them<00:02:16.860> every

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
my three years and just do them every

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.660 
my three years and just do them every
year<00:02:17.630> but<00:02:18.630> unless<00:02:19.020> something<00:02:19.680> major<00:02:19.710> comes<00:02:20.220> up

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
year but unless something major comes up

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.670 
year but unless something major comes up
like<00:02:20.910> maybe<00:02:21.180> when<00:02:21.450> all<00:02:21.600> my<00:02:21.780> ends<00:02:22.080> lock<00:02:22.440> or

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
like maybe when all my ends lock or

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.140 
like maybe when all my ends lock or
something<00:02:22.980> like<00:02:23.100> that<00:02:23.160> maybe<00:02:23.640> I'll<00:02:23.880> do<00:02:24.030> it

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
something like that maybe I'll do it

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.750 
something like that maybe I'll do it
update<00:02:24.620> but<00:02:25.620> other<00:02:25.770> than<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.040> just<00:02:26.160> done

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
update but other than that just done

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.060 
update but other than that just done
once<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.450> year<00:02:27.630> since<00:02:28.050> not<00:02:28.320> much<00:02:28.530> is<00:02:28.740> really

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
once a year since not much is really

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.770 
once a year since not much is really
going<00:02:29.310> on<00:02:29.930> as<00:02:30.930> far<00:02:31.020> as<00:02:31.260> my<00:02:31.380> hair<00:02:31.590> anything<00:02:32.780> i

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
going on as far as my hair anything i

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.510 
going on as far as my hair anything i
will<00:02:34.050> show<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:34.560> also<00:02:36.500> i<00:02:37.500> have<00:02:37.860> a<00:02:37.890> couple<00:02:38.370> of

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
will show you also i have a couple of

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.590 
will show you also i have a couple of
have<00:02:39.510> some<00:02:40.200> differences<00:02:40.650> in<00:02:41.070> sizing<00:02:41.790> this

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
have some differences in sizing this

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.140 
have some differences in sizing this
area<00:02:43.170> like<00:02:43.590> here<00:02:44.190> is<00:02:44.370> where<00:02:44.580> I<00:02:44.640> have<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:44.970> most

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
area like here is where I have the most

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.590 
area like here is where I have the most
density<00:02:45.840> of<00:02:45.870> hair<00:02:46.280> so<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.580> have<00:02:47.790> some<00:02:48.060> big<00:02:48.270> locks

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
density of hair so I have some big locks

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.400 
density of hair so I have some big locks
up<00:02:48.989> here<00:02:49.739> due<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.220> not<00:02:51.180> compensating<00:02:52.080> for<00:02:52.350> the

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
up here due to not compensating for the

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.150 
up here due to not compensating for the
size<00:02:52.800> of<00:02:53.430> them<00:02:53.930> size<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.200> base<00:02:55.410> when<00:02:55.860> i<00:02:55.980> was

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
size of them size of the base when i was

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.160 
size of them size of the base when i was
doing<00:02:56.340> them<00:02:56.700> because<00:02:56.940> of<00:02:57.180> how<00:02:57.480> much<00:02:57.660> hair<00:02:57.959> that

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
doing them because of how much hair that

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.990 
doing them because of how much hair that
is<00:02:58.200> there<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:59.209> then<00:03:00.209> this<00:03:00.660> one<00:03:00.739> is<00:03:02.000> my

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
is there and then this one is my

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.320 
is there and then this one is my
smallest<00:03:03.360> lock<00:03:04.220> it<00:03:05.220> would<00:03:05.880> have<00:03:06.090> been

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
smallest lock it would have been

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.960 
smallest lock it would have been
combined<00:03:06.900> with<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.470> hairs<00:03:07.770> on<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.730> locks

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
combined with the hairs on the locks

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.900 
combined with the hairs on the locks
next<00:03:09.660> to<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:10.110> if<00:03:10.350> i<00:03:10.650> combine<00:03:11.040> them<00:03:11.550> it<00:03:11.730> would

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
next to it if i combine them it would

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.850 
next to it if i combine them it would
have<00:03:12.000> made<00:03:12.150> it<00:03:12.330> too<00:03:12.630> big<00:03:12.660> so<00:03:13.260> i<00:03:13.320> decided<00:03:13.709> to

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
have made it too big so i decided to

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.490 
have made it too big so i decided to
just<00:03:13.980> leave<00:03:14.190> it<00:03:14.489> alone<00:03:15.140> so<00:03:16.140> i'll<00:03:16.290> show<00:03:16.440> you

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
just leave it alone so i'll show you

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.500 
just leave it alone so i'll show you
kind<00:03:16.830> of<00:03:16.890> side<00:03:17.160> by<00:03:17.370> side<00:03:17.700> kind<00:03:18.239> of<00:03:18.330> the

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
kind of side by side kind of the

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.229 
kind of side by side kind of the
difference<00:03:21.410> right<00:03:22.410> there<00:03:22.470> and<00:03:22.830> thickness<00:03:23.340> so

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
difference right there and thickness so

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.840 
difference right there and thickness so
we'll<00:03:24.630> see<00:03:24.840> what<00:03:24.989> happens<00:03:25.160> my<00:03:26.160> hair<00:03:26.400> is<00:03:26.519> still

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
we'll see what happens my hair is still

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.380 
we'll see what happens my hair is still
settling<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:27.660> doing<00:03:27.989> things<00:03:28.230> so<00:03:28.920> um<00:03:29.390> the

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
settling and doing things so um the

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.030 
settling and doing things so um the
possibility<00:03:31.200> they<00:03:31.380> won't<00:03:31.620> be<00:03:31.769> that

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
possibility they won't be that

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.340 
possibility they won't be that
drastically<00:03:32.640> different<00:03:33.510> in<00:03:33.630> thickness<00:03:34.080> I

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
drastically different in thickness I

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.050 
drastically different in thickness I
just<00:03:34.890> have<00:03:35.040> to<00:03:35.070> see<00:03:35.310> what<00:03:35.430> happens<00:03:35.489> because

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
just have to see what happens because

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.479 
just have to see what happens because
even<00:03:36.360> though<00:03:36.540> I'm<00:03:36.810> two<00:03:37.049> years<00:03:37.350> in<00:03:37.590> my<00:03:38.250> hair

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
even though I'm two years in my hair

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.449 
even though I'm two years in my hair
isn't<00:03:38.640> finished<00:03:39.560> kind<00:03:40.560> of<00:03:40.680> blocking<00:03:41.160> and

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
isn't finished kind of blocking and

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.800 
isn't finished kind of blocking and
doing<00:03:41.850> everything<00:03:41.970> is<00:03:42.420> trying<00:03:42.750> to<00:03:42.870> do<00:03:43.049> so

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
doing everything is trying to do so

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.270 
doing everything is trying to do so
that's<00:03:45.810> why<00:03:46.019> I'm<00:03:46.200> leaving<00:03:46.590> my<00:03:46.830> hair<00:03:47.010> long<00:03:47.220> and

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
just kind of watching and seeing what it

just kind of watching and seeing what it
does<00:03:50.010> I<00:03:51.709> see<00:03:53.239> I'll<00:03:54.239> SiC<00:03:54.870> do<00:03:55.110> with<00:03:55.410> 360<00:03:56.250> of<00:03:56.340> my

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
does I see I'll SiC do with 360 of my

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.410 
does I see I'll SiC do with 360 of my
hair<00:03:56.790> but<00:03:57.660> then<00:03:58.010> after<00:03:59.010> that<00:03:59.190> I<00:03:59.250> have<00:03:59.670> picture

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
hair but then after that I have picture

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.560 
hair but then after that I have picture
a<00:04:00.810> picture<00:04:01.530> slideshow<00:04:01.950> and<00:04:02.459> three<00:04:03.330> things

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
a picture slideshow and three things

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.830 
a picture slideshow and three things
I've<00:04:03.780> noticed<00:04:04.019> has<00:04:04.410> changed<00:04:04.980> over<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.310> year

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
I've noticed has changed over the year
