00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
designed and thought about from the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.020 
designed and thought about from the
driver<00:01:16.110> seat<00:01:16.350> outwards<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:17.490> really<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
driver seat outwards it really is the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.760 
driver seat outwards it really is the
driving<00:01:18.420> experience<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:19.290> we've<00:01:19.410> wanted<00:01:19.530> to

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
driving experience that we've wanted to

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.710 
driving experience that we've wanted to
major<00:01:20.010> on<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.430> think<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.700> styling<00:01:20.940> is

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
major on I think the styling is

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.560 
major on I think the styling is
fantastic<00:01:22.410> the<00:01:23.340> sound<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.730> the<00:01:23.850> car<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.240> also

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
fantastic the sound of the car is also

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.960 
fantastic the sound of the car is also
great<00:01:24.870> but<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.620> drive<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.100> for<00:01:26.370> me<00:01:26.490> as<00:01:26.700> you'd

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
great but the drive is for me as you'd

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.640 
great but the drive is for me as you'd
imagine<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.420> what<00:01:27.450> it's<00:01:27.690> all<00:01:27.810> about<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.350> we've

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
imagine is what it's all about so we've

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.710 
imagine is what it's all about so we've
really<00:01:28.800> paid<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> lot<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.490> attention<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:30.570> of

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
really paid a lot of attention to of

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.420 
really paid a lot of attention to of
course<00:01:30.930> what<00:01:31.230> the<00:01:31.350> cost<00:01:31.530> performance<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:32.220> like

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
course what the cost performance is like

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.120 
course what the cost performance is like
on<00:01:32.720> cornering<00:01:33.720> on<00:01:33.900> acceleration<00:01:34.560> on<00:01:34.680> braking

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
on cornering on acceleration on braking

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.830 
on cornering on acceleration on braking
it<00:01:35.520> meets<00:01:35.730> very<00:01:35.910> high<00:01:36.090> targets<00:01:36.510> in<00:01:36.630> all<00:01:36.720> of

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
it meets very high targets in all of

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.140 
it meets very high targets in all of
those<00:01:36.930> areas<00:01:37.230> but<00:01:38.190> most<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.580> the<00:01:38.670> time<00:01:38.850> these

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
those areas but most of the time these

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.790
