00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.830
 hello in this video only very briefly 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:17.369
 Explains how to use your microsoft windows 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.470
 8 and windows 8.1 online account on her 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.449
 Windows can also use offline well 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.340
 or almost make an effort to get here 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.630
 whatever other problem is that 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.180
 Microsoft in the establishment of 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.669
 Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 do it 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.559
 urged to create an online account 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:33.420
 There was also the possibility of an offline 

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:35.010
 account to create the option is 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.160
 but very hidden and 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.960
 is therefore often overlooked 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.540
 problem with the online accounts is 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.770
 but if we are not right 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.450
 Internet connection have danzig windows 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.640
 ever around and does not let us 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.980
 only in our account that is 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.989
 as far as logical as the windows yes now 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.300
 can not check if that is from us 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.220
 entered login and password at all 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.809
 That's right, there were some here today 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.070
 e-mails to users of all not 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.590
 could more in their accounts 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.660
 whether that has something to do with the ssl gap 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.369
 has also occurred today 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.380
 or can not become known 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.390
 say with certainty but it is already 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.830
 a pretty big coincidence that the two 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.740
 points fall on each other 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.380
 However , how do we persuade ours? 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.830
 windows that we will continue to do so 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.840
 can use offline 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.640
 that we use an online account here 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.680
 we can see that under here 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.070
 our username an e mail address 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.670
 stands in this case old her svw 89 and 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.230
 so on 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.630
 Of course we have to do it again 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.710
 correctly log in so far it is so 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.270
 not if the child is already in the fountain 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.920
 has fallen and we have at all 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.450
 no possibility to log us 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.950
 we have to separate this here so 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.870
 make before 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.200
 that means I log in there now 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.200
 on 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:52.250
 the on the desktop but only around the 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.380
 then leave again because that was 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:02:02.179
 now strictly wrong we just look for 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:04.250
 with control fdf to get account 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.469
 We manage our own account as an option 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.920
 there we go and then we have 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:12.799
 here the option to disconnect because we click 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:18.980
 then it must be the current password 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:21.230
 specify once again send off and now 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.670
 the corresponding names so i have 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.680
 no touchscreen that's why I get 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.670
 that here not go away because we have now 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.520
 just live with 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.870
 one of these great news no matter 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.120
 now the corresponding names 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.860
 and we also enter data with the 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.780
 want to have linked local account 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:42.140
 So user name in my case something 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:44.680
 a few video password 123456 123456 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.360
 password note 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:53.640
 1 to 6 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.650
 continue to unsubscribe and that's it 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.540
 local could prepared north one 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.830
 second 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.830
 we will be automatically informed 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:09.769
 and now we can hereby 123456 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.769
 Sign in 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:18.630
 and that was it in the end one more 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.150
 small note if you have some data 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.630
 saved only on the online account 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.270
 had 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.800
 of course, then the data is not now 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.180
 more available on your computer 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.150
 they would then have to over for example 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.620
 Download the firefox still by hand 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.820
 the data is by no means lost 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.380
 they're just not on the road anymore 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.390
 We have the strictest calculator 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.070
 just created a new account and that 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.340
 Of course, as usual under windows 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.990
 always quite empty therefore insofar 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.460
 then, for example, about the firefox altogether 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.960
 normal access and the data 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.540
 download if any there 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.500
 anything should be possible you can 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.270
 of course, whole story too 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.350
 easily turn back again 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:58.230
 For example, I'm looking over again 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.250
 need my magnifying glass look again account 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.260
 enter 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.150
 manage their own account 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.159
 then I take here now local 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.200
 account and with a microsoft account 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:11.209
 you click on that link 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.959
 current password of this local 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.959
 enter account 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.239
 so can 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.530
 with the e- mail address we have in front 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.759
 have seen and accordingly 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.410
 login password 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:27.509
 then we will be online again 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.280
 account then the data are back again 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:31.710
 they will be downloaded 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.280
 for us or are available to call 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.780
 ready 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.150
 in the worst case then stop on the 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.039
 outsource usb-stick and then the again 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.160
 Turning back history is therefore quite 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.160
 easy
