00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.240
 we came to Andalusia to look for the sun and that's two 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.900
 days that can continuously for testing the new audi a8 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:32.960
 mua 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.960

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.660
 this new generation of the a8 the conference is the bmw series 7 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.870
 what foot to dance ago and the oldest to what happens 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.870
 not to mention the psol of their feet lexus ls 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.250
 hospital officials 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.890
 we presented the new a8 as a sports car in fact she 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.570
 has dynamic qualities quite in the norm but by ap so much at 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.670
 on top of a bmw series 7 on this first try it's hard to say six to 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.160
 eight at the level of behavior 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.390
 or that comfort is above his rivals 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.920
 on the other hand there is one thing that is sure is that engine performance 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.230
 as well 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.710
 the pessimists of the 8 gasoline or diesel 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.869
 is above the lot compared to the previous generation 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.390
 'thanks in particular 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.350
 to lighten the structure that is always 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.130
 to the new 8-speed gearbox 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.590
 and at work on the engine we come to emissions 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.939
 and a consumption which on average decreases on all the engines of 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.570
 18% 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.810
 inside the new a8 c just as qualitatively as on the old 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.920
 both in terms of materials 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.840
 than assembly that is almost perfect 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.240
 which is rare noticeably evolved 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.149
 compared to the previous paris 8 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.129
 the design kiffer than hell more in a cocoon we will also notice that the 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.809
 new 8-speed automatic transmission 

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:20.959
 fail baloi elsewhere 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.760
 it takes up much less space since it only takes the impetus for the 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.669
 manipulate 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:27.519
 and who need more space 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.129
 for other elements on the center console 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.469
 among the novelties aboard the new a8 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:36.609
 we note the hamas but all that can be understood and mother abakar black 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.269
 who 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.549
 to make all the settings at the level of navigation with the era of 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:42.849
 car features 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:43.739
 sfr 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.450
 the instrument cluster there is still visible German between 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.380
 both counters 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.739
 we have a new computer 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.669
 any footballer 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:55.810
 as much information as before if not more 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.309
 and we also lose the comfort 

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:02.609
 heddebault Basel it can even become exceptional 6 choose 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.869
 and good option 

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:06.109
 for example 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:09.009
 4 pm final 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:13.419
 for habitability it is good but there no longer not exceptional for those 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:17.829
 who want more it will be necessary to wait for the extended version which will be available 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.829
 by the end of the year 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:28.329
 honda handling of the new audi a8 yes of course it would be good 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:29.989
 The behaviour 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.760
 more enjoyable than before then this fight 60% of the group in time 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.760
 normal on the rear wheel this meaning to all our players 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.000
 an intolerable behavior so we tried the three engines of 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:44.349
 the limit 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.459
 in 2008 the v8 petrol 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.379
 I very very well but there is a small problem 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.590
 it's common sense prevail and higher average consumption 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.149
 independent for adults these countries 

00:03:58.149 --> 00:04:01.939
 the 350 horses seem to have taken the huge couple 

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:07.809
 also very quiet read alas find themselves private - mayor - of 

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:08.669
 society 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:11.679
 for the pole tv line I have a little noisier than the v8 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:13.639
 this said 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:18.349
 the test of the widest with this first tdi jump of 250 horses 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.970
 if we do not deprive ourselves above all to spend 14 average otherwise it is 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.970
 quite possible to stay around 18h 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.690
 the new audi a8 will be marketed in France from April 8th but there 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.919
 it will only be with the v8 versions for the first of the 6 tdi 250 horsepower 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.110
 it will be necessary to wait until June 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.060
 in this version the marcquois 82 thousand euros for v8 engines 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.740
 as well as rebirth 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.530
 the weight of years we are just below the bar of 100000 euros 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.180
 in basic version to refine it on the buzz 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.120
 which is available for all engines 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.750
 12000 euros extra at these prices there we can decorate 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:06.620
 the new a8 a multitude of options 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.630
 and especially we found one concerns this culture to more than 18000 euros 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:13.560
 You can not stop progress
