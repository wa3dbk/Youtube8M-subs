00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.440
 hello today we are going to change the country if 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.320
 we are not in Spain we have 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.470
 moved to england are for example 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.810
 in london and it's around 3 in the 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:20.470
 late and the sacred moment has arrived 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.540
 of British tea tea that ritual that 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.890
 you all know and how good we are going to 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.750
 try to do it and make us very 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.119
 well and we will do very well because it's going 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.910
 to do this ritual our cousin from 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.280
 primita pigeon is very easy but also 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.950
 it is a very healthy very rich drink there is 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.100
 to say silvia and you know very well that 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:41.410
 tea is the second drink that is most 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.990
 baby is taken in the world that is 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.580
 curious after the water 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.130
 effectively and the country where most 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:51.340
 consume is ireland ireland ireland 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:54.490
 they are also consumed in all of China 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.750
 Japan Korea in the Arab world also and 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.730
 good all the countries of the 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.920
 commonwealth and every time is a drink 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.050
 well let's say more extended and also very 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.910
 healthy very rich then we are going to 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.800
 explain what is necessary for a tea 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.480
 English 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.640
 for us two we are going to put three 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.640
 black tea bags that is tea 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.220
 usual two teapots and then 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.980
 we will explain why two a jug with 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.660
 cold milk 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:23.600
 a sugar was lemon optional and good 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.200
 some cups and the thinner the better 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.490
 rich 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.500
 Well, I'm not wanting to know anything 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.450
 how are the ones proposed for the steps 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.370
 they are important and there are details that 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.810
 Sometimes we run away with 20 and know 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.880
 and that everyone is there because there we are going to 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.160
 analyze them in principle we take then 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.490
 a teapot and what we are going to do is 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.650
 temper the kettle I will put the water 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.900
 warm temper 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.810
 so that the container our cold 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.900
 let's actually touch and see that 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.780
 the recipient has lost the coldness the 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.090
 porcelain has lost to the brakes now it's 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.520
 when it is well this is done then for 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.650
 that the hot water stays better and 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.940
 for another reason the English teapots 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.360
 traditionally the English portion 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.369
 It is very thin to avoid breaking the 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.820
 pileup right now the abrupt change of 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.500
 temperature could burst now 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.450
 What I have done is put all three 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.550
 tea bags 6 medium first thing what 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.160
 first if we are two we have to put three 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.890
 my because you always have to put a 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.570
 more so that it is not lost so that the 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.130
 flavor be concentrated and now what 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:30.800
 let's do is 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.800
 hot water water that is boiling 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.930
 perfect 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:46.040
 what we do 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.570
 we cover the teapot and let it rest 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.580
 between 3 and 5 minutes 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.250
 I'm going to tell you a very short story very 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.140
 short in that dream inside the can not 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.790
 is that we care if that bothers you 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.230
 happens after bridges you tell me 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.630
 I sent a little message I shut up but it is that 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.250
 I like to tell things for example 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.440
 you know the origin of the theater we already know 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.120
 that is from china as an emperor a 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.000
 Chinese emperor who was very neat very 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.060
 very neat neat very worried about the 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.760
 health hygiene he liked to be 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.459
 served the water he drank to drink and 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.320
 one day I was taking is about to 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.100
 take the one that was already hot from 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.050
 Warm but not burning it fell out of a 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.209
 tree a tree a bush a leaf 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.430
 that fell into that warm water 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.040
 warm I was going to take and suddenly 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.830
 that water took a flavor and a color 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.840
 special that that man loved 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.670
 emperor since then he decided that 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.560
 I always wanted to take the water with you 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.320
 little leaf inside leaf that evidently 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.840
 in algete and from there to notice you liked it 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.549
 to me very much and you curious that we are going to 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.500
 wait two more minutes we wait for a 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:51.350
 little since they have already passed between 3 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.840
 5 minutes we have this ready and now 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.870
 you have to tell us pigeon that of the 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.640
 2 teapots effectively surprises but 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.410
 this teapot that we have here full of 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.030
 boiling water is a teapot that 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.220
 it simply is as support as 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.020
 reinforcement if someone likes the subject 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.150
 it is clear what you have to do next 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.340
 to be served is to rinse it with water 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.630
 this third so that each one what 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.570
 can take it to your liking this is the 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.280
 basic function of this teapot then 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.269
 now if you want we do not serve tea 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.130
 Silvia 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.959
 There is one thing that has told us that 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.180
 it seems interesting you should never move 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.310
 the tea bags are all very dice 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.460
 whether they are made as a teapot or made 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:31.730
 in a cup to pull a thread and mobile not 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.830
 is a reflex act of charged not the 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.530
 bag should rest and water otherwise 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.419
 boiling that we have done must throw up 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.460
 a little bit must be thrown from above 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.470
 so that the water does not demand me there is 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.870
 catch your bubbles as power of the 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.480
 flavor and there we let it rest and now 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:51.440
 we do not know good now it's our turn 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:54.000
