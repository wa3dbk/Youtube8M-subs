and<00:01:06.440> it's<00:01:06.590> only<00:01:06.770> a<00:01:06.860> half<00:01:07.160> keel<00:01:07.460> I'll<00:01:07.970> actually

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
and it's only a half keel I'll actually

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.960 
and it's only a half keel I'll actually
get<00:01:08.510> a<00:01:08.570> new<00:01:08.810> pump<00:01:09.110> a<00:01:09.440> more<00:01:09.740> powerful<00:01:10.430> pump

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
get a new pump a more powerful pump

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.030 
get a new pump a more powerful pump
later<00:01:11.240> on<00:01:11.450> because<00:01:11.810> I'm<00:01:12.470> just<00:01:12.680> not<00:01:12.800> getting

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
later on because I'm just not getting

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.980 
later on because I'm just not getting
the<00:01:13.130> push<00:01:13.430> from<00:01:13.670> this<00:01:13.910> pump<00:01:14.180> that<00:01:14.600> I<00:01:14.660> was

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
the push from this pump that I was

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.660 
the push from this pump that I was
hoping<00:01:15.350> to<00:01:15.560> especially<00:01:15.890> since<00:01:16.250> I've<00:01:16.370> had<00:01:16.490> to

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
hoping to especially since I've had to

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.030 
hoping to especially since I've had to
split<00:01:16.910> the<00:01:17.090> feed<00:01:17.360> into<00:01:17.720> the<00:01:17.750> refugium<00:01:18.290> to

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
split the feed into the refugium to

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.140 
split the feed into the refugium to
cycle<00:01:19.400> water<00:01:19.580> through<00:01:19.940> there<00:01:20.560> um<00:01:21.729> yes<00:01:22.729> i<00:01:22.940> did

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.730 
cycle water through there um yes i did
move<00:01:23.300> the<00:01:23.450> rocks<00:01:23.660> around<00:01:23.930> one<00:01:24.140> more<00:01:24.290> time<00:01:24.350> I

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
it's too much fun trying to figure out

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.109 
it's too much fun trying to figure out
the<00:01:29.600> best<00:01:29.900> the<00:01:30.860> best<00:01:31.070> and<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:31.430> most<00:01:31.520> prettiest

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
the best the best and the most prettiest

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.140 
the best the best and the most prettiest
and<00:01:32.500> no<00:01:33.500> convenient<00:01:34.250> set<00:01:34.700> up<00:01:34.850> for<00:01:35.030> your

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
and no convenient set up for your

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.560 
and no convenient set up for your
aquarium<00:01:35.300> but<00:01:36.820> next<00:01:37.820> week<00:01:38.000> I'm<00:01:38.270> getting<00:01:38.479> the

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
aquarium but next week I'm getting the

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.359 
aquarium but next week I'm getting the
corals<00:01:38.930> so<00:01:39.140> I<00:01:39.380> think<00:01:39.590> this<00:01:39.860> will<00:01:40.009> be<00:01:40.070> the<00:01:40.220> last

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
corals so I think this will be the last

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.440 
corals so I think this will be the last
set<00:01:40.670> up<00:01:41.619> I've<00:01:42.619> got<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:43.580> ones<00:01:43.759> that<00:01:43.970> like<00:01:44.119> light

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
set up I've got the ones that like light

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.330 
set up I've got the ones that like light
they'll<00:01:44.720> be<00:01:44.810> going<00:01:44.930> up<00:01:45.170> there<00:01:45.470> some<00:01:46.160> of<00:01:46.280> the

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
they'll be going up there some of the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.490 
they'll be going up there some of the
less<00:01:46.520> light<00:01:46.729> intensive<00:01:47.330> corals<00:01:48.200> will<00:01:48.410> be

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
less light intensive corals will be

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.550 
less light intensive corals will be
going<00:01:48.710> along<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:49.130> second<00:01:49.610> row<00:01:49.790> and<00:01:50.090> then<00:01:50.780> some

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
going along the second row and then some

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.109 
going along the second row and then some
of<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:51.740> more<00:01:51.950> tricky<00:01:52.460> ones<00:01:52.640> would<00:01:52.850> we<00:01:52.940> going

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
of the more tricky ones would we going

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.080 
of the more tricky ones would we going
around<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:53.479> bottom<00:01:54.220> not<00:01:55.220> so<00:01:55.430> light<00:01:55.640> sensitive

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
around the bottom not so light sensitive

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.749 
around the bottom not so light sensitive
not<00:01:56.330> so<00:01:56.509> flow<00:01:56.750> sensitive<00:01:57.290> and<00:01:57.560> a<00:01:58.100> couple<00:01:58.580> of

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
not so flow sensitive and a couple of

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.580 
not so flow sensitive and a couple of
them<00:01:58.910> can<00:01:59.450> be<00:01:59.630> aggressive<00:01:59.869> so<00:02:00.290> they<00:02:00.410> need<00:02:00.560> a

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
them can be aggressive so they need a

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.469 
them can be aggressive so they need a
little<00:02:00.740> bit<00:02:00.950> of<00:02:01.009> room<00:02:01.280> so<00:02:01.550> i'll<00:02:02.180> be<00:02:02.270> putting

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
little bit of room so i'll be putting

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:03.850 
little bit of room so i'll be putting
them<00:02:02.660> along<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:03.050> bottom<00:02:03.229> and<00:02:03.440> they're<00:02:03.590> okay

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
system these are just three ketchup

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.410 
system these are just three ketchup
bottles<00:04:01.100> that<00:04:01.220> actually<00:04:01.610> have<00:04:01.820> measurements

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
bottles that actually have measurements

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.870 
bottles that actually have measurements
on<00:04:02.540> them<00:04:02.720> I<00:04:02.840> don't<00:04:03.020> know<00:04:03.110> if<00:04:03.230> you<00:04:03.320> can<00:04:03.670> see<00:04:04.670> what

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
on them I don't know if you can see what

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.350 
on them I don't know if you can see what
they<00:04:04.970> have<00:04:05.090> measurements<00:04:06.940> I've<00:04:07.940> connected

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
they have measurements I've connected

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.690 
they have measurements I've connected
little<00:04:09.080> piece<00:04:09.230> of<00:04:09.350> tubing<00:04:09.620> at<00:04:09.770> the<00:04:09.860> end<00:04:10.010> to<00:04:10.670> a

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
little piece of tubing at the end to a

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.210 
little piece of tubing at the end to a

tubing<00:04:13.550> that<00:04:14.270> will<00:04:14.450> drip<00:04:14.630> my<00:04:14.780> solutions<00:04:15.260> into

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
tubing that will drip my solutions into

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.660 
tubing that will drip my solutions into
the<00:04:15.950> tank<00:04:16.160> and<00:04:17.120> a<00:04:17.239> nice<00:04:17.420> low<00:04:17.630> rate<00:04:18.400> my<00:04:19.400> test

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:19.670 
the tank and a nice low rate my test

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.480 
the tank and a nice low rate my test
gets<00:04:19.880> right<00:04:20.060> now<00:04:20.209> aren't<00:04:20.420> very<00:04:20.630> reliable

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:21.490 
gets right now aren't very reliable

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:23.950 
gets right now aren't very reliable
between<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:22.580> two<00:04:22.760> I<00:04:22.790> have<00:04:23.150> all<00:04:23.510> the<00:04:23.780> levels

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
between the two I have all the levels

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.990 
between the two I have all the levels
seem<00:04:24.260> fine<00:04:24.560> so<00:04:24.860> I<00:04:24.890> really<00:04:25.430> don't<00:04:25.610> have<00:04:25.670> a<00:04:25.760> need

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
seem fine so I really don't have a need

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.659 
seem fine so I really don't have a need
to<00:04:26.030> dose<00:04:26.360> right<00:04:26.600> now<00:04:26.840> but<00:04:27.800> I'm<00:04:28.040> hoping<00:04:28.400> to<00:04:28.520> get

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
to dose right now but I'm hoping to get

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:31.710 
to dose right now but I'm hoping to get
some<00:04:28.940> more<00:04:29.540> accurate<00:04:29.960> test<00:04:30.200> kits<00:04:30.470> next<00:04:31.010> payday

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
some more accurate test kits next payday

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.290 
some more accurate test kits next payday
I've<00:04:32.720> got<00:04:32.990> some<00:04:33.550> macro<00:04:34.550> algae<00:04:34.760> in<00:04:35.240> the

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
I've got some macro algae in the

I've got some macro algae in the
refugium<00:04:36.200> now<00:04:38.440> see<00:04:39.440> this<00:04:39.970> will<00:04:40.970> break<00:04:41.210> the

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
refugium now see this will break the

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.880 
refugium now see this will break the
camera<00:04:41.810> trying<00:04:42.050> to<00:04:42.110> shove<00:04:42.410> in<00:04:42.620> this<00:04:42.770> small

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
space there it is yeah and turn the

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.390 
space there it is yeah and turn the
lights<00:04:47.330> off<00:04:47.480> and<00:04:47.900> if<00:04:48.020> you<00:04:48.050> push<00:04:48.860> that<00:04:49.040> around

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
lights off and if you push that around

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.020 
lights off and if you push that around
you'll<00:04:49.640> see<00:04:49.669> a<00:04:50.060> little<00:04:50.900> copepods<00:04:51.530> and<00:04:52.030> all

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
you'll see a little copepods and all

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.450 
you'll see a little copepods and all
sorts<00:04:53.360> of<00:04:53.419> cool<00:04:54.410> little<00:04:54.680> shrimp<00:04:55.070> looking

things<00:04:55.730> scurry<00:04:56.630> out<00:04:56.750> run<00:04:57.320> around<00:04:57.650> you<00:04:58.430> know

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
things scurry out run around you know

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.850 
things scurry out run around you know
danger<00:04:59.060> danger<00:04:59.510> but<00:05:00.410> they're<00:05:00.590> pretty<00:05:00.800> awesome

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
danger danger but they're pretty awesome

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.120 
danger danger but they're pretty awesome
so<00:05:01.730> and<00:05:02.180> here<00:05:02.630> hopefully<00:05:03.050> they'll<00:05:03.290> thrive<00:05:03.650> and

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
so and here hopefully they'll thrive and

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.909 
so and here hopefully they'll thrive and
grow<00:05:04.340> I'll<00:05:04.970> probably<00:05:05.240> get<00:05:05.450> some

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
grow I'll probably get some

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.500 
grow I'll probably get some
phytoplankton<00:05:06.919> and<00:05:07.310> throw<00:05:08.030> it<00:05:08.150> in<00:05:08.240> there<00:05:08.480> and

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
phytoplankton and throw it in there and

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.200 
phytoplankton and throw it in there and
they<00:05:09.350> can<00:05:09.500> feed<00:05:09.830> and<00:05:10.070> grow<00:05:10.760> and<00:05:10.970> eventually

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
they can feed and grow and eventually

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.659 
they can feed and grow and eventually
they<00:05:11.600> can<00:05:11.810> be<00:05:12.440> food<00:05:12.710> for<00:05:12.740> my<00:05:13.040> corals<00:05:13.460> and

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
they can be food for my corals and

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.180 
they can be food for my corals and
whatnot<00:05:14.540> so<00:05:14.570> I<00:05:14.750> don't<00:05:14.990> have<00:05:15.110> to<00:05:15.200> rush<00:05:15.560> to<00:05:15.590> feed

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
whatnot so I don't have to rush to feed

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.960 
whatnot so I don't have to rush to feed
my<00:05:16.370> tank<00:05:16.640> all<00:05:16.820> the<00:05:16.970> time<00:05:18.130> I've<00:05:19.130> stuck<00:05:19.669> in<00:05:19.850> the

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
my tank all the time I've stuck in the

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.870 
my tank all the time I've stuck in the
Nano<00:05:20.180> skimmer<00:05:20.570> I<00:05:21.130> threw<00:05:22.130> it<00:05:22.250> in<00:05:22.370> last<00:05:22.610> night

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
Nano skimmer I threw it in last night

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.760 
Nano skimmer I threw it in last night
I'm<00:05:23.750> just

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
I'm just

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.559 
I'm just
slowly<00:05:25.250> getting<00:05:25.610> used<00:05:25.759> to<00:05:26.060> how<00:05:26.180> to<00:05:26.240> calibrate

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:26.569 
slowly getting used to how to calibrate

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:30.309 
slowly getting used to how to calibrate
this<00:05:26.990> thing<00:05:27.759> I<00:05:28.759> just<00:05:29.300> emptied<00:05:29.690> the<00:05:29.870> container

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:30.319 
this thing I just emptied the container

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:32.830 
this thing I just emptied the container
there<00:05:30.590> was<00:05:30.740> a<00:05:30.770> little<00:05:31.009> bit<00:05:31.220> of<00:05:31.569> grunge<00:05:32.569> in

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
there was a little bit of grunge in

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.830 
there was a little bit of grunge in
there<00:05:33.080> it's<00:05:33.889> it's<00:05:34.430> doing<00:05:34.789> okay<00:05:35.090> actually<00:05:35.389> I

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
there it's it's doing okay actually I

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.649 
there it's it's doing okay actually I
had<00:05:36.319> to<00:05:36.440> modify<00:05:36.650> it<00:05:36.919> a<00:05:37.039> bit<00:05:37.069> because<00:05:37.370> it<00:05:38.360> wasn't

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:38.659 
had to modify it a bit because it wasn't

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:40.330 
had to modify it a bit because it wasn't
working<00:05:38.690> out<00:05:38.960> so<00:05:39.020> well<00:05:39.169> I<00:05:39.650> had<00:05:40.069> to<00:05:40.159> put<00:05:40.310> a

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
working out so well I had to put a

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.909 
working out so well I had to put a
regular<00:05:40.759> airline<00:05:40.970> tubing<00:05:41.419> down<00:05:41.830> into<00:05:42.830> the

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 
regular airline tubing down into the

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:44.439 
regular airline tubing down into the
pump<00:05:43.159> because<00:05:43.430> the<00:05:43.789> one<00:05:43.909> that<00:05:44.060> came<00:05:44.210> with<00:05:44.419> it

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:44.449 
pump because the one that came with it

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:46.240 
pump because the one that came with it
was<00:05:44.690> just<00:05:44.870> too<00:05:45.169> small<00:05:45.440> wasn't<00:05:45.770> sucking<00:05:45.979> any

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
was just too small wasn't sucking any

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.369 
was just too small wasn't sucking any
air<00:05:46.460> making<00:05:46.669> bubbles<00:05:47.090> so<00:05:47.870> I've<00:05:47.960> got<00:05:48.110> a<00:05:48.139> nice

00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:48.379 
air making bubbles so I've got a nice

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:51.969 
air making bubbles so I've got a nice
airline<00:05:48.860> tube<00:05:49.099> and<00:05:49.750> if<00:05:50.750> you<00:05:50.990> ever<00:05:51.289> get<00:05:51.800> the

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
airline tube and if you ever get the

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:55.029 
airline tube and if you ever get the
same<00:05:52.220> skimmer<00:05:52.970> from<00:05:53.240> ebay<00:05:53.629> just<00:05:54.409> put<00:05:54.650> a<00:05:54.680> long

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:55.039 
same skimmer from ebay just put a long

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:58.330 
same skimmer from ebay just put a long
tube<00:05:55.400> on<00:05:55.610> it<00:05:55.759> and<00:05:55.909> it<00:05:56.060> stops<00:05:56.389> the<00:05:57.130> stop<00:05:58.130> the

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
tube on it and it stops the stop the

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.430 
tube on it and it stops the stop the
sucking<00:05:58.729> sound<00:05:58.970> of<00:05:59.090> muffles<00:05:59.479> it<00:05:59.659> works<00:06:00.259> out

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
sucking sound of muffles it works out

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.490

moving<00:06:03.770> along<00:06:03.800> fine<00:06:04.280> my<00:06:05.000> heater<00:06:05.330> is<00:06:05.949> just<00:06:06.949> a

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
moving along fine my heater is just a

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.879 
moving along fine my heater is just a
pain<00:06:07.909> in<00:06:08.030> the<00:06:08.060> ass<00:06:08.270> these<00:06:08.569> days<00:06:08.780> it<00:06:09.050> fluctuates

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:09.889 
pain in the ass these days it fluctuates

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:12.760 
pain in the ass these days it fluctuates
all<00:06:10.099> the<00:06:10.250> time<00:06:10.840> one<00:06:11.840> day<00:06:11.990> I'll<00:06:12.080> come<00:06:12.289> home<00:06:12.530> and

all the time one day I'll come home and

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.820 
all the time one day I'll come home and
my<00:06:13.099> tank<00:06:13.310> will<00:06:13.460> be<00:06:13.550> sitting<00:06:13.729> at<00:06:13.940> 83<00:06:14.509> and<00:06:15.229> then

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
my tank will be sitting at 83 and then

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.680 
my tank will be sitting at 83 and then
the<00:06:16.190> next<00:06:16.280> day<00:06:16.520> I'll<00:06:16.669> come<00:06:16.909> home<00:06:17.120> my<00:06:17.300> tank<00:06:17.599> will

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
the next day I'll come home my tank will

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.649 
the next day I'll come home my tank will
be<00:06:17.780> sitting<00:06:17.990> at<00:06:18.199> 75<00:06:18.770> so<00:06:19.190> I'm<00:06:20.060> trying<00:06:20.300> to<00:06:20.419> figure

00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:20.659 
be sitting at 75 so I'm trying to figure

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:22.209 
be sitting at 75 so I'm trying to figure
out<00:06:20.690> a<00:06:20.840> position<00:06:21.349> in<00:06:21.469> a<00:06:21.560> way<00:06:21.740> that<00:06:21.949> will<00:06:22.039> keep

00:06:22.209 --> 00:06:22.219 
out a position in a way that will keep

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:24.909 
out a position in a way that will keep
it<00:06:22.479> steady<00:06:23.479> I<00:06:23.780> think<00:06:24.080> I<00:06:24.169> finally<00:06:24.409> figured<00:06:24.590> it

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 
it steady I think I finally figured it

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:26.999 
it steady I think I finally figured it
out<00:06:25.009> just<00:06:25.219> by<00:06:25.520> putting<00:06:25.789> it<00:06:25.940> on<00:06:26.090> the<00:06:26.120> surface<00:06:26.750> of

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:27.009 
out just by putting it on the surface of

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:30.879 
out just by putting it on the surface of
the<00:06:28.009> second<00:06:28.430> section<00:06:28.639> of<00:06:28.880> my<00:06:29.000> some<00:06:29.599> here<00:06:29.930> so

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:30.889 
the second section of my some here so

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:32.439 
the second section of my some here so
far<00:06:31.130> it<00:06:31.250> only<00:06:31.370> goes<00:06:31.580> on<00:06:31.789> when<00:06:31.940> it<00:06:32.060> needs<00:06:32.240> doing

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:32.449 
far it only goes on when it needs doing

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:34.149 
far it only goes on when it needs doing
the<00:06:32.659> temperature<00:06:33.139> has<00:06:33.229> been<00:06:33.259> pretty<00:06:33.530> constant

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:34.159 
the temperature has been pretty constant

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:38.260 
the temperature has been pretty constant
at<00:06:34.250> 79<00:06:34.880> 281<00:06:35.770> but<00:06:36.770> yeah<00:06:36.919> the<00:06:37.219> little<00:06:37.729> skimmers

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.430 
at 79 281 but yeah the little skimmers
