00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello to all I am jaumÃ¡ welcome to 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.150
 block number 7 of I'm geek and if he does 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.890
 enough that it did not record but in short 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.639
 they say it's better late than never 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.639
 that we go there 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.719
 do not 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.350
 as many of you will already know recently was the 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.060
 greeting of the sleeve and no I am not going to speak to you 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.560
 of how the room was and everything that happened 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.570
 there for that you already have the networks 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.730
 social you put a stack manga lounge 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.770
 and you will find out about everything but yes that 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.240
 I will recommend three things to read me 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.310
 encouraged to re-record and record this 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.960
 blog because my partner edu that that for 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.300
 here below in the description you have the 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.770
 channel asked me if I could 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.870
 recommend some manga to read because 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.850
 I had not read manga for a long time 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.680
 wanted or not to do it to us 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.570
 I recommended one of the sleeves that I'm going to 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.160
 recommend also in this blog but you 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.630
 I will recommend to you also two 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.400
 more tidbits that there is a little more 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.580
 variety I will not classify in three 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.740
 different levels level one for people 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.470
 who has never read manga or who has read 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.060
 little manga and wants to reread manga 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.430
 but he also does not want to complicate himself 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.739
 too much neither the sector shacks nor anything 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.080
 that is very heavy in level 2 os 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.659
 I'm going to recommend a manga that is 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.280
 pretty well known but maybe if this one is 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.799
 a little disconnected from the point maÃ±a no 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.850
 it's going to sound or maybe a hearsay 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.170
 only but good 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.180
 I'm going to recommend it for sure 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.180
 like a lot although it is somewhat heavier 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.280
 the level and the level 3 more 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.190
 a sleeves I will recommend a book that 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.350
 for manga people let's say to people who 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.390
 he likes japan and all the culture 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.460
 Japanese with which the manga would be 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.460
 encompassed within this we go there 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.179
 this manga called the holidays of 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.789
 jesus and buddha tells the story of jesus 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.520
 and Buddha the super powerful gods 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.920
 supreme of the religion that decide 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.840
 get off the sky and share floor in 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.539
 Tokyo as you can see the drawing is 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.819
 pretty simple with some very lines 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.100
 is not left clean easily read no 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:04.590
 it has too much text but still good 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.539
 the story is curious is not that it is not 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.039
 follow a linear story or anything 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.140
 like but are rather stories 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.690
 short that are happening to both 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.370
 characters and good cause moments 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.530
 funny 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.540
 do not 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.010
 here in Spain at the moment there are only seven 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.630
 tomos unless while I'm 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.790
 recording this video they have already released another 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.770
 that this last week has already come out another 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.630
 and I have not found out nothing happens but 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.220
 well it 's pretty good the truth is 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.690
 that is a little bit because it's eight 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.640
 euros per volume but the truth is that 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.800
 it 's worth it because it's entertaining 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.930
 different manga is not fighting is not 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.270
 sport is not teenagers tell them 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.340
 They are two are two gods 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.580
 in a messy way and for someone who does not 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.959
 he likes religion like I do not like 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.180
 I'm going to enjoy the story but that 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.220
 I recommend that you read it or go to 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.120
 our bookstore you take a look and if 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.120
 you like it so you buy it 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.239
 in level 2 for more readers 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:04.610
 advanced bakuman this manga that in 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.680
 Spain has already finished are 20 volumes and 2 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.689
 specials is super good is from the 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.909
 authors of deep not that surely you 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:12.799
 it will sound and if not look for it I notice the 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:15.530
 notebook of death in google and flick 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.540
 you will do a series cojonuda both the manga 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.010
 like the girl in this case under man 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.780
 there is also anime but I still do not 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.329
 I've seen I have it pending yet so 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:27.410
 the manga is spectacular is incredible the 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:29.240
 Manga is about the kids here 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.910
 that already from small since they have 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.830
 13 14 years old decide to become 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.960
 mangakas a mangaka for the one who does not 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.480
 know is that person who is dedicated to 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.610
 draw or write manga and from the tome 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.250
 1 until volume 20 count as they 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.780
 two of very small are put a goal 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.660
 in life that is to draw manga and 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.060
 get a certain goals and how 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.650
 little by little they are struggling to achieve them 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.600
 this manga is very good because the 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.370
 drawing is very careful until the most 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.069
 minimum detail is incredible the amount 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.920
 of details there 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.510
 in each and every one of the vignettes and it 's 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.810
 so cool because he mixes love with 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.999
 humor with a lot of different 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.069
 thematic and chilies that clear as going 

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:10.659
 of two kids who want to be mangakas 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.760
 so you know how all the 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:14.680
 editorial process that is since the 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.239
 drawing is your first manga until what 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.530
 you send to the publishers you public 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.570
 etc 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.670
 and here you have the whole kids collection 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.370
 the truth is that it is very cool is a 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.690
 very motivating manga every time you finish 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.320
 to read from a tome you want to 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.780
 right after reading the next one sometimes 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.760
 I have suffered I have resisted 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.320
 because most of the sleeves that are 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.030
 take away Spain in Japan because we already 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.760
 they have five or six numbers of advantage 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.830
 I have endured for not reading the story 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.890
 plot even when I went on a trip to 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.780
 japan around here they go for it took 12 or so 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.550
 there they go on the 17th and just look at the 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.350
 I really resisted the urge 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.630
 to see what happened in the following 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.640
 because I liked to read it in Spanish for 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.650
 find out better of everything but what is said is 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.630
 a very motivating manga every time 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.150
 you want to do things and if you 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.800
 you have a project in mind you read this 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.540
 manga and you feel like throwing 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.090
 go ahead and do whatever it takes to make 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.490
 everything goes well in total are 20 volumes 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.900
 more these two specials this is the 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:16.120
 last thing that came out that is the pcpe the 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.970
 perfect comic profile is actually 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:22.160
 as a guide to the characters that 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:24.110
 draw the characters in the manga is 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.460
 but it is very cool the truth is that 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.990
 I read it whole because it came out in this 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.690
 manga lounge and I just bought it 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.580
 really but they were and this is a 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.470
 guide of manga characters such and such 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.780
 the characters your friends your classmates 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.400
 other characters that he also draws on 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:41.120
 sleeves inside the sleeve not the truth is 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.220
 that this one is quite currado and by 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.520
 last although it is not a manga reading 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.350
 because it's not manga it's really a book 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.550
 we have a geek in japan I have the 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.650
 second edition of this book but 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.240
 they really carry quite a lot more in fact 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.440
 now it's square format is a little bit 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.170
 fatter with additional material 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.790
 etcetera but good this book is from 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.740
 kira and those that we like the command to the 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.740
 Japanese culture sure you know their 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.330
 blog that is a person that for 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.790
 many years he went to live in japan 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.280
 and he has a blog where he's counting all 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.260
 his experience so in this book he goes 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.110
 explaining how Japan and its culture are 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:19.480
 technology tradition manga obviously the 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:21.340
 video game what is the pop phenomenon 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.530
 Japanese trends urban legends 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:26.260
 of everything a little so that if ever 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:29.760
 visits japan then you can have at least 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:32.100
 a basis for how this society has gone 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.360
 You can find all these books 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.430
 surely our usual library in 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.200
 surfaces type snack cut English 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.790
 etcetera the truth is that they are very 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.250
 easy to get are in almost all 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:44.380
 the sites are known sleeves and this 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.730
 book is also obviously known as well 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.440
 that it will not cost you anything to find it 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.540
 I hope you liked these 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.830
 recommendations if you have any more than 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.750
 make people who would like to read 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.490
 manga leave a comment down
