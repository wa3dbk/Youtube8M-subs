00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
they're going to do is that you are

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.930 
they're going to do is that you are
about<00:03:42.590> half<00:03:42.799> as<00:03:42.979> likely<00:03:43.099> to<00:03:43.280> open<00:03:43.519> a<00:03:43.729> shock

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
about half as likely to open a shock

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.449 
about half as likely to open a shock
land<00:03:44.239> in<00:03:44.479> a<00:03:44.540> dragon's<00:03:45.500> maze<00:03:45.620> pack<00:03:45.889> as<00:03:46.159> you

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
land in a dragon's maze pack as you

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:47.860 
land in a dragon's maze pack as you
would<00:03:46.609> be<00:03:46.760> even<00:03:47.000> turns<00:03:47.150> erotic<00:03:47.239> or<00:03:47.629> a<00:03:47.690> gay

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
would be even turns erotic or a gay

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.569 
would be even turns erotic or a gay
crash<00:03:48.139> because<00:03:48.739> remember<00:03:48.829> there's<00:03:49.159> all<00:03:49.280> ten

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
crash because remember there's all ten

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.020 
crash because remember there's all ten
shock<00:03:49.879> lands<00:03:50.299> in<00:03:50.479> the<00:03:50.569> set<00:03:50.780> not<00:03:50.989> just<00:03:51.019> five<00:03:52.030> but

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
shock lands in the set not just five but

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.640 
shock lands in the set not just five but
then<00:03:53.150> again<00:03:53.180> of<00:03:53.449> course<00:03:53.569> the<00:03:53.900> set<00:03:54.079> itself<00:03:54.229> is

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
then again of course the set itself is

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.149 
then again of course the set itself is
also<00:03:55.220> smaller<00:03:56.109> so<00:03:57.109> you're<00:03:57.440> about<00:03:57.590> as<00:03:57.739> quarter

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 
also smaller so you're about as quarter

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:00.219 
also smaller so you're about as quarter
likely<00:03:58.669> to<00:03:59.000> open<00:03:59.299> a<00:03:59.419> specific<00:03:59.870> one<00:03:59.989> that<00:04:00.049> you
