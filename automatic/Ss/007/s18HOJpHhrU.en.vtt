00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:20.730
 good morning good afternoon good evening people are 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.529
 welcome a video here on the channel 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.050
 this time world fifa 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.420
 here we use it and we will be reviewing the 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.890
 my fifth recorded season 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.810
 this time in the second division I 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.790
 I just climbed up getting pretty with a 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.010
 beautiful steroid goal this season 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.570
 From here I started very well, Miguel. 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.780
 with about four wins in a row 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.329
 taking only one goal in four games 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:45.770
 It was really a fantastic start 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.060
 I was sure I was going to split up 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.890
 unfortunately it was not what happened one 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.050
 championship for me 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.540
 concentrating much on the championship and 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.050
 I ended up giving mole in the end also of a 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.510
 A little bit of bad luck, I believe it 's thiago silva. 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.740
 made a penalty and was sent off in two games 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.910
 and I do not think any of the 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.670
 two was missing 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.579
 were games at the end of the season 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.250
 that ended up sealing my destiny 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:12.450
 Anyway, I feel that I'm getting better at 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.159
 I even play because I'm picking up 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.080
 opponents and I'm getting better 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.640
 keep possession of the ball 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.440
 I'm getting better results only 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.000
 approaching the first division I think 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.200
 that next season I'll go up 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.330
 for sure 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.680
 besides just want to announce that already for 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.229
 this week possibly on Wednesday 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.729
 when the tones are 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.400
 I'll decide the blue cards, I'll go. 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.110
 making a very large pact or penning 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.940
 It will roll there and it will be a good event. 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.340
 cool 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.979
 let's open about 4,000 fifa points 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.920
 I hope I can do it first. 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.950
 more pec man of the future then counts on 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.020
 your presence I 'm thinking now 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.770
 My next step here is for my team. 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:56.189
 is to get to the attack for the place of the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.049
 stud enter the legend and aguero I think 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.770
 It's one thing to make a lot of difference in my 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.200
 team 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.090
 the result makes good effect sense 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.970
 soares has improved a lot this season 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:10.860
 since I am learning to use it 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.299
 better a little in doubt as maybe 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.799
 What am I going to do with the entrance of Aguero? 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.540
 I already thought about trying to get eventually 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:18.569
 an oscar ief 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.120
 I'm still seeing how I'm going to do 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.870
 with some doubts about my back 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.180
 including I'm probing the 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.500
 possibility of changing the team to 3 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.210
 5 2 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.640
 and I wanted to know you there, who knows 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.740
 play well will the 3 5 2 maybe 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.250
 would have more effect for bpl 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.980
 the English acronym than the current 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.140
 4 1 2 1 2 after all the language 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.520
 English has exceptional flyers 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.130
 ramires and tv 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.800
 the exceptional quarterback is probably 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.770
 the best league against the back and she 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.450
 has not much like that in the Question 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.330
 sides 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.740
 would be a good excuse to use the 3 5 2 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.630
 I'm thinking of doing this. I wanted to 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.530
 opinion on this can 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.630

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.190

 continue in this second division
