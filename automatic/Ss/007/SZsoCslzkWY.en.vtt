00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
last year but I've got to run it again

last year but I've got to run it again
this<00:02:23.890> year<00:02:23.950> and<00:02:24.510> I've<00:02:25.510> noticed<00:02:25.780> that<00:02:26.140> right

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
this year and I've noticed that right

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.170 
this year and I've noticed that right
out<00:02:26.440> of<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.650> package<00:02:27.040> they're<00:02:27.430> insanely

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
out of the package they're insanely

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.750 
out of the package they're insanely
sliding<00:02:28.900> like<00:02:29.050> when<00:02:30.010> I<00:02:30.100> got<00:02:30.250> these<00:02:30.400> wheels<00:02:30.640> I

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
sliding like when I got these wheels I

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.340 
sliding like when I got these wheels I
expected<00:02:31.240> them<00:02:31.360> to<00:02:31.390> have<00:02:31.630> like<00:02:31.660> more

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
expected them to have like more

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.110 
expected them to have like more
existence<00:02:32.920> because<00:02:33.100> it's<00:02:33.520> more<00:02:33.760> of<00:02:33.850> a<00:02:33.880> Fanny

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
existence because it's more of a Fanny

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.780 
existence because it's more of a Fanny
wheel<00:02:34.360> but<00:02:35.280> first<00:02:36.280> slide<00:02:36.580> like<00:02:36.910> I<00:02:37.680> think<00:02:38.790> they

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
wheel but first slide like I think they

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.120 
wheel but first slide like I think they
split<00:02:40.120> even<00:02:40.690> better<00:02:40.870> or<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.440> same<00:02:41.650> as<00:02:41.860> like<00:02:42.100> a

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
split even better or the same as like a

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.850 
split even better or the same as like a
cleaner<00:02:42.720> so<00:02:43.720> that<00:02:43.900> was<00:02:44.050> really<00:02:44.200> nice<00:02:44.440> and<00:02:44.709> as

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
cleaner so that was really nice and as

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.090 
cleaner so that was really nice and as
you<00:02:45.070> get<00:02:45.190> them<00:02:45.310> down<00:02:45.459> a<00:02:45.790> little<00:02:46.060> bit<00:02:46.270> and<00:02:47.100> you

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
you get them down a little bit and you

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.949 
you get them down a little bit and you
know<00:02:48.220> like<00:02:48.459> get<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.700> smaller<00:02:49.060> they<00:02:49.450> get<00:02:49.930> a

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
know like get a smaller they get a

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.580 
know like get a smaller they get a
little<00:02:50.110> more<00:02:50.260> controllable<00:02:50.770> and<00:02:51.190> less<00:02:51.580> icy

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
little more controllable and less icy

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.780
