it<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.250> little<00:01:32.369> flick<00:01:32.820> what<00:01:33.270> will<00:01:33.360> happen<00:01:33.750> is

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
it a little flick what will happen is

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.980 
it a little flick what will happen is
the<00:01:34.320> back<00:01:34.560> will<00:01:34.860> actually<00:01:35.549> print<00:01:35.909> onto<00:01:36.869> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
the back will actually print onto the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.840 
the back will actually print onto the
card<00:01:37.259> now<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.799> can<00:01:38.009> do<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.250> same<00:01:38.400> thing<00:01:38.729> with

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
card now you can do the same thing with

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.760 
card now you can do the same thing with
the<00:01:38.970> face<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.450> just<00:01:39.479> take<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.079> give<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.710> a

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
the face you just take it and give it a

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.469 
the face you just take it and give it a
little<00:01:40.890> flick<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.460> sure<00:01:41.610> enough<00:01:41.640> you'll<00:01:42.299> get

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
little flick and sure enough you'll get

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.850 
little flick and sure enough you'll get
an<00:01:42.570> imprint<00:01:42.990> but<00:01:43.079> if<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.229> look<00:01:43.409> real<00:01:43.590> close

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
an imprint but if you look real close

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.530 
an imprint but if you look real close
you'll<00:01:44.100> notice<00:01:44.399> it's<00:01:44.759> actually<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.119> reverse

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
you'll notice it's actually a reverse

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.030 
you'll notice it's actually a reverse
imprint<00:01:46.170> if<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.590> know<00:01:46.680> anything<00:01:46.890> about

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
imprint if you know anything about

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.130 
imprint if you know anything about
printing<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.939> need<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.149> reverse<00:01:48.479> imprint<00:01:48.990> in

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
printing you need a reverse imprint in

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.420 
printing you need a reverse imprint in
order<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.409> make<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.680> happen<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.280> sure

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
order to make that happen and sure

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.670 
order to make that happen and sure
enough<00:01:50.460> from<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.060> reverse<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:52.049> can<00:01:52.229> print<00:01:52.530> a

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
enough from that reverse you can print a

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.310 
enough from that reverse you can print a
positive<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:54.030> card<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.540> was<00:01:54.960> doing<00:01:55.200> this

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
positive of the card I was doing this

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.499 
positive of the card I was doing this
one<00:01:55.560> time<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.430> took<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.729> card<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.329> got

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
one time and I took a card and I got

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.539 
one time and I took a card and I got
talking<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:58.049> little<00:01:58.170> bit<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:58.890> forgot<00:01:59.250> that<00:01:59.310> I

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
talking a little bit and I forgot that I

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.859 
talking a little bit and I forgot that I
was<00:01:59.670> already<00:01:59.850> printing<00:02:00.299> something<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.840> I

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
was already printing something and I

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.870 
was already printing something and I
took<00:02:00.930> another<00:02:01.350> card<00:02:01.649> up<00:02:01.799> next<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.310> sure

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
took another card up next to it and sure

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.580 
took another card up next to it and sure
enough<00:02:03.119> when<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.390> do<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.689> what<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.290> wind<00:02:04.469> up

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
enough when you do that what you wind up

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.340 
enough when you do that what you wind up
with<00:02:04.799> is<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.430> double<00:02:06.000> imprint<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.930> cards

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
with is a double imprint of the cards

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.949 
with is a double imprint of the cards
now<00:02:07.979> people<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.789> asked<00:02:08.970> do<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.420> have<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.750> print

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
now people I asked do you have to print

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.420 
now people I asked do you have to print
the<00:02:10.080> whole<00:02:10.229> Carter<00:02:10.649> can<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:10.860> only<00:02:11.039> print<00:02:11.370> a

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
the whole Carter can you only print a

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.650 
the whole Carter can you only print a
part<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.849> card<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.239> you

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
part of the card and you

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.630 
part of the card and you
have<00:02:12.780> to<00:02:12.900> print<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.230> whole<00:02:13.410> card<00:02:13.710> but<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.400> can

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
have to print the whole card but you can

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.000 
have to print the whole card but you can
print<00:02:14.970> just<00:02:15.180> enough<00:02:15.630> that's<00:02:16.260> touching<00:02:16.650> and

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
print just enough that's touching and

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.070 
print just enough that's touching and
it'll<00:02:17.370> print<00:02:17.610> only<00:02:17.910> a<00:02:18.210> little<00:02:18.540> part<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:18.960> the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
it'll print only a little part of the

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.710 
it'll print only a little part of the
card<00:02:19.320> another<00:02:20.070> thing<00:02:20.280> people<00:02:20.430> ask<00:02:20.730> me<00:02:21.030> is<00:02:21.150> when

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
card another thing people ask me is when

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.810 
card another thing people ask me is when
you<00:02:21.810> print<00:02:22.110> these<00:02:22.260> does<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.220> ink<00:02:23.370> dry

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
you print these does the ink dry

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.390 
you print these does the ink dry
instantly<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:25.170> always<00:02:25.320> say<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:26.010> know<00:02:26.040> it

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
instantly and I always say you know it

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.920 
instantly and I always say you know it
doesn't<00:02:26.670> necessarily<00:02:27.120> dry<00:02:27.330> instantly

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
doesn't necessarily dry instantly

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.570 
doesn't necessarily dry instantly
because<00:02:28.110> if<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.260> catch<00:02:28.470> it<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.710> could<00:02:29.130> smear

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
because if you catch it you could smear

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.870 
because if you catch it you could smear
the<00:02:29.760> ink<00:02:29.910> a<00:02:30.030> little<00:02:30.180> bit<00:02:30.650> but<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:32.250> just<00:02:32.520> takes<00:02:32.760> a

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
the ink a little bit but it just takes a

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.600 
the ink a little bit but it just takes a
second<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:33.420> then<00:02:33.510> it's<00:02:33.660> there<00:02:33.840> permanently

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
second and then it's there permanently

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.830 
second and then it's there permanently
another<00:02:35.610> thing<00:02:35.910> that's<00:02:36.030> interesting<00:02:36.300> under

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
another thing that's interesting under

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.210 
another thing that's interesting under
that<00:02:36.960> same<00:02:37.200> principle<00:02:37.410> if<00:02:37.710> you<00:02:37.770> take<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:37.980> couple

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
that same principle if you take a couple

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.740 
that same principle if you take a couple
cards<00:02:38.550> put<00:02:38.670> them<00:02:38.820> together<00:02:38.940> give<00:02:39.600> them<00:02:39.720> a

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
cards put them together give them a

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.020 
cards put them together give them a
little<00:02:39.900> spin<00:02:40.320> and<00:02:40.620> look<00:02:40.950> what<00:02:41.100> happens<00:02:41.460> all

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
little spin and look what happens all

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.840 
little spin and look what happens all
the<00:02:42.090> pips<00:02:42.720> wind<00:02:43.080> up<00:02:43.260> spinning<00:02:44.190> in<00:02:44.310> different

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
the pips wind up spinning in different

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.490 
the pips wind up spinning in different
directions<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.510> of<00:02:45.870> course<00:02:46.050> another<00:02:46.260> thing

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
directions and of course another thing

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.020 
directions and of course another thing
you<00:02:46.650> can<00:02:46.770> do<00:02:46.860> is<00:02:46.980> you<00:02:47.100> take<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.460> and<00:02:47.610> as<00:02:47.850> you're

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
you can do is you take it and as you're

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.520 
you can do is you take it and as you're
printing<00:02:48.270> it<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.540> before<00:02:48.630> that<00:02:48.780> ink<00:02:49.050> dries<00:02:49.260> to

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
printing it and before that ink dries to

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.650 
printing it and before that ink dries to
shake<00:02:49.830> those<00:02:50.310> pips<00:02:50.700> down<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:50.940> little<00:02:51.240> bit<00:02:51.450> and

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
shake those pips down a little bit and

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.110 
shake those pips down a little bit and
look<00:02:52.050> at<00:02:52.200> that<00:02:52.350> they<00:02:52.800> all<00:02:52.950> wind<00:02:53.190> up<00:02:53.340> on<00:02:53.580> one

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
look at that they all wind up on one

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.480 
look at that they all wind up on one
side<00:02:54.360> of<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.570> card<00:02:54.810> that's<00:02:55.710> how<00:02:55.920> a<00:02:55.950> magician

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
side of the card that's how a magician

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.380 
side of the card that's how a magician
who's<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.060> printer<00:02:57.450> prints<00:02:58.230> playing<00:02:58.590> cards

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
who's a printer prints playing cards

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.150 
who's a printer prints playing cards
like<00:03:00.390> I<00:03:00.510> said<00:03:00.720> a<00:03:00.750> magic<00:03:01.320> trick<00:03:01.470> hopefully<00:03:01.920> just

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
like I said a magic trick hopefully just
