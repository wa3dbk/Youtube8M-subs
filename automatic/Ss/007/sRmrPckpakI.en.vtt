00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:03.989
 There are women and your fan 'and I am commenting 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.670
 come I bring another flight review of 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:07.290
 weapon in claudia pas warfare a weapon that 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.879
 I had saved a long time ago and that 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.320
 I fill and to the hair to also commented 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:11.969
 is some fee get later when 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.559
 kill her because she wanted to 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.999
 talk about her that I think they're not going 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.410
 to improve more you waiting a little bit 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:18.540
 now they will improve but it seems 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.130
 that at the moment not so good then 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.900
 we have to the six magistrate in the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.450
 free model that you already know that when 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.370
 You get 300 casualties with a weapon, they give you a 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.540
 model we go in secret quotes that 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.580
 that everyone can and in this 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.890
 six case in this model and not 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.030
 good is a model that is good now 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.130
 for the template already to talk about 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.829
 those seems to give a point of reach for 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.800
 one point of precision and you lose one of 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.410
 management and one of mobility is that 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.329
 practically the same as the model is in 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.070
 six money because well the crisis 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.720
 money I think it drops one more driving 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.840
 or one more mobility I do not remember 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.430
 the two and you upload ammo reserve is 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.010
 say that it is the same weapon only that 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.420
 he even loses or does not lose his hip 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.040
 or pointing 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.230
 I sincerely prefer this model to 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.550
 the genesis money simply because no 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.500
 we lose nothing weird 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.030
 of mobility and handling and nothing like that 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.650
 not because it's emma ammo you can 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.229
 put a ram and you 're 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.729
 so then we're going to go with 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.130
 real stickers of the guns seems no longer 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.810
 suddenly loaded with 32 bullets few 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.909
 they carry cargo employees 1 with 8 the 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.650
 normal 1 against fast 2 with 1 the 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.000
 empty the recoil is very low 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.590
 obviously actions 6 has very little 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.150
 recoil if we add back 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.380
 because nothing moves absolutely 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.810
 they go through and they jumped the pressure that 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.830
 has and then good because it has a 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.880
 cadence that I in this case in the 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.770
 employment I take with fast play and 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.850
 grip and I think I was wearing with or 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.250
 seated 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.380
 Ribbed think has won much 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.990
 case but good the normal cadence the 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.720
 series are the first four bullets I think 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.759
 that are one thousand 90 bullets per minute with what 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.619
 which link the good thing about this weapon is 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.479
 try to take advantage of the great cadence that 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.280
 they have the first bullets and then by 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.110
 the next ones come out of 800 a lot 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.369
 you ask are the bullets of the charger or 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.600
 the bullets every time you shoot in 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.670
 this case the opposite with the one that makes 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.409
 five are the bullets every time 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.970
 shoot shoot will decide stops 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.979
 shoot bag shoot is the cadence 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.960
 extra and then good as the scope of the 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:08.050
 range damage has is 4 bullets 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.789
 up to 13 meters between 13 and 21 with 9 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.709
 they are five bullets and from there they are 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.030
 six this model what has is that the 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:16.030
 psuv the scope with which the second 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.459
 the scope is a little bit bigger than the 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.590
 scope let's say original here by 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.790
 example if I take the brave see you'll joe 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.190
 to make a cut although the streak continues 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.080
 but as a streak of 20 he collaborated what 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.640
 what it is about this weapon is the video 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.950
 is and that by the cut and just 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.230
 I'm still in the same game but after 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.150
 with this same weapon not so good 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.010
 after this lapse here with a man 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.810
 that I wanted to blade because then 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.000
 get with the gun and everything will go with the 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.780
 weapon not then in external conclusion and 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.790
 it seems pretty 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.430
 good circus with fast fire is 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.810
 worse as you go out to the fire fast and good 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.050
 is a weapon that can use it or its 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.090
 rifle to sack with rapid fire or if you 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.319
 You put a red dot because it can be 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.930
 almost as if they were rifles to 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.550
 grooved red dot tone that's a le 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.230
 you put point watch or hilt and 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.640
 ribbed and it's practically rifle 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.350
 assault does not move has a reach 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.569
 Good for the damage, yes, it is true that 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.980
 It is a little loose but good in general 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:11.560
 except the vall and maybe the good the 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.880
 zebra up close is also very good and 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.320
 good but for example I could do it 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.790
 competition here 12 has no more 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.860
 cadence that here 12 the damage is very 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.360
 similar except from very very far and not 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.860
 absolutely nothing moves so it's 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.870
 a weapon that is decent not to be a 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.280
 weapon that they give you and from here good already 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.200
 after finishing maybe with this 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.550
 review tell you that I came up with the 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.410
 idea of ​​how good a top has made 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.600
 of rifles and together those rifles in 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.580
 all better weapons make a top 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.900
 better weapons not elites I think it's not 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.819
 convenient since many are spoken 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.319
 times of the best non-elite weapons and 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.790
 you know that I was going to win the coup 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.560
 being for example the aml and you have to 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.989
 be there also the heavy then 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.860
 I think it's much more interesting 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.299
 this week I do not believe in the one that comes 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.930
 not because the issue of 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.340
 Map 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.769
 a patch of weapons and all and you know 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.900
 they were going to put the legendary ones and such but 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.700
 in the not too distant future make a top 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.680
 of the best free weapons and 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.569
 better than they give you the well by 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.939
 example now I caught in this of play the 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.980
 second magnitude the measure of sirte is 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:04.420
 say weapons that are 300 casualties and that 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.579
 can have absolutely everyone 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.870
 and that really arms us too 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.219
 bad but there are even weapons of 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.109
 they are very good and for example 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:12.430
 You already know that I took her one more and that 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:14.319
 I've done it many times when I play mode 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.239
 league is what I use because it seems very 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.709
 good for those situations so if 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.959
 it seems to you we could make that top of 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.910
 best free weapons best weapons 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.960
 without category that is without royalty 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.430
 because it could be fine you can 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.930
 discover weapons that really are very 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.430
 good and that can help get the 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.750
 gameplays so good before it's over 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.069
 this example also tell you that today goes 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.680
 to have direct at 8 o'clock in the afternoon 

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:35.120
 Spanish schedule if you are from Mexico 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.840
 chile argentina etc 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.150
 good south america or usa so say you 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.530
 that is not that you look more or less is for 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.479
 google the schedules because it is that each 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.180
 country has its fringe put of different 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:48.740
 regulates 8 o'clock at night night 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.880
 I'm going to do a live show, I think 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.620
 i'd rather be at home and would 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.120
 come out the school and such and I will make a 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.800
 direct as I told you uploading the 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.630
 last level of the game to great prestige 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.830
 teacher and once it's up it's not 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.599
 teach a little my arsenal is my 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.550
 things and also play some game with 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:02.830
 new armor and all that but my idea 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.030
 to do that do a direct mega 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.560
 written on the youtube channel to the 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.210
 eight o'clock in the afternoon I hope that you guys 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.400
 I liked you liked to leave your me 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.210
 like favorites sign up for more 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.210
 goodbye
