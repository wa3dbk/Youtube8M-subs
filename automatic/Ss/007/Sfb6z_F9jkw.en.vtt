00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.639
 we are in new york because here is acer ha 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.460
 just finished presenting its range 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.800
 of products for the second half of 2015 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.349
 so for back to school and there are 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.860
 even some convertible tablets of one 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:21.810
 like this switch 10 a refresh a 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:26.300
 update of the model currently 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.399
 already present in the price list with a design 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.550
 fairly important aesthetics 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:35.489
 because you see it 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.399
 now the design is much more like 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.980
 that of the ultrabook aspire the 7 with 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.400
 a gorilla glass white glass cover 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.530
 3 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.520
 while in this frame instead a 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:51.190
 this silver finish and through the 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.620
 snap hinge mechanism that 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.150
 you know well why the same as 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.800
 model currently on the market yes 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.960
 clips to watch a keyboard 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.470
 mechanism that combines these pins of 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.140
 alignment with a guide system 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:08.080
 magnetic and a little fin connector for 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.420
 connect the keyboard to the keyboard dock 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.540
 hosts in addition to the island keyboard 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:18.369
 also a precise one that touchpad 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:20.950
 Windows 8.1 supports gestures but 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.479
 which is also equipped with rejection of the 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.790
 palm of your hand so you wo n't have to 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.590
 more worry about unwanted touches 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.329
 when you are writing 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.359
 as for the overall dimensions are 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:34.780
 enough content the tablet itself 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:36.880
 weighs about 600 grams while hooked 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.130
 to the keyboard and reaches a weight of 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.560
 slightly older than old verdu and therefore a 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.530
 bit bulkier a bit heavier but 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.380
 however we are talking about a device that can 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.679
 compete on the footprint profile with 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.229
 the transported of the same format the 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:57.310
 snacks hinge allows in addition to modette 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:59.470
 when it was tablet mode also of 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.049
 reverse the screen orientation 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:05.200
 hence of any in the screen towards 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:08.860
 a possible interlocutor to have 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.599
 this mode but we try to 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.250
 display that allows you to look better 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:16.060
 a movie because the screen comes to 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.819
 find more than 100 to the user e 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.830
 then always with the same position on the 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:24.040
 zipper you can also get the 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.690
 how to wait for a mode that 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.360
 allows for excellent stability e 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.959
 maybe to share the contents with a 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.959
 interlocutor 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.660
 frontally we see that there is a screen 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.100
 10-inch with full HD resolution 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.830
 treatment or the gap that allows 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.600
 have better image quality 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.400
 reducing the refraction because the various ones 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.680
 layers that make up the screen are 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.710
 examined come on the others and then on 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:03.820
 low the two speakers in one 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:05.830
 position that is not disturbed nor 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:11.740
 when holding it is in tablet mode 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:14.550
 nor when using touched inserted 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.550
 in the keyboard dock 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.859
 regarding interfaces 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:22.950
 we see that on the left side there is the 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:25.500
 plug and power a michael output 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.299
 and cd is never a door but principals a 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.730
 card reader manfredini 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.200
 frontally there is nothing with on the side 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.430
 right we have the ignition button 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.099
 an audio jack 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.959
 the volume rocker and the button 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:40.379
 to return to south stream is here on 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.859
 keyboard dock a further usb port 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.859
 additional 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.940
 the ad hoc taseer may contain 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.530
 even a hard disk but tell us here that 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.090
 most likely on this model 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.390
 on switch 10 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.520
 this option will not be enabled approximately 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.690
 the rlo platform there are processors 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:05.780
 intel atom of the trails z 37 35 do 2 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.540
 gigabytes of ram and internal battery e 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.790
 from 22 factor a sufficient capacity 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.210
 to power the tablet for seven hours 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.210
 row 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.859
 let's make a quick comparison with it 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.920
 switch 10 euros 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:26.010
 in terms of size they are 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.810
 the weight is also very similar 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.460
 so what changes mainly 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.140
 are the materials and finishes because 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.200
 here we have glass and here instead 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:37.730
 we have a plastic surface too 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.730
 if with a particular texture 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.280
 then there is also an optional accessory 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.370
 this pain activates acer active stylus 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.140
 which allows recognition 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.910
 of pressure levels for why 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:54.910
 based on sanatrix technology 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.260
 acer aspire and switch 10 and revealed one 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.630
 Italian bank starting from the month of 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.630
 June at a price of 449 euros
