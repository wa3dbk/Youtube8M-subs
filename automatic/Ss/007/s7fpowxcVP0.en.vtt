00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.730 

I<00:00:27.130> want<00:00:28.130> to<00:00:28.220> show<00:00:28.310> you<00:00:28.369> guys<00:00:29.259> why<00:00:30.259> some<00:00:30.590> people

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
I want to show you guys why some people

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.290 
I want to show you guys why some people
choose<00:00:31.160> to<00:00:31.220> use<00:00:31.430> a<00:00:31.910> tablet<00:00:32.390> that<00:00:33.820> that<00:00:34.820> perhaps

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
choose to use a tablet that that perhaps

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.810 
choose to use a tablet that that perhaps
it<00:00:35.750> doesn't<00:00:36.050> run<00:00:36.440> the<00:00:36.920> way<00:00:37.070> it<00:00:37.250> should

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
it doesn't run the way it should

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.500 
it doesn't run the way it should
this<00:00:38.540> is<00:00:38.660> the<00:00:38.870> Motorola<00:00:39.350> Xoom<00:00:39.470> and<00:00:40.510> some

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
this is the Motorola Xoom and some

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.670 
this is the Motorola Xoom and some
reason<00:00:42.129> pretty<00:00:43.129> mobile<00:00:43.370> hasn't<00:00:44.379> fixed<00:00:45.379> it<00:00:45.650> so

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
reason pretty mobile hasn't fixed it so

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.710 
reason pretty mobile hasn't fixed it so
that<00:00:45.920> the<00:00:46.640> game<00:00:46.850> would<00:00:47.000> run<00:00:47.269> the<00:00:47.420> way<00:00:47.570> it

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
that the game would run the way it

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.310 
that the game would run the way it
should

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
should

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.100 
should
so<00:00:48.920> right<00:00:49.129> now<00:00:49.309> it's<00:00:49.850> running<00:00:50.150> about<00:00:50.480> half<00:00:50.839> the

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
so right now it's running about half the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.009 
so right now it's running about half the
speed<00:00:51.379> that<00:00:51.829> it<00:00:52.159> normally<00:00:52.909> would<00:00:53.120> on<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:53.750> on

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019 
speed that it normally would on the on

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.469 
speed that it normally would on the on
this<00:00:54.320> particular<00:00:54.620> tablet<00:00:55.239> so<00:00:56.239> what<00:00:56.360> does<00:00:56.449> that

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:56.479 
this particular tablet so what does that

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:59.020 
this particular tablet so what does that
mean<00:00:56.750> well<00:00:57.619> if<00:00:57.860> it's<00:00:58.010> running<00:00:58.339> half<00:00:58.580> the<00:00:58.729> speed

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
mean well if it's running half the speed

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.240 
mean well if it's running half the speed
you're<00:00:59.780> gonna<00:00:59.930> have<00:01:00.199> just<00:01:00.530> that<00:01:01.040> much<00:01:01.189> more

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
you're gonna have just that much more

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.679 
you're gonna have just that much more
time<00:01:02.769> to<00:01:03.769> ship<00:01:04.010> at<00:01:04.189> the<00:01:04.280> precise<00:01:04.699> moment<00:01:05.150> so

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
time to ship at the precise moment so

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.170 
time to ship at the precise moment so
your<00:01:06.080> reaction<00:01:06.500> time<00:01:06.710> is<00:01:06.979> it<00:01:07.580> doesn't<00:01:07.909> have<00:01:08.000> to

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
your reaction time is it doesn't have to

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.380 
your reaction time is it doesn't have to
be<00:01:08.299> as<00:01:08.479> fast<00:01:09.070> so<00:01:10.070> I'm<00:01:10.759> gonna<00:01:10.909> show<00:01:11.119> you<00:01:11.180> real

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
be as fast so I'm gonna show you real

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.120 
be as fast so I'm gonna show you real
quick<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:11.869> Nissan<00:01:12.320> Skyline<00:01:13.540> I'm<00:01:14.540> gonna<00:01:15.100> do<00:01:16.100> a

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
quick the Nissan Skyline I'm gonna do a

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.350 
quick the Nissan Skyline I'm gonna do a
video<00:01:16.400> I<00:01:18.250> want<00:01:19.250> to<00:01:19.369> put<00:01:19.520> my<00:01:19.610> phone<00:01:19.880> right<00:01:20.060> here

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
video I want to put my phone right here

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.719 
video I want to put my phone right here
and<00:01:20.600> I'm<00:01:20.720> gonna<00:01:20.840> show<00:01:21.140> you<00:01:21.970> with<00:01:22.970> a<00:01:23.030> clock<00:01:24.729> how

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
and I'm gonna show you with a clock how

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:31.320 
and I'm gonna show you with a clock how
slow<00:01:26.090> it<00:01:26.270> really<00:01:26.630> actually<00:01:26.810> goes<00:01:30.159> all<00:01:31.159> right

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
slow it really actually goes all right

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.020 
slow it really actually goes all right
hold<00:01:32.330> on

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.170 

let's<00:01:36.540> go<00:01:36.660> to<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.840> race

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.960 

it's<00:01:42.720> not<00:01:42.900> skyline<00:01:43.350> they<00:01:43.620> should<00:01:43.830> rather<00:01:44.010> just

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
it's not skyline they should rather just

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.660 
it's not skyline they should rather just
cost<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.270> around<00:01:45.330> about<00:01:45.600> 10<00:01:45.870> seconds<00:01:46.610> so<00:01:47.610> I'm

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
cost you around about 10 seconds so I'm

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.190 
cost you around about 10 seconds so I'm
gonna<00:01:47.790> put<00:01:48.000> my<00:01:48.120> phone<00:01:48.990> right<00:01:49.140> here<00:01:49.350> as<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.530> timer

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:09.669 

and<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.740> started<00:01:53.130> when<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.310> race<00:01:53.490> starts

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.410 

I'll<00:02:10.190> get<00:02:10.369> ready<00:02:10.489> stop<00:02:10.879> it<00:02:11.060> when<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.239> rain

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
I'll get ready stop it when the rain

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:24.390 
I'll get ready stop it when the rain
stops

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.270 

so<00:02:25.400> as<00:02:25.550> you<00:02:25.730> can<00:02:25.850> see<00:02:25.910> I<00:02:26.450> ran<00:02:26.990> a<00:02:27.020> nine<00:02:27.500> nine<00:02:27.890> nine

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
so as you can see I ran a nine nine nine

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.900 
so as you can see I ran a nine nine nine
seven<00:02:29.260> but<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.410> actual<00:02:30.800> time<00:02:31.010> it<00:02:31.040> took<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.760> do

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
seven but the actual time it took to do

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.300 
seven but the actual time it took to do
that<00:02:31.940> run<00:02:32.300> was<00:02:32.720> actually<00:02:33.020> twenty-one<00:02:33.590> point

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
that run was actually twenty-one point

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.990 
that run was actually twenty-one point
seven<00:02:34.610> seconds<00:02:35.030> so<00:02:36.190> little<00:02:37.190> over<00:02:37.400> half<00:02:37.670> the

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
seven seconds so little over half the

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.990 
seven seconds so little over half the
speed<00:02:38.240> of<00:02:38.420> what<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:39.410> game<00:02:40.370> actually<00:02:40.760> should

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
speed of what the game actually should

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.180 
speed of what the game actually should
run<00:02:42.820> so<00:02:43.820> that's<00:02:44.000> why<00:02:44.150> some<00:02:44.480> people<00:02:44.510> would<00:02:45.190> use

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
run so that's why some people would use

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.130 
run so that's why some people would use
a<00:02:46.220> tablet<00:02:46.580> or<00:02:47.270> maybe<00:02:48.220> slow<00:02:49.220> phone<00:02:49.520> that<00:02:50.150> really

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
a tablet or maybe slow phone that really

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
a tablet or maybe slow phone that really
lacks<00:02:51.380> a<00:02:51.530> lot<00:02:52.990> if<00:02:53.990> you<00:02:54.050> think<00:02:54.380> that<00:02:54.590> might<00:02:54.950> help

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
lacks a lot if you think that might help

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.080 
lacks a lot if you think that might help
you<00:02:55.460> maybe<00:02:56.240> does<00:02:56.570> maybe<00:02:57.050> doesn't<00:02:57.470> who<00:02:57.620> knows

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
you maybe does maybe doesn't who knows

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.370 
you maybe does maybe doesn't who knows
but<00:02:59.090> you<00:02:59.300> wanted<00:02:59.510> to<00:02:59.600> share<00:02:59.960> with<00:03:00.050> you<00:03:00.140> guys

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
but you wanted to share with you guys

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.240 
but you wanted to share with you guys
see<00:03:01.220> what<00:03:01.250> you<00:03:01.460> think<00:03:01.700> I<00:03:02.500> tried<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.560> play<00:03:04.070> with

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
see what you think I tried to play with

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.200 
see what you think I tried to play with
this<00:03:04.430> tablet<00:03:04.760> as<00:03:05.180> you<00:03:05.930> can<00:03:06.050> see<00:03:06.290> on<00:03:06.860> my<00:03:07.160> cars

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:16.660 

whoops<00:03:12.700> my<00:03:13.700> cars<00:03:13.940> I<00:03:14.150> only<00:03:14.360> got<00:03:14.630> up<00:03:14.840> to<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:15.670> the

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
whoops my cars I only got up to the the

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.050 
whoops my cars I only got up to the the
BMW<00:03:17.390> and<00:03:18.430> I<00:03:19.430> couldn't<00:03:19.760> go<00:03:19.850> any<00:03:20.030> further

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
BMW and I couldn't go any further

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.660 
BMW and I couldn't go any further
because<00:03:20.600> it's<00:03:20.990> so<00:03:21.140> slow<00:03:21.440> I<00:03:21.770> just<00:03:22.190> can't<00:03:22.430> stand

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
because it's so slow I just can't stand

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.110 
because it's so slow I just can't stand
playing<00:03:23.000> on<00:03:23.240> a<00:03:23.270> tablet<00:03:23.810> that<00:03:24.710> runs<00:03:25.490> half<00:03:25.940> the

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
playing on a tablet that runs half the

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.390 
playing on a tablet that runs half the
speed<00:03:26.390> so<00:03:26.870> I<00:03:26.900> pretty<00:03:27.470> much<00:03:27.560> gave<00:03:27.830> up<00:03:28.010> on<00:03:28.190> this

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
speed so I pretty much gave up on this

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.480 
speed so I pretty much gave up on this
tablet<00:03:28.760> unless<00:03:29.480> they<00:03:29.860> unless<00:03:30.860> they<00:03:31.010> fixed<00:03:31.370> it

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
tablet unless they unless they fixed it
