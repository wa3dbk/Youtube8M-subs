 blood comes out 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.010
 anna and we would be about 70 people 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.140

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.180
 dies in a day 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.990
 the ninth not in two days on Saturday and Sunday you have to think about the 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.160
 Mexicans

 forward they are becoming aware of the remoteness of haiti they are 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:31.429
 selling the idea of ​​sterilizing to avoid the overpopulation of dogs like 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:35.849
 little of everything still saying father I do not want my dog ​​to water 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.880
 the men are still fighting against that for this year it was a bad 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.729
 do not want to sterilize their male dogs because of allowing but many 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.399
 women bring us the crops because they are tired of having a camera 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.990
 behind another 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.270
 n &amp; p in more and more people come so that this limit does not support the sector 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.640
 sources of energy and a hundred if we could take into account all the 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.330
 weeks is that on all weekends I'm not sure that 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.590
 we would be act it may be safe 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.570
 the next step in today's journey is to bring the rescued dogs to a 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.950
 review in the veterinary clinic sponsored by inequity with for 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.430
 animals gods and the humanitarian of tijuana 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.290
 the h stj where a dog is sterilized free of charge and 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.800
 their offspring can have nothing less than 67 thousand dogs in only six years 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.550
 That's why sterilization is essential to save the lives of dogs 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.249
 mexico nothing now 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:34.259

 madrid Sep 16 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.849
 in the sevillanas streets I will be very happy 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.229
 thanks for helping to turn off this amount of people 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:58.199
 Now Holy Week begins in all those who are in the pantheon up to 40 

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:59.649
 years 

00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:03.049
 So far we have done about 20 7% and 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.400
 6 47 operation 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.840
 so far so far although we have some more of course this is a 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.549
 joint operation of the aid and that was the best animal simple society 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.870
 tijuana humanitarian this society was organized by Mexicans to be resolved 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.449
 the problems of mexico 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:21.489
 is awesome 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:22.290
 Mr 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.570
 for once in life but they will be able to see groups of dogs and cats 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.789
 recovering from the anesthesia in extinction 

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:31.759
 for me it is very positive 

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:34.099
 this time amazing 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.459
 endeavor and everyone is treated with affection to act in all the world is in 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.619
 Athenian peace I think it's the best way to recover 

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:44.609
 in a good mood because when a dog is used in that event they put it in a 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.769
 cage in the same fact and wake up sunny 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.610
 of suez in this way wakes up in a pack attacking like this not only in a 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:56.079
 herd of dogs but in a herd of cat will wear out the gale I'm 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.400
 fascinated who declared that although the only thing they can do is something of 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.180
 very important, my life has always known that animals can unite 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.059
 the tumors and is a good example the American culture and culture 

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:10.819
 mexicana work together for the benefit of animals as well because I am very 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.129
 proud of that from pc that this is just the beginning of raising awareness of 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.129
 that people need education must be aware 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.940
 In the clinic a veterinarian checks to vaccinate all the animals rescued 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.180
 those who are going to travel to the United States 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.120
 although the island and that john ford animals is a relatively new organization 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.170
 the group has a high percentage of success in placing more short of mexico 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:43.409
 and southern california 2 bazze to this day comes three years later 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.569
 we have found nothing else 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:49.300
 500 animals rescued 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.470
 indicated that for animals that have to avoid risks the reason for our 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.819
 success is due to the fact that we have several host families because the 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:00.960
 Dogs that are both included are adoptable children 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.620
 efe in a few weeks thyssen are frustrated for example facets people who 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.150
 they welcome a dog in their house they observe it if in the end with the endorsement they are optimized 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.660
 all the information I need seven years to know danks in the operating room 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.240
 can connect well 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.710
 he is a great dog 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.790
 I welcome big dogs with problems is not that nobody wants pairings 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.039
 rehabilitated and give them the opportunity to be in a house 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:30.529
 despite this despite trying because we have attended one of his seminars 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:35.309
 have learned that you have to walk the dog times are trying to 

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:40.589
 César collaborates more with me because I need a lot of help today you know 

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:44.119
 meets with a group of volunteers from the island and that make up and more to 

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:47.559
 help them in some of their most difficult cases to move the days 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:52.089
 it could be said that it seems 

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:55.089
 this is to give it up for adoption so it can not be 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.069
 in this eagerness much hope in those women 6 at the beginning bit me 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:05.360
 how many from health could not even put in the coruña are prevented 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.430
 of the French painter 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.390
 those experiences this is good this is good the efficiency ratio what does 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:15.860
 themselves to be able to educate the people to whom the dogs deliver 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.550
 in this sense it is cited through dance 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:24.309
 the michel era that need basic information 

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:28.759
 the day and that is going to be my class participation at the moment this is protecting the 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:32.139
 reports and giving them information so that they get a high percentage of 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:35.949
 adoptions in times and to pass that information to the new owners of 

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:37.889
 the dogs and dr the ideal 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:41.419
 That's why dog ​​lovers have acquired knowledge or 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:45.259
 what they want the Caesar dogs can not help falling in love with one of the 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:48.110
 rescued dogs and decided to adopt it 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.020
 hours later the first time I'm going to have 11 the fourth I've always wanted 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.990
 to have one 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.550
 There are those who come to help a little to these wonderful mamas with my 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.149
 Knowledge part of them are going to help me fulfill my dreams
