feel a little fast you got the

compression

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.860 

yeah<00:03:02.250> that<00:03:02.610> was<00:03:02.730> good<00:03:02.970> I<00:03:03.270> told<00:03:03.599> you<00:03:03.750> this

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
yeah that was good I told you this

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.490 
yeah that was good I told you this
thing's<00:03:04.140> good<00:03:05.120> I'm<00:03:06.120> gonna<00:03:07.200> you

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
thing's good I'm gonna you

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.199 
thing's good I'm gonna you
wouldn't<00:03:07.739> a<00:03:07.800> thunk<00:03:08.040> it<00:03:08.190> would<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:08.520> know<00:03:09.150> you

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
wouldn't a thunk it would you know you

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.059 
wouldn't a thunk it would you know you
because<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.110> gear<00:03:10.319> ratios<00:03:10.709> are<00:03:10.860> just

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
because the gear ratios are just

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.520 
because the gear ratios are just
slightly<00:03:11.340> different<00:03:12.110> second<00:03:13.110> year<00:03:13.290> coming

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
slightly different second year coming

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.140 
slightly different second year coming
out<00:03:13.709> with<00:03:13.830> a<00:03:13.920> sliver<00:03:14.130> turns<00:03:14.459> you<00:03:14.580> get<00:03:14.730> a<00:03:14.760> little

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
out with a sliver turns you get a little

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.960 
out with a sliver turns you get a little
more<00:03:15.270> pull<00:03:15.540> than<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:15.840> other<00:03:15.959> car<00:03:16.230> in<00:03:16.380> third

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
more pull than the other car in third

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.210 
more pull than the other car in third
but<00:03:17.970> you<00:03:18.270> notice<00:03:18.600> it<00:03:18.750> shifts<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.260> fourth<00:03:19.650> just

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
but you notice it shifts the fourth just

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.430 
but you notice it shifts the fourth just
before<00:03:20.610> you<00:03:20.730> break<00:03:20.970> in<00:03:21.540> a<00:03:21.660> couple<00:03:21.959> spots<00:03:22.170> on

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
before you break in a couple spots on

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.050 
before you break in a couple spots on
the<00:03:22.560> straightaway<00:03:22.980> so<00:03:23.400> it<00:03:23.489> kind<00:03:23.640> of<00:03:23.730> shifts

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
the straightaway so it kind of shifts

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.390 
the straightaway so it kind of shifts
and<00:03:24.150> then<00:03:24.270> you<00:03:24.360> break<00:03:24.660> and<00:03:24.900> then<00:03:25.560> why<00:03:26.130> doesn't

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
and then you break and then why doesn't

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.070 
and then you break and then why doesn't
then<00:03:26.670> what<00:03:27.150> would<00:03:27.330> be<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.569> difference<00:03:27.930> if

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
then what would be the difference if

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.040 
then what would be the difference if
this<00:03:28.260> was<00:03:28.440> afternoon<00:03:29.269> nothing<00:03:30.269> in<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.810> tip

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
this was afternoon nothing in the tip

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.170 
this was afternoon nothing in the tip
the<00:03:31.319> mapping<00:03:31.739> no<00:03:32.430> because<00:03:32.790> you're<00:03:32.940> in<00:03:33.030> full

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
the mapping no because you're in full

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.809 
the mapping no because you're in full
throttle<00:03:33.660> so<00:03:33.810> much<00:03:34.019> see<00:03:34.260> okay<00:03:34.650> it<00:03:34.860> once<00:03:35.489> you<00:03:35.670> go

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
throttle so much see okay it once you go

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.130 
throttle so much see okay it once you go
to<00:03:35.850> full<00:03:36.150> throttle<00:03:36.390> it's<00:03:36.690> waiting<00:03:37.110> for

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
to full throttle it's waiting for

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.440 
to full throttle it's waiting for
redline<00:03:37.709> anyway<00:03:38.130> before<00:03:38.340> it<00:03:38.610> shifts<00:03:39.030> the

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
redline anyway before it shifts the

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.940 
redline anyway before it shifts the
throttle<00:03:39.870> is<00:03:39.989> full<00:03:40.350> throttle<00:03:40.500> full<00:03:40.890> throttle

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.940 
throttle is full throttle full throttle
that's<00:03:41.640> gonna<00:03:41.819> shift<00:03:42.150> when<00:03:42.390> it<00:03:42.510> gets<00:03:43.019> there

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
that's gonna shift when it gets there

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.000 
that's gonna shift when it gets there
yeah<00:03:44.220> that's<00:03:44.670> only<00:03:45.030> gonna<00:03:45.269> make<00:03:45.360> a<00:03:45.540> difference

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
yeah that's only gonna make a difference

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.710 
yeah that's only gonna make a difference
when<00:03:47.010> you're<00:03:47.160> in<00:03:47.370> kind<00:03:47.580> of<00:03:47.760> that<00:03:47.940> middle<00:03:48.690> range

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
when you're in kind of that middle range

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.840 
when you're in kind of that middle range
stuff<00:03:49.709> you<00:03:49.920> know<00:03:50.069> when<00:03:50.250> you're<00:03:50.370> on<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.730> off

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
and you're you're working like like

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:53.960 
and you're you're working like like
you're<00:03:53.010> in<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.220> mountains<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:53.610> you're<00:03:53.700> doing

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
you're in the mountains and you're doing

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.570 
you're in the mountains and you're doing

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
if you're balancing in there then it

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.729 
if you're balancing in there then it
