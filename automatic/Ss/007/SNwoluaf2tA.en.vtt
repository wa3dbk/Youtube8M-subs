important<00:00:58.109> but<00:00:59.090> basically<00:01:00.090> one<00:01:00.329> thing<00:01:00.570> that

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
important but basically one thing that

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.860 
important but basically one thing that
I've<00:01:00.960> noticed<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:02.010> speed<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:03.690> speed

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030

I<00:01:06.060> really<00:01:06.479> hope<00:01:06.689> they<00:01:06.810> update<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.760> was

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
I really hope they update that I was

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.250 
I really hope they update that I was
playing<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.180> ranked<00:01:09.420> game<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:09.840> actually<00:01:09.960> won

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
playing a ranked game and I actually won

playing a ranked game and I actually won
my<00:01:10.409> first<00:01:10.619> ranked<00:01:10.920> game<00:01:11.130> which<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:11.939> very<00:01:12.119> nice

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
my first ranked game which is very nice

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.020 
my first ranked game which is very nice
i'm<00:01:12.570> really<00:01:12.840> liking<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.830> game<00:01:14.070> so<00:01:14.340> far<00:01:14.520> it's

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
just there were some problems um well

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.190 
just there were some problems um well
Dominique<00:01:18.000> rodgers-cromartie<00:01:18.630> picked<00:01:19.020> off<00:01:19.170> a

Dominique rodgers-cromartie picked off a

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.770 
Dominique rodgers-cromartie picked off a
pass<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.920> end<00:01:20.070> zone<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.549> was<00:01:21.509> about<00:01:21.720> to

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
pass in the end zone and was about to

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.660 
pass in the end zone and was about to
run<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.140> back<00:01:22.259> for<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.500> house<00:01:22.619> he<00:01:22.799> was<00:01:22.890> running

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
run it back for a house he was running

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.130 
run it back for a house he was running
back<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.090> house<00:01:24.240> he<00:01:24.479> was<00:01:24.600> five<00:01:24.840> yards

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
back to the house he was five yards

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.320 
back to the house he was five yards
ahead<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.500> defend<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:26.009> head<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.180> wide

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
ahead of the defend a head of the wide

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.170 
ahead of the defend a head of the wide
receiver<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.930> Jones<00:01:28.920> who<00:01:29.189> has<00:01:29.310> 86<00:01:29.880> speed

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
receiver and Jones who has 86 speed

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.289 
receiver and Jones who has 86 speed
caught<00:01:31.079> up<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.409> him<00:01:31.530> within<00:01:31.920> 20<00:01:32.460> yards<00:01:32.640> which

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
caught up to him within 20 yards which

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.969 
caught up to him within 20 yards which
is<00:01:33.600> just<00:01:33.810> absurd<00:01:34.200> because<00:01:34.439> Dom<00:01:34.740> McGraw

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
is just absurd because Dom McGraw

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.499 
is just absurd because Dom McGraw
rodgers-cromartie<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.790> probably<00:01:36.360> the

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
rodgers-cromartie is probably the

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.719 
rodgers-cromartie is probably the
fastest<00:01:36.869> quarterback<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.680> league<00:01:37.710> if<00:01:38.100> not

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
fastest quarterback in the league if not

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.690 
fastest quarterback in the league if not
second<00:01:39.479> fastest<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.810> think<00:01:40.020> he's<00:01:40.700> second

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
second fastest I think he's second

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.730 
second fastest I think he's second
fastest<00:01:42.060> but<00:01:42.329> he's<00:01:42.479> 99<00:01:42.899> overall<00:01:43.200> which<00:01:43.500> is

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
fastest but he's 99 overall which is

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.410 
fastest but he's 99 overall which is
just<00:01:43.979> absurd<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.490> he<00:01:44.610> got<00:01:44.850> caught<00:01:44.909> up<00:01:45.149> that

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
just absurd that he got caught up that

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.679 
just absurd that he got caught up that
fast<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.840> also<00:01:46.380> LeSean<00:01:47.009> McCoy<00:01:47.360> got<00:01:48.360> caught<00:01:48.540> up

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
fast and also LeSean McCoy got caught up

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.240 
fast and also LeSean McCoy got caught up
by<00:01:48.869> aj<00:01:49.530> hawk<00:01:49.770> or<00:01:50.450> on<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.479> breakaway<00:01:52.439> i<00:01:52.770> did<00:01:53.100> not

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
by aj hawk or on a breakaway i did not

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.959 
by aj hawk or on a breakaway i did not
record<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:53.759> however<00:01:53.939> but<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.720> was<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.960> pretty

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
record this however but it was a pretty

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:02.300 
record this however but it was a pretty
unfortunate<00:01:57.890> so<00:01:59.149> anyway<00:02:00.149> this<00:02:00.810> series<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.680> will

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
unfortunate so anyway this series I will

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
and kickers I'm not sure why I think I

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.050 
and kickers I'm not sure why I think I
have<00:02:57.720> like<00:02:57.900> five<00:02:58.319> backup<00:02:59.030> punters<00:03:00.030> and

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.280 
have like five backup punters and
kickers<00:03:00.269> but<00:03:00.540> as<00:03:00.629> you<00:03:00.720> can<00:03:00.810> see<00:03:00.989> right<00:03:01.019> here

well my defense is a little shaky on my
quarterbacks<00:03:48.379> especially<00:03:49.379> because<00:03:49.560> I<00:03:49.650> like

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
quarterbacks especially because I like

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.759 
quarterbacks especially because I like
to<00:03:49.919> run<00:03:50.040> man<00:03:50.280> coverage<00:03:51.199> highest<00:03:52.199> is<00:03:52.379> 71

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
to run man coverage highest is 71

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.220 
to run man coverage highest is 71
overall<00:03:53.099> and<00:03:53.340> then<00:03:53.819> we<00:03:54.239> go<00:03:54.419> to<00:03:54.449> special<00:03:54.900> teams

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
overall and then we go to special teams

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.500 
overall and then we go to special teams
and<00:03:55.500> my<00:03:55.560> special<00:03:55.739> teams<00:03:56.099> is<00:03:56.250> beast<00:03:56.549> me<00:03:57.329> for<00:03:57.449> all

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
I already noticed that from all the

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.789 
I already noticed that from all the
punters<00:04:00.449> and<00:04:00.480> kickers<00:04:00.660> I<00:04:00.930> was<00:04:01.049> getting<00:04:01.290> and

up to New England coach offense I guess
