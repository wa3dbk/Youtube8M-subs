00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
first time you know I think it was very

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.330 
first time you know I think it was very
vital<00:03:25.319> for<00:03:25.349> us<00:03:25.560> coming<00:03:25.769> up<00:03:25.920> there<00:03:26.069> and<00:03:26.219> make<00:03:26.310> a

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
vital for us coming up there and make a

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.089 
vital for us coming up there and make a
statement<00:03:26.670> you<00:03:27.140> know<00:03:28.140> so<00:03:28.349> it's<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:28.709> little<00:03:28.980> bit

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
statement you know so it's a little bit

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.809 
statement you know so it's a little bit
between<00:03:29.989> stay<00:03:30.989> tonight<00:03:31.109> and<00:03:31.469> I<00:03:32.159> think<00:03:32.609> we<00:03:32.670> came

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
between stay tonight and I think we came

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.940 
between stay tonight and I think we came
out<00:03:33.030> there<00:03:33.209> off<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.510> line<00:03:33.930> came<00:03:34.170> out<00:03:34.379> to<00:03:34.530> see

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
out there off the line came out to see

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.800 
out there off the line came out to see

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
Jackson was going the ball over I think

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.780 
Jackson was going the ball over I think
he<00:03:37.079> attended<00:03:37.469> four<00:03:37.590> receivers<00:03:37.890> and<00:03:38.219> you<00:03:38.640> know

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129 
that's what we were trying to make a

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:43.729 
that's what we were trying to make a
