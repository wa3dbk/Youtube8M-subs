00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
right hey guys I know I'm not gonna do

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.180 
right hey guys I know I'm not gonna do
an<00:00:02.700> impression<00:00:02.820> this<00:00:03.179> time<00:00:03.589> or<00:00:04.589> rather<00:00:04.830> to<00:00:04.980> try

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
an impression this time or rather to try

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.540 
an impression this time or rather to try
the<00:00:05.250> same<00:00:05.490> impression<00:00:05.790> again<00:00:06.830> this<00:00:07.830> is<00:00:08.189> my

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
the same impression again this is my

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.759 
the same impression again this is my
second<00:00:09.360> well<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.690> sequel<00:00:10.080> I<00:00:10.200> guess<00:00:10.440> of<00:00:10.710> the

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
second well the sequel I guess of the

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.110 
second well the sequel I guess of the
cow<00:00:11.700> killing<00:00:12.059> machine<00:00:12.920> with<00:00:13.920> 1.5<00:00:14.730> I<00:00:14.790> thought

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
cow killing machine with 1.5 I thought

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.430 
cow killing machine with 1.5 I thought
it'd<00:00:15.210> be<00:00:15.240> quite<00:00:15.480> nice<00:00:15.630> if<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:15.870> had<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.020> chest<00:00:16.350> that

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
it'd be quite nice if I had a chest that

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.950 
it'd be quite nice if I had a chest that
was<00:00:16.619> filling<00:00:16.920> itself<00:00:17.250> up<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:18.630> probably

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
was filling itself up and I probably

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.870 
was filling itself up and I probably
should<00:00:19.320> have<00:00:19.350> emptied<00:00:20.039> that<00:00:20.070> before<00:00:20.850> I

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
should have emptied that before I

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.679 
should have emptied that before I
started<00:00:21.500> oh<00:00:22.500> well<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.460> guess<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.119> could<00:00:24.300> restart

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
started oh well I guess I could restart

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.150 
started oh well I guess I could restart
but<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.050> know<00:00:25.140> I'm<00:00:25.199> not<00:00:25.320> going<00:00:25.500> to

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
but you know I'm not going to

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.419 
but you know I'm not going to
I've<00:00:26.519> got<00:00:26.730> levers<00:00:27.180> on<00:00:27.330> there<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.779> be<00:00:27.900> able<00:00:28.170> to

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:28.429 
I've got levers on there to be able to

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.919 
I've got levers on there to be able to
turn<00:00:29.429> off<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.820> hoppers<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.300> I'll<00:00:30.420> just<00:00:30.539> clear

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
turn off the hoppers and I'll just clear

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.240 
turn off the hoppers and I'll just clear
this<00:00:31.050> out<00:00:31.260> just<00:00:31.500> because<00:00:31.590> this<00:00:31.980> doesn't

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
this out just because this doesn't

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.740 
this out just because this doesn't
really<00:00:32.520> say<00:00:32.730> too<00:00:32.790> much<00:00:33.059> at<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.450> time<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:35.750> we

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
really say too much at this time and we

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.270 
really say too much at this time and we
should<00:00:36.899> get<00:00:36.989> rid<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.260> we'll<00:00:37.710> take<00:00:37.920> that

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
should get rid of that we'll take that

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.200 
should get rid of that we'll take that
we're<00:00:39.149> just<00:00:39.239> gonna<00:00:39.390> have<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.540> look<00:00:39.690> at<00:00:39.809> things

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.250 

okay<00:00:45.210> candy<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.570> know<00:00:45.750> there's<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.079> cows

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
okay candy I know there's the cows

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.950 
okay candy I know there's the cows
burning<00:00:46.590> right<00:00:46.920> okay<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:48.030> wanted<00:00:48.809> a

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
burning right okay and I wanted a

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.380 
burning right okay and I wanted a
viewing<00:00:49.410> window<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.800> again<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.329> sort<00:00:51.329> of

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
viewing window in again so I sort of

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.020 
viewing window in again so I sort of
forced<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.140> but<00:00:52.379> we'll<00:00:52.590> get<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.890> that

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
forced this in but we'll get to that

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.029 
forced this in but we'll get to that
I've<00:00:54.030> made<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.449> sort<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.260> twice<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.860> length

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
I've made it sort of twice the length

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.279 
I've made it sort of twice the length
before<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.670> was<00:00:56.760> only<00:00:56.940> sort<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.780> two<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.140> these

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
before it was only sort of two of these

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.900 
before it was only sort of two of these
segments<00:00:58.890> across<00:00:59.120> now<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:00.359> four<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.910> that

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
segments across now it's four and that

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.149 
segments across now it's four and that
is<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.239> really<00:01:03.480> spread<00:01:03.870> out<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.500> sort<00:01:05.070> of

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
is to really spread out the sort of

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.429 
is to really spread out the sort of
spawning<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.680> I've<00:01:07.680> also<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:09.049> guess<00:01:10.049> nerfed

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
spawning and I've also I guess nerfed

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.440 
spawning and I've also I guess nerfed
the<00:01:10.920> spawn<00:01:11.580> rate<00:01:11.930> by<00:01:12.930> about<00:01:14.000> you've<00:01:15.000> got<00:01:15.060> five

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
the spawn rate by about you've got five

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.310 
the spawn rate by about you've got five
or<00:01:15.479> six<00:01:15.900> times<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.710> it's<00:01:17.180> significantly<00:01:18.180> less

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
or six times so it's significantly less

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.190 
or six times so it's significantly less
laggy<00:01:20.000> because<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.180> other<00:01:21.330> one<00:01:21.509> was<00:01:21.540> quite

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
laggy because the other one was quite

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.920 
laggy because the other one was quite
horrible<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.799> actually<00:01:23.040> play<00:01:23.250> with<00:01:23.689> also<00:01:24.689> the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
horrible to actually play with also the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.399 
horrible to actually play with also the
incinerator<00:01:25.830> at<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.100> end<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:27.409> significantly

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
incinerator at the end is significantly

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.060 
incinerator at the end is significantly
less<00:01:28.970> efficient<00:01:29.970> well<00:01:30.509> it's<00:01:30.750> it's<00:01:31.470> slower

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
less efficient well it's it's slower

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.870 
less efficient well it's it's slower
I<00:01:32.310> guess<00:01:32.939> it's<00:01:33.180> as<00:01:33.450> efficient<00:01:34.110> because

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
I guess it's as efficient because

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.010 
I guess it's as efficient because
probably<00:01:35.880> more<00:01:36.150> efficient<00:01:36.540> actually<00:01:36.840> because

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
probably more efficient actually because

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.020 
probably more efficient actually because
fewer<00:01:37.259> things<00:01:37.740> are<00:01:38.009> getting<00:01:38.549> burnt<00:01:38.759> up

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
fewer things are getting burnt up

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.660 
fewer things are getting burnt up
because<00:01:39.390> they've<00:01:40.350> got<00:01:40.560> for<00:01:40.890> hoppers<00:01:41.130> directly

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
because they've got for hoppers directly

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.889 
because they've got for hoppers directly
underneath<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.240> other<00:01:42.390> things<00:01:42.420> are<00:01:42.689> going

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
underneath so other things are going

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.980 
underneath so other things are going
there<00:01:44.270> beside<00:01:45.270> what<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.450> wanted<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.810> killing

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
there beside what I wanted the killing

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.219 
there beside what I wanted the killing
window<00:01:46.380> as<00:01:46.500> well<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.299> although<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.960> that

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
window as well and although this that

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.639 
window as well and although this that
cowl<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:50.360> they<00:01:51.360> can't<00:01:51.659> actually<00:01:51.899> escape

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
cowl that they can't actually escape

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.760 
cowl that they can't actually escape
through<00:01:53.520> here<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.420> could<00:01:54.930> just<00:01:54.960> go<00:01:55.500> here

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
through here so you could just go here

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.620 
through here so you could just go here
and<00:01:55.799> continue<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.729> kill<00:01:57.060> said<00:01:57.479> cows<00:01:59.630> depending

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
and continue to kill said cows depending

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.469 
and continue to kill said cows depending
on<00:02:00.719> your<00:02:00.840> sword<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.290> course<00:02:02.060> but<00:02:03.060> yeah<00:02:03.299> that's

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
on your sword of course but yeah that's

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.840 
on your sword of course but yeah that's
that<00:02:03.899> I've<00:02:04.170> also<00:02:04.439> oh<00:02:04.770> yeah<00:02:04.950> obviously<00:02:05.369> moved

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
that I've also oh yeah obviously moved

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.449 
that I've also oh yeah obviously moved
the<00:02:07.280> spawner

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
the spawner

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.380 
the spawner
from<00:02:08.959> just<00:02:09.959> in<00:02:10.110> front<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.709> behind<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:12.060> seems

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
from just in front to behind that seems

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.880 
from just in front to behind that seems
to<00:02:12.569> be<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.959> best<00:02:13.140> place<00:02:13.349> for<00:02:13.379> them

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
to be the best place for them

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.890 
to be the best place for them
because<00:02:14.100> now<00:02:14.460> they<00:02:14.640> can't<00:02:14.910> sort<00:02:15.240> of<00:02:15.300> be<00:02:15.569> stuck

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
because now they can't sort of be stuck

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.320 
because now they can't sort of be stuck
there<00:02:16.200> but<00:02:16.920> I<00:02:16.950> mean<00:02:17.160> before<00:02:17.310> they<00:02:17.700> needed<00:02:17.970> cows

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
there but I mean before they needed cows

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.820 
there but I mean before they needed cows
to<00:02:18.600> push<00:02:18.780> into<00:02:19.020> other<00:02:19.170> cows<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.590> have<00:02:19.680> them

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
to push into other cows to have them

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.370 
to push into other cows to have them
fall<00:02:20.040> down<00:02:20.069> and<00:02:20.630> bar<00:02:21.630> that<00:02:21.840> one<00:02:21.990> which<00:02:22.140> seems

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
fall down and bar that one which seems

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.280 
fall down and bar that one which seems
to<00:02:22.440> have<00:02:22.590> failed<00:02:22.860> on<00:02:23.069> me<00:02:23.780> that<00:02:24.780> would<00:02:24.900> be<00:02:25.050> how

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
to have failed on me that would be how

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.710 
to have failed on me that would be how
it<00:02:25.319> worked<00:02:25.770> let's<00:02:26.370> just<00:02:26.670> grab<00:02:27.030> those<00:02:27.360> so<00:02:27.690> that

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
it worked let's just grab those so that

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.300 
it worked let's just grab those so that
works<00:02:28.290> again<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:31.680> see<00:02:31.830> how<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:32.070> was<00:02:32.190> the

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
works again and and see how that was the

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.550 
works again and and see how that was the
way<00:02:32.400> I<00:02:32.430> was<00:02:32.550> doing<00:02:32.880> that<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:33.360> kind<00:02:34.170> of<00:02:34.230> remember

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
way I was doing that I kind of remember

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.260 
way I was doing that I kind of remember
I<00:02:34.590> was<00:02:34.860> anymore<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.490> I<00:02:35.550> can't<00:02:35.790> type<00:02:36.030> either

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
I was anymore and I can't type either

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.660 
I was anymore and I can't type either
this<00:02:36.540> is<00:02:36.690> going<00:02:37.050> well

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
this is going well

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.100 
this is going well
so<00:02:38.670> yeah<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.940> idea<00:02:39.330> is<00:02:39.600> that<00:02:39.690> that's<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.930> bit

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
so yeah the idea is that that's a bit

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.350 
so yeah the idea is that that's a bit
sort<00:02:40.560> of<00:02:40.620> better<00:02:40.860> then<00:02:41.850> you<00:02:41.910> can<00:02:42.030> go<00:02:42.150> there<00:02:42.330> to

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
sort of better then you can go there to

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.320 
sort of better then you can go there to
kill<00:02:42.750> things<00:02:43.020> as<00:02:43.170> well<00:02:43.319> should<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:43.770> wish<00:02:43.920> to

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
kill things as well should you wish to

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.790 
kill things as well should you wish to
know<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.360> fence<00:02:45.660> there<00:02:45.900> so<00:02:46.110> the<00:02:46.230> idea<00:02:46.560> is<00:02:46.680> it

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
know the fence there so the idea is it

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.790 
know the fence there so the idea is it
doesn't<00:02:46.950> burn<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.459> think<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.360> doesn't<00:02:49.170> that's

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
doesn't burn I think it doesn't that's

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.570 
doesn't burn I think it doesn't that's
the<00:02:50.010> plan<00:02:50.220> anyway

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
the plan anyway

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.060 
the plan anyway
and<00:02:50.760> see<00:02:51.540> if<00:02:51.720> we<00:02:51.870> turn<00:02:52.290> these<00:02:52.470> on<00:02:52.620> shop<00:02:52.950> just

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
and see if we turn these on shop just

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.860 
and see if we turn these on shop just
realize<00:02:53.400> they<00:02:53.519> had<00:02:53.880> kept<00:02:54.150> off<00:02:54.330> I<00:02:54.540> imagine

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
realize they had kept off I imagine

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.009 
realize they had kept off I imagine
those<00:02:54.959> have<00:02:55.110> got<00:02:55.230> quite<00:02:55.440> full<00:02:55.680> yeah<00:02:56.660> then<00:02:57.660> that

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
those have got quite full yeah then that

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.180 
those have got quite full yeah then that
will<00:02:58.290> start<00:02:58.739> filling<00:02:59.220> up<00:03:00.260> depending<00:03:01.260> on<00:03:01.470> sort

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
will start filling up depending on sort

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.670 
will start filling up depending on sort
of<00:03:02.250> those<00:03:02.430> speeds<00:03:02.880> because<00:03:03.239> this<00:03:03.570> is<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.350> series

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
of those speeds because this is a series

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.509 
of those speeds because this is a series
of<00:03:04.709> hoppers<00:03:04.980> going<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.550> other<00:03:05.580> ways<00:03:05.880> all

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
of hoppers going the other ways all

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.830 
of hoppers going the other ways all
filling<00:03:08.519> it<00:03:08.640> in<00:03:08.730> so<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.180> course<00:03:09.330> those<00:03:09.480> four

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
filling it in so of course those four

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.560 
filling it in so of course those four
will<00:03:10.260> link<00:03:10.440> down<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.950> sort<00:03:11.310> of<00:03:11.370> two<00:03:11.640> than<00:03:12.390> those

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
will link down to sort of two than those

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.110 
will link down to sort of two than those
two<00:03:12.810> pushing<00:03:13.170> to<00:03:13.290> those<00:03:13.470> two<00:03:13.739> I<00:03:14.250> remember

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
two pushing to those two I remember

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.790 
two pushing to those two I remember
exactly<00:03:15.300> I<00:03:15.540> set<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:15.870> up<00:03:15.959> but<00:03:16.320> yeah<00:03:16.590> that'd<00:03:16.769> be

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
exactly I set it up but yeah that'd be

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.830 
exactly I set it up but yeah that'd be
the<00:03:17.070> way<00:03:17.220> to<00:03:17.519> do<00:03:18.120> it<00:03:18.239> and<00:03:18.329> then<00:03:18.420> you<00:03:18.510> obviously

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
the way to do it and then you obviously

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.720 
the way to do it and then you obviously
access<00:03:19.410> it<00:03:19.560> by<00:03:19.829> going<00:03:19.860> up<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.160> ladders<00:03:20.519> which

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
access it by going up the ladders which

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.640 
access it by going up the ladders which
I<00:03:21.030> apparently<00:03:21.570> can't<00:03:21.840> demonstrate<00:03:22.560> because

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
I apparently can't demonstrate because

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.289 
I apparently can't demonstrate because
ladders<00:03:23.040> are<00:03:23.190> very<00:03:23.519> difficult<00:03:23.760> you<00:03:24.060> know<00:03:24.150> what

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
ladders are very difficult you know what

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.240 
ladders are very difficult you know what
screw<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.690> ladders<00:03:24.959> I<00:03:25.019> don't<00:03:25.170> care<00:03:25.380> I'm<00:03:26.070> gonna

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
screw the ladders I don't care I'm gonna

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.569 
screw the ladders I don't care I'm gonna
fly<00:03:27.380> okay<00:03:28.380> I<00:03:28.410> also<00:03:28.739> said<00:03:29.010> they<00:03:29.130> can't<00:03:29.310> get<00:03:29.489> out

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
fly okay I also said they can't get out

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.330 
fly okay I also said they can't get out
but<00:03:29.880> what<00:03:30.269> I<00:03:30.420> won<00:03:30.780> they<00:03:31.260> own<00:03:31.500> that<00:03:31.709> those<00:03:31.980> these

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
but what I won they own that those these

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.539 
but what I won they own that those these
clearly<00:03:32.730> got<00:03:32.910> out<00:03:33.060> so<00:03:33.630> this<00:03:33.780> this<00:03:33.989> one<00:03:34.549> isn't

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
clearly got out so this this one isn't

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.630 
clearly got out so this this one isn't
better<00:03:36.390> I<00:03:36.540> guess<00:03:36.810> it's<00:03:37.650> it<00:03:38.070> could<00:03:38.340> do<00:03:38.519> with

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
better I guess it's it could do with

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.949 
better I guess it's it could do with
some<00:03:38.760> fine-tuning<00:03:39.329> but<00:03:39.480> I<00:03:39.510> thought<00:03:39.720> I<00:03:39.750> would

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
some fine-tuning but I thought I would

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.949 
some fine-tuning but I thought I would
just<00:03:40.340> make<00:03:41.340> this<00:03:41.579> as<00:03:42.420> you<00:03:42.570> can<00:03:42.660> see<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:42.840> does

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
just make this as you can see it does

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.360 
just make this as you can see it does
fill<00:03:43.170> up<00:03:43.290> pretty<00:03:43.320> quickly<00:03:43.739> though<00:03:43.980> and<00:03:44.190> they

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
fill up pretty quickly though and they

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.610 
fill up pretty quickly though and they
are<00:03:44.489> sort<00:03:44.790> of<00:03:44.820> all<00:03:44.940> queuing<00:03:45.360> to<00:03:45.390> die<00:03:45.720> very

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
are sort of all queuing to die very

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
are sort of all queuing to die very
British<00:03:46.799> off<00:03:47.130> them<00:03:47.280> it's<00:03:48.090> taking<00:03:48.360> a<00:03:48.420> while<00:03:49.640> and

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
British off them it's taking a while and

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.850 
British off them it's taking a while and
so<00:03:50.880> it<00:03:51.030> still<00:03:51.329> builds<00:03:51.750> up<00:03:51.930> much<00:03:52.320> faster<00:03:52.739> than

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
so it still builds up much faster than

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.060 
so it still builds up much faster than
you'd<00:03:53.010> need<00:03:53.250> things<00:03:53.579> and<00:03:54.200> that's<00:03:55.200> only<00:03:55.739> going

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
you'd need things and that's only going

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.270 
you'd need things and that's only going
to<00:03:56.130> take<00:03:56.280> a<00:03:56.340> while<00:03:56.579> to<00:03:56.730> get<00:03:56.880> in<00:03:57.920> yeah<00:03:58.950> ventually

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
to take a while to get in yeah ventually

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.880 
to take a while to get in yeah ventually
they<00:03:59.519> will<00:03:59.670> all<00:03:59.820> pour<00:04:00.060> down<00:04:00.500> into<00:04:01.500> there<00:04:01.680> but

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
they will all pour down into there but

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.380 
they will all pour down into there but
all<00:04:02.070> the<00:04:02.220> time<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.549> hoppers<00:04:02.820> are<00:04:02.910> exposed<00:04:03.269> we

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
all the time the hoppers are exposed we

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.530 
all the time the hoppers are exposed we
can't<00:04:03.570> just<00:04:03.720> grab<00:04:03.840> them<00:04:04.019> anyway<00:04:05.360> yeah<00:04:06.360> and

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
can't just grab them anyway yeah and

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.060 
can't just grab them anyway yeah and
then<00:04:06.630> just<00:04:06.660> after<00:04:07.230> I<00:04:07.290> finished<00:04:07.620> building<00:04:07.769> this

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
then just after I finished building this

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.830 
then just after I finished building this
realized<00:04:08.670> that<00:04:08.880> what<00:04:09.000> I<00:04:09.030> could<00:04:09.299> have<00:04:09.390> done<00:04:09.600> is

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
realized that what I could have done is

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.130 
realized that what I could have done is
on<00:04:10.170> this<00:04:10.410> original<00:04:11.070> one<00:04:11.390> this<00:04:12.390> is<00:04:12.570> as<00:04:12.780> it<00:04:12.930> was

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
on this original one this is as it was

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.310 
on this original one this is as it was
it's<00:04:13.410> not<00:04:13.590> oh<00:04:13.620> I<00:04:14.570> say<00:04:15.570> it<00:04:15.690> kills<00:04:15.989> them<00:04:16.140> a<00:04:16.200> lot

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
it's not oh I say it kills them a lot

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.349 
it's not oh I say it kills them a lot
faster<00:04:16.530> it's<00:04:17.039> a<00:04:17.100> better<00:04:17.310> killing<00:04:17.850> window<00:04:18.209> as

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
faster it's a better killing window as

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:19.699 
faster it's a better killing window as
well<00:04:18.539> it<00:04:18.750> probably<00:04:19.079> looks<00:04:19.229> a<00:04:19.320> bit<00:04:19.350> better<00:04:19.500> as

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
well it probably looks a bit better as

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.520 
well it probably looks a bit better as
well<00:04:19.859> as<00:04:20.310> I<00:04:20.430> could<00:04:20.640> have<00:04:20.760> just<00:04:20.970> made<00:04:21.930> hoppers

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
well as I could have just made hoppers

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.490 
well as I could have just made hoppers
go<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:22.830> a<00:04:22.979> chest<00:04:23.280> like<00:04:23.460> this<00:04:23.610> instead<00:04:23.910> and<00:04:24.500> so

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
go to a chest like this instead and so

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.740 
go to a chest like this instead and so
you<00:04:25.650> know<00:04:25.770> in<00:04:25.979> in<00:04:26.190> many<00:04:26.400> ways<00:04:26.580> I<00:04:26.789> did<00:04:26.940> waste

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
you know in in many ways I did waste

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.770 
you know in in many ways I did waste
No<00:04:28.560> all<00:04:28.680> my<00:04:28.920> time<00:04:29.160> it's<00:04:29.760> it's<00:04:29.970> it's<00:04:30.420> the<00:04:30.570> same

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
No all my time it's it's it's the same

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:31.910 
No all my time it's it's it's the same
sort<00:04:31.170> of<00:04:31.230> deal

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
sort of deal

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.710 
sort of deal
it<00:04:32.190> just<00:04:32.430> goes<00:04:32.580> to<00:04:32.790> a<00:04:32.820> chest<00:04:33.120> now<00:04:33.270> just<00:04:33.480> because

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
it just goes to a chest now just because

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.990 
it just goes to a chest now just because

1.5 and I've just given this a bit of

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.890 
1.5 and I've just given this a bit of
time<00:04:38.310> to<00:04:38.520> catch<00:04:38.730> up<00:04:38.790> and<00:04:39.240> you<00:04:39.600> can<00:04:39.720> see<00:04:39.870> just

time to catch up and you can see just

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.420 
time to catch up and you can see just

sort of the it's a decent amount as I

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.330 
sort of the it's a decent amount as I
say<00:04:44.580> still<00:04:44.850> far<00:04:45.060> more<00:04:45.210> than<00:04:45.360> you'd<00:04:45.480> need

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
say still far more than you'd need

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.100 
say still far more than you'd need
apparently<00:04:47.340> not<00:04:47.550> enough<00:04:47.690> raw<00:04:48.690> beef<00:04:48.930> or

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
apparently not enough raw beef or

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.400 
apparently not enough raw beef or
actually<00:04:49.410> being<00:04:49.620> cooked<00:04:49.920> but<00:04:51.290> you<00:04:52.290> know

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
actually being cooked but you know

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.870 
actually being cooked but you know
there's<00:04:52.620> still<00:04:52.710> Li<00:04:53.040> enough<00:04:53.310> there<00:04:53.640> and<00:04:53.820> we

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
there's still Li enough there and we

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.550 
there's still Li enough there and we
could<00:04:54.060> always<00:04:54.210> you<00:04:54.750> could<00:04:54.870> just<00:04:55.230> get<00:04:55.380> rid<00:04:55.470> of

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
could always you could just get rid of

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.380 
could always you could just get rid of
them<00:04:55.740> the<00:04:55.860> other<00:04:56.010> way<00:04:56.160> but<00:04:56.820> yeah<00:04:57.090> that's<00:04:57.240> the

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
them the other way but yeah that's the

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.770 
them the other way but yeah that's the
new<00:04:57.750> design<00:04:58.110> in<00:04:58.920> many<00:04:59.610> ways<00:04:59.850> it's<00:05:00.120> far<00:05:00.419> worse

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
new design in many ways it's far worse

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.290 
new design in many ways it's far worse
it's<00:05:01.380> about<00:05:01.530> it<00:05:01.710> really<00:05:01.919> actually<00:05:02.300> this

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
it's about it really actually this

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.980 
it's about it really actually this
wasn't<00:05:03.510> the<00:05:03.690> best<00:05:03.720> sequel<00:05:04.230> ever<00:05:04.380> made<00:05:05.960> yeah

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
wasn't the best sequel ever made yeah

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.060 
wasn't the best sequel ever made yeah
the<00:05:07.410> this<00:05:07.770> this<00:05:08.340> could<00:05:08.910> have<00:05:09.030> gone<00:05:09.390> better<00:05:10.070> and

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
the this this could have gone better and

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.740 
the this this could have gone better and
just<00:05:11.340> if<00:05:11.700> anybody's<00:05:12.030> watching<00:05:12.150> this<00:05:12.419> before

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
just if anybody's watching this before

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.659 
just if anybody's watching this before
the<00:05:12.840> next<00:05:12.990> one<00:05:13.169> comes<00:05:13.230> out<00:05:13.590> so<00:05:14.100> the<00:05:14.220> next<00:05:14.400> video

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
the next one comes out so the next video

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.370 
the next one comes out so the next video
comes<00:05:14.910> out<00:05:15.030> not<00:05:15.150> the<00:05:15.240> next<00:05:15.480> sequel<00:05:16.110> of<00:05:16.200> this

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
comes out not the next sequel of this

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.780 
comes out not the next sequel of this
because<00:05:16.620> I<00:05:16.680> can't<00:05:16.980> imagine<00:05:17.070> I<00:05:17.370> will<00:05:17.580> because

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
because I can't imagine I will because

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.520 
because I can't imagine I will because
I'm<00:05:18.030> apparently<00:05:18.720> getting<00:05:19.020> worse<00:05:19.230> at<00:05:19.410> this

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
I'm apparently getting worse at this

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:20.030 
I'm apparently getting worse at this
there<00:05:19.650> they<00:05:19.710> go

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
there they go

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.400 
there they go
and<00:05:20.130> this<00:05:20.940> doesn't<00:05:21.180> count<00:05:21.450> as<00:05:21.720> today's<00:05:22.110> video

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
and this doesn't count as today's video

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.920 
and this doesn't count as today's video
so<00:05:22.800> good<00:05:23.700> news<00:05:23.820> there<00:05:24.090> considering<00:05:24.510> how

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
so good news there considering how

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.350 
so good news there considering how
