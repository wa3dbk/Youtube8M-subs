00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:14.930
 Good evening to say that the weather is inclement 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.630
 and little in Turin for example it snows in Rome 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.980
 the evening is rather sad and 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.320
 drizzly the weather is generally 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.550
 gray and perturbed on most of the 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.349
 our regions 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.689
 the manager of this new one 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.789
 worsening is the cloudy system that 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.099
 is approaching our regions 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.829
 from France this disturbed system 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.290
 it will last a couple of days but let's see 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.840
 better the perturbation with the images 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.760
 of the situation across the board is one 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.100
 rather fast perturbation it has 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.690
 crossed in less than 24 hours 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.910
 france the alpine arc 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.219
 a part of this disturbance if any 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.780
 will go to northern Europe while the part 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.269
 more southern it is in the bordighera 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.550
 on Italy and this in the final analysis 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:58.250
 it means a permanence of bad weather 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.359
 for at least 48 or 72 hours 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.100
 that being said let's move on to the forecast 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.700
 this is the forecast for the day 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.350
 of tomorrow 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.630
 tomorrow morning we will have cloudy skies or 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.159
 very cloudy on all regions yes 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.680
 will have scattered rains of 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.200
 thunderstorms to the centrosud of snowfall 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.210
 on reliefs and locally also in 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.850
 Po Valley during the day 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.310
 or in the afternoon the situation does not 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.780
 it will change substantially again 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.549
 disrupted with rain and storms 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.380
 snowfall even at relatively high levels 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.030
 low 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.759
 now let's see the forecast for the night 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.680
 there will be a certain attenuation of the 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.320
 cloudiness and phenomena on the sector 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.600
 north-west on Tuscany and on 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.759
 Sardinia while the cloudiness and the 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.500
 precipitation will be concentrated 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.299
 on the southern regions and along the 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.219
 Adriatic side 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.130
 snowfall is expected on the reliefs 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:55.100
 of the Abruzzo region of Irpinia 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.530
 in the potentino this is the situation 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.619
 of the temperatures foreseen for this 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.170
 night will be quite cold minus two the 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.680
 coldest city aosta we see now the 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.200
 maximum even if they are decreasing 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.500
 tomorrow however the hottest city will be 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.480
 to reggio calabria with 17 degrees 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.819
 the winds will generally be moderate or 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.680
 strong and careful if you go by sea 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.670
 because there could be some 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.410
 storms 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.019
 the sea will therefore be very rough or 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.129
 agitated I thank you for your kindness 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.780
 caution 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.780
 goodbye and good evening anyway
