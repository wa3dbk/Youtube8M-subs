00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 restoration and then also with the 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.290
 task that we always have every day 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.160
 for our friends today on this Friday 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.610
 what I'm good at, I kept thinking about the 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:18.720
 theme of the heart of love and I stayed 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.900
 thinking because many people do not know 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.199
 they feel deserving of love because 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.289
 Many people find it hard to believe they deserve 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:32.220
 love because it costs many brothers 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.110
 believe that they can be loved 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.620
 why 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.160
 and there are many reasons 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:43.739
 one can be in his childhood 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.430
 in that they were abandoned where they were 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.590
 Rejected 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.730
 another can be in the different 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.860
 frustrations they have had in life 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.540
 or another one can be in the constants 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.360
 negative consignments that have 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.470
 received and clear when I spoke 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.510
 right now of God's love ' 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.430
 when I spoke right now from the heart of 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.740
 Jesus' love is of God for 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.780
 we many probably said 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.490
 but but but like that 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.009
 but this can not be 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.229
 I do not I do not deserve that love the father 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:19.140
 is exaggerating is talking about things 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.200
 that I do not feel 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.860
 and many of you believe that you do not deserve 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.140
 the love for that are mistreated and 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.210
 they accept abuse, that is why they are beggars 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.190
 of love and that's why they are enduring it 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.190
 I could not and should not bear it 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.190
 because they think they can not find 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.240
 another person who loves them 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:43.060
 I have several brothers 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.860
 have faced tough situations and that 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.220
 they have not made radical decisions in 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.850
 their lives for fear of not being loved by 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.920
 fears of being abandoned for fear that 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.320
 do not find another person who loves them 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.729
 and you know why that happens because they're 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:04.630
 he has definitely forgotten that they are 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:06.039
 valuable then today the task would be the 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.030
 task that we would have to cause 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:13.060
 would be to talk again and understand that 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.910
 we are valuable now what happens is that 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.940
 that was talking to him with juancho from the spray 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.290
 of the espriella with mario 'in those days 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.840
 I was talking to Mario, we had lunch 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.720
 together and I talked to him in that and 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.420
 we shared the man is that many 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.940
 people who will ask you 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.770
 about his life to the enemies 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.860
 sure you will find a compliment in 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.630
 your enemy hear enemy you believe that 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.310
 I serve for something that the 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.330
 enemy with light and I put you know 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.640
 observe where the person who most 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.480
 I want you to hear that you hate me is 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.489
 true that I'm good at singing 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.260
 that is, you do not serve for the 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.470
 fans

 loved you deserving of love 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.400
 imagine yourself 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.500
 Jesus gives his life for you because you are 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.150
 valuable he does not give his life for you because 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.350

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.180
