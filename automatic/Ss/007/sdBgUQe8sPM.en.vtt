say<00:00:00.719> you<00:00:00.780> were<00:00:00.989> tasked<00:00:01.230> with<00:00:01.439> teaching

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
say you were tasked with teaching

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.740 
say you were tasked with teaching
someone<00:00:02.429> about<00:00:02.970> the<00:00:03.120> nucleophilic

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
someone about the nucleophilic

someone about the nucleophilic
reactivity<00:00:04.529> of<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.770> enemy<00:00:05.240> the<00:00:06.240> way<00:00:06.359> you'd

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
reactivity of the enemy the way you'd

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.720 
reactivity of the enemy the way you'd
probably<00:00:06.720> do<00:00:07.109> it<00:00:07.230> on<00:00:07.319> paper<00:00:07.589> is<00:00:07.980> you<00:00:08.580> would

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
probably do it on paper is you would

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.209 
probably do it on paper is you would
draw<00:00:08.910> curved<00:00:09.330> arrows<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:10.110> show<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.410> enamine

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
draw curved arrows to show the enamine

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.100

electrons when you drew those curved

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.330 
electrons when you drew those curved
arrows<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:16.139> probably<00:00:16.529> start<00:00:16.949> at<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.160> very

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
arrows you probably start at the very

electrophile is around on paper this is
easy<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.250> do<00:00:32.399> sequentially<00:00:33.180> because<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.540> have

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
easy to do sequentially because you have

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.870 
easy to do sequentially because you have
to<00:00:33.899> draw<00:00:34.079> one<00:00:34.320> arrow<00:00:34.620> before<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.219> other<00:00:35.370> but

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
to draw one arrow before the other but

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.510 
to draw one arrow before the other but
in<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.210> j/mol<00:00:36.660> model<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.469> can<00:00:37.649> be<00:00:37.770> hard<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.219> show

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
in a j/mol model it can be hard to show

in a j/mol model it can be hard to show
things<00:00:38.850> sequentially<00:00:39.290> that's<00:00:40.290> where<00:00:40.559> the

into the wiki you can test animations

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.119 
into the wiki you can test animations
however<00:01:00.000> using<00:01:00.750> your<00:01:00.870> local<00:01:01.230> copy<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.620> Jaimal

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
however using your local copy of Jaimal

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.179 
however using your local copy of Jaimal
along<00:01:02.550> with<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> few<00:01:03.090> useful<00:01:03.600> commands

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
along with a few useful commands

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.310 
along with a few useful commands
remember<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.489> active<00:01:05.939> applet<00:01:06.420> maker<00:01:06.630> that

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
remember in the active applet maker that

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.440 
remember in the active applet maker that
every<00:01:07.710> button<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.280> going<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.729> be<00:01:08.850> assigned<00:01:09.180> a

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
every button is going to be assigned a

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.320 
every button is going to be assigned a
long<00:01:09.810> string<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.439> commands<00:01:11.340> so<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.119> can

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
long string of commands so you can

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.570 
long string of commands so you can
string<00:01:12.689> commands<00:01:13.080> together<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.250> script

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
string commands together in the script

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.270 
string commands together in the script
console<00:01:15.060> locally<00:01:15.659> see<00:01:16.439> what<00:01:16.619> they<00:01:16.770> do<00:01:16.830> and

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
console locally see what they do and

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.789 
console locally see what they do and
realize<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.630> exact<00:01:19.080> sequence<00:01:19.409> is

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
realize that that exact sequence is

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.980 
realize that that exact sequence is
going<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.159> take<00:01:20.340> place<00:01:20.549> when<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> user<00:01:21.600> clicks

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
going to take place when a user clicks

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.260 
going to take place when a user clicks
your<00:01:22.290> button<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> web<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.790> let's<00:01:24.030> see<00:01:24.180> if

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
your button on the web so let's see if

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.570 
your button on the web so let's see if
we<00:01:24.390> can<00:01:24.540> emulate<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.229> process<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.979> drawing

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
we can emulate the process of drawing

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.910 
we can emulate the process of drawing
curved<00:01:26.970> arrows<00:01:27.330> sequentially<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.259> this

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
curved arrows sequentially on this

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.819 
curved arrows sequentially on this
Jaimal<00:01:29.430> well<00:01:30.299> if<00:01:30.420> we<00:01:30.570> simply<00:01:30.960> lay<00:01:31.200> down<00:01:31.439> two

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
Jaimal well if we simply lay down two

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.550 
Jaimal well if we simply lay down two
arrows<00:01:32.540> and<00:01:35.060> upload<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.509> web<00:01:36.810> that's

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
arrows and upload that to the web that's

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.219 
arrows and upload that to the web that's
useful<00:01:37.920> in<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.240> see<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.570> curved<00:01:39.869> arrows

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
useful in that we see the curved arrows

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.649 
useful in that we see the curved arrows
and<00:01:40.439> see<00:01:40.710> how<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.920> electrons<00:01:41.490> flow<00:01:41.790> but<00:01:42.570> we

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
and see how the electrons flow but we

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:43.999 
and see how the electrons flow but we
don't<00:01:42.869> see<00:01:43.110> things<00:01:43.380> along<00:01:43.799> the

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
don't see things along the

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.330 
don't see things along the
time-dimension<00:01:45.530> to<00:01:46.530> see<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.860> time<00:01:47.070> dimension

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
time-dimension to see the time dimension

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.100 
time-dimension to see the time dimension
we<00:01:48.000> need<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.240> apply<00:01:48.540> these<00:01:48.600> commands

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
we need to apply these commands

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.380 
we need to apply these commands
sequentially<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:49.979> place<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.610> delay<00:01:51.090> between

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
sequentially and place a delay between

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.380 
sequentially and place a delay between
the<00:01:51.659> two<00:01:51.869> draw<00:01:52.200> arrow<00:01:52.470> commands<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.119> easy

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
the two draw arrow commands this is easy

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.170 
the two draw arrow commands this is easy
to<00:01:54.540> do<00:01:54.720> using<00:01:55.110> jmol<00:01:55.710> delay<00:01:56.219> command<00:01:56.670> which

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180
