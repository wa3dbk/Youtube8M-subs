00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.200
 perhaps stirred by the remarkable success of 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.059
 dark souls 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.100
 after the landing on steam the developers 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.990
 Japanese are finally opening the 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.770
 their mind to the difficult world of titles 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.720
 for computers 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.759
 however, we are talking about studies that have taken place 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.230
 historically always focused on 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.940
 console and therefore it is rarely 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.070
 they succeed in the hard task of optimizing 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.739
 and perfect their works properly 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.629
 for the new platform the same port 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.550
 in dark souls is among the worst that 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.379
 we never saw that it took a 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.090
 bit of well calculated fashions 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.410
 the experience worthy of the expectations of 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.610
 new audience 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.710
 the port we are dealing with today is 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.079
 particularly important since yes 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.200
 comes to metal gear rising first title 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.579
 of platinum games to arrive on steam 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.230
 the house is one of the few to have the 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.090
 courage to always bet on titles 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.160
 innovative and original in the land of 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.579
 rising sun and this horse nature 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.410
 crazy 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.930
 led her to become one of the most 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.610
 love from my critics the boundless of 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.050
 steam would be a nice place to do 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.970
 prosper this further 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.380
 very clever group of programmers but 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.470
 platinum men will be enough 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:15.180
 preparations to surprise even on PC and the former 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.259
 no bradley 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.219
 needless to repeat another time 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.990
 the game's plot 

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:21.490
 find everything in the previous one 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.590
 review and also regarding 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.579
 the dust-free gameplay is more than that 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.350
 enough 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.939
 we will therefore concentrate on the scheme of 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.920
 controls of this version and on 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.570
 technical department trying to evaluate the 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.060
 better the yield of rising on the various 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.710
 configurations the adventure of ryder 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.960
 first of all it is not an action hack and 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.850
 common slash while containing combinations 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.170
 multiple and numerous types of attack 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.329
 rotates its system of 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.649
 fighting almost totally around 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:47.380
 single defensive maneuver 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.179
 a very precise directional parade that 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.590
 offers a wide time window for 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:52.750
 respond to opponents' blows 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.759
 such parri guarantees even one 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.959
 instant countermove if used 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.549
 last moment 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:59.770
 or can make an enemy vulnerable e 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.630
 start a zanda on one 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.189
 spectacular execution that allows the 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.810
 protagonist of farah pieces any 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.119
 opponent during a special mode 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.810
 with closer view known as the 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.000
 blade mod 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.769
 if we consider that both maneuvers 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.450
 require a certain precision and a 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.920
 precise orientation can be perceived 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.200
 immediately how they are employees 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.790
 from the analog sticks of a pub 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.680
 but we were curious to see how 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.609
 the developers would have translated the 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.130
 all on the keyboard 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:25.720
 the answer was the most obvious and the 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.030
 platinum used a combination of 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.060
 mouse control and directional w 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.980
 asd to make the parade effective too 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.209
 in the absence of a gamepad succeeding in 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.980
 offer a control system 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.450
 very respectable albeit obvious 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.500
 reasons intuitive black than that 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.329
 original 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.250
 there is only one small problem that much 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.870
 small reality is not taking up the 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.549
 console control system lo 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.590
 displacement of the view by mouse 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.600
 partially simulates the movements of the 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.549
 analog and in this way maintains a 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.170
 internal acceleration leading to changes 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.959
 directional to come with a slight delay 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.790
 and with limited accuracy the defect does not 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.650
 is marked as in the aforementioned version 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.510
 dark souls pc but it is anyway 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.970
 annoying and we really can't 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.200
 understand why you keep appearing 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.639
 raised the sensitivity anyway we are 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.410
 managed to advance without too many 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:10.299
 problems and we can applaud the 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.190
 command mapping chosen by platinum 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.959
 which is adequate and functional 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.459
 passing to the technical sector is 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.260
 impossible not to notice others 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.410
 demonstrations of inexperience in the team 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.510
 in the field of doors of this type 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.820
 for example, the resolution does not exceed in 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.590
 1080p and if therefore you are part of the 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.330
 tiny percentage that can be enjoyed 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.530
 video game to the majestic resolution of 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:34.380
 2560 x 1440 you will have to settle for a 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.580
 beautiful 1900 20 x 1080 the sixteen ninths 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.230
 developers should be at work 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.060
 on a corrective patch for this 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.650
 lack and have already released a pixel 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.510
 very fast after discovering that 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.400
 title did not work in the absence of one 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.930
 internet connection but expect to 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.310
 to see with our own eyes the success 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.750
 operation 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.850
 the framerate appears to be a 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.980
 present some problems though 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.750
 only on some configurations if 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.940
 played in full screen in fact the rising 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.950
 crashes at 30 fps on some computers 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.840
 absurd thing given that in the window and 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.730
 at the same resolution travels at 60 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.340
 frames per second without any changes 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.420
 download the updated driver 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.310
 use external programs to do 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.930
 disappearing the edges of the window allows 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.850
 to eliminate also this magagna in 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.560
 many cases more than good finally i 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.510
 graphic settings that besides allowing 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.580
 to set the anti aliasing and the filter 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.049
 anisotropic allow to decrease the 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.790
 number of pieces in which you can 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.770
 cut enemies during blade mode 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.500
 and their time spent on screen 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.240
 these two may look like rometta maretta 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.740
 factors are quite significant 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.140
 in computer game performance 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.090
 less powerful and stabilize not a little 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.680
 prim race and decreased by offering one 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.680
 scalability that shows him a good job 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.390
 of optimization by platinum 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.669
 the ports of metal gear rising reven.ge 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.100
 nas on pc is certainly not one of the best 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.450
 the game happened to us 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.100
 however it has been optimized so 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.720
 much better than expected 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.000
 present a check pattern well 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.980
 calculated even in the absence of a bug is 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.419
 a ridiculous price in this version though 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.070
 compared to that of retail for 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.940
 consul 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.590
 in short, it remains a purchase 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.030
 highly recommended for those who love action 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.040
 hack and slash and for anyone who wants 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.630
 support platinum games in this one 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.750
 their first visit to the world of gods 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.750
 computer
