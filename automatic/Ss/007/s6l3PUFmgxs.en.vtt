00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:04.800
 protein synthesis begins in the cell nucleus with transcription 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.990
 copying of a fragment of bnat by the reindeer ahahahahaah messenger 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.990
 mrna 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:19.230
 the mrna formed furi comes out of the nucleus and in the cytoplasm 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:22.929
 to a unit ribosome ale 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.210
 in the ribosomes there are two sites for the complementary coupling between the 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.030
 triplets of nitrogenous bases of rna am to those of the molecules of rna of 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.330
 transport 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.330
 rna 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.510
 the first load trna molecule is inserted into the start codon on 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.760
 mrna molecule 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.760
 and goes to occupy the p site of the ribosome 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.580
 subsequently in the phase called elongation a second trna with load yes 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.430
 brings to the app site of the ribosome 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.330
 a peptide bond is formed between the two amino acids carried by the molecules of 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.540
 trna inserted into the ribosome 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.350
 at the same time the bond between the first amino acid and its trna is broken 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:26.110
 the ribosome moves along the mrna and is the second trna with the detective and attack 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.240
 moves from the site to the site p as soon as the first unloaded pipe detaches from the 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.820
 ribosome 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.060
 a third loaded trna is brought to the site a and another peptide bond is formed 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.910
 this step is repeated several times 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.910
 until the polypeptide is complete 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.750
 in the last phase called termination the ribosome encounters a stop codon 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.350
 to which no trna corresponds 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.890
 the polypeptide is detached from the last trna that frees the site p 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:13.439
 the a eeh site is affected by a release factor that causes the dissociation 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:15.259
 of the two units of the ribosome
