00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.000
 hello everyone this is fabien I you 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.190
 present today a glitch 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.750
 spectacular on the map diaries of the 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.700
 zombie fashion of call of duty black ops 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.110
 allowing you to access the sky 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.250
 barrier of this map so I'm going to 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.050
 present two methods 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.030
 a solo method discovered by the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.250
 gaming industrials is a method to 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.580
 two players discovered by myself 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.309
 tactical yt the gentleman glitch elton 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.110
 7.7 yt so the first method is 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.730
 relatively sings that's why 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.290
 I looked for a second method you 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.180
 must place the thrusters as on 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.830
 the video you aim down at you 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.570
 shifted to the right so that the 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.540
 thruster you face the albres and at 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.440
 this little wall and then once on 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.640
 inside this bowl breaches what you 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.589
 should you shift a little bit to the right 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.290
 a little to the left while advancing 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.760
 so as to gauge a little bit because if 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.510
 never are you 3 left or too much to 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.700
 right you are automatically 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.310
 expelled from the wall and that's exactly it 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.870
 which is boring because will be in truth what 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.540
 it's the booster that pisses you 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.830
 so here is the second method to two 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.570
 players so you have to place the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.159
 thrusters the same as on the video 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.820
 it's the same as the first method 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.130
 do not change anything from there you aim 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.509
 green the ground what are you aiming towards the ground 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.100
 and you shifted to the right 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.409
 until you reach the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.570
 propeller so it will propel you and 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.549
 there my other teammates must 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.320
 remove the propellant in fact it is 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.060
 the booster that will piss you off when 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.979
 you test the first method there you 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.390
 just have to just move on 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.530
 you take your time there is not the 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.210
 fire at the lake then you are 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.310
 automatically teleport on lascars 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.840
 bay the sky barrier forgiveness of this map 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.310
 so that's when you remove the 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.270
 propeller it is frankly very very 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.840
 simple and you can achieve 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.850
 easily and quickly when 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.320
 your teammate removes the thruster 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.240
 you currently see on the screen no 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.740
 my tactical teammates yt dedication 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.179
 in time to the passage that just passed 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.100
 this glitch is frankly very very 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.810
 simple and you can chain the church 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.459
 plays normally you can not ride 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.140
 the four if you ever do you 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.879
 do the second method you can 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.620
 go up to 3 is the last one will have to do to 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.879
 the solo method that is pretty boring 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.260
 but if you ever are the cathos 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.489
 above I tell you not a little 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.530
 the fun it can provide in 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.780
 private party so here are the friends so 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.040
 it does not create a zombie barrier 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.200
 so all the zombies are not going to come 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.519
 whirling will have in front of you but 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.470
 good you are at the target and that's when 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.690
 even a more spectacular glitch helpful 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.890
 I hope you'll like me 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.299
 I'll see you again soon for 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.299
 next videos alessio everyone
