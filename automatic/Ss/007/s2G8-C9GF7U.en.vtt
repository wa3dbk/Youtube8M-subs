00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:16.529
 sedan declined in the coupé the opel astra 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.660
 gtc however is not a simple version a 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.369
 three doors longer than the 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.279
 five-door front version 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.279
 redesigned, in short, it knows so much again 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.180
 depending on the bodywork to the frame 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.520
 modified not only in step but also 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.120
 in the widest low roads and 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.760
 streamlined 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.410
 the astra gtc has a high waistline 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:46.140
 and the sharp edges on the tail the inevitable 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.510
 fake extractor that together with the circles 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.219
 19-inch of our copy in 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.399
 evidence underline all 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.500
 sporting of the car the seat 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.140
 enveloping and enveloping above all 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.820
 level of the hips the controls are all 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.579
 arranged on the large central console 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.489
 which, however, has a high key density 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.290
 who can lose the attention who 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.390
 is looking for a good dose of 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.409
 sportsmanship on board could remain 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.540
 disappointed 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.540
 the setting of the car is sober and 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.990
 elegant as on the sedan 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:21.000
 the astra gtc is long at 4.47 meters which 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.119
 would make you think of a spacious car too 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.549
 in the front inside it is actually wide and 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.710
 you travel comfortably but behind the space 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.420
 for passengers and rather sacrificed 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.570
 and accessibility is not the most 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.409
 easy visibility to tell the truth not 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.450
 it is optimal 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.759
 the trend of large uprights 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.310
 prior penalizes and the design of the 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.280
 queue typical of coupes does not facilitate the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.570
 maneuvers better to opt for the sensors that 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.000
 but they are optional and 2 liters turbodiesel 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.170
 to a good progression pushes strong 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.170
 since the lower regimes 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.410
 less brilliant the recovery but here a 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.870
 penalizing gtc are long gears 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.220
 which however serve to reduce turns and 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.290
 consumption 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.180
 instead the change from the best of themselves 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.640
 in fast use 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.980
 the opel astra gtc to a bell'assetto is a 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.680
 excellent balance the understeer is 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.209
 minimum and roll is almost nil there 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.280
 lets you turn into a curve 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.840
 quick with the car that complies with 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.840
 better driver input 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.160
 the answer can also be changed 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.500
 accelerator 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.180
 in the normal mode the gtc at a little 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:48.430
 sitting but in sport it immediately becomes lively 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.500
 the suspensions filter discreetly 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.180
 roughness and front seats but 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.600
 are a bit too rigid to 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.030
 rear-end penalizing who sits behind 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.280
 the consumption of the opel astra gtc detected 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.500
 from our test center in vairano not 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.170
 they are particularly excessive to 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.710
 constant speed at 130 kilometers per hour 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.050
 you travel 15.6 km 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:14.260
 in the city, instead, values ​​fall 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.590
 drastically the liter km in this case 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:21.799
 down to 11.4 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.930
 the opel astra gtc 2016 to the 165 horses 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.239
 cosmos of our sample under test 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.249
 it costs just over 30 thousand euros 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.549
 however in the range there are more versions 

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:34.030
 rates starting at € 19,850
