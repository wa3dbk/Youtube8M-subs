00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 cardiocirculatory system anatomy 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.720
 axillary arteries 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.849
 in this video we will describe both the 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.389
 course of axillary artery that i 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.740
 its collateral branches turn to choose 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.350
 topographically very characteristic 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.720
 they in fact originate from the margin of the 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.510
 first it costs precisely where it is considered 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.080
 to finish the suq lavia and brings in 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.449
 low and laterally going to finish 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.320
 in the axilla at head level 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.140
 of the humerus in its course passes between the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.450
 muscles under the scapular muscles 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.370
 side of the chest wall can be 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.129
 consider divided into three parts by 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.950
 tendon of the small pectoral muscle 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:48.710
 that passes in front of her when the arm is 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.010
 abb 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:57.079
 we begin to treat the collateral branches 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.079
 let's start from the upper thoracic art 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.829
 the upper thoracic artery is a 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.250
 small branch that is born immediately after 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.680
 the origin of the axillary artery from the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.990
 his lower face is brought down 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.540
 first in the first intercostal space 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.950
 after which it bends, splitting into some 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.970
 branches in terminals that go to ba 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.530
 to school the muscles of this region 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:24.210
 then we have the toraco artery in chrome 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:27.060
 ial and this is a really extensive artery 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.250
 as a circle indeed to one 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.229
 vascularization both at the level of 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.090
 anterior chest wall is level 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.000
 of the kronion of the scapula and also 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.630
 of the head of the humerus thoracic artery a 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.950
 chrome ial and moves down forward 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.770
 dividing into a series of branches for the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.180
 large pectoral muscle in its part 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.430
 terminal 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.399
 collaterally from a branch to the first 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.409
 intercostal space a branch for the neck 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.479
 anatomical humerus 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.610
 finally a branch with chrome ial that yes 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.530
 heads back up going to 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.600
 chromium vascularized and providing 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.390
 also some branches for the upper part 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.049
 of the joint capsule 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.049
 of the glenohumeral joint 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.910
 then we have the lateral thoracic artery 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.490
 lateral or even breast thoracic 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.640
 lateral and an artery that arises from the 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.920
 second portion heads down e 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.260
 during his journey he provides many 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.030
 small branches for the region above all 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.490
 muscle branches 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.120
 however, there are also branches appointed to 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.270
 vascularization of the breast 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.860
 then we have the sub scapular artery 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.630
 artery that arises from the third portion e 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.790
 which stands out from the others because yes 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.940
 head back head back 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.580
 providing branches with a subscapularis branch 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.720
 for the lateral margin of the scapula 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.489
 the branch for the round muscles 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.370
 then we have circumflex larters 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:03:00.950
 of the humerus these arteries originate 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.590
 from the very last part of the axillary a 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.600
 side level are two arteries a 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.330
 front one back 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.350
 the first turns before respect 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.330
 at the head of the humerus 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.910
 the second obviously on a level 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.430
 posterior is the ostomate to form 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.470
 a ring from which the circumflex name e 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.519
 plus a stoma dinner with some 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.900
 branches of the thoracic artery to chrome ial e 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.530
 forming a single circle around the 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.530
 humeral head
