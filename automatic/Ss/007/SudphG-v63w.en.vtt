00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.190
 welcome friends androidworld.it la 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.170
 android preview l also comes up 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.360
 nexus 4 is obviously not a version 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.270
 official made in google it is a 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.990
 porting of the currency carried out precisely 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.760
 on nexus 5 and mac on seven 2013 a 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.440
 porting but I have to say it worked 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.300
 really very very well 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.400
 development is still very active in 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.559
 over the last weekend there have been 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.430
 really varied bild in showcases with 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:40.390
 distracted I mean dozens this is 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.340
 based precisely on the firmware lpv 79 which is 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.670
 that of the android me preview 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.830
 of the beta 2 beta 2 next 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:52.150
 really many other versions of 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:54.370
 try nexus 4 as you will see kernel 3.4 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.270
 porting of food directed by nexus 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.180
 5 in which it works practically a bit 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.640
 everything showed us quickly 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.910
 the settings screen such as 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.500
 you don't see that if they are updating in 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.390
 this moment from the various commissioner 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.020
 applications then installation of 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.759
 applications and perfectly supported 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.009
 the toggles work the works 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.790
 bluetooth 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.259
 let's go a little bit then in the 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.149
 bluetooth screen to let you see that 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:24.820
 it is activated but here we have gods 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.750
 already detected devices that are in the 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.450
 next room 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.369
 then working bluetooth wifi 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.750
 working because as you see it is 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:37.869
 by linking the functions of android and 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.009
 all the stories here are not stressed 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.020
 one by one 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:44.799
 indeed if anything, I refer to video 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.500
 however I deserve what he owed us 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.600
 in short, let's say there is there 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.760
 possibility precisely see to manage in 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.460
 differently notifications for example 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.119
 to silence them for a period of time 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.860
 there are also more or less long 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.810
 anomalies if we want the preview of 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.689
 android l ie in the sense that when for 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.009
 example are lowered 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.350
 in short, when they move to this area 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.420
 relative to the former quick setting is not 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.760
 You can interact with notifications 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.580
 below that instead we can go to 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.280
 discard when lowered when it is 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.690
 in short, the part relating to 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.239
 quick setting 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:27.610
 the system is not fluid enough 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:29.620
 just as fluid as on nexus 5 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.460
 you probably won't notice it already from 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.070
 this from this room preview does not 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.470
 yes no maybe exactly the fluidity 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.080
 but I assure you that it is slightly less 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.210
 fluid that on nex 5 is treated anyway 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.090
 you will still have seen a port 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.280
 which is also present superuser of o'shea 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.060
 all does not work at the moment 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.950
 super su says in fire but they work e 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.130
 roughly all the other apps that 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.940
 work with android l with the preview 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.760
 so remember that this one anyway 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.190
 rom is ready for daily use this 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.830
 take away to be precise is ready 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:12.130
 for everyday use as much as it is 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:16.260
 preview on nexus 5 or ready but up 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.940
 at some point in the sense that anyway 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.300
 not all waters are guaranteed 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.280
 in short, to work perfectly 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.860
 they also work what they don't 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.190
 all worked in early beta 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:33.459
 lock screen options or 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:36.360
 notifications works the shortcut to the 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.440
 numeric keypad for dialers 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.180
 this is precisely the bad thing 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.850
 logic showed so this is 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.650
 a release really came out in the 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.690
 last hours he goes to correct i 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.340
 problems that the first alphas had 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.709
 published during this weekend 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.140
 so precisely a porting really 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:56.200
 almost perfect of the rom you find 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.930
 also on nexus 5 on the nexus serves 2013 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.390
 which will give you a chance to try the preview 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.209
 of the next release of android too 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.670
 on your usual nexus 4 remember 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.680
 that anyway not all the apps could 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.600
 work perfectly both because 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.220
 this is a port both because 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.260
 not all water works 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.109
 correctly in the preview of andrÃ© 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.620
 dell for this our quick preview 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.269
 so it's all you remember to watch 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.400
 in the videos we have made dedicated 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.400
 to the preview of android l to get one 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.190
 more complete overview of its innovations 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.190
 a greeting from nicola ii gas for 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.190
