chance to be a first round pick he's a

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.110 
chance to be a first round pick he's a
top<00:00:58.590> athlete<00:00:58.800> with<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.129> big<00:00:59.309> arm<00:00:59.550> but

throughout<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.449> year<00:01:00.750> you've<00:01:00.840> seen<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.050> lot<00:01:01.320> of

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
throughout the year you've seen a lot of

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.439 
throughout the year you've seen a lot of
inconsistency<00:01:01.770> both<00:01:02.430> with<00:01:02.640> his<00:01:02.670> footwork<00:01:03.239> his

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
inconsistency both with his footwork his

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.690 
inconsistency both with his footwork his
mechanics<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.110> his<00:01:04.199> accuracy<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.460> think

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
mechanics and his accuracy and I think

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.280 
mechanics and his accuracy and I think
therefore<00:01:05.909> for<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.299> guy<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.630> had<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.750> chance<00:01:07.049> to

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
therefore for a guy that had a chance to

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.050 
therefore for a guy that had a chance to
be<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> first-round<00:01:07.799> pick<00:01:08.070> now<00:01:08.520> scouts<00:01:08.909> are

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
be a first-round pick now scouts are

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.910 
be a first-round pick now scouts are
telling<00:01:09.330> me<00:01:09.390> maybe<00:01:09.689> fourth<00:01:10.170> round<00:01:10.470> at<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.710> top

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
telling me maybe fourth round at the top

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.890 
telling me maybe fourth round at the top
but<00:01:11.130> potentially<00:01:11.700> even<00:01:11.939> later<00:01:12.420> than<00:01:12.540> that

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
but potentially even later than that

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.990 
but potentially even later than that
which<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.320> astonishing<00:01:14.100> for<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.310> guy<00:01:14.460> with<00:01:14.490> such

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
which is astonishing for a guy with such

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.390 
which is astonishing for a guy with such
great<00:01:15.360> physical<00:01:16.020> talent<00:01:16.439> decision<00:01:16.920> making<00:01:17.280> is

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
great physical talent decision making is

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.730 
great physical talent decision making is
another<00:01:17.700> thing<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.030> you've<00:01:18.689> heard<00:01:18.990> right

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
another thing that you've heard right

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.170 
another thing that you've heard right
and<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.340> certainly<00:01:20.520> hasn't<00:01:20.850> helped<00:01:21.090> that

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
and and it certainly hasn't helped that

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.310 
and and it certainly hasn't helped that
he<00:01:21.210> was<00:01:21.360> banged<00:01:21.570> up<00:01:21.689> part<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.080> year<00:01:22.200> with

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
he was banged up part of the year with

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.200 
he was banged up part of the year with
an<00:01:22.409> ankle<00:01:22.590> injury<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.340> will<00:01:23.520> create<00:01:23.790> further

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
an ankle injury that will create further

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.999 
an ankle injury that will create further
questions<00:01:24.810> why<00:01:25.229> does<00:01:25.380> give<00:01:25.530> out<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.830> other

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
questions why does give out to other

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.460 
questions why does give out to other

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
and sitting down with him he said one of

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.530 
and sitting down with him he said one of
the<00:02:56.010> most<00:02:56.160> beneficial<00:02:56.340> things<00:02:56.940> for<00:02:57.150> him<00:02:57.330> is

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
the most beneficial things for him is

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.479 
the most beneficial things for him is
that<00:02:57.690> they've<00:02:57.870> moved<00:02:58.170> him<00:02:58.560> around<00:02:58.709> so<00:02:59.310> much

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
that they've moved him around so much

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.400 
that they've moved him around so much
just<00:02:59.760> in<00:02:59.880> terms<00:03:00.239> of<00:03:00.420> his<00:03:00.570> versatility<00:03:01.110> what

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
just in terms of his versatility what

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.780 
just in terms of his versatility what
he'll<00:03:01.560> be<00:03:01.680> able<00:03:01.769> to<00:03:01.920> offer<00:03:01.950> at<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.400> next<00:03:02.640> level

I<00:03:02.970> think<00:03:03.000> that's<00:03:03.269> probably<00:03:03.450> increased<00:03:04.019> to<00:03:04.230> a

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
I think that's probably increased to a

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.470 
I think that's probably increased to a
huge<00:03:04.860> because<00:03:05.160> he's<00:03:05.370> not<00:03:05.550> just<00:03:05.850> a<00:03:06.030> sort<00:03:06.269> of<00:03:06.300> one

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
huge because he's not just a sort of one
