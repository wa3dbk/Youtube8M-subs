00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
people you could have band together in a

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:33.910 
people you could have band together in a
group<00:00:33.050> is<00:00:33.200> you<00:00:33.320> don't<00:00:33.469> want<00:00:33.620> to<00:00:33.680> have<00:00:33.770> more

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
group is you don't want to have more

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.920 
group is you don't want to have more
people<00:00:34.219> that<00:00:34.340> you<00:00:34.489> can<00:00:34.670> feed<00:00:35.060> because<00:00:35.750> once

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
people that you can feed because once

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.270 
people that you can feed because once
you<00:00:36.020> get<00:00:36.140> to<00:00:36.200> where<00:00:36.260> you<00:00:36.350> can't<00:00:36.560> feed<00:00:36.860> people

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
you get to where you can't feed people

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.100 
you get to where you can't feed people
then<00:00:37.850> that's<00:00:38.030> when<00:00:38.180> things<00:00:38.420> go<00:00:38.600> bad<00:00:38.780> people

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
then that's when things go bad people

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.150 
then that's when things go bad people
start<00:00:39.320> turning<00:00:39.650> on<00:00:39.740> each<00:00:39.770> other

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
start turning on each other

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.670 
start turning on each other
so<00:00:41.030> he<00:00:41.300> turned<00:00:41.540> to<00:00:41.630> me<00:00:41.720> and<00:00:41.750> he<00:00:41.840> asked<00:00:42.140> me<00:00:42.260> do<00:00:42.530> we

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
so he turned to me and he asked me do we

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.350 
so he turned to me and he asked me do we
have<00:00:42.860> enough<00:00:43.130> food<00:00:43.400> in<00:00:43.430> our<00:00:43.700> house<00:00:43.940> if<00:00:44.180> things

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
have enough food in our house if things

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.150 
have enough food in our house if things
ever<00:00:44.450> went<00:00:44.720> bad<00:00:44.870> like<00:00:45.140> if<00:00:45.230> we<00:00:45.350> had<00:00:45.560> we're<00:00:45.950> cut

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
ever went bad like if we had we're cut

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.680 
ever went bad like if we had we're cut
off<00:00:46.280> for<00:00:46.520> a<00:00:46.550> while<00:00:46.700> first<00:00:47.060> problem<00:00:47.390> reason<00:00:47.600> or

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
off for a while first problem reason or

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.790 
off for a while first problem reason or
another<00:00:47.750> and<00:00:48.079> I<00:00:48.140> so<00:00:48.290> I<00:00:48.320> think<00:00:48.380> well<00:00:48.650> you<00:00:48.680> know

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
another and I so I think well you know

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.950 
another and I so I think well you know
we<00:00:49.040> really<00:00:49.070> don't<00:00:49.460> so<00:00:50.390> that<00:00:50.540> maybe<00:00:50.690> started

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
we really don't so that maybe started

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.090 
we really don't so that maybe started
thinking<00:00:51.140> I<00:00:51.170> need<00:00:51.350> to<00:00:51.470> start<00:00:51.680> thinking<00:00:52.040> about

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
thinking I need to start thinking about

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.920 
thinking I need to start thinking about
food<00:00:53.200> preparedness<00:00:54.200> for<00:00:55.450> emergency<00:00:56.450> rations

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
food preparedness for emergency rations

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.290 
food preparedness for emergency rations
for<00:00:57.320> natural<00:00:57.950> disaster<00:00:58.579> or<00:00:58.760> anything<00:00:58.970> like

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
for natural disaster or anything like

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.210 
for natural disaster or anything like
that

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
that

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.500 
that
so<00:01:01.220> I<00:01:01.250> started<00:01:01.700> that<00:01:01.850> yeah<00:01:01.970> I<00:01:02.000> think<00:01:02.090> I<00:01:02.329> need<00:01:02.480> a

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
so I started that yeah I think I need a

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.869 
so I started that yeah I think I need a
two-tier<00:01:03.170> system<00:01:03.680> I<00:01:03.890> haven't<00:01:04.460> even<00:01:04.640> come

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
two-tier system I haven't even come

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.490 
two-tier system I haven't even come
close<00:01:04.909> to<00:01:05.329> putting<00:01:05.630> my<00:01:05.780> system<00:01:06.079> together<00:01:06.320> for

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
close to putting my system together for

to start using it they go some bad

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.020 
to start using it they go some bad
faster<00:01:48.409> ones<00:01:48.619> it's<00:01:48.770> open<00:01:49.100> so<00:01:49.549> I<00:01:49.580> mean<00:01:49.790> if
