00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.910
 hello guys well found in this 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.080
 new video we are with the episode of 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.560
 best gb for android 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.119
 I recommend we reach is overcome 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.189
 the 25 I like to have a future 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.800
 episode of this column I know that there is 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.840
 you can easily do the first one 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.400
 Today's game is 99 problems that jam 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.960
 as you see reality as written 51 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.379
 because he was really ahead here 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.230
 31 actually and can own 20 I have not 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:42.480
 made not even one he or unlocked between 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.940
 initially you will be blocked at a 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.340
 really advanced level practically 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.850
 with the tap you will see this square will go 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.039
 to move and will be killed if touched 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.320
 the other white squares in this one 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.390
 case obviously the background will change then 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.520
 cricket level also the type of 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.379
 game will change the level because in 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.800
 some will go from top to bottom 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.160
 in others they will go from bottom to top 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.800
 it is in others it might even exceed 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.080
 the rector screen to find yourself at 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.660
 this side the important thing here you see the 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.970
 number 51 goes down in this case is 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.960
 super there will be the number 50 when 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.210
 will come to the center 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.790
 in many cases you don't even need to go overboard 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.580
 totally level when it arrives at 100 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.350
 obviously in the middle sorry passera 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.810
 next level this thing also for 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.840
 the other two types of level I do 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.550
 see one at random as you can see here 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.420
 for example this thing intermittently 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.470
 they are really complicated by having to 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.610
 handle 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.100
 we must arrive even in the moment 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.700
 just the second game today and yes 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.530
 knock down 2 if you have seen the episode of 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.040
 multiplayer games and run in 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.810
 collaboration we say with blake we have 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.490
 having seen the title number 1 to have warned 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.600
 as a mortgage that basically I am not 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.970
 in the same way we can go to 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.950
 play against the computer in this 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.020
 case against the smartphone against a 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.640
 other player against player 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.310
 product way the player online for 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.690
 community video-reviewing environment 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.330
 we choose against the computer mode 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.140
 advanced classic we also do one 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.170
 classic mode and to explain you can 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.530
 do them automatically as you see them 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.260
 manage him how to put the boats 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.970
 let's see in battle 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:33.830
 obviously this side we will go to 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:36.970
 click on each point once and 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.620
 we had to try to take down the ships 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.630
 of the computer for example we have 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.709
 pecked one is this case we have 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:48.140
 wrong maybe we try to go upstairs 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.850
 ok to say that here it has cheated me instead 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.390
 so this is the biggest one e 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:56.930
 even the comets obviously go 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.660
 precisely to destroy these ships 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.170
 let's say about our opponent 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:06.530
 today's cast about alien is a game 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.990
 really very nice I did some 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.140
 level then had to cancel them 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.640
 install it anyway you see that with 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.750
 these two darts can go 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.180
 to change the view of yours 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.190
 ball while with these arrows 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.040
 tended to the left back and forth 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:30.160
 clear goal is to arrive 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:34.160
 at the end of the level without wrong 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:38.230
 at the end of the level without falling of 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.370
 below the first level is really 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.070
 you can see very simply here it is possible 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:47.630
 going to shoot I always want to come back 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:49.790
 to fill first we go forward but 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.050
 practically it will become white because in 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:56.570
 this case so we could do the climbs 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.280
 in the other case but no then here 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.519
 we can go right to left in 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:06.310
 this post we want but we are not interested 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:13.270
 continue straight on is once you get 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:15.390
 it seems to me that at this point of boxing but 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.840
 that in this way than there is 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:22.280
 could go here then it becomes 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:26.010
 black again so we can go to 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.870
 move for example for these boulders 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.360
 go get the fallen we go 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:34.080
 to take those small particles and 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:37.070
 last day of today and mp3 2.0 the 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.870
 game itself advises you to go to 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:43.890
 select to use headphones 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:46.410
 oh well one day we are interested in returning 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.380
 back then i only did the 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.980
 first level as you see and it really is 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.120
 I will be very difficult too 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:59.280
 just denied covered advertising 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:00.500
 we can run away from advertising on 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.580
 advertising 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:08.340
 let's take this first level 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:12.990
 start is practically a kind of of 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:16.230
 cute of course I'm really 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.540
 linked to these types of games however there is 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.350
 I show chiavari 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.350
 don't like it 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.300
 a bit of concentration 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:48.390
 I have seen however the shooting but the 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.390
 competent island video camera throttled 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.990
 obviously it's really hard too 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.480
 because you find it horizontally not in 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:05.270
 vertical for antifreeze tired therefore 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.770
 for this episode it's all I remember you 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.660
 I like to write to the kailash 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.160
