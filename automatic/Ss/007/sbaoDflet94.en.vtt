was<00:01:43.350> not<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.670> hadn't<00:01:45.149> booted<00:01:45.420> up<00:01:45.630> before<00:01:45.930> I

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
was not on I hadn't booted up before I

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.719 
was not on I hadn't booted up before I
just<00:01:46.170> turned<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.680> prior<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.490> filming

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
in sketchbook for example even in

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.580 
in sketchbook for example even in
Photoshop<00:01:57.460> it<00:01:58.460> has<00:01:58.790> like<00:01:59.120> no<00:01:59.450> lag<00:01:59.690> it's<00:02:00.140> just

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
Photoshop it has like no lag it's just

good example if I were to buy the

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.460 
good example if I were to buy the

without<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:00.800> computer<00:04:01.220> and<00:04:01.400> then<00:04:01.670> a<00:04:01.940> MacBook

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
without the computer and then a MacBook

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.320 
without the computer and then a MacBook
Air<00:04:03.220> that<00:04:04.220> is<00:04:04.490> that<00:04:04.700> the<00:04:04.790> same<00:04:05.000> has<00:04:05.300> a

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
Air that is that the same has a

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:06.910 
Air that is that the same has a
basically<00:04:05.780> the<00:04:05.870> same<00:04:06.020> spec<00:04:06.350> it<00:04:06.620> gives<00:04:06.800> a

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
basically the same spec it gives a

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.560 
basically the same spec it gives a
memory<00:04:07.510> Intel<00:04:08.510> Core<00:04:08.720> i7<00:04:10.060> basically<00:04:11.060> you<00:04:11.420> would

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
memory Intel Core i7 basically you would

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.100 
memory Intel Core i7 basically you would
be<00:04:11.890> right<00:04:12.890> at<00:04:13.070> you'd<00:04:14.060> be<00:04:14.210> pretty<00:04:14.600> much<00:04:14.720> over

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
be right at you'd be pretty much over

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.220 
be right at you'd be pretty much over
$2,500<00:04:15.950> you'd<00:04:16.070> be<00:04:16.160> at<00:04:16.250> about<00:04:16.450> $2,800<00:04:17.450> and<00:04:17.660> so

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
$2,500 you'd be at about $2,800 and so

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:19.930 
$2,500 you'd be at about $2,800 and so
the<00:04:18.680> value<00:04:19.130> that<00:04:19.280> you're<00:04:19.430> getting<00:04:19.459> with<00:04:19.820> this

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
the value that you're getting with this

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.220 
the value that you're getting with this
is<00:04:20.269> exceptional<00:04:21.109> and<00:04:22.070> I'm<00:04:22.720> I've<00:04:23.720> had<00:04:23.960> a<00:04:23.990> great
