00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.299
 [Music] 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.849
 ah 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:11.350
 we had a bad start of the start it 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.320
 saw that the team did not 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.120
 did not work 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.610
 and I think the biggest difficulty is 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.050
 we had half of court for ahead 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.550
 out there some tactical mistakes that 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.099
 we had that we were just talking to 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.850
 the players have to correct it 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.700
 immediately 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.100
 and I think we were overcome by that 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.260
 in the first time they were in the 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.910
 start mainly I think that 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.250
 the first minutes we had had 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.730
 two or three situations that could 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.730
 have materialized 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.130
 so there are some things taxis things 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.210
 tactics that we have more wrong but 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.290
 surely we will try to 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.970
 correct for the party next 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.230
 I think it's been a long time since 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:55.310
 we have a start this way 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:57.560
 it was not planned it was not no 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.220
 what we had put together this equipment for 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:05.300
 really because we have players who 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:08.540
 they have very good foot well juan 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.950
 but it was also this is the beginning and the 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.360
 start of the championship we have to 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.730
 recover 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.220
 was convinced by the group that we have 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.020
 the character that the players have 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.030
 surely we are going to lift 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.109
 you have to work half-court to 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.469
 go ahead and we have to do it 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:26.909
 urgently because I think they are 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:29.159
 very few chances we had 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.659
 both in the handling in the handling of what 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.360
 what other things to work with and 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.719
 surely in the week in this week 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:40.530
 we are going to improve you saw it what 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:42.350
 what happened first was not criminal and second 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.950
 he did not come forward 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.689
 it seems that those are very serious false 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.340
 an important classic and it's very 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.970
 obvious because after everyone 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.730
 go and 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.640
 and surely there is the last time I go 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.700
 to the opinion of the referees 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.590
 because it seems to me that not in the party 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.900
 during the game or you can go wrong 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.479
 us we can have bugs me 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.700
 Like I always said that they win me that 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.459
 they win me well that they win me playing that 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.840
 they win me that if they are superior to our 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:18.209
 team but it seems to me that in this case 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.770
 the referee is wrong I think what 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.790
 What happens is that they lack respect for 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.620
 club to the institution a ramón díaz ni is 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.200
 the club that is lacking in respect and that 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.360
 it's something I do not like 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.830
 because I think that river is one of the most 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.310
 equipment of the teams at level 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.660
 world 's most important international 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.989
 then when you are lacking in respect to 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.099
 this way and serious for that reason with the 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.120
 players we are going to have much more 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.739
 attention let's go to 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.299
 and before, also a party so 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.909
 important that we play on Sunday the 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:52.459
 Thursday then we are going to do 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.530
 very punctual in taking the precautions 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:58.550
 we want it 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.200
 we try and try to play 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.240
 there we can play well we can play 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.970
 wrong but we always do it in this 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.770
 mind that what we 're going to go towards me 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.020
 it seems that if you analyze well 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.610
 when you try for a criminal and you see it and 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.860
 then in the repetition why not 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.260
 we wanted to talk to do because out there 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.970
 this is going to say things that are not 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.800
 correspond then today we went very 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.800
 punctual and you see that he did not get ahead 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.879
 then when guy makes you repeat in 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.939
 the magnet that is standing there that sees it 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:32.000
 perfectly that is not ahead there 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:34.100
 something that is not going 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.680
 and mainly that they are missing 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.850
 the respect to the club not to ramón díaz nor to 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.350
 the players I think they are 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.120
 disrespecting the athletic club 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.050
 river plate worries the half of 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.380
 court forwards 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:50.170
 because the team handles the ball well 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.700
 we have to keep the ball a 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.860
 little bit above we were talking 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.450
 with them there are errors for half of 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.690
 field mainly for forward that 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.710
 we have to correct it immediately 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.930
 because there are parties that we have done 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.450
 very well and the party that how to do in 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.330
 I did not like this case and that's for 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.760
 improve me I like what I do know where 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.330
 I'm the pressures that exist on 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.310
 team has to play better 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.250
 I think the team can not play 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.350
 this way I assume all the 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.209
 responsibilities because I was the one 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.880
 arm the team the one that I decided to play 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.640
 what o fabbro and arrears 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.020
 my responsibility that's why we're going to 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.120
 try to correct and mickey the 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.390
 players better because to play in 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.030
 river has to play much better 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:38.380
 in this case seeing the images already 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.969
 both in the play of the goal and in the penalty 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.549
 they are very discussed 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:45.709
 then that no longer against us 

00:04:43.549 --> 00:04:47.419
 I can not do that anymore 

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:50.029
 nothing we can not do anything a ball 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:53.119
 crossed and in a penalty against gymnastics 

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:55.579
 that was not very doubtful either and I think that 

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:58.459
 when the river president speaks and 

00:04:55.579 --> 00:05:00.349
 the leaders surely when they take 

00:04:58.459 --> 00:05:03.009
 letters in the matter mainly that 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:04.930
 they do not lack in respect to anything else 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:06.020
 because river is a very big club 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.660
 [Music] 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.030
 we have 60 percent of the fans 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.770
 who are river fans so I 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.440
 only one that I want the referees not to 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:24.150
 lack of respect for lead 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:24.150
