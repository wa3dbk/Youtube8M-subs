00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.580

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.920
 series hunters game and look what I 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.740
 I got it today in the box and it's up to a 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.570
 coincidence of destination and nonino destination 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.430
 where you only have one video of the 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.199
 8 bit Sunday nigger did not bring 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.599

 home series two games for the super 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.850
 nintendo looks that interesting is how 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.160
 said it seems an irony of fate or 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.520
 but there is an original 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.920

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.890
 Mario in the box looking that cool 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.350
 the key in the power box is complicated 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.309
 It's more expensive, it's not too bad. 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.710
 like this 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.410
 the box is not such a expensive game I paid 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.289
 he can do it with his comrade and 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.449

 There was no such game, so here it is. 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.810
 for collection and as says an irony of 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.390
 destination that has the original internal cradle 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.070
 and also to see the original but he has 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.520
 It's okay with us because it 's a cartridge. 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:27.860
 pretty old cartridge and car stereo looks 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:31.530

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.840

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.180

 state that is sure to have 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.799

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.680
 from there until you find someone who will take care 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:48.780
 I'm sure she'll take care of herself and me. 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:51.689
 until your turn is curious and you're right. 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.390
 this morning when we see the 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.909

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:11.099
 Look that is cool and interesting 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.450
 Kind of happened to me from a salesman here. 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.010

 want to buy it sells for the prices 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.519
 very interesting even if it takes a lot 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.069
 there is customs warehouse customs 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:30.220
 life they have been imprisoned for years and 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.860
 years and years and maybe this will be the case or not 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.690
 I think it was a rental car but 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.830

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.930

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.269

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.370

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.739
 that you liked a simple game 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.849
 but that brings a lot of history with you 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.190
 of course not 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.170
