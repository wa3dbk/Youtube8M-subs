different<00:01:42.170> viewpoint<00:01:42.590> and<00:01:42.740> they<00:01:42.860> just<00:01:43.069> didn't

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
different viewpoint and they just didn't

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:44.680 
different viewpoint and they just didn't
know<00:01:43.700> what<00:01:43.880> it<00:01:43.970> was<00:01:44.060> about<00:01:44.179> and<00:01:44.509> they<00:01:44.630> were

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
know what it was about and they were

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.480 
know what it was about and they were
taught<00:01:45.020> that<00:01:45.259> when<00:01:45.619> you<00:01:45.860> bring<00:01:46.069> up<00:01:46.160> the<00:01:46.340> word

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
taught that when you bring up the word

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.150 
taught that when you bring up the word
witch<00:01:46.759> or<00:01:47.030> pagan<00:01:47.660> or<00:01:48.110> magic<00:01:48.619> or<00:01:48.740> anything<00:01:49.130> like

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
witch or pagan or magic or anything like

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.070 
witch or pagan or magic or anything like
that<00:01:49.340> they<00:01:49.700> think<00:01:49.759> it's<00:01:50.060> evil<00:01:50.479> the<00:01:50.720> hint<00:01:50.929> gets

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
that they think it's evil the hint gets

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.590 
that they think it's evil the hint gets
wrong<00:01:51.319> and<00:01:51.590> so<00:01:52.130> number<00:01:52.729> one<00:01:52.910> thing<00:01:53.179> from<00:01:53.390> my

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
wrong and so number one thing from my

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.389 
wrong and so number one thing from my
experience<00:01:54.140> is<00:01:54.319> that<00:01:54.350> they<00:01:54.679> just<00:01:54.830> don't<00:01:55.039> know

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
experience is that they just don't know

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.180 
experience is that they just don't know
yet<00:01:55.789> and<00:01:56.030> if<00:01:56.270> you<00:01:56.509> talk<00:01:56.929> to<00:01:57.200> them<00:01:57.350> if<00:01:57.649> that's

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
yet and if you talk to them if that's

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.580 
yet and if you talk to them if that's
possible<00:01:58.490> in<00:01:59.060> some<00:01:59.420> way<00:01:59.600> you<00:01:59.630> know<00:02:00.050> try<00:02:00.440> and

studying Wicca all the stuff I just told

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.390 
studying Wicca all the stuff I just told
you<00:02:56.330> that<00:02:56.660> you<00:02:57.230> just<00:02:57.440> agreed<00:02:57.739> with<00:02:57.769> and<00:02:58.190> said

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
you that you just agreed with and said

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.520 
you that you just agreed with and said
is<00:02:58.519> not<00:02:58.550> that<00:02:58.849> scary<00:02:59.150> is<00:02:59.390> what<00:02:59.750> i<00:02:59.930> mean<00:03:00.260> by<00:03:00.500> that

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
is not that scary is what i mean by that

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.890 
is not that scary is what i mean by that
and<00:03:00.950> she<00:03:01.280> was<00:03:01.400> floored<00:03:01.790> she<00:03:02.180> had<00:03:02.300> absolutely

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
and she was floored she had absolutely

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.690 
and she was floored she had absolutely
no<00:03:03.170> idea<00:03:03.200> that<00:03:03.800> that<00:03:03.830> had<00:03:04.130> anything<00:03:04.370> to<00:03:04.519> do

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
no idea that that had anything to do

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.390 
no idea that that had anything to do
with<00:03:04.730> it<00:03:04.910> so<00:03:05.150> i<00:03:05.390> think<00:03:05.810> that's<00:03:06.650> probably<00:03:06.950> a<00:03:07.190> big

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
with it so i think that's probably a big

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.100 
with it so i think that's probably a big
part<00:03:07.610> of<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.790> problem<00:03:07.819> so<00:03:08.360> if<00:03:08.390> you<00:03:08.690> can<00:03:08.900> talk

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
part of the problem so if you can talk

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.479 
part of the problem so if you can talk
to<00:03:09.290> your<00:03:09.440> parents<00:03:09.560> which<00:03:09.890> you<00:03:10.010> should<00:03:10.220> be<00:03:10.250> able

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
to your parents which you should be able

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.550 
to your parents which you should be able
to<00:03:10.730> I<00:03:10.760> hope<00:03:10.849> you<00:03:11.150> can<00:03:11.420> try<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:11.959> talk<00:03:12.230> to<00:03:12.410> them

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560

about what you really believe and
there's<00:03:15.260> a<00:03:15.349> chance<00:03:15.560> that<00:03:15.650> they're<00:03:15.830> still<00:03:16.040> not

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
there's a chance that they're still not

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.770 
there's a chance that they're still not
going<00:03:16.280> to<00:03:16.370> be<00:03:16.459> okay<00:03:16.700> with<00:03:16.730> it<00:03:16.880> anyway<00:03:17.209> my<00:03:17.630> mom

I<00:03:19.790> believe<00:03:20.060> where<00:03:20.209> she<00:03:20.360> doesn't<00:03:20.599> agree<00:03:21.260> with

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
I believe where she doesn't agree with

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.830 
I believe where she doesn't agree with
them<00:03:21.530> but<00:03:21.709> she's<00:03:22.040> okay<00:03:22.400> with<00:03:22.549> it<00:03:22.610> and<00:03:22.880> so<00:03:23.209> don't

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
them but she's okay with it and so don't

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.500 
them but she's okay with it and so don't
expect<00:03:23.959> them<00:03:24.290> to<00:03:24.650> be<00:03:25.010> like<00:03:25.040> oh<00:03:25.220> we're<00:03:25.970> pagan<00:03:26.299> to

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
expect them to be like oh we're pagan to

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.479 
expect them to be like oh we're pagan to
or<00:03:26.720> anything<00:03:26.870> like<00:03:27.170> that<00:03:27.319> I<00:03:27.709> mean<00:03:28.010> don't

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
or anything like that I mean don't

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.870 
or anything like that I mean don't
expect<00:03:28.970> miracles<00:03:29.870> my<00:03:30.620> goodness<00:03:30.890> so<00:03:31.579> give<00:03:31.790> them

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
expect miracles my goodness so give them

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.569 
expect miracles my goodness so give them
time<00:03:32.090> to<00:03:32.390> think<00:03:33.230> about<00:03:33.410> it<00:03:33.590> Mull<00:03:34.040> it<00:03:34.190> over<00:03:34.430> but

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
time to think about it Mull it over but

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.120 
time to think about it Mull it over but
it<00:03:34.700> is<00:03:34.849> definitely<00:03:35.420> better<00:03:35.900> if<00:03:36.200> you<00:03:36.680> can<00:03:36.860> talk

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
it is definitely better if you can talk

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.130 
it is definitely better if you can talk
and<00:03:37.519> tell<00:03:38.000> people<00:03:38.030> and<00:03:38.450> be<00:03:38.540> honest<00:03:38.840> with<00:03:38.870> them

and tell people and be honest with them

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.509 
and tell people and be honest with them
because<00:03:39.319> the<00:03:39.799> worst<00:03:39.920> thing<00:03:40.040> you<00:03:40.190> can<00:03:40.280> do<00:03:40.400> is

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
because the worst thing you can do is

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.309 
because the worst thing you can do is
hide<00:03:40.700> it<00:03:40.880> in<00:03:40.970> my<00:03:41.000> opinion<00:03:41.390> so<00:03:41.690> definitely<00:03:42.079> do

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
hide it in my opinion so definitely do

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.530 
hide it in my opinion so definitely do
not<00:03:42.470> hide<00:03:42.980> in<00:03:43.160> your<00:03:43.190> room<00:03:43.340> and<00:03:43.849> hide<00:03:44.060> stuff

from them by like you know just making
it<00:03:48.200> an<00:03:48.850> obscure<00:03:49.850> scary<00:03:50.480> thing<00:03:50.810> for<00:03:50.840> them<00:03:51.170> by

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709

it an obscure scary thing for them by
hiding<00:03:52.040> it<00:03:52.340> if<00:03:52.489> you're<00:03:52.609> open<00:03:52.819> about<00:03:53.030> it

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
hiding it if you're open about it

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.930 
hiding it if you're open about it
they'll<00:03:53.870> see<00:03:54.079> that<00:03:54.230> it's<00:03:54.410> not<00:03:54.739> that<00:03:55.100> weird<00:03:55.670> and

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
they'll see that it's not that weird and

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.970 
they'll see that it's not that weird and
maybe<00:03:56.359> the<00:03:56.540> way<00:03:56.660> you<00:03:56.690> practice<00:03:57.019> paganism<00:03:57.590> is

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
maybe the way you practice paganism is

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.099 
maybe the way you practice paganism is
weird<00:03:58.730> by<00:03:58.970> some<00:03:59.180> people's<00:03:59.480> standards<00:03:59.870> maybe

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
weird by some people's standards maybe

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.559 
weird by some people's standards maybe
you<00:04:00.319> do<00:04:00.470> want<00:04:00.500> to<00:04:00.799> have<00:04:00.950> the<00:04:01.280> silver<00:04:01.880> spiders

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
you do want to have the silver spiders

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.830 
you do want to have the silver spiders
on<00:04:02.810> your<00:04:03.019> f<00:04:03.170> MA<00:04:03.560> and<00:04:03.889> a<00:04:03.950> black<00:04:04.760> box<00:04:05.150> with<00:04:05.569> stuff

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
on your f MA and a black box with stuff

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.780 
on your f MA and a black box with stuff
in<00:04:05.959> it<00:04:06.079> and<00:04:06.139> maybe<00:04:06.410> you<00:04:06.620> do<00:04:06.799> want<00:04:06.829> to<00:04:07.310> look

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
in it and maybe you do want to look

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.970 
in it and maybe you do want to look
scary<00:04:08.239> and<00:04:08.569> that's<00:04:08.840> totally<00:04:09.230> fine<00:04:09.440> but<00:04:09.920> I

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
scary and that's totally fine but I

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.259 
scary and that's totally fine but I
still<00:04:10.250> think<00:04:10.459> the<00:04:10.519> worst<00:04:10.700> thing<00:04:10.819> you<00:04:11.000> can<00:04:11.120> do

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
still think the worst thing you can do

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.170 
still think the worst thing you can do
is<00:04:11.540> hide<00:04:12.230> that<00:04:12.530> so<00:04:12.920> no<00:04:13.459> matter<00:04:13.549> what<00:04:13.700> it<00:04:13.910> is<00:04:13.970> be

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
is hide that so no matter what it is be

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.270 
is hide that so no matter what it is be
