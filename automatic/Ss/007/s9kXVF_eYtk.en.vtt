00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:19.390
 Pencil bait 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:27.750
 But I think the top over to the court from the other Hey, the second half of the summer to come out and have E sedge things 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:33.450
 One normally this is I do such things as it is text book boss image water in the late summer 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:38.430
 I think that the transparency is not so good when I wake up that the fish is on the shallow side 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:42.000
 I do not like it, but I say that some seaweed has been added 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:47.040
 It is easy to move to the fish shallow side at a stretch 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.710
 Then something also about to say you do 30 centimeters in Tsu yo was running in there bicycle yesterday I 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.230
 There is only promotion 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:56.930
 The place was a new land until yesterday there is Komizu 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.960
 Toka and out in 49 centimeter 50 captain'm Buster from j league After Nokka' 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.360
 It's coming up who entered the place that say with're such Toko 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:08.290
 It is are you came in five colors 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:11.080
 It is shaving easy to fish that do Speaking of relatively fishing easy to fish because they came in a predatory 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.710
 There's no sticky stew. 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:21.250
 More and more minute fishing exploring the relatively speedy 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:22.790
 When I chose a port , I did a lot and it was too small and bigger than a port 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:29.150
 I 'm in front of a porter 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:30.860
 And it depends on what kind of obstacle there is at that time 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.300
 Basically 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.200
 Close 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:39.190
 strong 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.270
 Nearby is relatively shallow and is than the movement of the lateral is less 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:45.049
 For example Oriza 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:50.450
 Those that I'm super spoon likely but was near Asahi and 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.929
 If you give out the motion of the forecast, this will run away from the baitfish it is so shallow 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.270
 so 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:58.460
 I'm the reaction is good if the look together with that rice that Nigemado' 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.170
 I am always 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.360
 Where did you talk 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.120
 The larger the difference between the baitfishes 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:11.710
 After all it is easy to take out the bus 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:15.160
 Naturally , if the size of the lure is increased, the number of strikes is relatively high. 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.630
 It is generally said that touching 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.930
 When conditions like now 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:24.730
 Summer Thoughts are also true during summer 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.690
 The increase in turbidity when there is a certain level of training 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.730
 Because it comes to the fish shallow side with predatory elements 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.900
 Top Those who some degree Pocky is to reverse the use 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.210
 Small but included 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.880
 Right 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.230
 But with confidence 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:42.130
 Please go there and it 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:44.230
 About going to things dropped the speed I wonder if there is no strike 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:49.330
 My stoke will decrease 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:51.610
 Conversely, let's move our head more and more slowly. 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.100
 Good sprouting went 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:58.200
 It's reaction is good 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:00.560
 The rhythm of movement and its speed if you dare to say 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:05.090
 By changing more and more quickly 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:11.000
 I understand the best speed and movement under the conditions 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:16.910
 Okay because the place where turbid basically did find it to continue to use it much 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:22.959
 However, I put a change at the point of the ranker point that I think I'm dad by myself 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.959
 I think that it is easier for me to put out Decabas
