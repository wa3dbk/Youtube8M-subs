right<00:00:37.230> into<00:00:38.390> your<00:00:39.390> foam<00:00:39.809> works<00:00:40.410> very<00:00:40.890> nicely

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
right into your foam works very nicely

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.850 
right into your foam works very nicely
and<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.360> last<00:00:42.600> supply<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.530> we're<00:00:43.680> going<00:00:43.770> to

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
and the last supply that we're going to

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.190 
and the last supply that we're going to
use<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> lot<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.430> today<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.690> steel<00:00:45.930> pick

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
use a lot of today is the steel pick

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.200 
use a lot of today is the steel pick
machine<00:00:46.620> if<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.190> don't<00:00:47.579> have<00:00:47.760> one<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:47.969> these

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
machine if you don't have one of these

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.790 
machine if you don't have one of these
get<00:00:48.930> one<00:00:49.230> quick<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:50.399> has<00:00:50.670> metal<00:00:51.539> steel<00:00:51.960> pics<00:00:52.469> I

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
get one quick it has metal steel pics I

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.680 
get one quick it has metal steel pics I
guess<00:00:53.250> if<00:00:53.399> they're<00:00:53.610> still<00:00:53.850> there<00:00:53.910> metal<00:00:54.510> and

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
guess if they're still there metal and

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.400 
guess if they're still there metal and
they<00:00:55.620> slide<00:00:55.949> right<00:00:56.340> into<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.850> Machine<00:00:57.239> and

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
they slide right into the Machine and

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.610 
they slide right into the Machine and
there's<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.469> weight<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:58.829> goes<00:00:59.250> on<00:00:59.430> top<00:00:59.489> and

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
there's a weight that goes on top and

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.139 
there's a weight that goes on top and
then<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.770> can<00:01:01.949> use<00:01:02.190> these<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.820> make<00:01:03.000> your

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
then you can use these to make your

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.289 
then you can use these to make your
stems<00:01:03.420> longer<00:01:04.019> or<00:01:04.290> make<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.890> end<00:01:05.070> sharp<00:01:05.220> ER<00:01:05.790> so

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
stems longer or make the end sharp ER so

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.270 
stems longer or make the end sharp ER so
that<00:01:06.510> they<00:01:06.630> can<00:01:06.869> stick<00:01:07.229> into<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.710> foam<00:01:07.950> nice

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
that they can stick into the foam nice

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.420 
that they can stick into the foam nice
and<00:01:08.520> easy<00:01:09.080> so<00:01:10.080> we've<00:01:10.260> got<00:01:10.439> our<00:01:10.470> bowl<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:11.010> we've

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
and easy so we've got our bowl and we've

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.280 
and easy so we've got our bowl and we've

got our candle and i will make a round

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.580 
got our candle and i will make a round
centerpiece<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.220> go<00:01:14.369> around<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:15.470> what<00:01:16.470> i'm

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
centerpiece to go around this what i'm

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.890 
centerpiece to go around this what i'm
going<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.950> do<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.490> use<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.420> steel<00:01:18.659> pick

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
going to do is use the steel pick

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.429 
going to do is use the steel pick
machine<00:01:19.320> by<00:01:19.799> putting<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.280> flower<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.970> and

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:21.439 
machine by putting the flower in and

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:26.179 
machine by putting the flower in and
clamping<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.590> down<00:01:23.330> and<00:01:24.710> that<00:01:25.710> puts<00:01:26.009> this

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
clamping it down and that puts this

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.690 
clamping it down and that puts this
steel<00:01:26.520> pick<00:01:26.850> on<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.689> flower<00:01:28.549> see<00:01:29.549> how

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
steel pick on to the flower see how

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.520 
steel pick on to the flower see how
nicely<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.180> goes<00:01:30.509> into<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.930> foam

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.230 

i'm<00:01:36.530> going<00:01:36.710> to<00:01:36.800> use<00:01:36.980> threes<00:01:37.430> we<00:01:37.730> always<00:01:38.030> use

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
i'm going to use threes we always use

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.930 
i'm going to use threes we always use
three<00:01:38.600> when<00:01:38.810> we're<00:01:38.960> designing<00:01:39.520> all<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.670> times

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
three when we're designing all the times

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.000 
three when we're designing all the times
you<00:01:41.120> can<00:01:41.300> wire<00:01:41.540> and<00:01:41.840> tape<00:01:42.080> but<00:01:42.500> this<00:01:42.650> is<00:01:42.830> all

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
you can wire and tape but this is all

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.090 
you can wire and tape but this is all
expensive<00:01:43.880> and<00:01:44.150> takes<00:01:44.570> time<00:01:44.990> if<00:01:45.650> you<00:01:45.860> have<00:01:46.070> a

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
expensive and takes time if you have a

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.830 
expensive and takes time if you have a
lot<00:01:46.370> to<00:01:46.580> do<00:01:46.700> when<00:01:46.880> you<00:01:47.000> don't<00:01:47.030> have<00:01:47.330> time<00:01:47.600> to

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
lot to do when you don't have time to

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.870 
lot to do when you don't have time to
wire<00:01:48.020> and<00:01:48.290> tape<00:01:48.500> everything<00:01:48.860> then<00:01:49.580> get

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
wire and tape everything then get

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.990 
wire and tape everything then get
yourself<00:01:50.030> one<00:01:50.450> of<00:01:50.510> these<00:01:50.630> nice<00:01:50.960> pic<00:01:51.260> missions

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
yourself one of these nice pic missions

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.400 
yourself one of these nice pic missions
so<00:01:53.000> we<00:01:53.120> put<00:01:53.330> three<00:01:53.750> gardenias<00:01:54.470> in<00:01:54.680> and<00:01:55.330> below

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
so we put three gardenias in and below

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.380 
so we put three gardenias in and below
each<00:01:57.410> of<00:01:57.740> the<00:01:57.920> first<00:01:58.130> three<00:01:58.340> that<00:01:58.700> we<00:01:58.790> put<00:01:59.030> in<00:01:59.180> I

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
each of the first three that we put in I

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.060 
each of the first three that we put in I
