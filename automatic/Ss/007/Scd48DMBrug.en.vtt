00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:04.840
 my grandmother one day told me a phrase that stuck with me for a long time 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.089
 the word impacts 

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:10.449
 but the example drags 

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:14.619
 well I said it because it is truly many of the human beings we are good 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:17.369
 to give advice but very bad to live them 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.350
 and probably you, madam or lord, have spent all your life 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.019
 wanting to educate their children under certain precepts under certain values 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.539
 certain virtues 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.560
 and unfortunately that advice has not succeeded 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.260
 has not been successful with this exhortation 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.450
 so it hits 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.710
 it was simply that people truly learn more than they should 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.100
 of what they say 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.160
 and this one can not verify frequently when asking our 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.950
 children that we are a little more patients that are not so loud and 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.200
 ended with that of you screams you get impatient when in the car that 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.170
 do the person who goes ahead take off zonza 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.170
 and truly that kind of attitudes the child love 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.870
 the girl not closed 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:01.760
 and knows what 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.420
 they were happy in such a way that their conscious that determines to become 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.370
 in addicted 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.270
 It's useless to tell the children to eat them healthy if 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.550
 this one does not 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.760
 penalties and reviewed that you will tell me to be honest if it was the fashion favors 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.300
 corruption when giving bites to traffic agents when it reaches 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.560
 happen that if monterrey rarÃ­simo is 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.540
 but it's no use too 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.390
 let him tell you to respect your mom 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.340
 if you as a parent do not respect 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.500
 to Mrs. 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.390
 to their mother they truly are incongruences of life 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.490
 and unfortunately our life is full of that inconsistencies 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.500
 of things that we demand 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.370
 but we do not like that they demand us 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.189
 of things that we preach 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.310
 but that in our between these acts 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.810
 are far from what we say 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.750
 the wonderful incongruity is 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.160
 truly 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.020
 do what we think what we say but we act that there is harmony in 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.010
 those three 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.870
 it did not prosper 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:01.600
 until next time
