00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
good but oh it's so hard but I think it

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.550 
good but oh it's so hard but I think it
turned<00:01:30.690> out<00:01:30.840> nice<00:01:31.830> I<00:01:32.220> guess<00:01:32.760> I<00:01:33.690> definitely

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
turned out nice I guess I definitely

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.490 
turned out nice I guess I definitely
like<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.640> exterior<00:01:36.090> better<00:01:36.720> but<00:01:37.290> yeah<00:01:38.150> I

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
house view is just amazing but I think

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.820 
house view is just amazing but I think
every<00:01:47.730> house<00:01:47.940> in<00:01:48.240> this

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
every house in this

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.540 
every house in this
would<00:01:49.370> have<00:01:49.700> an<00:01:50.000> amazing<00:01:50.270> view<00:01:50.810> but<00:01:51.530> yeah<00:01:51.980> I<00:01:52.010> I

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
would have an amazing view but yeah I I

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.570

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
just think the view is just beautiful

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.650 
just think the view is just beautiful
and<00:01:56.200> it's<00:01:57.200> kind<00:01:57.440> of<00:01:57.500> my<00:01:57.710> thing<00:01:58.000> when<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.420> time

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
and it's kind of my thing when the time

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.470 
and it's kind of my thing when the time
comes<00:02:00.020> and<00:02:00.380> I<00:02:00.830> have<00:02:01.190> to<00:02:01.370> choose<00:02:01.640> my<00:02:01.910> own<00:02:01.940> house

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:02.480

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
that's definitely something that I will

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.390
