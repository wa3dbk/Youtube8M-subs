figure<00:03:06.720> into<00:03:07.200> various<00:03:07.739> poses<00:03:08.040> now<00:03:08.909> we<00:03:08.970> do<00:03:09.239> have

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
figure into various poses now we do have

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.170 
figure into various poses now we do have
articulation<00:03:10.019> to<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.799> top<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.849> leg<00:03:12.030> at

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
articulation to the top of the leg at

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.909 
articulation to the top of the leg at
the<00:03:12.269> top<00:03:12.510> of<00:03:12.659> the<00:03:12.780> thigh<00:03:13.019> and<00:03:13.349> then<00:03:13.620> we<00:03:13.709> also

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:13.919 
the top of the thigh and then we also

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:15.770 
the top of the thigh and then we also
have<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.579> second<00:03:15.090> point<00:03:15.239> of<00:03:15.419> articulation

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
have the second point of articulation

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.740 
have the second point of articulation
where<00:03:16.739> you<00:03:16.859> can<00:03:17.010> actually<00:03:17.159> twist<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:18.329> leg<00:03:18.569> as

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
where you can actually twist the leg as

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.220 
where you can actually twist the leg as
well<00:03:19.439> and<00:03:19.709> then<00:03:20.129> the<00:03:20.280> knee<00:03:20.519> joint<00:03:20.849> is<00:03:21.150> a<00:03:21.230> double

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
well and then the knee joint is a double

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.970 
well and then the knee joint is a double
joint<00:03:23.480> articulation<00:03:24.480> so<00:03:25.049> either<00:03:25.319> side<00:03:25.650> of<00:03:25.829> the

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
joint articulation so either side of the

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.759 
joint articulation so either side of the
knee<00:03:26.129> top<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.730> bottom<00:03:27.150> you<00:03:27.659> can<00:03:27.959> move<00:03:28.409> the

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
knee top and bottom you can move the

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.259 
knee top and bottom you can move the
lake<00:03:29.069> so<00:03:29.250> it<00:03:29.370> does<00:03:29.549> give<00:03:29.729> you<00:03:29.879> a<00:03:29.909> lot<00:03:30.239> of

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
lake so it does give you a lot of

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.080 
lake so it does give you a lot of
freedom<00:03:30.750> of<00:03:31.049> movement<00:03:31.109> and<00:03:31.739> then<00:03:32.489> down<00:03:32.819> to<00:03:32.849> the

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
freedom of movement and then down to the

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.319 
freedom of movement and then down to the
foot<00:03:33.299> as<00:03:33.449> well<00:03:33.599> the<00:03:33.780> ankle<00:03:34.260> joint<00:03:34.500> is<00:03:35.329> jointed

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
foot as well the ankle joint is jointed

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.050 
foot as well the ankle joint is jointed
as<00:03:36.479> well<00:03:36.690> we<00:03:36.810> get<00:03:36.930> the<00:03:37.220> articulation<00:03:38.220> there<00:03:38.489> so

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
as well we get the articulation there so

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.659 
as well we get the articulation there so
lots<00:03:39.449> of<00:03:39.599> articulation<00:03:40.439> on<00:03:40.620> this<00:03:40.799> figure<00:03:41.069> so

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669 
lots of articulation on this figure so

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:43.610 
lots of articulation on this figure so
you<00:03:41.760> can<00:03:41.970> move<00:03:42.269> it<00:03:42.419> around<00:03:42.540> put<00:03:42.989> it<00:03:43.019> in<00:03:43.229> a<00:03:43.260> lot

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
you can move it around put it in a lot

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.330 
you can move it around put it in a lot
of<00:03:43.889> different<00:03:44.220> poses<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:45.979> possibilities<00:03:46.979> are

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
of different poses the possibilities are

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.969 
of different poses the possibilities are
many<00:03:47.819> now<00:03:48.479> let's<00:03:48.689> have<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:48.870> look<00:03:49.049> more<00:03:49.470> so<00:03:49.739> out

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:49.979 
many now let's have a look more so out

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:54.770 
many now let's have a look more so out
of<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.310> detail<00:03:50.729> the<00:03:51.510> head<00:03:52.500> is<00:03:53.250> pretty<00:03:54.120> good

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
of the detail the head is pretty good

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.469 
of the detail the head is pretty good
and<00:03:55.099> also<00:03:56.099> we<00:03:56.310> have<00:03:56.519> all<00:03:56.729> the<00:03:56.819> detail<00:03:57.239> too

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:57.479 
and also we have all the detail too

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:00.409 
and also we have all the detail too
that's<00:03:57.689> also<00:03:58.049> as<00:03:58.259> well<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.620> armor<00:03:59.419> definition

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:00.419 
that's also as well the armor definition

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:04.099 
that's also as well the armor definition
looks<00:04:01.109> very<00:04:01.620> very<00:04:01.859> nice<00:04:02.159> and<00:04:02.629> then<00:04:03.629> down<00:04:03.930> to

looks very very nice and then down to

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:05.899 
looks very very nice and then down to
the<00:04:04.229> legs<00:04:04.439> not<00:04:04.650> much<00:04:04.889> more<00:04:05.099> to<00:04:05.280> speak<00:04:05.669> of

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:05.909 
the legs not much more to speak of

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:09.199 
the legs not much more to speak of
really<00:04:06.329> but<00:04:06.870> we<00:04:06.989> do<00:04:07.169> have<00:04:07.349> some<00:04:07.650> nice<00:04:08.209> defining

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
really but we do have some nice defining

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.399 
really but we do have some nice defining
points<00:04:09.680> on<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:11.250> detail<00:04:11.849> of<00:04:12.090> this<00:04:12.329> figure<00:04:12.599> all

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:13.409
