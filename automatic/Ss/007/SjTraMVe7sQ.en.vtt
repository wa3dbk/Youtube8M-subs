00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
rare to find a Japanese maple of that

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.320 
rare to find a Japanese maple of that
size<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.600> stature<00:01:04.430> not<00:01:05.430> often<00:01:05.850> do<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.030> see

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
size in that stature not often do I see

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.480 
size in that stature not often do I see
him<00:01:06.450> much<00:01:07.350> taller<00:01:07.740> than<00:01:08.070> this

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
him much taller than this

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.330 
him much taller than this
I<00:01:08.659> was<00:01:09.659> asked<00:01:09.990> recently<00:01:10.020> how<00:01:10.890> old<00:01:11.100> does<00:01:11.310> a

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
I was asked recently how old does a

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.530 
I was asked recently how old does a
Japanese<00:01:11.939> maple<00:01:12.240> live<00:01:12.770> and<00:01:13.770> my<00:01:13.979> answer<00:01:14.400> was

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
Japanese maple live and my answer was

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.480 
Japanese maple live and my answer was
not<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:15.720> much<00:01:15.869> how<00:01:16.110> old<00:01:16.320> does<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.979> tree<00:01:17.220> live

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
not so much how old does the tree live

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.480 
not so much how old does the tree live
but<00:01:18.180> what<00:01:18.360> kind<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.689> impact<00:01:19.290> does<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.250> tree

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
but what kind of impact does the tree

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.690 
but what kind of impact does the tree
receive<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.119> his<00:01:21.270> life<00:01:21.710> now<00:01:22.710> this<00:01:22.890> sidewalk<00:01:23.400> is

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
receive in his life now this sidewalk is

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.120 
receive in his life now this sidewalk is
an<00:01:23.850> original<00:01:24.210> sidewalk<00:01:24.720> from<00:01:25.049> way<00:01:25.439> way<00:01:25.470> back

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
an original sidewalk from way way back

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.640 
an original sidewalk from way way back
when<00:01:26.210> so<00:01:27.210> this<00:01:27.450> tree<00:01:27.689> was<00:01:27.869> planted<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:28.470> this

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
when so this tree was planted in this

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.730 
when so this tree was planted in this
location<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:30.360> clear<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.530> tree

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
location and it's clear that the tree

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.410 
location and it's clear that the tree
was<00:01:31.920> planted<00:01:32.040> when<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.579> house<00:01:32.759> was<00:01:33.060> put<00:01:33.270> in

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
was planted when the house was put in

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.190 
was planted when the house was put in
here<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.320> adapted<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.400> environment

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
here so it adapted to this environment

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.380 
here so it adapted to this environment
now<00:01:37.200> had<00:01:37.560> somebody<00:01:38.100> come<00:01:38.280> in<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.520> put<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.180> some

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
now had somebody come in and put in some

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.569 
now had somebody come in and put in some
trenching<00:01:39.900> or<00:01:40.140> some<00:01:40.380> irrigation<00:01:40.950> pipes<00:01:41.220> or

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
trenching or some irrigation pipes or

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.389 
trenching or some irrigation pipes or
you<00:01:42.210> know<00:01:42.329> we<00:01:42.659> did<00:01:43.350> some<00:01:43.680> underground<00:01:44.070> stuff

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
you know we did some underground stuff

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.609 
you know we did some underground stuff
and<00:01:44.610> severed<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.000> roots<00:01:45.299> then<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.380> tree

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
and severed the roots then this tree

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.210 
and severed the roots then this tree
very<00:01:46.920> likely<00:01:47.159> would<00:01:47.520> not<00:01:47.759> still<00:01:48.299> be<00:01:48.329> here

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
very likely would not still be here

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.100 
very likely would not still be here
unfortunately<00:01:50.220> there<00:01:50.369> are<00:01:50.399> some<00:01:50.820> bad<00:01:51.060> cuts<00:01:51.899> up

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
unfortunately there are some bad cuts up

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.780 
unfortunately there are some bad cuts up
in<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.290> tree<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.560> there's<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.799> lot<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.100> decay

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
in the tree and there's a lot of decay

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.600 
in the tree and there's a lot of decay
but<00:01:55.450> hey<00:01:55.990> a<00:01:56.290> hundred-year-old<00:01:57.010> Japanese

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
but hey a hundred-year-old Japanese

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.410 
but hey a hundred-year-old Japanese
maple<00:01:58.800> I've<00:01:59.800> not<00:02:00.040> seen<00:02:00.250> one<00:02:00.280> any<00:02:00.580> older<00:02:00.940> if<00:02:01.210> any

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
maple I've not seen one any older if any

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.360 
maple I've not seen one any older if any
of<00:02:01.570> you<00:02:01.660> have<00:02:01.870> seen<00:02:02.140> a<00:02:02.200> tree<00:02:02.530> older<00:02:03.040> than<00:02:03.220> this

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
of you have seen a tree older than this

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.030 
of you have seen a tree older than this
a<00:02:03.430> Japanese<00:02:04.000> maple<00:02:04.210> older<00:02:04.780> than<00:02:04.930> this<00:02:05.080> I<00:02:05.320> would

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
a Japanese maple older than this I would

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.980 
a Japanese maple older than this I would
love<00:02:06.250> to<00:02:06.460> see<00:02:06.640> a<00:02:06.670> picture<00:02:07.000> or<00:02:07.360> at<00:02:07.480> least<00:02:07.660> leave

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
far this is the oldest Japanese maple

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.250 
far this is the oldest Japanese maple
that<00:02:16.270> I<00:02:16.360> have<00:02:16.540> ever<00:02:16.750> seen
