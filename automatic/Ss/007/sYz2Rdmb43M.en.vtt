making it tough in there and he got some

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.460 
making it tough in there and he got some
some<00:04:49.760> open<00:04:50.060> looks<00:04:50.090> at<00:04:50.450> it<00:04:50.600> and<00:04:50.720> you<00:04:51.140> know<00:04:51.170> had

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
some open looks at it and you know had

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.520 
some open looks at it and you know had
had<00:04:51.950> one<00:04:52.310> of<00:04:52.460> the<00:04:52.640> ones<00:04:52.910> he<00:04:53.180> made<00:04:53.420> came<00:04:54.290> at<00:04:54.470> a

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
had one of the ones he made came at a

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.440 
had one of the ones he made came at a
different<00:04:54.890> time<00:04:55.070> instead<00:04:55.700> of<00:04:55.760> that<00:04:55.970> one<00:04:56.180> Lake

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
different time instead of that one Lake

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.390 
different time instead of that one Lake
it<00:04:57.050> really<00:04:57.410> changes<00:04:57.770> the<00:04:57.830> outcome<00:04:58.040> of<00:04:58.280> the

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
it really changes the outcome of the

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.210 
it really changes the outcome of the
game<00:04:58.430> so<00:04:58.940> I<00:04:59.570> think<00:05:00.500> it's<00:05:00.710> important<00:05:01.190> that

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
game so I think it's important that

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.650 
game so I think it's important that
Kenny<00:05:01.520> knows<00:05:01.730> that<00:05:01.910> I<00:05:02.000> have<00:05:02.030> confidence<00:05:02.330> in

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
Kenny knows that I have confidence in

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.080 
Kenny knows that I have confidence in
