even<00:02:39.180> this<00:02:39.780> stuff<00:02:40.080> isn't<00:02:40.290> really<00:02:40.500> something

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
even this stuff isn't really something

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.150 
even this stuff isn't really something
I've<00:02:41.300> spent<00:02:42.300> too<00:02:42.450> much<00:02:42.600> time<00:02:42.660> on<00:02:43.170> but<00:02:43.680> I'm

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
I've spent too much time on but I'm

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.360 
I've spent too much time on but I'm

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
blue red is in red and then the other

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.680 
blue red is in red and then the other
two<00:02:49.380> are<00:02:49.650> clearly<00:02:50.550> separated<00:02:51.180> by<00:02:51.360> this<00:02:51.420> little

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
two are clearly separated by this little

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.430 
two are clearly separated by this little
thing<00:02:51.810> as<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.769> audio<00:02:53.250> parts<00:02:53.820> of<00:02:54.090> my<00:02:54.330> cables<00:02:55.260> so

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
thing as the audio parts of my cables so

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.440 
thing as the audio parts of my cables so
the<00:02:55.530> cables<00:02:55.980> I'm<00:02:56.730> not<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:57.120> mean<00:02:57.209> I'm<00:02:57.360> not

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
the cables I'm not I mean I'm not

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.800 
the cables I'm not I mean I'm not
retarded<00:02:57.810> I<00:02:58.200> can<00:02:58.440> put<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.620> cable<00:02:58.980> in<00:02:59.660> so<00:03:00.660> these

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
retarded I can put a cable in so these

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.970 
retarded I can put a cable in so these
cables<00:03:01.260> are<00:03:01.320> in<00:03:01.560> beautifully<00:03:04.430> okay<00:03:06.860> it<00:03:07.860> is

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
cables are in beautifully okay it is

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.970 
cables are in beautifully okay it is
displaying<00:03:08.430> fine<00:03:09.410> so<00:03:10.410> that's<00:03:10.530> what's<00:03:10.769> going

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
displaying fine so that's what's going

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:19.190 
displaying fine so that's what's going
to<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.130> ps2<00:03:12.500> here<00:03:13.500> is<00:03:14.630> Playstation<00:03:15.630> one<00:03:18.200> Gran

that way for you it's in controller here
and<00:03:33.660> let's<00:03:34.250> figure<00:03:35.250> out<00:03:35.400> what's<00:03:35.610> going<00:03:35.820> on

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
and let's figure out what's going on

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.670 
and let's figure out what's going on
okay<00:03:36.750> so<00:03:37.070> it's<00:03:38.070> booting<00:03:38.459> up<00:03:39.410> right<00:03:40.410> off<00:03:40.530> the

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
okay so it's booting up right off the

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.870 
okay so it's booting up right off the
bat<00:03:40.860> here

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.100 

everything<00:03:44.880> where<00:03:45.000> it's<00:03:45.120> fine<00:03:45.630> it's<00:03:45.810> just

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
everything where it's fine it's just

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.330 
everything where it's fine it's just
whenever<00:03:46.320> it<00:03:46.530> gets<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:46.860> racing<00:03:49.040> that<00:03:50.040> might<00:03:50.190> be

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
whenever it gets to racing that might be

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.430 
whenever it gets to racing that might be
a<00:03:50.370> little<00:03:50.520> loud<00:03:53.330> but<00:03:54.330> that's<00:03:54.450> okay<00:03:54.870> I'm<00:03:55.350> not
