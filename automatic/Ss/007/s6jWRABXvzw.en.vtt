00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.860
 hello I am gamers for the first time in 50 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.500
 years mysterious sounds were recorded 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.139
 36 kilometers from the surface of the 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.939
 planet the infra sounds were 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.220
 recorded from a student's globe 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.619
 from the nasa while doing an experiment 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.770
 but before telling you more about these 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.250
 sounds let's watch the video 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.200
 on August 9, 2014 a 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.240
 student named daniel bum in 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.970
 graduated from the University of Carolina 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.580
 north on chapel hill design 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.770
 he built the balloon with the goal of 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.010
 capture the infra sounds in the atmosphere 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.010
 from the earth 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.559
 the helium balloon counted with some 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.960
 infrasound sensors which flew 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.410
 for nine hours over new mexico and 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.650
 arizona and reached a height of 37 thousand 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.930
 500 meters 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.990
 so that we have more clear that it is a 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.390
 infrasound this is an acoustic wave u 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.250
 sound wave whose frequency is 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.650
 below the audible spectrum of the ear 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.500
 human frequency is measured in 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.260
 exercises the infra sound has a 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.950
 extremely low frequency between 1 and 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.870
 20 hertz we can barely hear it but 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.150
 This affects our body 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.730
 as the balloon floated over the 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.580
 new mexico infrasound sensors 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.230
 collected a mixture of signals that 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.650
 scientists are working for 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.960
 interpret meanwhile have arisen 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.720
 some theories of what can be the 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.000
 sounds like for example signs of a 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.300
 wind farm under the trajectory of 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.120
 Shock balloon of the sea waves 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.160
 Turbulence waves of gravity 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.200
 turbulence of clear air and vibrations 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.400
 caused by the vibrations of the cable 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.939
 of the globe 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.939
 [Music] 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.599
 the scientists have another planned 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.550
 launch of the balloon for 2015 that 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.760
 could help to reveal more about the 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.340
 source of your strange infrasound 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.050
 meanwhile they are only theories and 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.770
 we will keep updated with more 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.960
 information in the next release 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.510
 I hope you liked my video and if 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.620
 they want to see more of my research 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.660
 subscribe to my YouTube channel 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.670
 also if you want to participate with your 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.800
 comments in our discussions follow us 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.570
 in our social networks we see ourselves in 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.260
 the next video and as I always tell you 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:34.840
 judge for yourself
