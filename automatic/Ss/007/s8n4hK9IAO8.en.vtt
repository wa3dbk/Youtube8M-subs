football<00:00:06.000> or<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.240> soccer<00:00:06.540> ball<00:00:06.899> in<00:00:07.200> 3ds<00:00:08.010> max

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:08.150 
football or a soccer ball in 3ds max

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.480 
football or a soccer ball in 3ds max
using<00:00:09.150> simple<00:00:09.570> steps<00:00:09.870> so<00:00:10.830> right<00:00:11.040> now<00:00:11.070> in<00:00:11.340> front

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
using simple steps so right now in front

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.690 
using simple steps so right now in front
of<00:00:11.730> us<00:00:11.910> we<00:00:12.090> have<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.540> completed<00:00:13.370> soccer<00:00:14.370> ball

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
of us we have the completed soccer ball

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.849 
of us we have the completed soccer ball
so<00:00:15.150> what<00:00:15.780> I'm<00:00:15.870> going<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.139> do<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.470> I'm<00:00:16.650> going<00:00:16.680> to

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.460 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
delete<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.340> soccer<00:00:17.550> ball<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:18.060> we'll<00:00:18.900> select

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
delete the soccer ball and we'll select

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:27.230 
delete the soccer ball and we'll select
new<00:00:20.189> file<00:00:20.840> you<00:00:21.840> all<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:23.300> reset<00:00:24.590> right<00:00:25.910> so<00:00:26.910> it's

the<00:00:40.860> first<00:00:41.250> thing<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:41.989> you<00:00:42.989> have<00:00:43.020> to

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
the first thing is that you have to

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.930 
the first thing is that you have to
create<00:00:43.590> an<00:00:43.680> object<00:00:45.020> which<00:00:46.430> can<00:00:47.430> be<00:00:47.579> tweaked

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
create an object which can be tweaked

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.520 
create an object which can be tweaked
into<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:49.350> set<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.309> hexagons<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.329> Pentagon's<00:00:51.899> so

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
into a set of hexagons and Pentagon's so

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.590 
into a set of hexagons and Pentagon's so
if<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.739> go<00:00:52.920> through<00:00:53.129> my<00:00:53.190> tutorial<00:00:54.120> videos<00:00:54.480> you

if you go through my tutorial videos you
can<00:00:54.750> find<00:00:55.100> the<00:00:56.100> soccer<00:00:56.340> ball<00:00:56.489> designed<00:00:57.149> using

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
can find the soccer ball designed using

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.840 
can find the soccer ball designed using

this particular tutorial it's very easy
to<00:01:08.070> create<00:01:08.369> but<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.210> won't<00:01:09.360> get<00:01:09.600> that

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
to create but you won't get that

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.929 
to create but you won't get that
particular<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.470> perfection<00:01:11.010> what<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
particular a perfection what the

perfection and the what do you say the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.620 
perfection and the what do you say the
exact<00:01:16.220> design<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.850> soccer<00:01:18.060> ball<00:01:18.180> as<00:01:18.479> you

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
exact design of the soccer ball as you

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.440 
exact design of the soccer ball as you
got<00:01:18.810> catia<00:01:19.590> v5<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.640> let's<00:01:20.850> just<00:01:21.030> go<00:01:21.210> ahead<00:01:21.240> and

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
got catia v5 so let's just go ahead and

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.929 
got catia v5 so let's just go ahead and
create<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.350> first<00:01:23.000> object<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:25.939> heat

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
create the first object that is the heat

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.550 
create the first object that is the heat
rock<00:01:27.180> go<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.659> external<00:01:27.869> primitives<00:01:28.380> and

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
rock go to the external primitives and

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.330 
rock go to the external primitives and
select<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.920> Hedra<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.820> now<00:01:30.540> just<00:01:31.500> create<00:01:32.159> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
select the Hedra and now just create the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.600 
select the Hedra and now just create the
heater<00:01:32.549> over<00:01:32.880> here<00:01:33.890> so<00:01:34.890> if<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.189> want<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.460> can

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
heater over here so if you want to can

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.270 
heater over here so if you want to can
go<00:01:35.880> ahead<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.780> change<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.500> color<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.100> my

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
go ahead and change the color so in my

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.550 
go ahead and change the color so in my
case<00:01:38.310> I'm<00:01:38.670> not<00:01:38.880> gonna<00:01:39.000> both<00:01:39.990> about<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.320> color

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
case I'm not gonna both about the color

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.889 
case I'm not gonna both about the color
as<00:01:40.829> long<00:01:41.040> as<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.340> get<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.899> understanding

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
as long as you get the understanding

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.920 
as long as you get the understanding
alright<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.729> first<00:01:44.759> step<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.450> done<00:01:45.720> right

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
alright so the first step is done right

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.880 
alright so the first step is done right
now<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.409> now<00:01:47.130> what<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.119> need<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.360> do<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.890> you

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
now and now what you need to do is you

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.850 
now and now what you need to do is you
have<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:50.399> set<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:51.509> know<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.990> way<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.170> created

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
have a set of you know the way I created

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.560 
have a set of you know the way I created
to<00:01:53.100> real<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.869> is<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.610> beginner<00:01:57.270> if

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
to real this is is that the beginner if

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.450 
to real this is is that the beginner if
a<00:01:57.840> beginner<00:01:58.140> watches<00:01:58.560> also<00:01:58.890> he<00:01:59.130> should<00:01:59.310> be

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
a beginner watches also he should be

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.090 
a beginner watches also he should be
able<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.880> understand<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.320> if<00:02:01.590> he<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.009> a

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
able to understand that so if he is a

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.969 
able to understand that so if he is a
noob<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.579> 3ds<00:02:02.939> max<00:02:02.969> he<00:02:03.420> even<00:02:03.810> he<00:02:04.409> can<00:02:04.560> follow<00:02:04.799> my

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.210 
options which is related to this
particular<00:02:13.700> Hedra<00:02:14.209> so<00:02:14.930> it's<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.709> same<00:02:15.920> that's

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
particular Hedra so it's the same that's

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.979 
particular Hedra so it's the same that's
how<00:02:16.430> the<00:02:16.489> interface<00:02:17.030> is<00:02:17.060> if<00:02:17.420> I<00:02:17.569> click<00:02:17.810> outside

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
how the interface is if I click outside

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.039 
how the interface is if I click outside
it<00:02:18.349> goes<00:02:18.560> off<00:02:18.739> over<00:02:19.010> here<00:02:19.220> so<00:02:19.939> if<00:02:20.480> I<00:02:20.629> click<00:02:20.689> over

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
it goes off over here so if I click over

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.649 
it goes off over here so if I click over
here<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.500> related<00:02:21.890> options<00:02:22.069> come<00:02:22.489> so<00:02:23.150> here

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:23.659 
here the related options come so here

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:28.360 
here the related options come so here
you<00:02:23.840> can<00:02:23.870> go<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.730> Datuk<00:02:25.730> and<00:02:25.970> then<00:02:27.190> you<00:02:28.190> can

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
you can go to the Datuk and then you can

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.130 
you can go to the Datuk and then you can
see<00:02:28.549> the<00:02:28.819> shape<00:02:29.090> is<00:02:29.299> being<00:02:29.480> changed<00:02:29.690> right<00:02:29.900> now

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
see the shape is being changed right now

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.869 
see the shape is being changed right now
so<00:02:30.709> you<00:02:30.769> don't<00:02:30.890> have<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.099> panic<00:02:31.280> so<00:02:31.610> just

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
so you don't have to panic so just

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.600 
so you don't have to panic so just
increase<00:02:32.690> tweak<00:02:33.170> this<00:02:33.319> particular<00:02:33.769> thing<00:02:34.010> you

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
increase tweak this particular thing you

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.020 
increase tweak this particular thing you
can<00:02:34.760> see<00:02:34.940> it<00:02:35.510> actually<00:02:36.250> develops<00:02:37.250> pentagons

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
can see it actually develops pentagons

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.360 
can see it actually develops pentagons
and<00:02:38.060> hexagons<00:02:38.720> so<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.379> can<00:02:39.500> see<00:02:39.620> if<00:02:39.739> I<00:02:39.920> move<00:02:40.250> it

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
and hexagons so you can see if I move it

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.369 
and hexagons so you can see if I move it
or<00:02:41.090> you<00:02:41.599> know<00:02:41.720> more<00:02:42.709> it<00:02:42.980> becomes<00:02:43.519> I<00:02:43.849> actually

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
or you know more it becomes I actually

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.369 
or you know more it becomes I actually
forms<00:02:45.379> the<00:02:45.980> hexagon<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:47.329> the<00:02:47.810> pentagon

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
forms the hexagon the the pentagon

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.050 
forms the hexagon the the pentagon
rightly<00:02:48.799> but<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.129> hexagon<00:02:49.579> is<00:02:49.609> not<00:02:49.849> from

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
rightly but the hexagon is not from

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.910 
rightly but the hexagon is not from
properly<00:02:50.480> so<00:02:50.959> you<00:02:51.019> can<00:02:51.200> keep<00:02:51.379> it<00:02:51.530> somewhere

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
properly so you can keep it somewhere

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.210 
properly so you can keep it somewhere
where<00:02:52.220> you<00:02:52.909> feel<00:02:53.209> that<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:54.620> hexagonal

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
where you feel that the hexagonal

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.990 
where you feel that the hexagonal
Pentagon's<00:02:55.790> are<00:02:56.060> are<00:02:56.299> properly<00:02:56.690> aligned<00:02:56.959> and

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
Pentagon's are are properly aligned and

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.839 
Pentagon's are are properly aligned and
once<00:02:59.000> you're<00:02:59.150> done<00:02:59.299> with<00:02:59.359> that<00:03:00.609> rest<00:03:01.609> of<00:03:01.760> the

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
once you're done with that rest of the

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.369 
once you're done with that rest of the
things<00:03:02.060> you<00:03:02.209> can<00:03:02.389> leave<00:03:02.599> just<00:03:02.840> like<00:03:02.989> that<00:03:03.049> if

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
things you can leave just like that if

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:06.300 
things you can leave just like that if
you<00:03:03.500> want<00:03:03.680> you<00:03:03.769> can<00:03:03.920> tweak<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.940> radius<00:03:05.299> down

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
you want you can tweak the radius down

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.009 
you want you can tweak the radius down
so<00:03:07.310> you<00:03:07.370> can<00:03:07.609> put<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.150> radius<00:03:08.480> a<00:03:08.510> little<00:03:08.900> bit

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
so you can put the radius a little bit

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.539 
so you can put the radius a little bit
smaller<00:03:09.290> that<00:03:09.620> is<00:03:09.829> around<00:03:10.420> 30<00:03:11.420> and<00:03:12.190> just<00:03:13.190> click

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
smaller that is around 30 and just click

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.970 
smaller that is around 30 and just click
outside<00:03:13.760> and<00:03:14.150> you<00:03:14.239> can<00:03:14.420> see<00:03:14.629> the<00:03:14.930> shape<00:03:15.680> of

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
outside and you can see the shape of

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.180 
outside and you can see the shape of
your<00:03:16.449> new<00:03:17.449> soccer<00:03:17.720> ball<00:03:18.019> design<00:03:18.440> so<00:03:18.980> you<00:03:19.069> can

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
your new soccer ball design so you can

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.280 
your new soccer ball design so you can
see<00:03:19.310> it's<00:03:19.459> not<00:03:19.669> actually<00:03:20.359> a<00:03:20.389> spherical<00:03:21.079> shape

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
see it's not actually a spherical shape

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.500 
see it's not actually a spherical shape
so<00:03:22.099> you<00:03:22.190> need<00:03:22.459> to<00:03:22.639> apply<00:03:22.940> a<00:03:22.970> few<00:03:23.389> more

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
so you need to apply a few more

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.180 
so you need to apply a few more
modifiers<00:03:24.019> so<00:03:24.349> for<00:03:24.590> that<00:03:24.709> you<00:03:24.769> need<00:03:25.040> to

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
modifiers so for that you need to

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.629 
modifiers so for that you need to
convert<00:03:25.549> this<00:03:25.760> particular<00:03:26.799> object<00:03:27.799> into<00:03:28.099> the

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639 
convert this particular object into the

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:32.920 
convert this particular object into the
editable<00:03:29.060> poly<00:03:29.329> so<00:03:30.319> and<00:03:31.209> now<00:03:32.209> we<00:03:32.269> need<00:03:32.629> to<00:03:32.660> do<00:03:32.900> a

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
editable poly so and now we need to do a

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.680 
editable poly so and now we need to do a
further<00:03:33.440> sum<00:03:33.769> of<00:03:33.919> steps<00:03:34.250> which<00:03:34.970> in<00:03:35.209> with<00:03:35.510> which

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
further sum of steps which in with which

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.470 
further sum of steps which in with which
you<00:03:36.079> get<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:36.500> you<00:03:37.370> know<00:03:37.489> the<00:03:37.669> spherical<00:03:38.209> and

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
you get the you know the spherical and

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.930 
you get the you know the spherical and
now<00:03:38.780> you<00:03:39.290> need<00:03:39.470> to<00:03:39.590> subdivide<00:03:39.829> the<00:03:40.370> faces

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
now you need to subdivide the faces

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.229 
now you need to subdivide the faces
using<00:03:41.859> some<00:03:42.859> more<00:03:43.069> modifiers<00:03:43.699> so<00:03:44.000> which<00:03:44.120> i'm

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
using some more modifiers so which i'm

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.509 
using some more modifiers so which i'm
going<00:03:44.389> to<00:03:44.480> show<00:03:44.629> you<00:03:44.660> in<00:03:44.989> my<00:03:45.199> the<00:03:46.069> next<00:03:46.310> part<00:03:46.489> of
