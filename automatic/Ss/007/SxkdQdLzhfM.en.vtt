00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
simulate a shoulder dystocia

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.569 
simulate a shoulder dystocia
shoulder<00:00:33.570> dystocia<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:34.440> defined<00:00:35.219> when<00:00:35.460> the

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
shoulder dystocia is defined when the

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.190 
shoulder dystocia is defined when the
fetal<00:00:35.880> head<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.239> delivered<00:00:36.719> but<00:00:37.020> the

fetal head is delivered but the

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.660 
fetal head is delivered but the
shoulders<00:00:37.559> are<00:00:37.710> too<00:00:37.890> large<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.309> fit<00:00:38.340> through

the<00:00:38.760> mom's<00:00:38.969> pelvis<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.379> something<00:00:40.710> that

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
the mom's pelvis this is something that

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.130 
the mom's pelvis this is something that
we<00:00:41.010> call<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.280> very<00:00:41.700> high<00:00:42.030> fidelity<00:00:42.360> or<00:00:42.899> high

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
we call a very high fidelity or high

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.310 
we call a very high fidelity or high
risk<00:00:43.500> low<00:00:44.160> volume<00:00:44.700> event<00:00:45.210> what<00:00:45.750> we<00:00:45.870> do<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.170> we

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
risk low volume event what we do is we

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.889 
risk low volume event what we do is we
bring<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.590> group<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:47.120> staff<00:00:48.120> members<00:00:48.510> together

bring a group of staff members together

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.430 
bring a group of staff members together
we<00:00:49.530> take<00:00:49.739> physicians<00:00:50.370> nurses<00:00:50.940> OB<00:00:51.750> techs<00:00:52.079> and

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
we take physicians nurses OB techs and

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.069 
we take physicians nurses OB techs and
we<00:00:53.250> train<00:00:53.550> them<00:00:53.760> together<00:00:54.059> breaking<00:00:54.780> down<00:00:54.930> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
we train them together breaking down the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.020 
we train them together breaking down the
silos<00:00:55.289> of<00:00:55.500> Education<00:00:56.160> we<00:00:56.640> do<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> whole

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
silos of Education we do a whole

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.689 
silos of Education we do a whole
education<00:00:57.719> piece<00:00:57.960> on<00:00:58.199> shoulder<00:00:58.800> dystocia<00:00:58.980> we

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
education piece on shoulder dystocia we

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.000 
education piece on shoulder dystocia we
go<00:00:59.850> over<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.180> algorithm<00:01:00.809> how<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.230> run<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.710> how

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
go over the algorithm how to run it how

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.160 
go over the algorithm how to run it how
to<00:01:02.070> deliver<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.520> baby<00:01:02.760> safely<00:01:03.239> then<00:01:03.930> we<00:01:04.019> come

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
to deliver the baby safely then we come

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.230 
to deliver the baby safely then we come
into<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.409> room<00:01:04.619> like<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:04.830> we<00:01:05.790> run<00:01:06.060> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
into a room like this we run the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.940 
into a room like this we run the
simulation<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:07.170> then<00:01:07.290> we<00:01:07.409> take<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.650> same

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
simulation and then we take that same

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.170 
simulation and then we take that same
group<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.280> people<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.729> we<00:01:08.790> bring<00:01:08.970> them<00:01:09.119> back

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
group of people and we bring them back

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.480 
group of people and we bring them back
to<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> room<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.080> we<00:01:10.200> debrief<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.890> situation

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
to a room and we debrief the situation

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.580 
to a room and we debrief the situation
during<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.150> delivery<00:01:12.630> will<00:01:13.080> start<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.439> see

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
during the delivery will start to see

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.260 
during the delivery will start to see
certain<00:01:13.830> signs<00:01:14.280> one<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.850> signs<00:01:15.090> that

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
certain signs one of the signs that

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.210 
certain signs one of the signs that
Noelle<00:01:15.750> did<00:01:16.049> today<00:01:16.229> was<00:01:16.530> called<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.860> turtle

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
Noelle did today was called a turtle

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.700 
Noelle did today was called a turtle
sign<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:18.000> as<00:01:18.150> dr.<00:01:18.360> kovin<00:01:19.200> was<00:01:19.350> going<00:01:19.619> to

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
sign so as dr. kovin was going to

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.560 
sign so as dr. kovin was going to
deliver<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.250> rest<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.939> baby<00:01:21.090> after<00:01:21.330> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
deliver the rest of the baby after the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.929 
deliver the rest of the baby after the
head<00:01:21.750> came<00:01:21.990> out<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.740> baby<00:01:23.009> actually<00:01:23.250> retracts

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
head came out the baby actually retracts

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.880 
head came out the baby actually retracts
itself<00:01:24.390> just<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.900> turtle<00:01:25.200> coming<00:01:25.560> out<00:01:25.799> of

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
itself just like a turtle coming out of

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.590 
itself just like a turtle coming out of
the<00:01:26.009> shell<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.759> heard<00:01:27.000> him<00:01:27.150> announce<00:01:27.420> in

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
the shell so you heard him announce in

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.510 
the shell so you heard him announce in
the<00:01:27.689> room<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:27.930> have<00:01:28.110> shoulders<00:01:28.650> we<00:01:29.100> looked<00:01:29.310> for

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
the room I have shoulders we looked for

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.219 
the room I have shoulders we looked for
the<00:01:29.579> nurses<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.060> communicate<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.780> one<00:01:30.810> another

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
the nurses to communicate to one another

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.530 
the nurses to communicate to one another
they<00:01:31.680> activated<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.400> emergency<00:01:33.000> call<00:01:33.270> belt

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
they activated the emergency call belt

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.510 
they activated the emergency call belt
system<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.350> they<00:01:34.619> started<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.100> go<00:01:35.220> through<00:01:35.250> a

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
system and they started to go through a

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.999 
system and they started to go through a
series<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:36.000> maneuvers<00:01:36.600> we<00:01:37.290> brought<00:01:37.530> Noelle's

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
series of maneuvers we brought Noelle's

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.160 
series of maneuvers we brought Noelle's
legs<00:01:38.340> back<00:01:38.670> that's<00:01:39.000> called<00:01:39.299> McRoberts<00:01:39.930> it

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
legs back that's called McRoberts it

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.410 
legs back that's called McRoberts it
helps<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.560> open<00:01:40.710> up<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.189> pelvis<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:42.030> make<00:01:42.180> more

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
helps to open up the pelvis to make more

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.090 
helps to open up the pelvis to make more

simulation<00:03:33.690> because<00:03:33.989> our<00:03:34.170> you<00:03:34.380> know<00:03:34.410> we're

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
simulation because our you know we're

simulation because our you know we're
always<00:03:34.800> having<00:03:35.069> patients<00:03:35.910> come<00:03:36.030> in<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:36.180> we

the whole hospital is where we see the
