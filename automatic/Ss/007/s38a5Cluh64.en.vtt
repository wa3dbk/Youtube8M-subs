00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.680
 despite the economic difficulties 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.240
 the salary of British parliamentarians can 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.960
 grow ten thousand pounds 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.059
 sterling 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.830
 if such a decision is made by the body 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.440
 setting wages for 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.480
 members of parliament however in this story 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.789
 as in the case of these installations gave 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.520
 the stage is a little different than it seems on 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.080
 first glance 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.810
 yes yes not so simple 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.330
 when we had just but the residents see 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.390
 absolutely clear their salary as a whole 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.279
 frozen at the same level as 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.440
 deputies already pay more and if we 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.239
 approve this huge boost and people 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.620
 nothing will get started such 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.969
 resentment tearing you apart 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.980
 politicians led by the prime minister 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.180
 fervently declare that they will not agree with 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.190
 salary increase 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.410
 but they donâ€™t really decide 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.360
 labor parliamentarians appoints 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.219
 independent parliamentary management 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.110
 standards and its chairman 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.989
 already criticized the party leaders for 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.399
 the fact that they express their disagreement 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.829
 Earlier, the parliament determined its salary 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:06.659
 he and everyone perfectly remembers that it is 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.130
 led to scandal if we ourselves in 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.260
 Parliament set a salary 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.210
 we are accused if we install it 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.259
 an independent body we would still not 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.180
 called but members of parliament now 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.460
 receive more than two times more than 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.500
 on average in the country how does it respond to 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:29.009
 situation the British some answers 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:31.259
 Seems like an unexpected camera 7 because 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.600
 need to pay for work if people do not 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.400
 will have to perforce to earn money and 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:41.400
 distracted from the main job 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:43.470
 this is correct I only and it seems to me 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.659
 too much of their money goes to the graph 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.030
 salary expenses should not be big 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.240
 costs less they have extensive third-party 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:55.560
 revenues and in the current environment it is very 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:59.070
 sensitive topic right now is not to 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.869
 place and out of place benefits are reduced 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.610
 many uk have to 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.860
 apply for food to charity 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.780
 organizations more than ever before 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.930
 times of war it is extremely painful 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.930
 question 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.750
 it is clear that the question of raising 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.580
 parliamentary salaries cost him 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.100
 sound immediately caused many 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.750
 British perplexity and indignation but in 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.910
 in light of the cost scandals 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.620
 officials this increase may be 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.660
 associated with the closure of deputies 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.730
 the possibility of additional earnings and 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.950
 this is where some see the path to real 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:33.320
 reforms and disputes continue 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.770
 it remains only to guess what they will lead
