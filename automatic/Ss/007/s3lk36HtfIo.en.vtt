00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.620
 An overview of the patch point patch 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.460
 Points 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.320
 patch 2.3 minimize faster than mine 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.119
 tongue allows it that sometimes happens 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.240
 owe everything to ten things 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.850
 you should know first it further 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.340
 ruins a new area of â€‹â€‹session 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.179
 give and that is pretty important there 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.189
 because secondly there is one 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.469
 throws and we find this channel 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.969
 First, the wrong way around and 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.239
 this cube can be really great 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.370

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.469
 Make super sexy things and you should 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.030
 grab that cube and then 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.890
 You can do it with this dice three 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.899
 legendary features on itself 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.000
 which he can transfer as us 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.530
 submit which are not attracted 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.719
 you have to and then you own it 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.879
 the legendary features of eg 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.620
 to have a melting oven anyway 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.079
 and we can do that in it 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.080
 Characters make great things and still 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.840
 this is the legendary fix or as well 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.240
 always one that's it so that's what 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.450
 down there is always maximum 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.729
 rolled so you have a fucking part in 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.130
 smelting furnace has him in the channel 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.020
 I want a relative 50 percent 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.000
 to get 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.650
 Third, there are no more excited stones 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.380
 no more trails 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.170

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.829
 level you want is very very cool yes 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.210

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:35.369
 four new sets for crusader monks 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.220

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.350
 many other items have been revised and also 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.829
 the rates revised to changes 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.420
 shock retro active speak you have it 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.110
 now it will change 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.299
 with the patch everything else like for 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.210
 usually find new 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:57.119
 five people have hellfire amos now 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.219
 a hundred percent chance after 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.960
 to have a base 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.869
 Do not waste expensive materials 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.159
 wait until tomorrow and power the 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.200
 If the world 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.460
 One hundred percent works as well 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.650
 100 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:15.210
 more likely that something good 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:17.580
 Sixth, yes, the word sex is 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.700
 always exciting I know but it relates 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:25.440
 on something other than what you do 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:29.040
 hoping they are 5 starts on 28 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.930
 august we are already over but 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.500

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.770
 have been revised 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.040
 It is also important in which 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.780
 Order the tree this does because 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.730
 it is possible in the right one 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.500
 order, assuming you do 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.930
 it in the correct sequence 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.600
 you get an additional one per act 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.280
 Dice as a reward this contains then 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.410
 Also new materials the game 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.440
 then they came in again 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.300
 craften or for it can cube what too 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.130
 always have to be used 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.500
 can 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.810
 Eighth, new difficulty levels people 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.450

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.880

 teaching to speak equals one 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.790
 a few hundred million gold depending on 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.430
