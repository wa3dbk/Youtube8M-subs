hello<00:00:01.920> everyone<00:00:02.280> in<00:00:02.460> this<00:00:02.490> video<00:00:02.820> we'll<00:00:03.149> talk

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
hello everyone in this video we'll talk

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.769 
hello everyone in this video we'll talk
about<00:00:03.389> the<00:00:04.110> rule<00:00:04.350> of<00:00:04.770> 72<00:00:05.279> this<00:00:06.270> is<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.480> handy

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
about the rule of 72 this is the handy

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.740 
about the rule of 72 this is the handy
metric<00:00:07.259> when<00:00:07.770> it<00:00:07.919> comes<00:00:08.130> to<00:00:08.309> exam<00:00:08.639> or<00:00:09.030> for

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
metric when it comes to exam or for

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.470 
metric when it comes to exam or for
day-to-day<00:00:09.900> calculations<00:00:10.769> so<00:00:11.670> let<00:00:12.090> me<00:00:12.240> start

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
day-to-day calculations so let me start

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.289 
day-to-day calculations so let me start
so<00:00:13.049> suppose<00:00:13.410> if<00:00:13.559> we<00:00:13.710> have<00:00:13.880> investment<00:00:14.880> of<00:00:15.030> I

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
so suppose if we have investment of I

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.650 
so suppose if we have investment of I
and<00:00:15.570> we<00:00:16.350> want<00:00:16.680> this<00:00:16.890> investment<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.580> grow<00:00:17.940> to

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
and we want this investment to grow to

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.929 
and we want this investment to grow to
2i<00:00:18.900> so<00:00:19.529> we<00:00:19.680> want<00:00:19.890> our<00:00:20.070> investment<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.789> be

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
2i so we want our investment to be

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.150 
2i so we want our investment to be
double<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:22.350> interest<00:00:22.740> rate<00:00:22.949> in<00:00:23.130> the

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
double and the interest rate in the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:31.550 
double and the interest rate in the
market<00:00:26.660> is<00:00:27.660> equal<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.500> our<00:00:29.330> right<00:00:30.330> so<00:00:31.050> we<00:00:31.410> want

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
market is equal to our right so we want

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.250 
market is equal to our right so we want
to<00:00:31.650> know<00:00:31.769> how<00:00:32.099> much<00:00:32.369> time<00:00:32.700> will<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.570> take<00:00:33.690> for

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
to know how much time will it take for

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.600 
to know how much time will it take for
this<00:00:34.380> investment<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.219> be<00:00:35.940> 2<00:00:36.149> times<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:37.610> the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
this investment to be 2 times and the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.090 
this investment to be 2 times and the
there<00:00:39.149> are<00:00:39.390> certain<00:00:39.899> ways<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.410> calculate<00:00:40.680> this

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
there are certain ways to calculate this

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.580 
there are certain ways to calculate this
but<00:00:41.760> if<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.329> use<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:42.660> trick<00:00:42.930> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
but if you use this trick the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.279 
but if you use this trick the
approximate<00:00:44.460> time<00:00:44.700> can<00:00:45.510> be<00:00:45.629> calculated<00:00:46.050> very

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
approximate time can be calculated very

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.709 
approximate time can be calculated very
easily<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.760> time<00:00:48.000> will<00:00:48.510> be<00:00:48.539> equal<00:00:48.750> to<00:00:50.719> 72

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
easily and the time will be equal to 72

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.040 
easily and the time will be equal to 72
divided<00:00:52.590> by<00:00:52.770> R<00:00:53.480> so<00:00:54.480> for<00:00:54.719> example<00:00:55.199> if<00:00:56.059> rate<00:00:57.059> is

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
divided by R so for example if rate is

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.630 
divided by R so for example if rate is
10<00:00:58.469> then<00:00:59.430> time<00:01:00.000> will<00:01:00.510> be<00:01:00.690> equal<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.140> 7<00:01:02.070> point<00:01:02.399> 2

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
10 then time will be equal to 7 point 2

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.460 
10 then time will be equal to 7 point 2
years<00:01:04.820> if<00:01:05.990> rate<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.799> 20<00:01:08.460> then<00:01:09.210> time<00:01:09.570> will<00:01:10.320> be

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
years if rate is 20 then time will be

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.620 
years if rate is 20 then time will be
equal<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.799> 3<00:01:11.760> point<00:01:12.119> 6<00:01:12.810> years<00:01:14.930> so<00:01:15.930> how<00:01:16.740> this

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
equal to 3 point 6 years so how this

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.010 
equal to 3 point 6 years so how this
rule<00:01:18.630> works<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:20.009> let's<00:01:20.340> try<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:20.939> solve<00:01:21.420> this

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
rule works so let's try to solve this

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.630 
rule works so let's try to solve this
problem<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.950> regular<00:01:23.280> way

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
problem in a regular way

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.499 
problem in a regular way
so<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.390> regular<00:01:24.780> way<00:01:24.960> we<00:01:25.830> have<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.310> say<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:27.090> we

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
so in regular way we have to say that we

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:34.819 
so in regular way we have to say that we
know<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:30.560> suppose<00:01:31.579> we<00:01:32.579> have<00:01:33.680> investment<00:01:34.680> I

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
know that suppose we have investment I

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.640 
know that suppose we have investment I
and<00:01:35.240> we<00:01:36.240> have<00:01:36.540> interest<00:01:37.170> rate<00:01:37.350> 1<00:01:37.740> plus<00:01:38.600> R<00:01:39.650> right

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
and we have interest rate 1 plus R right

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.120 
and we have interest rate 1 plus R right
and<00:01:41.030> so<00:01:42.030> we<00:01:42.299> rested<00:01:42.540> for<00:01:42.899> 10<00:01:43.110> years<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.649> will

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
and so we rested for 10 years so it will

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.120 
and so we rested for 10 years so it will
be<00:01:44.280> D<00:01:44.460> here<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.750> should<00:01:45.990> be<00:01:46.110> equal<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.619> 2i

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
be D here so that should be equal to 2i

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.539 
be D here so that should be equal to 2i
right<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:49.049> our<00:01:49.259> initial<00:01:49.860> investment

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
right so this is our initial investment

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.609 
right so this is our initial investment
and<00:01:50.700> then<00:01:51.000> we<00:01:51.479> have<00:01:51.689> an<00:01:51.810> interest<00:01:52.110> rate<00:01:52.229> every

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
and then we have an interest rate every

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.069 
and then we have an interest rate every
year<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:53.909> compounded<00:01:54.630> every<00:01:54.750> year

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
year and this is compounded every year

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.700 
year and this is compounded every year
so<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.909> will<00:01:56.909> become<00:01:57.060> 2i<00:01:57.450> after<00:01:58.380> certain

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
so that will become 2i after certain

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.289 
so that will become 2i after certain
time<00:01:58.979> right<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.610> want<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.850> calculate<00:02:00.060> for

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
time right and you want to calculate for

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.670 
time right and you want to calculate for
the<00:02:00.659> time<00:02:00.869> should<00:02:01.439> be<00:02:01.619> right<00:02:01.799> so<00:02:02.579> now<00:02:02.729> if<00:02:02.969> we

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
the time should be right so now if we

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.910 
the time should be right so now if we
solve<00:02:04.680> this<00:02:04.860> equation<00:02:05.030> then<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:06.930> will<00:02:07.710> be

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
solve this equation then so I will be

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.490 
solve this equation then so I will be
canceled<00:02:08.340> out<00:02:08.459> by<00:02:08.520> another<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.950> so<00:02:11.780> this

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
canceled out by another I so this

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.380 
canceled out by another I so this
you<00:02:13.560> cancel<00:02:13.920> out<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:15.200> then<00:02:16.200> we<00:02:16.440> have<00:02:16.770> one<00:02:17.760> plus

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
you cancel out and then we have one plus

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:25.940 
you cancel out and then we have one plus
R<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:20.700> power<00:02:20.880> T<00:02:21.420> is<00:02:22.020> equal<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:23.450> so<00:02:24.590> further<00:02:25.590> if

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
R to power T is equal to so further if

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.460 
R to power T is equal to so further if
you<00:02:26.010> take<00:02:26.340> log<00:02:26.580> on<00:02:26.820> both<00:02:26.940> side<00:02:27.420> so<00:02:27.660> it<00:02:28.110> will<00:02:28.290> be

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
you take log on both side so it will be

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:38.600 
you take log on both side so it will be
T<00:02:32.000> log<00:02:33.000> of<00:02:33.270> one<00:02:33.810> plus<00:02:34.340> R<00:02:36.080> is<00:02:37.080> equal<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.470> log<00:02:38.370> off

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
T log of one plus R is equal to log off

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:48.949 
T log of one plus R is equal to log off
or<00:02:40.730> T<00:02:41.730> is<00:02:42.720> equal<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.260> log<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:44.959> 2<00:02:45.959> divided<00:02:46.950> by<00:02:47.959> log

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
or T is equal to log of 2 divided by log

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:58.160 
or T is equal to log of 2 divided by log
of<00:02:49.700> 1<00:02:50.700> plus<00:02:52.640> alright<00:02:53.660> so<00:02:54.660> now<00:02:55.290> if<00:02:55.620> I<00:02:55.920> go<00:02:57.170> to

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
of 1 plus alright so now if I go to

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.490 
of 1 plus alright so now if I go to
excel<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:59.010> try<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.340> solve<00:02:59.730> this<00:02:59.880> equation<00:03:00.500> so

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
excel and try to solve this equation so

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.160 
excel and try to solve this equation so
let<00:03:01.920> me<00:03:02.040> go<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.630> excel<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:05.420> so<00:03:06.420> now<00:03:06.570> suppose<00:03:06.630> if

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
let me go to excel and so now suppose if

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.780 
let me go to excel and so now suppose if
we<00:03:07.350> have<00:03:07.530> R<00:03:08.810> and<00:03:09.810> so<00:03:09.989> it<00:03:10.320> is<00:03:10.530> we<00:03:11.070> start<00:03:11.400> with<00:03:11.550> two

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
we have R and so it is we start with two

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.380 
we have R and so it is we start with two
three<00:03:12.390> four<00:03:12.900> five<00:03:13.380> so<00:03:14.100> this<00:03:14.250> is<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.550> rate<00:03:15.239> of

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
three four five so this is the rate of

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:26.530 
three four five so this is the rate of
interest<00:03:22.489> all<00:03:23.489> right<00:03:23.610> and<00:03:23.790> then<00:03:24.540> we<00:03:25.230> have<00:03:25.470> time

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
interest all right and then we have time

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.490 
interest all right and then we have time
so<00:03:27.540> time<00:03:27.840> should<00:03:28.110> be<00:03:28.260> equal<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.880> as<00:03:29.880> we

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
so time should be equal to as we

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:37.150 
so time should be equal to as we
calculated<00:03:31.500> before<00:03:32.060> log<00:03:33.200> of<00:03:34.200> 2<00:03:35.750> divided<00:03:36.750> by

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
calculated before log of 2 divided by

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:49.810 
calculated before log of 2 divided by
log<00:03:38.160> of<00:03:39.620> 1<00:03:40.620> plus<00:03:45.680> this<00:03:46.680> is<00:03:46.860> in<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.070> percentage

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.640 

so<00:03:50.820> it<00:03:51.150> says<00:03:51.560> 35<00:03:52.560> years<00:03:53.130> right<00:03:53.489> so<00:03:54.269> we<00:03:54.450> can<00:03:54.660> keep

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
so it says 35 years right so we can keep

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.520 
so it says 35 years right so we can keep
doing<00:03:56.010> this<00:03:56.310> and<00:03:56.579> we<00:03:56.850> can<00:03:57.000> also<00:03:57.350> generate<00:03:58.350> the

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
doing this and we can also generate the

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.880 
doing this and we can also generate the
table<00:03:58.890> for<00:03:59.100> for<00:04:00.030> all<00:04:00.329> the<00:04:00.630> ours<00:04:03.620> now<00:04:04.620> if<00:04:04.739> you

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
table for for all the ours now if you

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.130 
table for for all the ours now if you
look<00:04:05.100> here<00:04:05.450> then<00:04:06.769> if<00:04:07.769> you<00:04:07.950> multiply<00:04:08.070> it<00:04:08.459> time

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
look here then if you multiply it time

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:15.620 
look here then if you multiply it time
with<00:04:10.140> our<00:04:10.760> that<00:04:11.760> will<00:04:11.940> be<00:04:12.060> equal<00:04:12.360> to<00:04:12.570> 2<00:04:13.530> into<00:04:14.630> 35

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
with our that will be equal to 2 into 35

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.190 
with our that will be equal to 2 into 35
but<00:04:16.440> at<00:04:16.590> is<00:04:16.709> 70<00:04:17.190> point<00:04:17.850> zero<00:04:18.090> zero<00:04:18.180> five<00:04:18.540> six<00:04:18.810> so

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
but at is 70 point zero zero five six so

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.190 
but at is 70 point zero zero five six so
this<00:04:19.380> is<00:04:19.500> very<00:04:19.650> close<00:04:19.979> to<00:04:20.010> 72<00:04:21.000> so<00:04:21.690> if<00:04:21.750> you<00:04:21.900> keep

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
this is very close to 72 so if you keep

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.469 
this is very close to 72 so if you keep
doing<00:04:22.530> this<00:04:22.740> you<00:04:23.550> will<00:04:23.729> see<00:04:23.970> that<00:04:24.000> all<00:04:24.419> the

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
doing this you will see that all the

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.900 
doing this you will see that all the
numbers<00:04:24.930> are<00:04:25.380> close<00:04:25.800> to<00:04:26.070> 70

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
numbers are close to 70

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.670 
numbers are close to 70
so<00:04:27.910> seventeen<00:04:28.510> point<00:04:28.900> three<00:04:28.990> seven<00:04:29.470> two<00:04:29.650> point

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
so seventeen point three seven two point

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.810 
so seventeen point three seven two point
six<00:04:30.070> seventy<00:04:30.639> one<00:04:30.760> so<00:04:31.510> if<00:04:31.960> we<00:04:32.290> approximate<00:04:33.190> the

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
six seventy one so if we approximate the

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.050 
six seventy one so if we approximate the
number<00:04:34.120> to<00:04:34.270> be<00:04:34.420> 72<00:04:34.960> then<00:04:35.860> all<00:04:36.250> we<00:04:36.550> need<00:04:36.580> to<00:04:36.790> do

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
number to be 72 then all we need to do

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.580 
number to be 72 then all we need to do
is<00:04:37.270> so<00:04:38.260> if<00:04:38.440> I<00:04:39.270> use<00:04:40.270> the<00:04:40.450> same<00:04:40.690> approach<00:04:41.110> so<00:04:41.350> if<00:04:41.470> I

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
is so if I use the same approach so if I

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.909 
is so if I use the same approach so if I
use<00:04:41.830> our<00:04:42.220> trick<00:04:42.610> then<00:04:43.450> instead<00:04:44.050> of<00:04:44.169> using<00:04:44.410> 70

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
use our trick then instead of using 70

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.640 
use our trick then instead of using 70
I'll<00:04:45.220> always<00:04:45.660> 70<00:04:46.660> point<00:04:46.900> zero<00:04:47.110> zero<00:04:47.139> five<00:04:47.410> I

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
I'll always 70 point zero zero five I

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.290 
I'll always 70 point zero zero five I
will<00:04:47.770> use<00:04:48.450> always<00:04:49.450> 72<00:04:50.080> so<00:04:50.800> I<00:04:50.830> keep<00:04:51.190> using<00:04:51.520> 72

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
will use always 72 so I keep using 72

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.409 
will use always 72 so I keep using 72
for<00:04:52.660> all<00:04:52.960> this<00:04:53.230> rates<00:04:53.530> and<00:04:54.150> then<00:04:55.150> I'll

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:55.419 
for all this rates and then I'll

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.830 
for all this rates and then I'll
calculate<00:04:55.690> the<00:04:56.230> time<00:04:56.910> time<00:04:57.910> will<00:04:58.180> be<00:04:58.270> equal<00:04:58.450> to

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
calculate the time time will be equal to

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.150 
calculate the time time will be equal to
72<00:04:59.669> divided<00:05:00.669> by<00:05:00.850> rate<00:05:01.660> so<00:05:02.500> now<00:05:02.620> you<00:05:02.680> can<00:05:02.950> see

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
72 divided by rate so now you can see

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.480 
72 divided by rate so now you can see
that<00:05:03.580> I<00:05:03.880> get<00:05:06.540> numbers<00:05:07.540> which<00:05:08.020> are<00:05:08.230> very<00:05:09.130> close

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
that I get numbers which are very close

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.060 
that I get numbers which are very close
to<00:05:10.300> the<00:05:10.419> actual<00:05:10.840> time<00:05:11.020> it<00:05:11.050> should<00:05:11.350> be<00:05:11.500> so<00:05:11.680> it<00:05:11.770> so

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
to the actual time it should be so it so

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.430 
to the actual time it should be so it so
suppose<00:05:13.060> here<00:05:13.300> it<00:05:13.450> is<00:05:13.570> eleven<00:05:13.960> point<00:05:14.230> eight

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
suppose here it is eleven point eight

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.040 
suppose here it is eleven point eight
nine<00:05:14.680> but<00:05:15.370> here<00:05:15.580> I<00:05:15.610> get<00:05:15.880> twelve<00:05:16.180> here<00:05:16.900> it<00:05:16.960> is

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
nine but here I get twelve here it is

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.760 
nine but here I get twelve here it is
ten<00:05:17.230> point<00:05:17.560> two<00:05:17.800> four<00:05:18.100> four<00:05:18.310> I<00:05:18.370> get<00:05:18.760> ten<00:05:18.970> point

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
ten point two four four I get ten point

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.969 
ten point two four four I get ten point
two<00:05:20.770> eight<00:05:20.880> so<00:05:22.020> so<00:05:23.020> this<00:05:23.169> is<00:05:23.350> a<00:05:23.380> good

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
two eight so so this is a good

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.010 
two eight so so this is a good
approximation<00:05:24.510> instead<00:05:25.510> of<00:05:25.630> doing<00:05:25.870> this

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
approximation instead of doing this

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.310 
approximation instead of doing this
complicated<00:05:27.000> calculation<00:05:28.000> we<00:05:28.690> can<00:05:28.720> just<00:05:29.139> get

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
complicated calculation we can just get

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.420 
complicated calculation we can just get
approximation<00:05:30.040> using<00:05:30.760> this<00:05:31.060> trick<00:05:31.270> so<00:05:32.200> I<00:05:32.710> hope

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
approximation using this trick so I hope

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.480 
approximation using this trick so I hope
