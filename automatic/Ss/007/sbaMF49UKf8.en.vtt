fun that's actually really useful I made

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.250 
fun that's actually really useful I made
this<00:00:19.619> for<00:00:19.920> testing<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.369> out<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.520> went<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.260> the

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
this for testing it out I went to the

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.939 
this for testing it out I went to the
yin<00:00:22.859> le<00:00:25.670> spider<00:00:26.670> carcass<00:00:27.180> area<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:28.019> just<00:00:28.560> killed

yin le spider carcass area I just killed

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.700 
yin le spider carcass area I just killed
him<00:00:28.980> for<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.279> while<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:30.140> was<00:00:31.140> actually

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
him for a while so that was actually

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.380 
him for a while so that was actually
pretty<00:00:31.949> good

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
pretty good

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.860 
pretty good
I<00:00:33.480> would<00:00:34.260> say<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:35.329> that's<00:00:36.329> probably<00:00:36.570> not<00:00:36.750> the

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
I would say that that's probably not the

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.680 
I would say that that's probably not the
best<00:00:36.930> way<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.230> make<00:00:37.440> money<00:00:37.700> but<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.450> way

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
best way to make money but it is a way

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.779 
best way to make money but it is a way
that<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.230> use<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.920> if<00:00:41.660> if<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:43.520> have<00:00:44.520> some

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
that you use that if if you have some

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.850 
that you use that if if you have some
food<00:00:45.000> or<00:00:45.180> whatever<00:00:45.329> if<00:00:45.750> you're<00:00:45.930> low<00:00:46.110> level<00:00:46.559> and

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
food or whatever if you're low level and

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.310 
food or whatever if you're low level and
even<00:00:47.550> if<00:00:47.640> my<00:00:47.670> level<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.510> still<00:00:48.989> have<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.200> use<00:00:49.289> a

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
even if my level you still have to use a

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.290 
even if my level you still have to use a
journal<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.800> they<00:00:49.950> kill<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:51.059> honestly

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
journal and they kill you so I honestly

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.670 
journal and they kill you so I honestly
would<00:00:51.750> think<00:00:51.930> it's<00:00:52.020> probably<00:00:52.320> not<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.649> best

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
would think it's probably not the best

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.450 
would think it's probably not the best
weeks<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.059> return<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.660> not<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.079> good<00:00:55.460> but

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
weeks is the return is not so good but

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.950 
weeks is the return is not so good but
anyway<00:00:56.579> it's<00:00:56.910> pretty<00:00:57.090> nice<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.570> made<00:00:57.750> about<00:00:57.840> a

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
anyway it's pretty nice I made about a

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.560 
anyway it's pretty nice I made about a
meal<00:00:58.199> off<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.670> got<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.940> thousand<00:01:00.449> of

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
meal off that and I got a thousand of

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.979 
meal off that and I got a thousand of
those

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
those

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.900 
those

just<00:01:55.409> decided<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.890> know<00:01:56.009> what<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.189> might<00:01:56.340> as

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
just decided you know what I might as

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.319 
just decided you know what I might as
well<00:01:56.520> just<00:01:56.729> try<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.810> out<00:01:57.960> more<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:59.119> I'm<00:02:00.119> gonna

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
well just try it out more and I'm gonna

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.090

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
pretty sure they're the most expensive

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.289 
pretty sure they're the most expensive
out<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.500> those<00:02:04.710> maybe<00:02:05.520> it's<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.850> red<00:02:05.939> ones<00:02:06.180> are

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
out of those maybe it's the red ones are

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.880

attack<00:02:26.480> panel<00:02:28.880> that<00:02:29.880> does<00:02:30.150> this<00:02:30.270> mean<00:02:30.510> that

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
attack panel that does this mean that

attack panel that does this mean that
it's<00:02:30.840> still<00:02:31.170> going<00:02:32.600> that<00:02:33.600> is<00:02:33.840> so<00:02:34.080> weird<00:02:34.350> I

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
it's still going that is so weird I

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.690 
it's still going that is so weird I
think<00:02:36.390> that's<00:02:36.600> a<00:02:36.660> glitch<00:02:36.960> isn't<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.010> I've<00:02:38.490> had

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
think that's a glitch isn't it I've had

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.270 
think that's a glitch isn't it I've had
that<00:02:38.850> this<00:02:39.300> happened<00:02:39.720> at<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:40.100> frost<00:02:41.100> dragon

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
that this happened at a frost dragon

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.090 
that this happened at a frost dragon
where<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:41.910> still<00:02:42.270> goes<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:43.260> keeps<00:02:43.560> going<00:02:43.770> and

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
where it still goes it keeps going and

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.400 
where it still goes it keeps going and
it<00:02:44.790> adds<00:02:44.970> that<00:02:45.180> bonus<00:02:45.570> but<00:02:45.930> it<00:02:45.990> doesn't<00:02:46.260> have<00:02:46.380> a

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
it adds that bonus but it doesn't have a

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.040 
it adds that bonus but it doesn't have a
timer<00:02:46.850> I'm<00:02:47.850> gonna<00:02:48.060> test<00:02:48.210> it<00:02:48.390> out<00:02:48.480> see<00:02:48.690> if<00:02:48.900> it

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
timer I'm gonna test it out see if it

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.730 
timer I'm gonna test it out see if it

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
hours let's see now okay you probably

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.320 
hours let's see now okay you probably
make<00:03:16.110> more<00:03:16.290> money<00:03:16.470> doing<00:03:16.650> this<00:03:17.180> than<00:03:18.180> you

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
make more money doing this than you

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.770 
make more money doing this than you
would<00:03:19.459> in<00:03:20.459> ten<00:03:20.760> hours<00:03:20.790> so<00:03:21.270> that's<00:03:21.360> pretty<00:03:21.540> nice

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
would in ten hours so that's pretty nice

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.479 
would in ten hours so that's pretty nice
but<00:03:22.020> it's<00:03:22.200> still<00:03:22.410> it's<00:03:22.680> you<00:03:23.100> know<00:03:23.190> if<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.370> can

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.250 
kill them with non degradable weapon
that's<00:03:25.350> getting<00:03:26.070> extra<00:03:26.540> what<00:03:27.540> two<00:03:27.810> Miller

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
that's getting extra what two Miller

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.500 
that's getting extra what two Miller
three<00:03:28.500> mil<00:03:28.709> cuz<00:03:29.160> I'd<00:03:29.310> be<00:03:29.430> using<00:03:29.670> dual<00:03:29.970> chaotic

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
three mil cuz I'd be using dual chaotic

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.500 
three mil cuz I'd be using dual chaotic
rapier<00:03:30.870> so<00:03:31.080> like<00:03:31.230> or<00:03:31.700> crossbows<00:03:32.700> so<00:03:33.360> that

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
rapier so like or crossbows so that

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
rapier so like or crossbows so that
would<00:03:33.630> probably<00:03:33.780> be<00:03:34.610> like<00:03:35.610> three<00:03:36.390> mil<00:03:36.570> saved

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
would probably be like three mil saved

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.390 
would probably be like three mil saved
over<00:03:38.489> ten<00:03:38.940> hours<00:03:38.970> so<00:03:39.510> it's<00:03:39.750> this<00:03:40.110> not<00:03:40.410> bad<00:03:40.709> it

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
doesn't really matter depending on how

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.509

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
finally actually get that this ultimate

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.820 
finally actually get that this ultimate
just<00:04:45.420> easing<00:04:46.220> it<00:04:47.220> maybe<00:04:48.060> not<00:04:48.300> okay<00:04:48.720> Bocuse<00:04:49.620> it

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
just easing it maybe not okay Bocuse it

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.650 
just easing it maybe not okay Bocuse it
but<00:04:50.400> normally<00:04:50.520> it<00:04:50.850> actually<00:04:51.210> feels<00:04:51.480> something

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
but normally it actually feels something

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.880 
but normally it actually feels something
really<00:04:52.140> big<00:04:54.080> anyway<00:04:55.080> so<00:04:55.200> I'll<00:04:55.500> probably<00:04:55.680> go

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
really big anyway so I'll probably go

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.160

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
these kind of makeup of course it's

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.160 
these kind of makeup of course it's
limited<00:05:12.930> to<00:05:13.020> a<00:05:13.050> certain<00:05:13.560> amount<00:05:13.800> of<00:05:13.890> items<00:05:14.090> but

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
limited to a certain amount of items but

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.270 
limited to a certain amount of items but
it's<00:05:16.170> kind<00:05:16.410> of<00:05:16.440> nice<00:05:16.590> because<00:05:16.830> it's<00:05:17.100> pretty

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
it's kind of nice because it's pretty

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.870 
it's kind of nice because it's pretty
much<00:05:17.400> basically<00:05:17.850> a<00:05:17.940> pack<00:05:18.620> and<00:05:19.620> you<00:05:20.520> can<00:05:20.550> get<00:05:20.790> it

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
much basically a pack and you can get it

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.310 
much basically a pack and you can get it
at<00:05:21.000> a<00:05:21.090> lower<00:05:21.240> level<00:05:21.360> it<00:05:21.810> was<00:05:21.960> a<00:05:21.990> lot<00:05:22.170> less

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
at a lower level it was a lot less

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.720 
at a lower level it was a lot less
effort<00:05:22.530> to<00:05:22.830> actually<00:05:23.100> get<00:05:23.250> them<00:05:23.370> I<00:05:23.460> think<00:05:23.550> you

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
effort to actually get them I think you

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.130 
effort to actually get them I think you
can<00:05:23.880> get<00:05:24.000> them<00:05:24.090> at<00:05:24.180> like<00:05:24.270> level<00:05:24.510> 30<00:05:24.930> or

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
can get them at like level 30 or

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.360 
can get them at like level 30 or
something<00:05:25.320> or<00:05:26.100> less<00:05:26.510> with<00:05:27.510> with<00:05:28.080> the<00:05:28.370> original

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
something or less with with the original

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.040 
something or less with with the original
but<00:05:29.850> if<00:05:29.970> you<00:05:30.090> get<00:05:30.210> sine<00:05:30.420> of<00:05:30.450> the<00:05:30.600> porter<00:05:30.840> one

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
but if you get sine of the porter one

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.510 
but if you get sine of the porter one
it's<00:05:31.230> probably<00:05:31.320> like<00:05:31.560> level<00:05:31.830> eight<00:05:32.280> or

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
it's probably like level eight or

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.300 
it's probably like level eight or
something<00:05:32.940> I<00:05:33.870> just<00:05:34.110> don't<00:05:34.740> think<00:05:35.040> it's<00:05:35.160> worth

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
something I just don't think it's worth

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.620 
something I just don't think it's worth
it<00:05:35.460> then<00:05:35.640> you<00:05:36.120> might<00:05:36.210> as<00:05:36.300> well<00:05:36.360> just<00:05:36.480> keep

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
it then you might as well just keep

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.040 
it then you might as well just keep
training<00:05:37.580> because<00:05:38.580> they<00:05:38.790> only<00:05:39.210> trans<00:05:39.720> I<00:05:39.870> think

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
training because they only trans I think

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.930 
training because they only trans I think
get<00:05:40.260> five<00:05:40.500> charges<00:05:40.920> for<00:05:41.220> the<00:05:41.310> first<00:05:41.520> one<00:05:41.730> and

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
get five charges for the first one and

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.280 
get five charges for the first one and
then<00:05:42.000> it<00:05:42.150> goes<00:05:42.240> up<00:05:42.420> from<00:05:42.510> there<00:05:42.750> I<00:05:42.780> have<00:05:42.930> twenty

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
then it goes up from there I have twenty

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.030 
then it goes up from there I have twenty
on<00:05:43.470> this<00:05:43.650> one<00:05:44.060> so<00:05:45.060> it's<00:05:45.210> kind<00:05:45.420> of<00:05:45.480> nice<00:05:45.660> I<00:05:46.650> can't

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
wait till I can get sine of the porter

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.480 
wait till I can get sine of the porter

the<00:06:16.830> skills<00:06:17.190> are<00:06:17.370> look<00:06:17.760> pretty<00:06:18.000> cool

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
the skills are look pretty cool

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.660 
the skills are look pretty cool
apparently<00:06:19.200> it's<00:06:19.320> gonna<00:06:19.410> be<00:06:19.590> some<00:06:19.800> skill<00:06:20.130> that

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:20.670 
apparently it's gonna be some skill that

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.880 
apparently it's gonna be some skill that
allows<00:06:21.270> you<00:06:21.570> to<00:06:21.600> customize<00:06:22.020> your<00:06:22.350> weapon

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:22.890 
allows you to customize your weapon

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.040 
allows you to customize your weapon
stuff<00:06:23.250> like<00:06:23.400> that<00:06:23.610> so<00:06:23.820> I<00:06:24.060> think<00:06:24.630> that<00:06:24.750> sounds

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.050 
stuff like that so I think that sounds

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.279 
stuff like that so I think that sounds
pretty<00:06:25.200> awesome<00:06:25.470> and<00:06:25.940> that<00:06:26.940> will<00:06:27.060> allow

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:28.289 
pretty awesome and that will allow

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:30.350 
pretty awesome and that will allow
that<00:06:28.979> there<00:06:29.219> to<00:06:29.339> be<00:06:29.430> new<00:06:29.759> and<00:06:29.789> original

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
that there to be new and original

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.779 
that there to be new and original
weapons<00:06:31.289> instead<00:06:31.589> of<00:06:31.710> I<00:06:31.889> mean<00:06:32.099> it's<00:06:32.279> the

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:32.789 
weapons instead of I mean it's the

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:34.820 
weapons instead of I mean it's the
weapons<00:06:33.089> are<00:06:33.240> awesome<00:06:33.599> but<00:06:33.839> being<00:06:34.559> come<00:06:34.710> on

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830 
weapons are awesome but being come on

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.619 
weapons are awesome but being come on
once<00:06:35.069> they<00:06:35.189> get<00:06:35.279> to<00:06:35.399> 99<00:06:35.879> that'll<00:06:36.240> be<00:06:36.360> kind<00:06:36.539> of

00:06:36.619 --> 00:06:36.629 
once they get to 99 that'll be kind of

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:39.469 
once they get to 99 that'll be kind of
difficult<00:06:37.110> to<00:06:37.169> make<00:06:37.639> any<00:06:38.639> new<00:06:38.879> weapon<00:06:39.240> so<00:06:39.449> I

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 
difficult to make any new weapon so I

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:40.519 
difficult to make any new weapon so I
think<00:06:39.569> it's<00:06:39.749> gonna<00:06:39.839> be<00:06:39.930> cool<00:06:40.110> like<00:06:40.169> you<00:06:40.439> know

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:40.529 
think it's gonna be cool like you know

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:44.089 
think it's gonna be cool like you know
like<00:06:40.710> maybe<00:06:41.219> a<00:06:41.369> lot<00:06:41.699> like<00:06:41.879> a<00:06:41.909> planet<00:06:42.629> or<00:06:43.099> Team

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:44.099 
like maybe a lot like a planet or Team

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:46.159 
like maybe a lot like a planet or Team
Fortress<00:06:44.309> 2<00:06:44.639> where<00:06:44.819> they<00:06:44.939> have<00:06:45.119> really<00:06:46.050> good

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:46.169 
Fortress 2 where they have really good

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:48.260 
Fortress 2 where they have really good
weapons<00:06:46.649> that<00:06:47.129> look<00:06:47.460> awesome<00:06:47.669> and<00:06:47.969> they<00:06:48.119> have

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:48.270 
weapons that look awesome and they have

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:49.879 
weapons that look awesome and they have
all<00:06:48.389> these<00:06:48.539> really<00:06:48.809> do<00:06:49.169> really<00:06:49.349> cool<00:06:49.589> stuff

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:49.889 
all these really do really cool stuff

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:51.829 
all these really do really cool stuff
but<00:06:50.490> then<00:06:50.639> there's<00:06:50.819> a<00:06:50.909> few<00:06:51.149> negatives<00:06:51.659> that

00:06:51.829 --> 00:06:51.839 
but then there's a few negatives that

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:53.299 
but then there's a few negatives that
they<00:06:51.960> have<00:06:52.139> I<00:06:52.379> think<00:06:52.949> that'll<00:06:53.189> be<00:06:53.219> really

00:06:53.299 --> 00:06:53.309 
they have I think that'll be really

00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:54.950 
they have I think that'll be really
awesome<00:06:53.639> then<00:06:54.089> they'll<00:06:54.240> kind<00:06:54.360> of<00:06:54.479> balance<00:06:54.839> it

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 
awesome then they'll kind of balance it

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.059 
awesome then they'll kind of balance it
