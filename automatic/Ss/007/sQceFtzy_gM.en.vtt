00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.930
 staff let's do one more exercise because these fish was to find a bar 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.930
 in the center of a triangle we have the triangle ar 

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:15.009
 remembering that the most certain is the point of intersection of the median img year 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:18.009
 is that the segment connecting the mid-point side 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:22.779
 it is not to the apex example pointers do you think the midpoint of the side to be 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.560
 emiliano point b this is what we're going to do 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.839
 then there on the printed matter and we saw that to build 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:31.630
 the midpoint you can find mediatism 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.210
 there is always greater openness or distance of air until we go 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.400
 find the points 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.050
 to say 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.020
 now I change 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.020
 it is pointed out that 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.330
 I found that if they are not needed 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.960
 in thesis are first attack we do not need to make the complete bow that the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.750
 that we want are exactly those points here 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.400
 in this point 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.670
 in this point 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.670
 Obs is to put on the ruler by connecting these two points 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.120
 but we would have the mediatism that we want exactly the point about the 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.250
 phase segment then this is the midpoint of the secult imagina side 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.890
 Why delegate power? 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.630
 point at me but we have the first 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.920
 neide actress 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.230
 maybe it can be done 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.280
 and these youngsters and only surf the midpoint 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.270
 the media says do not need to pass that point 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.460
 so we do the same thing 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.460
 on the other hand let's take for example the side 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.960
 here his side we need the same thing in the mid-point 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.960
 air repeats larger opening process 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.860
 that the distance goal we will find the imprecision of the two arcs 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.730
 world here to the point outside 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.140
 it's an interception here 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.960
 in another decision 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.850
 so it is not these points we would have the country's media 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.340
 but we just need 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.729
 the intersection with one side this point 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.839
 is the other midpoint on the side of there and connecting port c 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:18.619
 vers at this midpoint 

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:20.109
 but we will have 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:22.019
 the other 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.069
 mediating 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.549
 so coming back from china 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.180
 position but we have here two midnight the meeting of these two 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.409
 medium 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.899
 This is what we call the 

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:39.669
 I enter 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:41.209
 it's one less but yes
