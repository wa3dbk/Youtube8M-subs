we think is the best option to get us
mentally<00:00:42.540> physically<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.140> emotionally

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260

in<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:52.259> fact<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.590> they<00:01:52.770> can<00:01:52.950> stop<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.460> run

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
in the fact that they can stop the run

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.810

with<00:01:53.850> their<00:01:53.970> front<00:01:54.210> seven<00:01:55.070> they<00:01:56.070> they<00:01:56.490> rush

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
with their front seven they they rush

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.760

much<00:02:11.200> of<00:02:11.230> a<00:02:11.409> difference<00:02:11.709> of<00:02:11.859> the<00:02:12.099> freshman<00:02:12.730> on

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
much of a difference of the freshman on

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.399 
much of a difference of the freshman on
the<00:02:12.939> defensive<00:02:13.269> line<00:02:13.329> specially<00:02:13.900> Kenny<00:02:14.109> Clark

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:14.409 
the defensive line specially Kenny Clark

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:15.449 
the defensive line specially Kenny Clark
Eddie<00:02:14.620> vanderdoes<00:02:14.829> how<00:02:15.159> much<00:02:15.310> of<00:02:15.400> a

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
Eddie vanderdoes how much of a

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:16.830 
Eddie vanderdoes how much of a
difference<00:02:15.700> is<00:02:15.790> though<00:02:15.939> those<00:02:16.359> guys<00:02:16.569> made

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
difference is though those guys made

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.050 
difference is though those guys made
kind<00:02:17.230> of<00:02:17.349> getting<00:02:17.890> into<00:02:18.099> the<00:02:18.219> flow<00:02:18.370> so<00:02:18.700> quickly

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
kind of getting into the flow so quickly

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.959 
kind of getting into the flow so quickly
oh<00:02:19.390> it's<00:02:19.840> been<00:02:20.049> big<00:02:20.469> you<00:02:20.709> know<00:02:20.829> the<00:02:21.700> more<00:02:21.909> you

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:21.969 
oh it's been big you know the more you

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.569 
oh it's been big you know the more you
can<00:02:22.269> rotate<00:02:22.780> along<00:02:23.049> the<00:02:23.439> front<00:02:23.829> and<00:02:24.069> keep<00:02:24.340> guys

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:24.579 
can rotate along the front and keep guys

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.410 
can rotate along the front and keep guys
fresh<00:02:25.060> as<00:02:25.390> much<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:27.250> know<00:02:27.420> fast-tempo

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
fresh as much you know fast-tempo

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.319 
fresh as much you know fast-tempo
up-tempo<00:02:29.200> offense<00:02:29.799> as<00:02:29.950> we<00:02:30.129> see<00:02:30.400> I<00:02:30.639> think<00:02:31.030> it's

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
up-tempo offense as we see I think it's

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:33.300 
up-tempo offense as we see I think it's
important<00:02:31.870> you<00:02:32.349> know<00:02:32.469> and<00:02:32.799> so<00:02:33.040> the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
important you know and so the

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.979 
important you know and so the
development<00:02:33.819> of<00:02:33.849> Kenny<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.359> the<00:02:34.450> development

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
development of Kenny and the development

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.920

of<00:02:35.609> Eddie<00:02:36.609> along<00:02:37.150> with<00:02:37.359> you<00:02:37.569> know<00:02:37.599> the<00:02:37.689> way

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
of Eddie along with you know the way

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.959 
of Eddie along with you know the way
