00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:09.010
 one of the most famous masters of 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.559
 riding of portugal manuel giorgi 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.599
 martins de oliveira is also one of 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:17.250
 the most successful breeders of the breed 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.250
 Portuguese Lusitanian 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:23.570
 the wise stallion is worth in the market 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.570
 sixty thousand euros 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.449
 for us Portuguese talk about 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.029
 Lusitanian horse is a great pride is 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:36.290
 one is a reference of a culture 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:38.540
 equestrian very that has many thousands of 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.710
 years it does not become a cultural thing very 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:45.260
 important and economical too but this 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.690
 culture is in permanent change before 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.110
 Lucitano was used in the bullfights of 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.500
 Bulls 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.780
 Today the breeders try to adapt their 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.629
 size and size to the standards of the 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.510
 international horse riding something that does not 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:03.980
 like manuel I think it's a shame 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:07.039
 the base race is a horse with a lot 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.450
 mobility and with great finesse is clear 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:11.149
 that for the demands of the 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.800
 competition the channel is bigger and 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:15.259
 less fine clear that that too 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.320
 harms the race a bit at my point of 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.320
 view 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:26.890
 the ribatejo region around 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:31.210
 lisbon is strongly agricultural 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:33.280
 the Lusitanians are everywhere a 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.100
 day a year the region hosts a large 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.740
 event in autumn in the little town 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.460
 of strike the breeders of 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.460
 all portugal 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.580
 The annual horse fair is a magnet for 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.860
 visitors 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.130
 here the tradition is proudly displayed 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.800
 even when almost no appointment is not from 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.690
 vulgar pure race becomes the 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.690
 center of the Portuguese equine world 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.250
 people from all countries come to see 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.159
 our Lusitanians why we come every 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.610
 year 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:13.340
 what many visitors do not see are being 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.709
 creating too many horses and those that do not 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.709
 find buyer are abandoned 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.560
 as nobody took charge of this colt 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.020
 they left it adopted 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.660
 this Englishwoman rescues the horses 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.959
 abandoned and try to place them in 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.200
 england germany or france 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:37.500
 here they care for 150 animals by means of 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.500
 donations 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:48.230
 there are many abandoned horses the 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.360
 Portuguese economy goes wrong the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.120
 maintaining a horse is expensive and 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.780
 many can not afford it anymore 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.400
 the hay the vet and that's why 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.580
 abandon the horses and finish 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.580
 dying 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.020
 many end up even in the slaughterhouse 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.270
 they let know the place where the 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.660
 horses wait to be slaughtered 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:17.330
 here this 7 year old mare is very gentle 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.330
 yaron thinks he should have good owners 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:26.970
 It is very hard 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.570
 or a horse so cute a loss not 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.760
 I should pass 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.360
 I would like to rescue them all but I 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.360
 alone I can not 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:42.909
 in just one year , almost 3000 were sacrificed 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:46.359
 Lusitanos practically all the 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:48.700
 surplus belarmino figueiredo lives from 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:52.420
 the resale of these animals you can 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:55.610
 take up to 100 euros per copy 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.189
 it's a system people wanted the 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.640
 horses then you can not follow 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:04.670
 keeping them then they call me to 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.769
 get rid of them I'm going to look for them 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.950
 and we talk about price and documentation 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:12.829
 that's very important horses 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.789
 they have to have a microchip if not 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:18.440
 the slaughterhouse accepts them 

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:20.480
 now to see also for slaughterhouses 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.060
 especially large 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.250
 for the training horses that 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.140
 they sell at the strike fair the 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.600
 traders ask for prices 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:33.670
 astronomical something that for manuel 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.670
 breeder is not a reason to celebrate 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.620
 formerly there was a passion and 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.830
 took to the fair to strike in 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:46.160
 example your horse gone bad and you had your 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:49.220
 pride in teaching the town that you had 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.800
 a horse looking bad today is more market 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.720
 it's more going to sell is another 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.240
 mentality 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.300
 Manuel is still betting on the Lusitanians 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.640
 of pure breed that he himself breeds and still 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:05.450
 believe in the old and almost forgotten 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:07.310
 Portuguese tradition and that says so much 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.740
 for intrepid sailors like 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:14.620
 reckless bullfighters the horse always 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.620
 played an important role in their lives
