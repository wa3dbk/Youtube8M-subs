many<00:00:08.160> of<00:00:08.340> us<00:00:08.430> work<00:00:08.700> at<00:00:08.880> two<00:00:09.120> deaths<00:00:09.390> we<00:00:10.380> have

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
many of us work at two deaths we have

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.010 
many of us work at two deaths we have
the<00:00:10.890> electronic<00:00:11.790> desk<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.389> work<00:00:12.570> station

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:13.020 
the electronic desk of the work station

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.959 
the electronic desk of the work station
and<00:00:13.590> we<00:00:13.740> have<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.070> physical<00:00:14.490> desk<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.880> the

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
and we have the physical desk of the

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.990 
and we have the physical desk of the
paper<00:00:15.180> pusher<00:00:15.830> now<00:00:16.830> these<00:00:17.340> two<00:00:17.550> desks<00:00:17.880> are

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
paper pusher now these two desks are

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.260 
paper pusher now these two desks are
very<00:00:18.210> separate<00:00:19.340> manipulating<00:00:20.340> objects<00:00:21.060> on

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
very separate manipulating objects on

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.750 
very separate manipulating objects on
the<00:00:21.630> workstation<00:00:22.050> it's<00:00:22.920> very<00:00:23.099> different<00:00:23.430> from

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
the workstation it's very different from

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.230 
the workstation it's very different from
manipulating<00:00:24.449> objects<00:00:24.840> on<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.140> real<00:00:25.320> desk<00:00:26.240> we

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
manipulating objects on the real desk we

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.210 
manipulating objects on the real desk we
have<00:00:27.270> the<00:00:27.630> desktop<00:00:28.080> metaphor<00:00:28.320> which<00:00:29.039> is

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
have the desktop metaphor which is

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.689 
have the desktop metaphor which is
supposed<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:29.970> make<00:00:30.119> them<00:00:30.330> more<00:00:30.449> similar<00:00:30.720> and

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
supposed to make them more similar and

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.939 
supposed to make them more similar and
some<00:00:32.699> people<00:00:33.000> think<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.680> it<00:00:34.680> can<00:00:34.860> be

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:34.949 
some people think that it can be

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:36.590 
some people think that it can be
extended<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.580> point<00:00:35.940> where<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.300> can<00:00:36.449> do

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
extended to the point where you can do

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.290 
extended to the point where you can do
everything<00:00:36.809> on<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.949> workstation<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:39.180> we

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
everything on the workstation that we

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.080 
everything on the workstation that we
currently<00:00:39.510> do<00:00:39.870> on<00:00:40.020> our<00:00:40.230> desks<00:00:40.970> replacing<00:00:41.970> them

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
currently do on our desks replacing them

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.950 
currently do on our desks replacing them
entirely<00:00:42.420> but<00:00:44.450> what<00:00:45.450> if<00:00:45.540> we<00:00:45.660> took<00:00:45.809> the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
entirely but what if we took the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.770 
entirely but what if we took the
opposite<00:00:46.410> approach<00:00:46.880> what<00:00:47.880> if<00:00:48.000> instead<00:00:48.450> of

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
opposite approach what if instead of

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.299 
opposite approach what if instead of
making<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.230> workstation<00:00:49.800> more<00:00:50.010> like<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
making the workstation more like the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:50.930 
making the workstation more like the
desk

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
desk

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.479 
desk
we<00:00:51.570> made<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.989> real<00:00:52.170> desk<00:00:52.500> more<00:00:53.100> like<00:00:53.309> the

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
we made the real desk more like the

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.180 
we made the real desk more like the
workstation<00:00:54.440> we<00:00:55.440> wouldn't<00:00:55.710> need<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.829> desktop

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
workstation we wouldn't need a desktop

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.610 
workstation we wouldn't need a desktop
metaphor<00:00:56.489> because<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.390> would<00:00:57.570> literally<00:00:58.230> be<00:00:58.410> a

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
metaphor because it would literally be a

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.540

desktop the digital desk has a couple of
video<00:01:02.850> cameras<00:01:03.390> here<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.899> point<00:01:04.440> down<00:01:04.680> at

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
video cameras here that point down at

video cameras here that point down at
the<00:01:05.009> desk<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.759> the<00:01:05.880> system<00:01:06.210> can<00:01:06.450> see<00:01:06.720> what<00:01:06.869> the

I<00:01:43.049> can<00:01:43.710> use<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:44.040> much<00:01:44.640> as<00:01:44.790> an<00:01:44.880> ordinary

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
I can use this much as an ordinary

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.140 
I can use this much as an ordinary

perform an operation on it multiply it
by<00:02:38.180> 2<00:02:39.019> and<00:02:39.700> get

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
by 2 and get

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.600 
by 2 and get
780
