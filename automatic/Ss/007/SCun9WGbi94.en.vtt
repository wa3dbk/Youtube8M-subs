car to come out of turns a lot harder

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.320 
car to come out of turns a lot harder
our<00:00:54.740> goal<00:00:54.920> is<00:00:55.130> going<00:00:55.160> to<00:00:55.490> need<00:00:55.790> to<00:00:55.970> give<00:00:56.150> him<00:00:56.270> a

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
our goal is going to need to give him a

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.790 
our goal is going to need to give him a
lot<00:00:56.510> more<00:00:56.540> torques

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:43.540 

so<00:01:01.340> I<00:01:01.399> see<00:01:01.640> what<00:01:01.760> happens

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.680 

okay<00:01:44.550> well<00:01:44.790> we're<00:01:44.940> just<00:01:45.000> going<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.270> recap<00:01:45.360> when

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
okay well we're just going to recap when

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.300 
okay well we're just going to recap when
we<00:01:45.780> ended<00:01:45.990> up<00:01:46.050> with<00:01:46.290> we<00:01:46.800> end<00:01:46.980> up<00:01:47.070> with<00:01:47.220> about

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
we ended up with we end up with about

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.390 
we ended up with we end up with about
the<00:01:47.640> 95<00:01:48.479> horsepower<00:01:48.630> on<00:01:49.050> this<00:01:49.080> time<00:01:49.320> yeah

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
the 95 horsepower on this time yeah

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.900 
the 95 horsepower on this time yeah
about<00:01:50.880> 73<00:01:51.570> 74<00:01:51.990> hundred<00:01:52.290> rpm<00:01:52.700> peak<00:01:53.700> torque

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
about 73 74 hundred rpm peak torque

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.050 
about 73 74 hundred rpm peak torque
numbers<00:01:54.090> are<00:01:54.360> our<00:01:54.800> 155<00:01:55.800> foot<00:01:56.010> non<00:01:56.190> Centauri<00:01:56.520> we

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
numbers are our 155 foot non Centauri we

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.400 
numbers are our 155 foot non Centauri we
actually<00:01:57.360> have<00:01:57.450> two<00:01:57.570> distinct<00:01:57.900> fourth<00:01:58.229> Peaks

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
actually have two distinct fourth Peaks

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.010 
actually have two distinct fourth Peaks
one<00:01:58.680> at<00:01:58.800> about<00:01:59.010> 6,000<00:01:59.520> rpm<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.180> one<00:02:00.840> about

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
one at about 6,000 rpm and one about

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.770 
one at about 6,000 rpm and one about
4400<00:02:03.110> so<00:02:04.110> we<00:02:04.380> all<00:02:04.470> have<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.710> run<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.430> again

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
4400 so we all have to run this again

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.109 
4400 so we all have to run this again
like<00:02:06.780> anything<00:02:07.229> dinos<00:02:07.650> read<00:02:08.190> differently<00:02:08.610> so

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
like anything dinos read differently so

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.480 
like anything dinos read differently so
to<00:02:09.899> know<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.320> the<00:02:10.530> changes<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.430> we<00:02:11.550> made

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
to know that the changes that we made

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.370 
to know that the changes that we made
are<00:02:13.090> actually<00:02:13.360> beneficial<00:02:13.750> we'll<00:02:14.080> have<00:02:14.230> to

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
are actually beneficial we'll have to

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.110 
are actually beneficial we'll have to
rerun<00:02:14.680> it<00:02:14.830> off<00:02:14.950> on<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.190> other<00:02:15.280> dinos<00:02:15.760> at<00:02:15.970> this

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
rerun it off on the other dinos at this

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.770 
rerun it off on the other dinos at this
part<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:17.530> fortunately<00:02:18.430> we<00:02:18.490> can<00:02:18.760> work<00:02:19.360> able<00:02:19.690> to

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
part so fortunately we can work able to

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.380 
part so fortunately we can work able to
run<00:02:19.930> this<00:02:20.020> farm<00:02:20.350> on<00:02:20.500> this<00:02:20.620> dino<00:02:21.330> before<00:02:22.330> the

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
run this farm on this dino before the

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.120 
run this farm on this dino before the
modifications<00:02:22.990> were<00:02:23.170> made<00:02:23.200> so<00:02:23.740> we<00:02:23.830> don't<00:02:23.980> know

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
modifications were made so we don't know

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.590 
modifications were made so we don't know
what<00:02:24.340> our<00:02:24.460> baseline<00:02:24.760> or<00:02:25.150> percentage

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
what our baseline or percentage

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.990 
what our baseline or percentage
increases<00:02:26.050> and<00:02:26.590> it's<00:02:26.710> died<00:02:27.310> notes<00:02:27.520> I'll<00:02:27.760> read

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
increases and it's died notes I'll read

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.970 
increases and it's died notes I'll read

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
before data on this car so we'll be able

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.000 
before data on this car so we'll be able
to<00:02:57.660> do<00:02:57.780> a<00:02:57.810> better<00:02:58.080> before<00:02:58.620> it<00:02:58.709> after

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
to do a better before it after

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.589 
to do a better before it after
comparison<00:02:59.459> with<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.849> modifications<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:00.540> a

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.550 

we<00:03:42.000> have<00:03:42.120> this<00:03:42.239> car<00:03:42.450> on<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.629> dyno<00:03:42.810> back<00:03:43.349> in

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
we have this car on the dyno back in

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.039 
we have this car on the dyno back in
June<00:03:43.799> at<00:03:44.159> the<00:03:44.370> racetrack<00:03:44.549> and<00:03:45.180> he<00:03:45.810> came<00:03:45.989> up

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
June at the racetrack and he came up

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.580 
June at the racetrack and he came up
with<00:03:46.230> 161<00:03:47.220> foot-pounds<00:03:47.670> of<00:03:47.760> torque<00:03:47.989> at<00:03:48.989> 6000

with 161 foot-pounds of torque at 6000

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.789 
with 161 foot-pounds of torque at 6000
rpm<00:03:49.950> and<00:03:50.280> he<00:03:50.970> was<00:03:51.120> 201<00:03:51.870> horsepower<00:03:52.049> right<00:03:52.620> at

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
rpm and he was 201 horsepower right at

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.559 
rpm and he was 201 horsepower right at
69<00:03:53.510> 7000<00:03:54.510> rpm<00:03:54.810> and<00:03:55.700> now<00:03:56.700> with<00:03:57.239> the<00:03:57.329> cams

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
69 7000 rpm and now with the cams

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.020 
69 7000 rpm and now with the cams
installed<00:03:58.079> and<00:03:58.470> some<00:03:58.890> tuning<00:03:59.189> by<00:03:59.310> Mitch<00:03:59.519> it<00:03:59.670> am

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
installed and some tuning by Mitch it am

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.380 
installed and some tuning by Mitch it am
with<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.659> AM<00:04:01.019> AMS<00:04:01.670> they<00:04:02.670> played<00:04:02.909> around<00:04:03.150> some

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
with the AM AMS they played around some

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.619 
with the AM AMS they played around some
of<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:03.569> VTEC<00:04:04.079> finding<00:04:04.769> I<00:04:04.890> guess<00:04:05.069> and<00:04:05.629> we've

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
of the VTEC finding I guess and we've

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.759 
of the VTEC finding I guess and we've
seen<00:04:06.930> a<00:04:07.290> 23<00:04:07.980> foot<00:04:08.010> pound<00:04:08.400> gain<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:09.329> torque<00:04:09.769> so

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
seen a 23 foot pound gain and torque so

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.009 
seen a 23 foot pound gain and torque so
the<00:04:10.920> peak<00:04:11.069> to<00:04:11.220> work<00:04:11.340> now<00:04:11.519> is<00:04:11.670> 185<00:04:12.390> foot-pounds

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
the peak to work now is 185 foot-pounds

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.809 
the peak to work now is 185 foot-pounds
but<00:04:13.200> it's<00:04:13.319> game<00:04:13.500> for<00:04:13.859> pretty<00:04:14.459> much<00:04:14.549> all

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
but it's game for pretty much all

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.029 
but it's game for pretty much all
everywhere<00:04:15.389> across<00:04:15.690> the<00:04:15.810> board<00:04:16.049> and<00:04:16.380> then

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
everywhere across the board and then

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:19.129 
everywhere across the board and then
again<00:04:17.639> more<00:04:17.850> horsepower<00:04:18.269> everywhere<00:04:18.690> bro

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
again more horsepower everywhere bro

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.600 
again more horsepower everywhere bro
peak<00:04:19.620> horsepower<00:04:20.400> is<00:04:20.729> 240<00:04:21.299> horsepower<00:04:21.560> at

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
peak horsepower is 240 horsepower at

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.129 
peak horsepower is 240 horsepower at
7500<00:04:23.610> rpm<00:04:23.940> so<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.240> total<00:04:24.449> gain<00:04:24.660> of<00:04:24.690> horsepower

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
7500 rpm so the total gain of horsepower

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.900 
7500 rpm so the total gain of horsepower
is<00:04:25.639> 39<00:04:26.639> horsepower<00:04:27.630> and<00:04:27.990> it's<00:04:28.729> pretty<00:04:29.729> good

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
is 39 horsepower and it's pretty good

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.909 
is 39 horsepower and it's pretty good
it's<00:04:30.360> hard<00:04:30.630> to<00:04:30.720> get<00:04:30.840> this<00:04:31.080> kind<00:04:31.289> of<00:04:31.350> horsepower

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
it's hard to get this kind of horsepower

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.460 
it's hard to get this kind of horsepower
out<00:04:32.160> of<00:04:32.190> a<00:04:32.310> normally<00:04:32.669> aspirated<00:04:32.729> car<00:04:33.470> Honda

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
out of a normally aspirated car Honda

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.990 
out of a normally aspirated car Honda
Acura<00:04:34.590> is<00:04:34.889> they<00:04:35.190> know<00:04:35.520> what<00:04:35.610> they're<00:04:35.729> doing

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
Acura is they know what they're doing

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.640 
Acura is they know what they're doing
they<00:04:36.180> send<00:04:36.690> these<00:04:36.780> cars<00:04:37.020> out<00:04:37.139> to<00:04:37.320> in<00:04:37.380> pretty

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
they send these cars out to in pretty

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.670 
they send these cars out to in pretty
well<00:04:37.800> so<00:04:38.550> with<00:04:39.539> this<00:04:39.690> kind<00:04:39.900> of<00:04:40.020> game<00:04:40.410> that's

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
well so with this kind of game that's

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:50.340 
well so with this kind of game that's
that's<00:04:41.160> pretty<00:04:41.400> good<00:04:41.490> work

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.410
