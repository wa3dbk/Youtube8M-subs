00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
reveal in the actual novels people who

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.149 
reveal in the actual novels people who
have<00:02:01.200> read<00:02:01.380> them<00:02:01.500> would<00:02:01.619> probably<00:02:01.649> know<00:02:01.979> more

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
have read them would probably know more

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.459 
have read them would probably know more
than<00:02:02.280> me<00:02:02.430> but<00:02:02.939> anyway<00:02:03.240> just<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.840> prospects<00:02:04.350> of

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
than me but anyway just the prospects of

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.749 
than me but anyway just the prospects of
that<00:02:04.530> plus<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.219> fact<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.490> we<00:02:05.549> could<00:02:05.700> be

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
that plus the fact that we could be

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.760 
that plus the fact that we could be
getting<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.030> W<00:02:06.390> OVA<00:02:06.689> kits<00:02:06.990> all<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
getting the W OVA kits all of the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.710 
getting the W OVA kits all of the
prospects<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.369> can<00:02:08.610> see<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.849> bad<00:02:09.090> one<00:02:09.300> amongst

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
prospects I can see a bad one amongst

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.020 
prospects I can see a bad one amongst
them<00:02:09.770> so<00:02:10.770> that's<00:02:10.950> my<00:02:11.129> speculation<00:02:11.400> so<00:02:11.940> why

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
them so that's my speculation so why

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.760 
them so that's my speculation so why
don't<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.209> let<00:02:12.360> me<00:02:12.420> know<00:02:12.450> with<00:02:12.629> the

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
don't you let me know with the

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:13.960 
don't you let me know with the
comment<00:02:13.040> down<00:02:13.130> below<00:02:13.280> about<00:02:13.400> your

comment down below about your

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.760 
comment down below about your
speculation<00:02:14.750> is<00:02:14.870> it<00:02:14.900> going<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.230> be<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.440> OVA

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
speculation is it going to be the OVA

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.770 
speculation is it going to be the OVA

going to be the capstone to this whole

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.980 
going to be the capstone to this whole
wing<00:02:25.400> explosion<00:02:25.970> they'll<00:02:26.510> do<00:02:26.690> absolutely

everything else in Master Grade and then

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:29.710 
everything else in Master Grade and then
that'll<00:02:29.060> be<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.240> last

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
that'll be the last

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.450 
that'll be the last
anyway<00:02:30.230> they<00:02:30.410> sort<00:02:30.650> of<00:02:30.680> kick<00:02:30.860> things<00:02:31.070> off<00:02:31.220> with

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
anyway they sort of kick things off with

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.070 
anyway they sort of kick things off with
