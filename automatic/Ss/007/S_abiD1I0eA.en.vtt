some ways because i think that you know
we're<00:00:45.899> talk<00:00:46.140> about<00:00:46.379> this<00:00:46.469> on<00:00:46.649> tyt<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.309> but<00:00:47.969> uh

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
we're talk about this on tyt you but uh

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.080 
we're talk about this on tyt you but uh
about<00:00:48.800> twenty<00:00:49.800> percent<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.610> people<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:51.000> the

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
about twenty percent of people in the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.970 
about twenty percent of people in the
united<00:00:51.449> states<00:00:51.480> have<00:00:52.199> no<00:00:52.440> religious

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
united states have no religious

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.830 
united states have no religious
affiliation<00:00:53.100> yet<00:00:54.030> right<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.420> people<00:00:54.750> are

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
affiliation yet right so people are

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.580 
affiliation yet right so people are
starting<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.230> increasingly<00:00:55.980> reject<00:00:56.789> uh

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
starting to increasingly reject uh

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.650 
starting to increasingly reject uh
religion<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.829> i<00:00:59.039> think<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.520> part<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.539> the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
religion and i think that part of the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.029 
religion and i think that part of the
reason<00:01:00.690> why<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.109> because<00:01:01.260> people<00:01:01.530> are<00:01:01.859> using

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
reason why is because people are using

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.070 
reason why is because people are using
religion<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.579> dictate<00:01:03.059> our<00:01:03.180> lives<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.870> now<00:01:04.019> we

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
religion to dictate our lives and now we

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.080 
religion to dictate our lives and now we
have<00:01:04.290> some<00:01:05.040> churches<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.519> are<00:01:05.580> speaking<00:01:05.970> out

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
have some churches that are speaking out

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.399 
have some churches that are speaking out
against<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.630> think<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.110> good<00:01:07.229> thing

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
against that I think it's a good thing

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.120 
Christianity that's perfectly fine but
when<00:01:43.140> they're<00:01:43.290> doing<00:01:43.409> something<00:01:43.530> like<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:43.950> I

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
when they're doing something like this I

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.800 
when they're doing something like this I
can't<00:01:44.310> help<00:01:44.399> but<00:01:44.490> think<00:01:44.610> if<00:01:45.180> not<00:01:45.540> for<00:01:45.750> the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
can't help but think if not for the

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.969 
can't help but think if not for the
churches<00:01:46.170> we<00:01:46.320> wouldn't<00:01:46.530> be<00:01:46.590> having<00:01:46.740> this

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
churches we wouldn't be having this

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.859 
churches we wouldn't be having this
conversation<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.700> begin<00:01:47.790> with<00:01:48.060> like<00:01:48.689> they're

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
conversation to begin with like they're

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.590 
conversation to begin with like they're
doing<00:01:49.110> what<00:01:49.229> they<00:01:49.350> can<00:01:50.240> but<00:01:51.240> they're<00:01:51.509> still

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
doing what they can but they're still

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.630 
doing what they can but they're still
the<00:01:51.960> cause<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.530> problem<00:01:52.979> not<00:01:53.310> these<00:01:53.430> guys

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
the cause of the problem not these guys

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.940 
the cause of the problem not these guys
individually<00:01:53.909> but<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:55.049> deity<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.770> they

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
individually but the the deity that they

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.830 
individually but the the deity that they
purport<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.369> represent<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.119> get<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.630> get<00:01:57.689> it

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
purport to represent I get it I get it

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.300 
purport to represent I get it I get it
but<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.110> reason<00:01:58.259> why<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.560> think<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.950> story<00:01:59.250> is

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
but the reason why I think the story is

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.340 
but the reason why I think the story is
important<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.000> because<00:02:00.030> there<00:02:00.540> are<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.750> ton<00:02:01.290> of

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
important is because there are a ton of

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.380 
important is because there are a ton of
religious<00:02:01.890> people<00:02:02.189> out<00:02:02.340> there<00:02:02.579> uh<00:02:02.880> that
