original<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.550> fixture<00:00:57.260> the<00:00:58.260> only<00:00:58.500> thing

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
original to this fixture the only thing

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.950 
original to this fixture the only thing
that<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.010> not<00:00:59.160> original<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.820> this<00:01:00.120> fixture<00:01:00.539> is

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
that is not original to this fixture is

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.600 
that is not original to this fixture is
the<00:01:01.739> cord<00:01:02.070> coming<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.300> bulb<00:01:04.309> well<00:01:05.309> I

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
the cord coming in and the bulb well I

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.050 
the cord coming in and the bulb well I
guess<00:01:06.210> we'll<00:01:06.479> close<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.229> back<00:01:07.590> up<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:08.070> turn<00:01:08.880> it

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
guess we'll close it back up and turn it

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.899 
guess we'll close it back up and turn it
on<00:01:10.010> so<00:01:11.010> we'll<00:01:11.400> put<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.760> back<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.270> here<00:01:13.909> close

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
on so we'll put this back in here close

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.600 
on so we'll put this back in here close
it<00:01:14.939> up<00:01:15.299> now<00:01:16.110> will<00:01:16.470> shut<00:01:16.680> off<00:01:16.710> some<00:01:17.189> lights<00:01:17.430> here

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
it up now will shut off some lights here

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.539 
it up now will shut off some lights here
so<00:01:18.530> we<00:01:19.530> can<00:01:19.770> see<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.130> turning<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:22.189> and<00:01:23.189> we'll

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
so we can see it turning on and we'll

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.690 
so we can see it turning on and we'll
plug<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:24.000> in<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.450> here<00:01:25.350> we<00:01:25.619> go

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.709 

it<00:01:30.270> has<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.509> coded<00:01:31.170> bulb<00:01:31.439> in<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:32.450> that's<00:01:33.450> where

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719 
it has a coded bulb in it that's where

00:01:33.719 --> 00:02:22.960 
it has a coded bulb in it that's where
it<00:01:33.810> gets<00:01:33.960> its<00:01:34.229> pinkish<00:01:34.770> color

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.420 

we<00:02:23.510> won't<00:02:23.750> show<00:02:24.020> it<00:02:24.170> turning<00:02:24.560> on<00:02:24.680> all<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.010> way

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
we won't show it turning on all the way

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.350 
we won't show it turning on all the way
but<00:02:26.150> anyways<00:02:27.050> this<00:02:27.650> is<00:02:27.860> my<00:02:28.070> Hall<00:02:28.340> of<00:02:28.490> Fame<00:02:28.670> 100
