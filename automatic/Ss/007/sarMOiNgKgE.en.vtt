00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:15.500
 the microphone is fine there so let's 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:19.650
 pull out on the blood like that we all pulled out 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:25.560
 we put here a gram of it so give 18 watts 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:30.240
 hand and in general photo microphone by the way 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:33.630
 iron if that so fixing 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.590
 look here i mean i put it like this 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:40.200
 him and in general now we will do it all 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.590
 so guys in general there just now 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:47.810
 in fact we are a little confused but it 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:51.660
 everything was here look here such here 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:54.270
 we fix in general here it was 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:59.910
 Included in here that is this one 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:02.370
 connector and it didnâ€™t fit in 30 but it is input 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.769
 adapter for something they didn't know but 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.290
 it is set so that it has a 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.930
 adapter not know what it is in general 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.340
 Now I will screw the article 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:16.410
 microphone boat legs and in general it 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:19.520
 so continue so here I screwed you 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:23.290
 I screwed look 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:26.470
 pretty beautiful cutout looks yes and by 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.840
 characteristics of the model is not bad 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:33.020
 works by the way on the box did not look 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.320
 and if the characteristics are in general, I think 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.890
 I characteristics of Sunu laid upon 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.340
 video 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.890
 Vegas code dismantle just dressed 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.100
 the characteristics will appear on the screen 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.220
 the main thing is not to forget so I think on this 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.930
 moment of the characteristics do so 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.720
 let's see what can be old 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.290
 you can tilt it 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.960
 principle as you like, even so 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.360
 though even so brazenly push that is, those 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.190
 scratch nothing 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.460
 look how you want to twist so general that 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.500
 because if something is wrong there is 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:14.750
 shaking the camera there may be faltering or 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:15.920
 what else grief do this first 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.200
 video on this 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.090
 such a plan in general, yes and in 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.070
 Further, such videos are unlikely to be 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.820
 yes even if they are very, very 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:29.540
 Rarely because I do not know that I will soon 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.850
 I can only buy a computer 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:35.680
 computer and I will survey no more 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:39.290
 that, in general, all good luck to all so far 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:43.030
 subscribe to the channel there sat luck 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.030
 all this microphone
