00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
in a hopper and and gives you a dropper

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.149 
in a hopper and and gives you a dropper
oh<00:01:26.450> poor<00:01:27.450> dropper<00:01:27.990> well<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.770> could<00:01:28.890> argue

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
oh poor dropper well you could argue

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
could do with other blocks already but

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.160 
could do with other blocks already but
still<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.399> nice<00:01:50.670> addition<00:01:51.000> make<00:01:51.780> things<00:01:52.049> a
