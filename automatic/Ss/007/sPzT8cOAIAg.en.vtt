00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.300
Well now you say you've found another man ...

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.400
... who does things to you that I can't

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.900
And that no matter what I do it's all over now

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.120
between me and you girl

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.820
I can't believe what you say

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.520
No I can't believe what you say

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:41.940
'cause darling

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.080
I don't wanna fade away

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.860
Oh darlin' I don't wanna fade away

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.560

Cause darlin' I don't wanna fade away

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.900
Well now you say that you've made up your mind it's ...

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.200
... been such a long, long time since it's been good with us

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.960
And somewhere back along the line ...

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.820
... I lost your love ...

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.500
... I lost your trust

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.640
Now rooms that once were so bright ...

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.580
... are filled with the coming night,

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.500
and darlin'

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.600
I don't wanna fade away

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.480

Cause darlin' I don't wanna fade away

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.020
You say it's not easy for you

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.920
And that you've been so lonely

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.160
While other girls go out ...

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.740
... doing what they want to do

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.960
You say that you miss the nights ...

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.220
... when we'd go out dancing

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.520
You miss the days when you and I walked as two

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.200
Well girl I miss them too

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.100
Oh I swear that I do

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.220
Oh darlin'

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.400
Now baby I don't wanna be just another useless memory ...

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.800
... holding you tight

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.400
Or just some other ghost out on the street  ...

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.100
.... to whom you stop and politely speak

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.720
when you pass on by ...

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.600
... vanishing into the night

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.860
left to vanish into the night

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.700
Oh darlin'

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.000
I don't wanna fade away

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.700
No darlin' I don't wanna fade away

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.460

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.940

Cause darlin' I don't wanna fade away

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.660
Don't make me darling

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.200
Don't make me darling

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.260
