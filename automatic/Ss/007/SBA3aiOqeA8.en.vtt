still<00:03:35.459> kill<00:03:35.640> me<00:03:35.790> but<00:03:36.570> if<00:03:36.690> I<00:03:36.780> fill<00:03:36.959> up<00:03:36.989> my<00:03:37.140> meter

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
still kill me but if I fill up my meter

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.290 
still kill me but if I fill up my meter
enough<00:03:37.680> I<00:03:37.980> could<00:03:38.489> do<00:03:38.550> a<00:03:38.580> special<00:03:38.970> technique

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
enough I could do a special technique

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.720 
unique techniques one on the ground one
in<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:15.989> air<00:04:16.109> they<00:04:16.650> have<00:04:16.769> varying<00:04:17.160> costs<00:04:17.609> but

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
in the air they have varying costs but

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.030 
in the air they have varying costs but
they<00:04:17.850> add<00:04:17.940> a<00:04:17.970> lot<00:04:18.209> of<00:04:18.269> flavor<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:19.230> the<00:04:19.320> game<00:04:19.500> in

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
the original we had

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.870 
the original we had
two<00:04:21.660> complaints<00:04:22.220> that<00:04:23.220> people<00:04:23.730> thought

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
two complaints that people thought

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.460 
two complaints that people thought
diving<00:04:24.240> kick<00:04:24.390> were<00:04:24.480> the<00:04:24.600> same<00:04:24.750> character<00:04:25.200> but

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
diving kick were the same character but

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.200 
diving kick were the same character but
they<00:04:25.560> were<00:04:25.620> very<00:04:25.680> very<00:04:25.920> different<00:04:26.550> now<00:04:27.000> it's

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
they were very very different now it's

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.610 
they were very very different now it's
even<00:04:27.330> more<00:04:27.690> obvious<00:04:28.080> that<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.290> different

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
even more obvious that the different

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.370 
even more obvious that the different
because<00:04:28.770> they<00:04:28.890> don't<00:04:29.040> even<00:04:29.130> share<00:04:29.400> techniques

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
because they don't even share techniques

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:41.270 
because they don't even share techniques
it's<00:04:31.380> very<00:04:31.530> cool<00:04:40.010> we're<00:04:41.010> adding<00:04:41.250> more
