tic-tac-toe really fun way to play
tic-tac-toe<00:02:25.050> if<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.410> guys<00:02:25.560> both<00:02:25.950> have<00:02:25.980> emoji

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
tic-tac-toe if you guys both have emoji

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.150 
tic-tac-toe if you guys both have emoji
even<00:02:27.330> if<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.540> don't<00:02:27.870> both<00:02:28.170> have<00:02:28.200> emoji<00:02:28.950> they

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
even if you don't both have emoji they

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.530 
even if you don't both have emoji they
can<00:02:29.310> just<00:02:29.520> use<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.910> regular<00:02:29.940> keyboard

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
can just use the regular keyboard

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.210 
can just use the regular keyboard
because<00:02:30.900> they'll<00:02:31.230> still<00:02:31.500> be<00:02:31.530> able<00:02:31.770> to<00:02:31.890> receive

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
because they'll still be able to receive

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.640 
because they'll still be able to receive
the<00:02:32.430> emoji<00:02:32.910> so<00:02:33.360> they<00:02:33.630> can<00:02:33.780> go<00:02:33.930> ahead<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:34.230> just

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
the emoji so they can go ahead and just

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.220 
the emoji so they can go ahead and just
put<00:02:34.740> a<00:02:34.920> regular<00:02:35.400> X<00:02:35.670> or<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.000> regular<00:02:36.690> oh<00:02:36.900> they're

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
put a regular X or a regular oh they're

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.530 
put a regular X or a regular oh they're
so<00:02:37.680> if<00:02:38.160> they<00:02:38.190> didn't<00:02:38.610> have<00:02:38.700> emoji<00:02:39.240> you<00:02:39.270> can

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
so if they didn't have emoji you can

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.570 
so if they didn't have emoji you can
just<00:02:39.750> go<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.020> regular<00:02:40.170> keyboard<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:41.010> to

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
just go to the regular keyboard and to

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.210 
just go to the regular keyboard and to
put<00:02:41.790> something<00:02:42.060> like<00:02:42.300> an<00:02:42.900> 0<00:02:43.140> there<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:44.160> know
