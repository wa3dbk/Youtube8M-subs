tablespoon of vanilla extract and i have
three<00:01:06.390> cups<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.869> flour<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.799> I've<00:01:07.979> sifted

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
three cups of flour that I've sifted

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.570 
three cups of flour that I've sifted
before<00:01:09.030> measuring<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.780> also<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.470> teaspoon<00:01:11.340> of

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
before measuring and also a teaspoon of

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.550 
before measuring and also a teaspoon of
baking<00:01:11.760> soda<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.990> reason<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.320> want<00:01:13.500> to

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
baking soda so the reason you want to

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.399 
baking soda so the reason you want to
sift<00:01:14.130> your<00:01:14.640> flour<00:01:14.700> before<00:01:15.570> measuring<00:01:16.080> is

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
sift your flour before measuring is

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.990 
sift your flour before measuring is
because<00:01:16.710> if<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.070> just<00:01:17.280> scoop<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.640> right<00:01:17.700> out

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
because if you just scoop it right out

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.300 
because if you just scoop it right out
you<00:01:18.240> can<00:01:18.420> have<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.840> lot<00:01:19.409> more<00:01:19.590> flour<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.250> your

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
you can have a lot more flour in your

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.520 
you can have a lot more flour in your
measuring<00:01:20.759> cup<00:01:21.030> than<00:01:21.240> if<00:01:21.390> you've<00:01:21.570> lightly

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
measuring cup than if you've lightly

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.490 
measuring cup than if you've lightly
sifted<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.670> it's<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.780> really<00:01:24.960> different

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
sifted it in so it's a really different

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.830 
sifted it in so it's a really different
end<00:01:25.830> result<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.119> tools<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.570> will

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
end result so the tools that will

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.960 
end result so the tools that will
actually<00:01:28.020> be<00:01:28.320> using<00:01:28.740> I'm<00:01:29.430> going<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.759> be<00:01:29.850> using

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
actually be using I'm going to be using

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.960 
actually be using I'm going to be using
a<00:01:30.509> stand<00:01:30.900> mixer<00:01:31.100> you<00:01:32.100> can<00:01:32.220> also<00:01:32.369> use<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.670> hand

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
a stand mixer you can also use a hand

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.789 
a stand mixer you can also use a hand
mixer<00:01:33.060> if<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.630> want<00:01:33.869> that's<00:01:34.470> kind<00:01:34.740> of

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
mixer if you want that's kind of

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.069 
mixer if you want that's kind of
important<00:01:35.310> for<00:01:35.790> creaming<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.750> butter<00:01:36.780> and

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
important for creaming the butter and

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.960 
important for creaming the butter and
sugar<00:01:37.229> together<00:01:37.619> because<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.250> need<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> really

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
sugar together because you need a really

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.140 
sugar together because you need a really
