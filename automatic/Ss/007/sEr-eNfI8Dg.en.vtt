open the top of this and unhook this
piece<00:00:32.610> here<00:00:32.850> which<00:00:33.030> I've<00:00:33.210> already<00:00:33.540> unhooked

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
piece here which I've already unhooked

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.950 
piece here which I've already unhooked
and<00:00:34.350> take<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.370> off<00:00:35.520> now<00:00:36.180> if<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.480> look<00:00:36.660> at<00:00:36.780> your

and take it off now if you look at your

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.139 
and take it off now if you look at your
machine<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.590> pretty<00:00:37.890> much<00:00:38.040> tells<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.550> how<00:00:38.820> it

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
machine it pretty much tells you how it

that<00:00:42.719> are<00:00:42.870> printed<00:00:43.230> on<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.500> machine<00:00:44.000> and<00:00:45.000> so

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
that are printed on the machine and so

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.529 
that are printed on the machine and so
this<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.750> where<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.289> roll<00:00:46.920> goes<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:48.390> see

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
this is where the roll goes and you see

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.470 
this is where the roll goes and you see
the<00:00:48.660> first<00:00:48.840> arrow<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.649> right<00:00:50.160> here<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:50.940> you

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
the first arrow is right here so you

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.760 
the first arrow is right here so you
need<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.750> make<00:00:51.899> sure<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.410> tape<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.739> going

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
need to make sure that the tape is going

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.330 
need to make sure that the tape is going
that<00:00:53.070> direction<00:00:53.449> just<00:00:54.449> put<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.750> on<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.350> clip

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
that direction just put it on and clip

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.650 
that direction just put it on and clip
it<00:00:56.460> into<00:00:56.579> place<00:00:56.910> okay<00:00:58.010> now<00:00:59.010> it's<00:00:59.969> showing<00:01:00.390> you

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
it into place okay now it's showing you

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.250 
it into place okay now it's showing you
here<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.559> go<00:01:01.739> here<00:01:02.449> then<00:01:03.449> over<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.840> roll<00:01:03.989> and

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
here to go here then over the roll and

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.770 
here to go here then over the roll and
then<00:01:04.350> there's<00:01:04.530> another<00:01:04.650> arrow<00:01:05.100> here<00:01:05.720> now<00:01:06.720> to

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
then there's another arrow here now to

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.590 
then there's another arrow here now to
make<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:08.070> spool<00:01:08.460> release<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.240> will<00:01:09.390> move

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
make the spool release so it will move

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.080 
make the spool release so it will move
you<00:01:09.960> can<00:01:10.140> just<00:01:10.290> hold<00:01:10.560> down<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.890> trigger<00:01:11.070> C<00:01:11.970> and

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
you can just hold down the trigger C and

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.510 
you can just hold down the trigger C and
that'll<00:01:12.299> make<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.450> move<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:14.430> I'm

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
that'll make it move and so I'm

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.880 
that'll make it move and so I'm
following<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.330> arrows<00:01:15.750> now<00:01:16.530> when<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.770> goes

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
following the arrows now when it goes

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.520 
following the arrows now when it goes
around<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.310> way<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:18.570> arrow<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:19.020> coming<00:01:19.320> back

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
around this way the arrow is coming back

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.490 
around this way the arrow is coming back
here<00:01:19.950> here's<00:01:20.189> another<00:01:20.280> arrow<00:01:20.960> and<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.320> is

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
here here's another arrow and that is

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.749 
here here's another arrow and that is
leading<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.009> over<00:01:23.400> here<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:25.369> the<00:01:26.369> ending

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
leading you over here to the the ending

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:27.260 
leading you over here to the the ending
spool

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
spool

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.319 
spool
now<00:01:28.080> there's<00:01:28.320> two<00:01:29.009> notches<00:01:29.250> here<00:01:29.850> on<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.090> side

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
now there's two notches here on the side

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.569 
now there's two notches here on the side
which<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.869> where<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.259> black<00:01:31.770> piece<00:01:32.070> fits<00:01:32.340> in

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
which is where that black piece fits in

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.810 
which is where that black piece fits in
and<00:01:33.000> then<00:01:33.390> there's<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:34.130> piece<00:01:35.130> here<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.670> has

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
and then there's a piece here that has

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.710 
and then there's a piece here that has
two<00:01:36.119> sides<00:01:36.150> notched<00:01:36.930> out<00:01:38.299> and<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.390> need<00:01:39.540> to

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
two sides notched out and you need to

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.630 
two sides notched out and you need to
get<00:01:40.590> enough<00:01:40.890> tape<00:01:42.740> so<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:44.070> can<00:01:44.250> put<00:01:44.460> this

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
get enough tape so that you can put this

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.499 
get enough tape so that you can put this
in<00:01:45.380> that<00:01:46.380> notched<00:01:46.680> thing<00:01:47.579> like<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:48.390> help

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
in that notched thing like that to help

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.080 
in that notched thing like that to help
hold<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.840> down<00:01:49.549> and<00:01:50.549> usually<00:01:50.850> there's<00:01:51.030> a

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
hold it down and usually there's a

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.539 
hold it down and usually there's a
little<00:01:51.360> bit<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.540> sticky<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.140> end<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:53.399> I

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
little bit of sticky on the end and I

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.969 
little bit of sticky on the end and I
use<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.840> wrap<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.200> around<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.619> kind<00:01:55.860> of

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
use that to wrap it around and kind of

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.039 
use that to wrap it around and kind of
stick<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.430> down<00:01:56.729> like<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:58.040> okay<00:01:59.040> now<00:02:00.049> holding
