two years arise so that does help a lot

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.290 
two years arise so that does help a lot
as<00:02:20.220> far<00:02:20.280> as<00:02:20.490> how<00:02:20.670> we're<00:02:20.820> gonna<00:02:20.910> train<00:02:21.180> our

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
as far as how we're gonna train our

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.309 
as far as how we're gonna train our
offensive<00:02:21.780> player<00:02:22.020> skill<00:02:22.500> in<00:02:22.710> front<00:02:23.040> seven<00:02:23.430> so

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
offensive player skill in front seven so

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.470 
offensive player skill in front seven so
I<00:02:28.219> guess<00:02:29.219> it's<00:02:29.400> probably<00:02:29.489> more<00:02:29.760> terminology

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
I guess it's probably more terminology

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.619 
I guess it's probably more terminology
for<00:02:30.599> the<00:02:30.719> kids<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.260> technique<00:02:32.030> that<00:02:33.030> process

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
for the kids and technique that process

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.199 
for the kids and technique that process
is<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:33.810> little<00:02:33.989> bit<00:02:34.700> you<00:02:35.700> know<00:02:35.730> when<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.090> talk

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
is a little bit you know when you talk

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.729 
is a little bit you know when you talk
about<00:02:36.420> transition<00:02:36.989> that's<00:02:37.140> that's<00:02:37.469> things

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
about transition that's that's things

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.080 
about transition that's that's things

first got here that Tuesday morning that
you<00:02:44.069> know<00:02:44.189> we're<00:02:44.640> gonna<00:02:44.760> learn<00:02:45.000> together

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
you know we're gonna learn together

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.259 
you know we're gonna learn together

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
we're gonna work together we're gonna

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.170 
we're gonna work together we're gonna
earn<00:02:48.480> each<00:02:48.599> other's<00:02:48.930> respect<00:02:49.349> and<00:02:49.560> Trust<00:02:50.180> and

earn each other's respect and Trust and

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.410 
earn each other's respect and Trust and
that's<00:02:51.480> kind<00:02:51.720> of<00:02:51.750> a<00:02:51.930> you<00:02:52.139> know<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.260> mutual<00:02:52.620> deal

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
that's kind of a you know a mutual deal

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.000 
that's kind of a you know a mutual deal
but<00:02:54.420> that<00:02:54.569> is<00:02:54.750> you<00:02:55.109> know<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.500> think<00:02:55.709> the

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
but that is you know I think the

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.369 
but that is you know I think the
transition<00:02:56.489> is<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:57.450> teaching<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:57.989> guys<00:02:58.139> the

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
transition is is teaching the guys the

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.710 
transition is is teaching the guys the
way<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.680> we<00:02:58.829> want<00:02:59.040> it<00:02:59.129> done<00:02:59.299> the<00:03:00.299> tempo<00:03:00.689> that

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
way that we want it done the tempo that

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.929 
way that we want it done the tempo that
we<00:03:00.959> want<00:03:01.170> it<00:03:01.290> done<00:03:01.470> effort<00:03:02.370> levels<00:03:02.730> what<00:03:02.909> we

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939 
we want it done effort levels what we

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:04.879 
we want it done effort levels what we
have<00:03:03.450> no<00:03:03.629> expectations<00:03:04.409> things<00:03:04.590> like<00:03:04.739> that

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
have no expectations things like that

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.250 
have no expectations things like that
and<00:03:05.069> then<00:03:05.220> just<00:03:05.879> a<00:03:05.970> technique<00:03:06.359> that<00:03:06.389> I<00:03:06.569> that<00:03:07.079> we

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.630 
wanted to work on a little bit more
speed<00:04:08.010> work<00:04:08.310> and<00:04:09.209> mobility<00:04:10.370> and<00:04:11.370> then<00:04:11.489> there's

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
speed work and mobility and then there's

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.039 
speed work and mobility and then there's
a<00:04:11.700> few<00:04:11.849> guys<00:04:12.000> we<00:04:12.209> got<00:04:12.329> to<00:04:12.420> cut<00:04:12.540> some<00:04:12.629> weight<00:04:12.870> off

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
a few guys we got to cut some weight off

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.740 
a few guys we got to cut some weight off
of<00:04:13.079> things<00:04:13.560> like<00:04:13.769> that<00:04:13.980> and<00:04:14.220> then<00:04:14.750> really

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
of things like that and then really

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.719 
of things like that and then really
wanted<00:04:16.109> to<00:04:16.199> work<00:04:16.350> on<00:04:16.620> you<00:04:17.070> know<00:04:17.130> first<00:04:17.519> step

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
wanted to work on you know first step

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.340 
wanted to work on you know first step
acceleration<00:04:18.449> stuff<00:04:18.660> right<00:04:18.840> now<00:04:18.989> with<00:04:19.169> them

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
acceleration stuff right now with them

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.820 
acceleration stuff right now with them
and<00:04:19.500> some<00:04:19.919> just<00:04:20.579> some<00:04:20.729> mechanics<00:04:21.269> of

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
and some just some mechanics of

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.590 
and some just some mechanics of
acceleration<00:04:22.830> phases<00:04:23.340> that<00:04:23.550> that<00:04:24.210> we<00:04:24.360> felt

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
acceleration phases that that we felt

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.650 
acceleration phases that that we felt
like<00:04:24.720> that<00:04:24.990> we<00:04:25.410> needed<00:04:25.560> to<00:04:25.710> work<00:04:25.979> on<00:04:26.190> and<00:04:27.180> then

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
like that we needed to work on and then

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.969 
like that we needed to work on and then
the<00:04:27.780> weight<00:04:27.900> room<00:04:28.080> wise<00:04:28.320> we<00:04:28.560> just<00:04:28.740> we<00:04:28.949> just

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
the weight room wise we just we just

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:31.150 
the weight room wise we just we just
wanted<00:04:29.340> to<00:04:29.460> clean<00:04:29.639> up<00:04:29.789> some<00:04:29.940> technique<00:04:30.360> and

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
wanted to clean up some technique and

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.629 
wanted to clean up some technique and
just<00:04:32.160> doing<00:04:32.550> it<00:04:32.639> doing<00:04:32.940> it<00:04:33.060> our<00:04:33.240> way<00:04:33.270> and<00:04:34.639> that

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
just doing it doing it our way and that

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.159 
just doing it doing it our way and that
was<00:04:35.789> that's<00:04:36.090> really<00:04:36.419> what<00:04:36.539> kind<00:04:36.660> of<00:04:36.690> a<00:04:36.780> Ron<00:04:36.960> so

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
was that's really what kind of a Ron so

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.140 
was that's really what kind of a Ron so
right<00:04:37.350> now<00:04:37.530> I<00:04:37.560> mean<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:37.919> guys<00:04:38.100> are<00:04:38.400> on<00:04:39.120> a

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
right now I mean the guys are on a

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
as a day to day work so as we change

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.730 
as a day to day work so as we change
into<00:05:33.360> spring<00:05:33.750> ball<00:05:33.960> we<00:05:34.110> change<00:05:34.380> a<00:05:34.500> little<00:05:34.560> bit

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
into spring ball we change a little bit

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.290 
into spring ball we change a little bit
transition<00:05:35.250> wise<00:05:35.370> as<00:05:35.580> far<00:05:35.639> as<00:05:35.820> an<00:05:35.880> end<00:05:36.000> season

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
transition wise as far as an end season

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.390 
transition wise as far as an end season
mode<00:05:36.479> and<00:05:36.659> then<00:05:36.750> we<00:05:36.780> go<00:05:36.930> into<00:05:37.080> summer<00:05:37.349> and<00:05:38.310> a

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
mode and then we go into summer and a

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.580 
mode and then we go into summer and a
preseason<00:05:38.880> we<00:05:39.630> start<00:05:39.900> doing<00:05:40.199> a<00:05:40.289> little<00:05:40.380> bit

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
preseason we start doing a little bit

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.260 
preseason we start doing a little bit
more<00:05:40.620> football<00:05:41.010> specific<00:05:41.610> movements<00:05:42.030> in<00:05:42.120> our

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
more football specific movements in our

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.000 
more football specific movements in our
speed<00:05:42.539> work<00:05:42.780> and<00:05:43.110> our<00:05:43.320> strength<00:05:43.650> and<00:05:43.770> plan

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
speed work and our strength and plan

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.399 
speed work and our strength and plan
changes<00:05:44.490> a<00:05:44.550> little<00:05:44.729> bit<00:05:44.849> so<00:05:45.240> that's<00:05:45.930> right<00:05:46.199> now

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:46.409 
changes a little bit so that's right now
