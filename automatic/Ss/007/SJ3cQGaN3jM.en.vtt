00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.260 

so<00:01:39.710> here's<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:40.040> Nexus<00:01:40.400> 5

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:53.160 

just<00:01:44.869> put<00:01:45.049> it<00:01:45.079> on<00:01:48.850> and<00:01:49.850> there<00:01:50.000> you<00:01:50.149> go<00:01:50.350> charge

just put it on and there you go charge

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.569 
just put it on and there you go charge
mix<00:01:54.170> a<00:01:54.259> little<00:01:54.409> jingle<00:01:55.119> there's<00:01:56.119> also<00:01:56.299> a<00:01:56.479> blue

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
mix a little jingle there's also a blue

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:02.620 
mix a little jingle there's also a blue
LED<00:01:58.579> light<00:01:59.200> that<00:02:00.200> flashes<00:02:01.210> let's<00:02:02.210> see<00:02:02.450> if<00:02:02.539> you

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630
