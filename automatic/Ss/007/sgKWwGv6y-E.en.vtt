00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
we get a fire are going with this thing

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.130 
we get a fire are going with this thing
so<00:02:37.800> first<00:02:38.760> of<00:02:38.940> all<00:02:39.060> we're<00:02:39.390> going<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.780> take<00:02:39.989> the

so first of all we're going to take the

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.490 
so first of all we're going to take the
piston<00:02:40.709> apart<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.670> we<00:02:42.629> can<00:02:42.780> see<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.080> little

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
piston apart and we can see the little

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.400 
piston apart and we can see the little
o-ring<00:02:43.890> here<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.480> little<00:02:45.690> chamber<00:02:45.959> now

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
o-ring here and the little chamber now

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.059 
o-ring here and the little chamber now
these<00:02:46.590> are<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:47.069> essential<00:02:47.610> components<00:02:48.019> to

clearly you guys can see this here but
we're<00:03:03.150> talking<00:03:03.330> little<00:03:03.870> tiny<00:03:04.170> piece<00:03:04.530> I'm

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
we're talking little tiny piece I'm

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.410 
we're talking little tiny piece I'm
going<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:05.340> kind<00:03:05.489> of<00:03:05.550> roll<00:03:05.790> that<00:03:05.819> up<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.300> little

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
going to kind of roll that up a little

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
going to kind of roll that up a little
bit<00:03:06.860> put<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:07.980> inside<00:03:08.519> of<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:09.300> chamber<00:03:09.840> at<00:03:10.290> the

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
bit put it inside of the chamber at the

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.729 
bit put it inside of the chamber at the
end<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.739> piston<00:03:11.129> and<00:03:12.140> we're<00:03:13.140> ready<00:03:13.349> to<00:03:13.560> go

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
end of the piston and we're ready to go

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.400 
end of the piston and we're ready to go
the<00:03:14.129> only<00:03:14.299> thing<00:03:15.299> we<00:03:15.450> need<00:03:15.599> to<00:03:15.629> do<00:03:15.840> next<00:03:16.049> is<00:03:16.290> to

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
the only thing we need to do next is to

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.770 
the only thing we need to do next is to
actually<00:03:16.530> lubricate<00:03:17.310> this<00:03:17.489> ring<00:03:17.849> so<00:03:18.239> that<00:03:18.269> it

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
actually lubricate this ring so that it

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.289 
actually lubricate this ring so that it
doesn't<00:03:19.170> fell<00:03:19.379> and<00:03:19.739> it<00:03:20.069> slides<00:03:20.610> nice<00:03:21.000> and

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
doesn't fell and it slides nice and

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.900 
doesn't fell and it slides nice and
easily<00:03:21.510> down<00:03:21.959> that<00:03:22.260> chamber<00:03:22.890> now<00:03:23.489> you<00:03:23.549> can<00:03:23.790> do

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
easily down that chamber now you can do

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.770 
easily down that chamber now you can do
that<00:03:24.060> using<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.720> Vaseline<00:03:25.940> chopstick<00:03:26.940> which<00:03:27.630> is

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
that using a Vaseline chopstick which is

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.259 
that using a Vaseline chopstick which is
commonly<00:03:28.170> carried<00:03:28.380> in<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.680> field<00:03:28.950> or<00:03:29.640> good

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
commonly carried in the field or good

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.509 
commonly carried in the field or good
old<00:03:30.420> saliva<00:03:30.829> then<00:03:31.829> we're<00:03:32.040> going<00:03:32.160> to<00:03:32.190> go<00:03:32.370> the

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
old saliva then we're going to go the

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.539 
old saliva then we're going to go the
slava<00:03:32.910> route<00:03:33.660> here<00:03:33.989> so<00:03:34.650> just<00:03:34.829> lubricate<00:03:35.340> that

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
slava route here so just lubricate that

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:36.440 
slava route here so just lubricate that
up<00:03:35.700> a<00:03:35.819> little<00:03:35.910> bit

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
up a little bit

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.770 
up a little bit
and<00:03:37.200> we're<00:03:37.829> ready<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.250> go<00:03:38.430> we'll<00:03:39.150> insert<00:03:39.540> that

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
and we're ready to go we'll insert that

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.319 
and we're ready to go we'll insert that
into<00:03:40.019> the<00:03:40.170> chamber<00:03:41.120> get<00:03:42.120> it<00:03:42.239> seated<00:03:42.660> and<00:03:43.160> allow

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
into the chamber get it seated and allow

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.910 
into the chamber get it seated and allow
enough<00:03:45.329> room<00:03:45.989> here<00:03:46.019> so<00:03:46.290> we<00:03:46.500> get<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.739> full

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
enough room here so we get the full

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.160 
enough room here so we get the full
length<00:03:47.129> get<00:03:47.459> a<00:03:47.489> firm<00:03:47.910> grip<00:03:48.360> on<00:03:48.599> the<00:03:48.660> end<00:03:48.959> of<00:03:49.079> the

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
length get a firm grip on the end of the

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.660 
length get a firm grip on the end of the
cylinder<00:03:49.530> we're<00:03:50.129> going<00:03:50.280> to<00:03:50.340> give<00:03:50.459> this<00:03:50.610> a

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
cylinder we're going to give this a

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.089 
cylinder we're going to give this a
sharp<00:03:51.209> whack<00:03:51.599> and<00:03:52.049> what's<00:03:52.440> going<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.650> happen

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
sharp whack and what's going to happen

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.300 
sharp whack and what's going to happen
is<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:54.150> force<00:03:54.480> of<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:55.040> compression<00:03:56.040> the

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
is the force of the compression the

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.759 
is the force of the compression the
compressed<00:03:56.730> air<00:03:56.940> exactly<00:03:57.690> is<00:03:58.260> going<00:03:58.680> to

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
compressed air exactly is going to

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.190 
compressed air exactly is going to
create<00:03:59.130> enough<00:03:59.579> friction<00:03:59.850> enough<00:04:00.840> heat

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
create enough friction enough heat

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.559 
create enough friction enough heat
inside<00:04:01.709> here<00:04:02.069> to<00:04:02.280> actually<00:04:02.760> combust<00:04:03.209> and

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
inside here to actually combust and

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.680 
inside here to actually combust and
ignite<00:04:04.049> the<00:04:04.859> little<00:04:05.670> piece<00:04:05.790> of<00:04:05.940> char<00:04:06.150> cloth<00:04:06.359> on

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
ignite the little piece of char cloth on

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.059 
ignite the little piece of char cloth on
the<00:04:06.810> end<00:04:06.989> here<00:04:07.230> the<00:04:07.470> temperature<00:04:07.859> is<00:04:07.950> actually

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
the end here the temperature is actually

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.629 
the end here the temperature is actually
going<00:04:08.430> to<00:04:08.519> exceed<00:04:08.940> 500<00:04:09.900> degrees<00:04:10.340> just<00:04:11.340> by<00:04:11.489> that

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
going to exceed 500 degrees just by that

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.030 
going to exceed 500 degrees just by that
sharp<00:04:12.030> whack<00:04:12.329> in<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:13.079> friction<00:04:13.829> the

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
sharp whack in the friction the

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.039 
sharp whack in the friction the
compression<00:04:14.670> that's<00:04:14.819> created<00:04:15.329> so<00:04:15.780> let's<00:04:15.930> go

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
compression that's created so let's go

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.000 
compression that's created so let's go
ahead<00:04:16.169> and<00:04:16.289> try<00:04:16.530> this<00:04:16.590> out<00:04:16.889> here<00:04:18.829> all<00:04:19.829> right

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
ahead and try this out here all right

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.860 
ahead and try this out here all right
well<00:04:20.639> that<00:04:20.789> worked<00:04:21.030> we've<00:04:21.239> got<00:04:21.479> actually<00:04:21.720> got

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
voila we have fire now next step is with

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.660 
voila we have fire now next step is with
any<00:05:53.520> fire<00:05:54.110> just<00:05:55.110> go<00:05:55.290> ahead<00:05:55.470> and<00:05:55.620> put<00:05:55.800> some<00:05:56.070> nice

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:56.670 
any fire just go ahead and put some nice

any fire just go ahead and put some nice
dry<00:05:57.210> small<00:05:58.730> kindling<00:05:59.730> on<00:05:59.820> here<00:06:00.210> I've<00:06:01.080> got<00:06:01.230> some

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.350 
dry small kindling on here I've got some

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.710 
dry small kindling on here I've got some
super<00:06:01.740> dry<00:06:01.950> small<00:06:02.280> kindling<00:06:02.760> we're<00:06:03.540> going<00:06:03.660> to

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
super dry small kindling we're going to

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.970 
super dry small kindling we're going to
go<00:06:04.050> ahead<00:06:04.170> and<00:06:05.090> add<00:06:06.090> a<00:06:06.120> little<00:06:06.590> had<00:06:07.590> a<00:06:07.620> few<00:06:07.950> a

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
little bit bigger sticks or twigs I

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.690 
little bit bigger sticks or twigs I
guess<00:06:10.740> here<00:06:11.100> and<00:06:12.530> that<00:06:13.530> is<00:06:13.830> all<00:06:14.130> there<00:06:14.280> is<00:06:14.340> to

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
guess here and that is all there is to

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.490 
guess here and that is all there is to
it<00:06:14.820> we've<00:06:14.970> got<00:06:15.210> that<00:06:15.480> fire<00:06:15.780> she's<00:06:16.260> already

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 
it we've got that fire she's already

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.190 
it we've got that fire she's already
going<00:06:16.740> these<00:06:17.190> twigs<00:06:17.940> are<00:06:18.210> nice<00:06:18.420> and<00:06:18.660> dry<00:06:18.900> and

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:19.200 
going these twigs are nice and dry and

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.440 
going these twigs are nice and dry and
as<00:06:19.710> that<00:06:19.860> gets<00:06:20.100> going<00:06:20.700> a<00:06:20.910> little<00:06:21.120> bit<00:06:21.240> more

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450 
as that gets going a little bit more

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.690 
as that gets going a little bit more
here<00:06:21.720> we<00:06:21.990> can<00:06:22.230> proceed<00:06:22.650> to<00:06:22.710> adding<00:06:23.250> a<00:06:23.400> little

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:23.700 
here we can proceed to adding a little
