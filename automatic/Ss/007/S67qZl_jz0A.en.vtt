 plan introduction x post and also 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.859
 teach how to install it in kitkat or 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.420
 lower versions since this video 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.019
 what are you seeing right now is 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.029
 Exclusive for Android 5.0 and Android 5.1 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.189
 lollipop well the truth is that 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.950
 are having enough problems to the 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.140
 time to adapt x post to lollipop about 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.940
 all for the changes in art that is not the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.920
 same poster that there is in kitkat that at 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.960
 what's in lollipop as a virtual machine 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.180
 and this is costing them a lot but 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.329
 finally a month ago and something that 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.430
 the famous developer of robbery x 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.649
 got the first official version that yes 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.809
 that is still in alpha state is in 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.059
 the alpha version 2 for the devices 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.010
 have lollipop android in this little 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.870
 time that eba teams for lollipop 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.270
 Many of the 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.339
 modules that are now compatible with 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.540
 android lollipop very well androids 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.090
 let's take action 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.310
 as you know before installing x post was 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.200
 as easy as installing age pk del 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.910
 equipment installer but now before 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.830
 to do that we will have to flash 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.900
 from the recovery of your device 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.820
 the corresponding zip that you can 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.220
 find in the description here below 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.410
 from this same video that you will see that the 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.650
 file to flash depends on if you have 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.900
 Android 5.0 or Android 5.1 the new 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.940
 lori pop version so if the 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.320
 Your mobile processor is 32 bits and 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.479
 you're not running a rom based on 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.430
 tweets of refrigerators and lalin that you left 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.369
 here below the description and in the 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.890
 post of x from here below you will find the 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.050
 two things to install that is both the zip 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.150
 as the apec and once downloaded 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.220
 both files open your phone in the 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.170
 recovery mode that should be a custom 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.110
 recovery like for example how is this 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.390
 the case the team win recovery project w 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.740
 rp is always highly recommended and this time 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.930
 more because it is an alpha 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.700
 make a backup a copy of 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.110
 security of your data because 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.759
 to the minimum failure that may occur 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.369
 simply without any risk of anything 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.350
 JCE restores the backup one 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.690
 Once it is completed now, we will give it to 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.850
 install and will probably be within 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.250
 the 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.520
 download you will find the file that 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.410
 we downloaded the zip the x post sdk in 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.070
 arm here says the date this one in concrete 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:27.010
 It's 2015 as you see on April 30th 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.660
 we will give and confirm to flash that 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.850
 it will be a pretty quick process like 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.340
 you see and we just give redwood 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.780
 system when it has finished once 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.040
 has opened process that will take 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.140
 around two or three minutes 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.120
 We will have to go now to the apec 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.730
 to which we have downloaded the post 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.710
 install and we give you install once 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.320
 inside the equipment installer we will do 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.510
 click on framework we will accept the 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.000
 windows that will show us the 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.890
 friend and as you see says that you can only 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.870
 do the manual installation as it is one 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.480
 It would have been done and once we are here 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.550
 now we will give you a reboot and 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.100
 will do another reboot we give 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.540
 the permission of superuser very well then 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.640
 now that it has reopened if you go 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.170
 to x post install within the framework 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.510
 you will see that it has the same appearance 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.920
 before all this was in green 3 this 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.480
 does not mean that it has not been installed or 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.590
 much less in fact has been activated 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.330
 correctly 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.460
 for example you can go to download 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.550
 modules me for example right now 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.800
 this module the amplified that we can 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.890
 already directly activate and we go back to 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.600
 make a soft bounce a soft reset and 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.820
 once rebooted when we are going to open 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.040
 the application will ask us again for the 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.660
 root permissions we give you to save the 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.060
 selection and we'll see here is 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.200
 checking the x push checking the 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.210
 root that we obviously have it 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.040
 rooted and as you see everything is ready and 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.750
 has been done correctly so this 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.250
 it's all for today androids you know how 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.010
 install in a fairly simple way 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.540
