the<00:00:28.949> way<00:00:29.070> I'm<00:00:29.130> playing<00:00:29.340> with<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.550> capo<00:00:29.910> on<00:00:30.150> the

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
the way I'm playing with the capo on the

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.120 
the way I'm playing with the capo on the
2nd<00:00:30.869> fret<00:00:31.700> I<00:00:33.440> don't<00:00:34.440> think<00:00:34.620> I'll<00:00:34.739> plays<00:00:34.950> it

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
2nd fret I don't think I'll plays it

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.280 
2nd fret I don't think I'll plays it
like<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.399> but<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.820> just<00:00:35.899> got<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.930> cap<00:00:37.140> on

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
like that but I just got a cap on

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.250 
like that but I just got a cap on
because<00:00:37.610> I<00:00:38.780> find<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.870> easier<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.170> play

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
because I find it easier to play

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.720 
because I find it easier to play
slightly<00:00:40.890> higher<00:00:41.070> up<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.340> fret<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.640> the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
slightly higher up the fret and the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.400 
slightly higher up the fret and the
guitar<00:00:42.030> because<00:00:42.750> I've<00:00:42.870> been<00:00:43.079> playing<00:00:43.320> that

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
long but it's obviously just the same as

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.410 
long but it's obviously just the same as
playing<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.559> in<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.670> normal<00:00:47.969> place<00:00:48.090> but<00:00:48.390> just

string<00:02:12.750> on<00:02:12.989> each<00:02:13.590> finger<00:02:15.709> so<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:17.250> same<00:02:17.459> as<00:02:17.580> the

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
string on each finger so the same as the

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.490 
string on each finger so the same as the
second<00:02:18.090> chord<00:02:18.300> but<00:02:18.600> just<00:02:18.840> moving<00:02:18.959> out<00:02:19.290> one

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500

string<00:02:19.800> on<00:02:19.950> each<00:02:20.069> finger<00:02:20.870> giving<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:21.959> that

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
string on each finger giving you that

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:38.199 
string on each finger giving you that
one<00:02:22.730> say<00:02:23.730> goes

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.199 

and<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.360> last<00:02:39.510> chord<00:02:39.810> is<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:41.640> deal<00:02:42.060> without

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
and the last chord is the deal without

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.260 
and the last chord is the deal without
the<00:02:42.569> middle<00:02:42.930> finger<00:02:43.110> on<00:02:43.319> again<00:02:43.970> so<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.000> should

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
the middle finger on again so I should

00:02:45.270 --> 00:03:09.979 
the middle finger on again so I should
censor<00:02:45.480> it<00:03:05.959> does<00:03:06.959> that<00:03:07.110> twice<00:03:08.420> those<00:03:09.420> costs

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
censor it does that twice those costs

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.040 
censor it does that twice those costs
twice<00:03:10.260> for<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.650> verse<00:03:11.360> then<00:03:12.360> you<00:03:12.420> go<00:03:12.540> into<00:03:12.720> the

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
twice for the verse then you go into the

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.910 
twice for the verse then you go into the
the<00:03:13.440> little<00:03:15.350> intially<00:03:16.350> bit<00:03:16.590> whatever<00:03:16.769> you

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
the little intially bit whatever you

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.070 
the little intially bit whatever you
want<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.100> call<00:03:17.220> it<00:03:17.630> basically<00:03:18.630> it's<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:18.930> the

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
want to call it basically it's to the

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.559 
want to call it basically it's to the
same<00:03:19.290> chord<00:03:19.500> you've<00:03:19.650> already<00:03:19.739> used<00:03:20.420> so<00:03:21.420> it's

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
same chord you've already used so it's

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:28.640

away
why

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
why

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:31.820 
why
that<00:05:14.490> finger

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.040 

and<00:05:32.830> it's<00:05:33.280> something<00:05:33.520> that's<00:05:34.060> again<00:05:34.720> and<00:05:34.960> of

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
and it's something that's again and of

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.790 
and it's something that's again and of
course<00:05:36.090> and<00:05:37.090> that's<00:05:37.300> pretty<00:05:37.870> much<00:05:37.990> it<00:05:38.290> basics

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
course and that's pretty much it basics

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.230 
course and that's pretty much it basics
of<00:05:38.950> the<00:05:39.070> song<00:05:39.280> I<00:05:41.370> said<00:05:42.370> it's<00:05:42.580> the<00:05:42.760> acoustic

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
of the song I said it's the acoustic

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.490 
of the song I said it's the acoustic
versions<00:05:43.540> and<00:05:43.690> so<00:05:43.780> obviously<00:05:44.880> the<00:05:45.880> strumming

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
versions and so obviously the strumming

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.560 
versions and so obviously the strumming
obviously<00:05:47.500> you<00:05:47.560> can<00:05:47.680> play<00:05:47.860> around<00:05:47.950> with<00:05:48.190> them

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
obviously you can play around with them

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.790 
obviously you can play around with them
haven't<00:05:49.570> really<00:05:49.840> listened<00:05:50.200> that<00:05:50.410> hard<00:05:50.680> to

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
haven't really listened that hard to

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.730 
haven't really listened that hard to
have<00:05:50.950> no<00:05:51.130> place<00:05:51.490> that<00:05:51.520> with<00:05:52.030> the<00:05:52.120> strumming

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
have no place that with the strumming

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.560 
have no place that with the strumming
but<00:05:53.740> I<00:05:54.600> like<00:05:55.600> the<00:05:55.720> way<00:05:55.840> this<00:05:56.290> plays<00:05:56.530> like<00:05:56.710> that

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
but I like the way this plays like that

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.850 
but I like the way this plays like that
so<00:05:58.570> obviously<00:05:58.960> normally<00:05:59.350> as<00:05:59.440> I<00:05:59.560> said<00:05:59.710> I<00:05:59.740> think

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
so obviously normally as I said I think

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.010 
so obviously normally as I said I think
there's<00:06:00.250> you<00:06:00.430> haven't<00:06:00.730> got<00:06:00.820> a<00:06:00.850> cafe<00:06:01.240> on<00:06:01.870> the

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020
