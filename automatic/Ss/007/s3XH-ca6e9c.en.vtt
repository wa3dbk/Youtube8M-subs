00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 what's up with people on youtube we're here 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.790
 again on mac 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.560
 in my mac in hacking all as 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.080
 you want to say and I already told you in the 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.350
 previous video and good because today I come to you 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.360
 to do a tutorial on how 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.920
 of how to change the resolution so that 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.650
 do not see these black bars here 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:24.150
 is and is and to put our resolution 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.160
 of our screen is worth and well 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.770
 for that is the video yesterday's video 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.260
 to introduce you how to put the root already 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.420
 that you need to have the root to be able to 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.610
 do this so well I did it only 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.410
 for that and well then let's do it 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.370
 first thing we will do is go into 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.390
 the root user closed session 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.390
 we go into root 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.160
 [Music] 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.640
 and once we're here we're going to do what 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.010
 next we are going to open the finder 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.420
 and let's go to our best 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.190
 partition 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.559
 I think we sealed the partition this is not 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.489
 I think here is this is the name of the 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.560
 part 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.510
 now we go to extra 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.510
 extension and 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.330
 but it's worth no no no no we're going to extra and 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.990
 you are here we have not enter in 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.330
 this now 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.600
 this file with point by point wood 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.469
 next to list double-click law and we 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:29.250
 will is worth 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:32.280
 this line of code seems is xml 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.170
 now let's minimize the mac and let's 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.750
 give if you have intel now I will do the 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.090
 form for if you have intel 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.030
 and a modern computer and if not then 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.270
 I teach another way the first way is in 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.240
 the desk of something give right click 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:50.280
 and give graphics properties 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.920
 [Music] 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.380
 Now select the screen you have 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.010
 integrated or the position to which you want 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.510
 come on anybody the good one the one 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.210
 you are using voucher for the sea 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.710
 then here you will have the resolution the 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.060
 resolution that this bet if you see 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.990
 well because you have already set it 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.790
 from arts 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.180
 because the copy is somewhere once 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:17.710
 in that the other screen and go back to more 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:21.920
 It is worth once this is done we are going to change 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:27.200
 this and it is worth to imagine the 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:33.520
 resolutions 1366 x 768 so let's go to 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.520
 put here 1366 x 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.880
 768 on the 32th we leave it like this is not worth it 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:45.870
 touch now we close we keep 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:45.870
 and now we're going to pay more worth team 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.830
 and now I do not know how to remove it but 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:55.590
 place in a video if I get it closed 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.200
 we turn off the machine and it is worth it once 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.270
 this we will open cmd if you do not know 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.150
 how it is done you can go here good the 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.730
 start and you have to write cvd 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.019
 will come out of system symbol or if not 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.579
 you can click 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.760
 if you have a different operating system 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:15.120
 you can give the windows key already to 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:19.439
 true start button and when you run with 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.640
 this month, it's ok or you can press the 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:22.709
 Windows key which is what I do 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.090
 normally the windows key that is that 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.599
 that she is the left of the 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.750
 left and click and while the 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:32.730
 ejected blanket you give to the air and he 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.060
 this tab works with this 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:40.370
 e-mail and accept think it's worth here what 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:43.200
 I have now what we are going to do is 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.060
 find where we have installed virtual 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.939
 box is very important that you have it 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.739
 I'm sorry, I'll close it and now 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:51.540
 we search where you have installed virtual 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:55.739
 box, I'm going to have it today 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:58.079

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:03.069
 You are going to leave as I have

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.760
 you will have all put cd 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:18.500
 two-point bars 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:20.870

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.620
 we put cd virtual box 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:30.270
 and I'll leave you good directly we could 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:32.780
 put cd program this is the line 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.780
 that I will leave in the description 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.780
 program 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.629
 they go to oracle virtual bar 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.659
 you can not copy it or if you do not look 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:47.610
 the description and it will take you here vale 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:52.050
 now you are going to have to put a command 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:54.830
 we put a box of virtualbox we put 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:58.190
 Mana and what is 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.940
 edit well I'm not very good at 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.600
 meaning and good here we can be 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.370
 Additional features 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.190
 This is also what we will leave 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.480
 in the description we open quotes and 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.070
 We put the name of our machine 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.850
 virtual must check anger because not 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:17.240
 I remember my virtual machine is called 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:19.430
 mac is capitalized mac is important 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.180
 know these capitals for this 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:26.510
 space and now you put in quotes 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:30.440
 this can be changed custom video mode 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:32.300
 1 we close quotation marks and we give a space and 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.460
 here you put the resolution is worth I go to 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.160
 open the other time I have it here already 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:40.310
 you put again in 1366 in mine by 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.290
 768 and by 32 is worth 32 is very 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.570
 important but the quotes and you give 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.849
 get in 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.889
 [Music] 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:49.169
 It is worth once you have done this you can already 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:51.529
 close and you will have finished we will 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:51.529
 prove it 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.270
 forgive me well called I do not know if what 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.370
 you will have heard but good you will leave this 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.020
 window when creating the application with this 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:04.290
 it is normal the assistants we give to 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:08.520
 accept and now we open it again I think 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:10.350
 that you see we're going again and you know 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.770
 opens and you will have more here and 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:16.250
 We give to start the machine 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:19.729
 and beige there that already runs screen 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.710
 complete and you will have our 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:26.229
 real full screen is worth so that it does not 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:31.250
 get those bars out and be able to work 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:32.569
 normally it's worth and now I'm going to teach 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.210
 pause the video and now when you're in 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:38.300
 notice desks worth has already loaded the 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:40.789
 desk and here you see that it is already 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.919
 full screen we can use it 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:45.050
 perfectly and 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:47.260
 we have all the tabs running 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:54.810
 as well 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:54.810
 and what we want we can open chrome 

00:06:56.569 --> 00:07:01.600
 If they charge we can manage 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:05.190
 we can do whatever we want 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:07.280
 we can give you more limit 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:10.590
 I do not get it very well maximize to see 

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:12.300
 we have to change the resolutions of 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.380
 the programs ourselves though 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.070
 I think that once we do it 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.510
 hear it 

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:21.290
 so to see 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:22.910
 is already and well this has been everything I hope 

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:24.410
 that you liked the video that you have 

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.760
 sense also and that you give him alaiki 

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.420
 says that we are worth a lot of trouble and 

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.420
 come to god
