in<00:00:08.189> this<00:00:08.309> tutorial<00:00:08.550> we're<00:00:08.970> going<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.179> learn

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
in this tutorial we're going to learn

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.629 
in this tutorial we're going to learn
how<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.480> use<00:00:09.660> cinema<00:00:10.080> for<00:00:10.320> DS<00:00:10.500> mograph<00:00:11.010> toolkit

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
how to use cinema for DS mograph toolkit

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.730 
how to use cinema for DS mograph toolkit
to<00:00:11.820> make<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.000> particle<00:00:12.389> effect<00:00:12.809> that<00:00:13.380> forms

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
to make a particle effect that forms

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.369 
to make a particle effect that forms
together<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.309> create<00:00:14.670> text<00:00:15.210> you<00:00:15.809> can<00:00:15.900> also<00:00:15.960> use

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
together to create text you can also use

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.109 
together to create text you can also use
the<00:00:16.529> same<00:00:16.710> effect<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.190> break<00:00:17.430> apart<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.820> text

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
the same effect to break apart the text

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.849 
the same effect to break apart the text
and<00:00:18.240> have<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.480> dissolve<00:00:18.869> away<00:00:19.020> which<00:00:19.740> we'll

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
and have it dissolve away which we'll

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.019 
and have it dissolve away which we'll
learn<00:00:19.949> about<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.189> little<00:00:20.460> bit<00:00:20.550> later<00:00:20.730> in<00:00:20.880> this

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
learn about a little bit later in this

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.439 
learn about a little bit later in this
lesson<00:00:21.300> so<00:00:22.020> let's<00:00:22.050> get<00:00:22.320> started<00:00:22.650> so<00:00:23.330> we<00:00:24.330> have

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
lesson so let's get started so we have

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.390 
lesson so let's get started so we have
just<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.689> blank<00:00:24.990> canvas<00:00:25.439> inside<00:00:25.769> of<00:00:25.859> cinema<00:00:26.160> 4d

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
just a blank canvas inside of cinema 4d

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.830 
just a blank canvas inside of cinema 4d
and<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.820> first<00:00:27.029> thing<00:00:27.180> we<00:00:27.269> want<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.510> do<00:00:27.630> is

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
and the first thing we want to do is

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.390 
and the first thing we want to do is
drop<00:00:28.109> in<00:00:28.260> some<00:00:28.439> text<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:28.859> we<00:00:29.039> can<00:00:29.160> work<00:00:29.369> with

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
drop in some text that we can work with

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.720 
drop in some text that we can work with
so<00:00:30.359> I'm<00:00:30.420> going<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.599> go<00:00:30.660> up<00:00:30.750> here<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:30.929> mograph<00:00:31.730> go

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
so I'm going to go up here to mograph go

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.170 
so I'm going to go up here to mograph go
down<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.180> mo<00:00:33.420> text<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.610> under<00:00:35.610> object<00:00:35.790> I'm

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
down to mo text and under object I'm

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.869 
down to mo text and under object I'm
going<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.360> change<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:36.780> from<00:00:37.020> text<00:00:37.410> to

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
going to change this from text to

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.459 
going to change this from text to
digital<00:00:38.879> tutors<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.510> can<00:00:39.750> just<00:00:39.899> change<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.230> to

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
digital tutors you can just change it to

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.979 
digital tutors you can just change it to
whatever<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.980> like<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.790> I'm<00:00:42.629> gonna<00:00:42.780> go<00:00:42.930> to

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
whatever you like and I'm gonna go to

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.119 
whatever you like and I'm gonna go to
our<00:00:43.260> depth<00:00:43.530> here<00:00:43.649> I'm<00:00:44.160> gonna<00:00:44.250> bump<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.670> up<00:00:44.730> to

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 
our depth here I'm gonna bump that up to

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.700 
our depth here I'm gonna bump that up to
around<00:00:47.129> 40<00:00:47.550> should<00:00:47.610> work<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:49.260> also<00:00:49.440> want<00:00:49.649> to

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
around 40 should work and I also want to

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.380 
around 40 should work and I also want to
increase<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.280> subdivisions<00:00:50.969> here<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.300> I'm

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
increase the subdivisions here so I'm

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.490 
increase the subdivisions here so I'm
gonna<00:00:51.480> increase<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.800> about<00:00:53.129> 12<00:00:54.260> all<00:00:55.260> right

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
gonna increase it to about 12 all right

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.200 
gonna increase it to about 12 all right
so<00:00:55.980> now<00:00:56.160> what<00:00:56.340> we<00:00:56.430> want<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.670> do<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:56.940> go<00:00:57.090> up<00:00:57.180> here

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
so now what we want to do is go up here

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.020 
so now what we want to do is go up here
to<00:00:57.420> mograph<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:59.010> we're<00:00:59.370> gonna<00:00:59.460> drop<00:00:59.730> in<00:00:59.940> a

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
to mograph and we're gonna drop in a

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.619 
to mograph and we're gonna drop in a
poly<00:01:00.329> effects<00:01:01.489> see<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.670> drop<00:01:03.000> into<00:01:03.600> our

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
poly effects see that drop into our

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.539 
poly effects see that drop into our
objects<00:01:04.140> panel<00:01:04.439> here<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.799> we<00:01:05.010> want<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.250> click

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
objects panel here and we want to click

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.630 
objects panel here and we want to click
the<00:01:05.760> poly<00:01:06.000> effects<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.950> move<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.130> under<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
the poly effects and move it under the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.870 
the poly effects and move it under the
mo<00:01:08.850> text<00:01:09.240> until<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.810> see<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.409> arrow<00:01:11.369> pointing

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
mo text until you see the arrow pointing

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.700 
mo text until you see the arrow pointing
downward<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.750> we<00:01:12.900> want<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.140> let<00:01:13.260> go

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
downward and we want to let go

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.050 
downward and we want to let go
and<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.890> can<00:01:14.010> see<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.280> now<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.670> becomes<00:01:14.939> a

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
and you can see that now that becomes a

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.090 
and you can see that now that becomes a
child<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.689> mo<00:01:15.840> text<00:01:16.259> if<00:01:16.680> we<00:01:16.740> open<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.009> up

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
child of the mo text if we open that up

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.399 
child of the mo text if we open that up
we<00:01:17.250> can<00:01:17.430> see<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.610> poly<00:01:17.820> effects<00:01:18.150> there<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:19.320> we

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
we can see the poly effects there so we

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.570 
we can see the poly effects there so we
want<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.619> make<00:01:19.710> sure<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.920> poly<00:01:20.130> effects<00:01:20.400> is

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
want to make sure the poly effects is

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.460 
want to make sure the poly effects is
selected<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.390> we're<00:01:21.570> gonna<00:01:21.659> change<00:01:21.990> these<00:01:22.170> x

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
selected and we're gonna change these x

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.380 
selected and we're gonna change these x
y&amp;z<00:01:23.100> values<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.970> 0<00:01:25.670> you<00:01:26.670> can<00:01:26.820> see<00:01:26.850> our<00:01:27.060> text

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
y&amp;z values to 0 you can see our text

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.999 
y&amp;z values to 0 you can see our text
disappears<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.290> we'll<00:01:28.380> get<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.680> back<00:01:28.860> in

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
disappears and we'll get that back in

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:29.870 
disappears and we'll get that back in
just<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.430> moment

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
just a moment

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.840 
just a moment
so<00:01:30.210> we're<00:01:30.360> gonna<00:01:30.450> go<00:01:30.600> into<00:01:30.780> fall-off<00:01:31.790> go<00:01:32.790> to

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
so we're gonna go into fall-off go to

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.760 
so we're gonna go into fall-off go to
this<00:01:33.479> shape<00:01:33.810> here<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.259> want<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.500> change<00:01:34.619> this

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
this shape here I want to change this

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.760 
this shape here I want to change this
from<00:01:34.829> infinite<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:36.210> linear<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:37.290> can<00:01:37.350> see<00:01:37.590> that

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
from infinite to linear you can see that

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.609 
from infinite to linear you can see that
we<00:01:37.860> get<00:01:38.090> some<00:01:39.090> particles<00:01:39.600> on<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.049> screen<00:01:40.350> here

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
we get some particles on the screen here

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.109 
we get some particles on the screen here
but<00:01:40.799> they're<00:01:41.250> really<00:01:41.280> not<00:01:41.579> looking<00:01:41.790> that

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
but they're really not looking that

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.660 
but they're really not looking that
great<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.960> that's<00:01:43.110> mainly<00:01:43.320> because<00:01:43.670> right

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
great and that's mainly because right

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.969 
great and that's mainly because right
now<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.880> orientation<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:46.049> set<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.770> wrong

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
now the orientation is set in the wrong

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.670 
now the orientation is set in the wrong
axis<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.270> if<00:01:48.329> we<00:01:48.479> set<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.750> select<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.409> Z

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
axis so if we set the select the Z

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.039 
axis so if we set the select the Z
handle<00:01:50.189> here<00:01:50.430> we<00:01:51.000> can<00:01:51.119> move<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.780> we<00:01:51.930> can

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
handle here we can move this and we can

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.920 
handle here we can move this and we can
see<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.729> the<00:01:53.729> particles<00:01:54.000> form<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.509> text<00:01:54.810> but

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
see that the particles form the text but

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.090 
see that the particles form the text but
it's<00:01:55.049> actually<00:01:55.290> having<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.710> wrong

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
it's actually having in the wrong

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.580 
it's actually having in the wrong
direction<00:01:56.750> so<00:01:57.750> we<00:01:57.869> want<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.110> go<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.259> our

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
direction so we want to go to our

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.889 
direction so we want to go to our
orientation<00:01:59.070> right<00:01:59.640> here<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.149> change<00:02:00.750> this

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
orientation right here and change this

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.310 
orientation right here and change this
from<00:02:01.110> positive<00:02:01.710> z<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.340> negative<00:02:02.820> X<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.479> now

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
from positive z to negative X and now

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.840 
from positive z to negative X and now
you<00:02:04.380> can<00:02:04.590> see<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:05.009> when<00:02:05.189> we<00:02:05.310> scrub<00:02:05.670> this

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
you can see that when we scrub this

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.559 
you can see that when we scrub this
forward<00:02:07.429> the<00:02:08.429> poly<00:02:08.670> effects<00:02:09.000> handle<00:02:09.270> here<00:02:09.450> we

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
forward the poly effects handle here we

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.410 
forward the poly effects handle here we
can<00:02:09.690> now<00:02:09.780> see<00:02:09.989> our<00:02:10.289> text<00:02:11.039> forms<00:02:11.879> on-screen

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
can now see our text forms on-screen

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.850 
can now see our text forms on-screen
from<00:02:12.720> these<00:02:12.870> little<00:02:13.110> particles<00:02:13.560> here

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
from these little particles here

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.530 
from these little particles here
so<00:02:13.950> it's<00:02:14.070> looking<00:02:14.640> closer<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.240> how<00:02:15.330> we<00:02:15.390> want

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
so it's looking closer to how we want

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.450 
so it's looking closer to how we want
alright<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:18.780> now<00:02:18.960> let's<00:02:18.990> go<00:02:19.410> under<00:02:19.890> here<00:02:20.160> so<00:02:20.370> we

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
alright so now let's go under here so we

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.520 
alright so now let's go under here so we
have<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.700> spline<00:02:21.060> I'm<00:02:22.020> gonna<00:02:22.200> select<00:02:22.320> this

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
have the spline I'm gonna select this

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.200 
have the spline I'm gonna select this
graph<00:02:22.800> here<00:02:23.100> I'm<00:02:23.220> gonna<00:02:23.340> right-click<00:02:23.670> and

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
graph here I'm gonna right-click and

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.580 
graph here I'm gonna right-click and
this<00:02:24.420> might<00:02:24.600> be<00:02:24.630> off<00:02:24.870> your<00:02:25.110> screen<00:02:25.380> a<00:02:25.410> little

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
this might be off your screen a little

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.710 
this might be off your screen a little
bit<00:02:25.710> but<00:02:26.490> I'm<00:02:26.580> gonna<00:02:26.670> go<00:02:26.820> down<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.390> go<00:02:27.660> to

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
bit but I'm gonna go down and go to

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.600 
bit but I'm gonna go down and go to
spline<00:02:28.290> presets<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.160> set<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.580> square<00:02:31.610> all

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
spline presets and set it to square all

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.030 
spline presets and set it to square all
right<00:02:32.760> that's<00:02:33.060> looking<00:02:33.300> pretty<00:02:33.330> good

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
right that's looking pretty good

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.430 
right that's looking pretty good
so<00:02:35.040> I'm<00:02:35.100> gonna<00:02:35.190> select<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.490> mo<00:02:35.670> text<00:02:36.030> again<00:02:36.750> go

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
so I'm gonna select the mo text again go

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.650 
so I'm gonna select the mo text again go
back<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.620> our<00:02:37.800> text<00:02:38.040> here<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:38.610> I<00:02:39.450> want<00:02:39.630> to

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
back to our text here and I want to

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.750 
back to our text here and I want to
scroll<00:02:39.930> down<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.470> change<00:02:40.980> this<00:02:41.190> intermediate

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
scroll down and change this intermediate

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.350 
scroll down and change this intermediate
points<00:02:42.270> from<00:02:42.720> adaptive<00:02:43.350> to<00:02:43.680> subdivide<00:02:44.340> it<00:02:44.490> and

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
points from adaptive to subdivide it and

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.850 
points from adaptive to subdivide it and
I<00:02:45.420> might<00:02:45.540> be<00:02:45.600> off<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.050> screen<00:02:46.290> just<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.650> little

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
I might be off the screen just a little

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.120 
I might be off the screen just a little
bit<00:02:47.010> here<00:02:48.170> but<00:02:49.170> as<00:02:49.320> you<00:02:49.500> can<00:02:49.590> see<00:02:49.650> as<00:02:49.890> soon<00:02:50.010> as

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
bit here but as you can see as soon as

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.320 
bit here but as you can see as soon as
we<00:02:50.250> do<00:02:50.370> that<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:52.760> particles<00:02:53.760> start<00:02:53.940> becoming

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
we do that the particles start becoming

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.780 
we do that the particles start becoming
a<00:02:54.600> little<00:02:55.440> bit<00:02:55.620> more<00:02:55.770> squared<00:02:56.130> off<00:02:56.370> as<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:56.760> can

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
a little bit more squared off as you can

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.020 
a little bit more squared off as you can
see<00:02:57.030> if<00:02:57.120> we<00:02:57.239> had<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:58.280> set<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.340> how<00:02:59.520> it<00:02:59.640> was<00:02:59.790> which

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
see if we had it set to how it was which

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.030 
see if we had it set to how it was which
was<00:03:00.209> adaptive<00:03:00.780> we<00:03:00.930> have<00:03:01.110> these<00:03:01.230> long<00:03:01.590> strips

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
was adaptive we have these long strips

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.949 
was adaptive we have these long strips
of<00:03:02.130> polygons<00:03:02.580> which<00:03:02.850> isn't<00:03:03.209> really<00:03:03.420> what<00:03:03.840> we

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
of polygons which isn't really what we

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.550 
of polygons which isn't really what we
want<00:03:04.200> so<00:03:05.190> I<00:03:05.220> want<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.400> change<00:03:05.640> that<00:03:05.850> back<00:03:06.120> to

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
want so I want to change that back to

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.690 
want so I want to change that back to
subdivided<00:03:07.560> alright<00:03:08.250> that's<00:03:08.430> looking<00:03:08.550> pretty

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
subdivided alright that's looking pretty

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.729 
subdivided alright that's looking pretty
good

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
good

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.160 
good
so<00:03:10.739> now<00:03:10.860> if<00:03:10.950> we<00:03:11.040> select<00:03:11.160> this<00:03:11.310> poly<00:03:11.550> effects<00:03:12.170> we

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
so now if we select this poly effects we

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.930 
so now if we select this poly effects we
can<00:03:13.290> scroll<00:03:13.620> this<00:03:13.860> and<00:03:14.190> we<00:03:14.280> can<00:03:14.430> see<00:03:14.610> that<00:03:14.790> our

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
can scroll this and we can see that our

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.990 
can scroll this and we can see that our
text<00:03:15.209> is<00:03:15.480> looking<00:03:16.410> a<00:03:16.470> little<00:03:16.560> bit<00:03:16.680> better

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
text is looking a little bit better

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.160 
text is looking a little bit better
particles<00:03:18.000> are<00:03:18.120> starting<00:03:18.390> to<00:03:18.480> form<00:03:18.720> here<00:03:18.989> but

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
particles are starting to form here but

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.580 
particles are starting to form here but
it's<00:03:20.040> forming<00:03:20.430> in<00:03:20.519> a<00:03:20.580> very<00:03:21.080> predictable<00:03:22.080> and

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
it's forming in a very predictable and

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.190 
it's forming in a very predictable and
linear<00:03:23.010> fashion<00:03:23.459> you<00:03:24.450> can<00:03:24.570> see<00:03:24.750> that<00:03:24.930> as<00:03:25.080> we

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
linear fashion you can see that as we

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.630 
linear fashion you can see that as we
scrub<00:03:25.470> well<00:03:25.709> you<00:03:25.769> kind<00:03:25.950> of<00:03:25.980> can<00:03:26.280> already<00:03:26.430> tell

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
scrub well you kind of can already tell

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.280 
scrub well you kind of can already tell
where<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.090> particles<00:03:27.510> are<00:03:27.570> gonna<00:03:27.690> come<00:03:27.989> from

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
where the particles are gonna come from

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.140 
where the particles are gonna come from
and<00:03:28.860> we<00:03:28.950> want<00:03:29.130> to<00:03:29.220> just<00:03:29.310> randomize<00:03:29.910> this<00:03:30.120> a

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
and we want to just randomize this a

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.539 
and we want to just randomize this a
little<00:03:30.330> bit<00:03:30.739> so<00:03:31.739> make<00:03:32.010> sure<00:03:32.040> your<00:03:32.310> poly

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
little bit so make sure your poly

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.160 
little bit so make sure your poly
effects<00:03:32.880> is<00:03:33.060> selected<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:33.750> we're<00:03:33.900> gonna<00:03:33.989> go

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
effects is selected and we're gonna go

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.070 
effects is selected and we're gonna go
to<00:03:34.260> mograph<00:03:35.120> effector<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.299> we're<00:03:36.989> gonna

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
to mograph effector and we're gonna

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.770 
to mograph effector and we're gonna
apply<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.950> random<00:03:38.700> here<00:03:39.180> so<00:03:39.390> we're<00:03:39.480> gonna<00:03:39.600> apply

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
apply a random here so we're gonna apply

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.750 
apply a random here so we're gonna apply
a<00:03:39.810> random<00:03:40.049> effector<00:03:40.620> and<00:03:41.160> as<00:03:41.310> soon<00:03:41.549> as<00:03:41.610> we

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
a random effector and as soon as we

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.789 
a random effector and as soon as we
select<00:03:42.090> that<00:03:42.150> you<00:03:42.330> can<00:03:42.450> see<00:03:42.570> that<00:03:42.750> now<00:03:43.049> the

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
select that you can see that now the

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.370 
select that you can see that now the
particles<00:03:44.280> are<00:03:45.000> much<00:03:45.540> more<00:03:45.780> random<00:03:46.019> they're

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
particles are much more random they're

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.750 
particles are much more random they're
broken<00:03:46.709> up<00:03:46.920> they're<00:03:47.190> kind<00:03:47.340> of<00:03:47.370> coming<00:03:47.670> from

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
broken up they're kind of coming from

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.210 
broken up they're kind of coming from
different<00:03:48.360> directions<00:03:48.570> here<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.440> we're

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
different directions here and we're

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.860 
different directions here and we're
getting<00:03:50.580> closer<00:03:50.850> the<00:03:51.060> results<00:03:51.540> that<00:03:51.690> we<00:03:51.840> want

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
getting closer the results that we want

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.199 
getting closer the results that we want
so<00:03:52.860> if<00:03:52.950> I<00:03:53.010> select<00:03:53.250> this<00:03:53.310> poly<00:03:53.580> effects<00:03:53.940> again

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
so if I select this poly effects again

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.830 
so if I select this poly effects again
and<00:03:54.420> I<00:03:55.350> just<00:03:55.380> scrub<00:03:55.830> this<00:03:56.010> forward<00:03:56.660> you<00:03:57.660> can

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
and I just scrub this forward you can

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.620 
and I just scrub this forward you can
see<00:03:57.870> that<00:03:58.140> now<00:03:58.730> the<00:03:59.730> particles<00:04:00.180> are<00:04:00.299> starting

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
see that now the particles are starting

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:01.759 
see that now the particles are starting
to<00:04:00.720> look<00:04:00.810> better<00:04:01.019> we're<00:04:01.260> getting<00:04:01.350> smaller

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
to look better we're getting smaller

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.470 
to look better we're getting smaller
particles<00:04:02.280> here<00:04:02.519> and<00:04:03.030> they're<00:04:03.150> starting<00:04:03.330> to

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
particles here and they're starting to

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.890 
particles here and they're starting to
form<00:04:03.780> our<00:04:03.989> letters<00:04:04.709> and<00:04:05.010> we<00:04:05.940> can<00:04:06.060> even<00:04:06.360> start

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
form our letters and we can even start

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.280 
form our letters and we can even start
bumming<00:04:07.320> up<00:04:07.410> this<00:04:07.530> randomization<00:04:08.190> even<00:04:08.730> more

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
bumming up this randomization even more

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.750 
bumming up this randomization even more
so<00:04:10.290> what<00:04:10.500> we<00:04:10.620> want<00:04:10.799> to<00:04:10.890> do<00:04:11.010> is<00:04:11.220> go<00:04:11.370> back<00:04:11.400> to<00:04:11.670> our

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
so what we want to do is go back to our

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.720 
so what we want to do is go back to our
random<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:12.690> go<00:04:13.350> under<00:04:13.680> our<00:04:13.709> parameters<00:04:14.519> here

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
random and go under our parameters here

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.240 
random and go under our parameters here
and<00:04:14.940> under<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:15.930> x<00:04:16.079> y&amp;z<00:04:16.709> I'm<00:04:16.919> just<00:04:17.070> going<00:04:17.190> to

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
and under the x y&amp;z I'm just going to

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.949 
and under the x y&amp;z I'm just going to
start<00:04:17.459> kind<00:04:18.209> of<00:04:18.269> messing<00:04:18.540> around<00:04:18.630> with<00:04:18.810> these

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
start kind of messing around with these

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.719 
start kind of messing around with these
values<00:04:19.380> and<00:04:19.530> you<00:04:19.620> can<00:04:19.739> do<00:04:19.829> the<00:04:19.950> same<00:04:20.160> as<00:04:20.400> well

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
values and you can do the same as well

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.240 
values and you can do the same as well
if<00:04:21.299> I<00:04:21.419> mess<00:04:21.690> around<00:04:21.720> with<00:04:22.020> the<00:04:22.109> x<00:04:22.229> y&amp;z<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:22.979> as

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
if I mess around with the x y&amp;z and as

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.650 
if I mess around with the x y&amp;z and as
we<00:04:23.400> dial<00:04:23.700> this<00:04:23.849> up<00:04:24.030> you<00:04:24.150> can<00:04:24.270> see<00:04:24.390> that<00:04:24.539> the

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
we dial this up you can see that the

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.900 
we dial this up you can see that the
particles<00:04:24.930> start<00:04:25.289> spreading<00:04:25.770> apart<00:04:25.860> and<00:04:26.310> now

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
particles start spreading apart and now

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.129 
particles start spreading apart and now
they're<00:04:27.180> really<00:04:27.360> coming<00:04:27.630> from

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 
they're really coming from

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:30.350 
they're really coming from
all<00:04:28.379> different<00:04:28.710> directions<00:04:29.009> here<00:04:29.580> so<00:04:30.270> if<00:04:30.330> we

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
all different directions here so if we

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.480 
all different directions here so if we
scrub<00:04:30.689> this<00:04:30.900> again<00:04:31.289> now<00:04:31.889> you<00:04:32.009> can<00:04:32.219> see<00:04:32.340> the

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
scrub this again now you can see the

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.200 
scrub this again now you can see the
particles<00:04:33.319> are<00:04:34.319> really<00:04:34.979> kind<00:04:35.219> of<00:04:35.280> just<00:04:35.939> coming

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
particles are really kind of just coming

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.519 
particles are really kind of just coming
in<00:04:36.300> from<00:04:36.419> all<00:04:36.689> different<00:04:36.840> directions<00:04:37.080> and

00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:37.529 
in from all different directions and

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:41.149 
in from all different directions and
it's<00:04:37.919> very<00:04:38.219> random<00:04:39.620> so<00:04:40.620> if<00:04:40.680> we<00:04:40.740> want<00:04:40.919> to<00:04:40.979> change

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:41.159 
it's very random so if we want to change

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:44.179 
it's very random so if we want to change
this<00:04:41.249> up<00:04:41.400> with<00:04:41.520> just<00:04:41.669> a<00:04:41.759> little<00:04:41.969> bit<00:04:42.979> we<00:04:43.979> can<00:04:44.069> go

00:04:44.179 --> 00:04:44.189 
this up with just a little bit we can go

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:46.610 
this up with just a little bit we can go
back<00:04:44.310> to<00:04:44.400> our<00:04:44.430> fall-off<00:04:44.969> here<00:04:45.469> I'm<00:04:46.469> going<00:04:46.560> to

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
back to our fall-off here I'm going to

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.320 
back to our fall-off here I'm going to
change<00:04:46.800> this<00:04:46.919> fall-off<00:04:47.310> value<00:04:47.819> and<00:04:47.939> just<00:04:47.969> bump

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
change this fall-off value and just bump

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.379 
change this fall-off value and just bump
that<00:04:48.479> up<00:04:48.539> and<00:04:49.490> now<00:04:50.490> you<00:04:50.550> can<00:04:50.669> see<00:04:50.999> that<00:04:51.240> this

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
that up and now you can see that this

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.420 
that up and now you can see that this
little<00:04:51.599> red<00:04:52.080> box<00:04:52.409> here<00:04:52.650> starts<00:04:53.069> moving

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
little red box here starts moving

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.640 
little red box here starts moving
forward<00:04:53.909> and<00:04:54.870> if<00:04:54.960> we<00:04:55.050> move<00:04:55.199> it<00:04:55.319> all<00:04:55.469> the<00:04:55.560> way

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
forward and if we move it all the way

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.119 
forward and if we move it all the way
back<00:04:55.830> the<00:04:56.069> particles<00:04:56.699> we<00:04:56.999> hit<00:04:57.180> this<00:04:57.330> strange

00:04:58.119 --> 00:04:58.129 
back the particles we hit this strange

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:01.159 
back the particles we hit this strange
deformation<00:04:59.129> issue<00:04:59.310> but<00:04:59.729> the<00:05:00.629> particles<00:05:01.050> are

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
deformation issue but the particles are

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.260 
deformation issue but the particles are
almost<00:05:01.560> non-existent<00:05:01.830> as<00:05:02.520> we<00:05:02.699> dial<00:05:02.909> that<00:05:03.060> back

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
almost non-existent as we dial that back

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.330 
almost non-existent as we dial that back
but<00:05:03.479> as<00:05:03.569> we<00:05:03.689> move<00:05:03.870> it<00:05:04.020> forward<00:05:04.439> you<00:05:04.710> can<00:05:05.219> see

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
but as we move it forward you can see

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.040 
but as we move it forward you can see
the<00:05:05.460> particles<00:05:05.909> start<00:05:07.009> kind<00:05:08.009> of<00:05:08.039> increasing

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
the particles start kind of increasing

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.350 
the particles start kind of increasing
ahead<00:05:10.050> of<00:05:10.199> the<00:05:10.529> actual<00:05:11.159> movement<00:05:11.639> so<00:05:12.180> now<00:05:12.300> we

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
ahead of the actual movement so now we

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.909 
ahead of the actual movement so now we
can<00:05:12.539> see<00:05:12.629> more<00:05:12.900> particles<00:05:13.349> are<00:05:13.469> starting<00:05:13.830> to

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
can see more particles are starting to

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.029 
can see more particles are starting to
form<00:05:14.219> if<00:05:14.490> we<00:05:15.000> just<00:05:15.150> select<00:05:15.629> this<00:05:15.900> now<00:05:16.680> we<00:05:16.770> can

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
form if we just select this now we can

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:18.409 
form if we just select this now we can
see<00:05:17.189> those<00:05:17.400> particles<00:05:17.879> are<00:05:17.969> really<00:05:18.150> coming

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
see those particles are really coming

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.929 
see those particles are really coming
from<00:05:18.599> all<00:05:18.810> different<00:05:19.050> directions<00:05:19.349> and<00:05:19.939> this

00:05:20.929 --> 00:05:20.939 
from all different directions and this

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:23.179 
from all different directions and this
eye<00:05:21.210> is<00:05:21.270> starting<00:05:21.779> to<00:05:21.870> form<00:05:22.139> before<00:05:22.379> the<00:05:22.770> G<00:05:23.039> is

00:05:23.179 --> 00:05:23.189 
eye is starting to form before the G is

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:25.420 
eye is starting to form before the G is
finished<00:05:23.610> so<00:05:23.729> that's<00:05:23.969> that's<00:05:24.330> what<00:05:24.569> we<00:05:24.689> want

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
finished so that's that's what we want

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:27.079 
finished so that's that's what we want
all<00:05:26.430> right<00:05:26.520> awesome

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:27.089 
all right awesome

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:28.939 
all right awesome
so<00:05:27.569> we've<00:05:27.689> learned<00:05:27.810> how<00:05:27.960> to<00:05:27.990> use<00:05:28.080> poly<00:05:28.469> effects

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:28.949 
so we've learned how to use poly effects

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:30.709 
so we've learned how to use poly effects
and<00:05:29.219> the<00:05:29.370> random<00:05:29.759> effector<00:05:30.240> to<00:05:30.389> create<00:05:30.689> a

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:30.719 
and the random effector to create a

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:33.379 
and the random effector to create a
really<00:05:31.169> nice<00:05:31.520> particle<00:05:32.520> effect<00:05:32.759> that<00:05:32.939> forms

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
really nice particle effect that forms

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.329 
really nice particle effect that forms
into<00:05:33.569> the<00:05:33.719> text<00:05:34.169> and<00:05:34.830> if<00:05:34.919> we<00:05:34.979> want<00:05:35.159> to<00:05:35.189> take

00:05:35.329 --> 00:05:35.339 
into the text and if we want to take

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:36.619 
into the text and if we want to take
this<00:05:35.430> a<00:05:35.490> step<00:05:35.580> further<00:05:35.759> if<00:05:36.180> you<00:05:36.270> want<00:05:36.419> to<00:05:36.479> have

00:05:36.619 --> 00:05:36.629 
this a step further if you want to have

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:39.170 
this a step further if you want to have
this<00:05:36.750> effect<00:05:37.279> dissolve<00:05:38.279> you<00:05:38.460> can<00:05:38.550> obviously

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
this effect dissolve you can obviously

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.909 
this effect dissolve you can obviously
keyframe<00:05:39.750> this<00:05:39.990> handle<00:05:40.349> and<00:05:40.500> kind<00:05:40.650> of<00:05:40.680> move<00:05:40.830> it

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
keyframe this handle and kind of move it

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:42.559 
keyframe this handle and kind of move it
back<00:05:41.129> there<00:05:41.370> to<00:05:41.520> have<00:05:41.759> that<00:05:41.789> dissolved<00:05:42.300> or<00:05:42.479> you

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:42.569 
back there to have that dissolved or you

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:43.790 
back there to have that dissolved or you
could<00:05:42.689> just<00:05:42.719> simply<00:05:43.110> just<00:05:43.319> change<00:05:43.620> the

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
could just simply just change the

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.360 
could just simply just change the
orientation<00:05:45.110> from<00:05:46.110> negative<00:05:46.680> X<00:05:46.860> to<00:05:46.979> positive

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
orientation from negative X to positive

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.939 
orientation from negative X to positive
X<00:05:47.550> so<00:05:47.729> now<00:05:47.909> you<00:05:47.969> can<00:05:48.180> see<00:05:48.330> the<00:05:48.740> effect<00:05:49.740> is

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:49.949 
X so now you can see the effect is

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:51.679 
X so now you can see the effect is
actually<00:05:50.250> dissolving<00:05:50.939> away<00:05:51.060> instead<00:05:51.629> of

00:05:51.679 --> 00:05:51.689 
actually dissolving away instead of

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:54.499 
actually dissolving away instead of
forming<00:05:52.139> all<00:05:53.099> right<00:05:53.310> awesome<00:05:53.580> well<00:05:54.180> this<00:05:54.330> was

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:54.509 
forming all right awesome well this was

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:55.969 
forming all right awesome well this was
just<00:05:54.689> one<00:05:54.960> example<00:05:54.990> of<00:05:55.529> where<00:05:55.680> you<00:05:55.710> can<00:05:55.889> use

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
just one example of where you can use

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:57.290 
just one example of where you can use
poly<00:05:56.219> effects<00:05:56.580> you<00:05:56.789> can<00:05:56.939> really<00:05:57.180> start

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
poly effects you can really start

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.119 
poly effects you can really start
experimenting<00:05:57.750> with<00:05:58.139> it<00:05:58.259> and<00:05:58.379> find<00:05:58.889> other

00:05:59.119 --> 00:05:59.129 
experimenting with it and find other

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:00.829 
experimenting with it and find other
areas<00:05:59.550> within<00:05:59.789> your<00:05:59.939> project<00:06:00.509> to<00:06:00.599> start
