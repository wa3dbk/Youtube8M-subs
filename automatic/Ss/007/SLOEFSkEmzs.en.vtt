that's why I'm just going to keep it as

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.720 
that's why I'm just going to keep it as
is<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:20.530> that's<00:02:20.709> really<00:02:20.860> all<00:02:21.100> there<00:02:21.250> is<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.580> it

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
is and that's really all there is to it

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.000 
is and that's really all there is to it
that's<00:02:22.540> how<00:02:22.750> you<00:02:22.810> core<00:02:23.080> a<00:02:23.110> pineapple<00:02:23.380> to<00:02:23.860> make
