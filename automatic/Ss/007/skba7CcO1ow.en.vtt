it up let's look at this term we see the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.380 
it up let's look at this term we see the
circle<00:01:25.110> all<00:01:25.860> right<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.670> circle<00:01:27.090> itself

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
circle all right in the circle itself

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.800 
circle all right in the circle itself
that<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.780> currently<00:01:28.140> see<00:01:28.759> that<00:01:29.759> dark<00:01:30.270> circle

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
that you currently see that dark circle

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.620 
that you currently see that dark circle
with<00:01:30.930> all<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.200> dark<00:01:31.470> lines<00:01:31.939> is<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.299> area

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
with all the dark lines is the area

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.200 
with all the dark lines is the area
where<00:01:33.750> they<00:01:33.840> pulled<00:01:34.110> 200<00:01:34.680> hairs<00:01:34.939> you<00:01:35.939> see<00:01:36.119> how

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
where they pulled 200 hairs you see how

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.030 
where they pulled 200 hairs you see how
thick<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.780> hair<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.200> out<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.650> area<00:01:37.799> they

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
thick the hair is out of the area they

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.999 
thick the hair is out of the area they
pulled<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.400> 200<00:01:38.729> hairs<00:01:39.020> that's<00:01:40.020> how<00:01:40.860> it

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
pulled the 200 hairs that's how it

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.469 
pulled the 200 hairs that's how it
responded<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:41.670> that's<00:01:41.880> going<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.090> create<00:01:42.210> the

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
responded and that's going to create the

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.300 
responded and that's going to create the
scientists<00:01:43.049> alright<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.100> process

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
scientists alright so this process

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.550 
scientists alright so this process
called<00:01:44.670> quorum<00:01:45.000> sensing<00:01:45.180> they<00:01:45.869> pull<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.200> hair

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
called quorum sensing they pull a hair

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.460 
called quorum sensing they pull a hair
out<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:46.979> basically<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:47.909> trauma<00:01:48.299> occurs<00:01:48.930> and

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
out and basically this trauma occurs and

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.679 
out and basically this trauma occurs and
then<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.770> body<00:01:49.950> responds<00:01:50.490> by<00:01:50.549> over<00:01:51.390> killing

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
then the body responds by over killing

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.690 
then the body responds by over killing
and<00:01:51.780> hair<00:01:51.899> production<00:01:52.380> good<00:01:52.740> for<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.070> so

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
and hair production good for you so

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.789 
and hair production good for you so
researchers<00:01:54.299> did<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:54.689> they<00:01:55.170> found<00:01:55.409> out<00:01:55.680> when

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
researchers did this they found out when

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.950 
researchers did this they found out when

millimeters<00:02:00.240> apart<00:02:00.329> when<00:02:01.200> they<00:02:01.259> plucked

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
millimeters apart when they plucked

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.050 
millimeters apart when they plucked
these<00:02:01.770> two<00:02:01.950> hundred<00:02:02.189> hairs<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.610> don't<00:02:02.759> ask<00:02:02.880> me

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
these two hundred hairs and don't ask me

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.330 
these two hundred hairs and don't ask me
how<00:02:03.509> they<00:02:03.719> came<00:02:03.869> up<00:02:03.960> with<00:02:03.990> 200<00:02:04.530> when<00:02:05.040> they

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
how they came up with 200 when they

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.380 
how they came up with 200 when they
the<00:02:05.460> two<00:02:05.549> hundred<00:02:05.759> hairs

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
the two hundred hairs

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.540 
the two hundred hairs
nothing<00:02:06.960> happened<00:02:07.350> just<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.710> bunch<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:07.950> parrots

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
nothing happened just a bunch of parrots

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.930 
nothing happened just a bunch of parrots
but<00:02:09.209> here<00:02:09.780> was<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.140> trick<00:02:10.440> when<00:02:11.370> they<00:02:11.550> plucked

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
but here was the trick when they plucked

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.610 
but here was the trick when they plucked
the<00:02:12.180> two<00:02:12.420> hundred<00:02:13.080> hair

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
the two hundred hair

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.790 
the two hundred hair
and<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.580> read<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.120> five-millimeter<00:02:15.989> circle

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
and it read a five-millimeter circle

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.170 
and it read a five-millimeter circle
that<00:02:17.670> was<00:02:17.879> it<00:02:18.200> then<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.500> body<00:02:19.830> responded<00:02:20.640> by

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
that was it then the body responded by

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.699 
that was it then the body responded by
taking<00:02:21.480> at<00:02:21.810> three<00:02:22.019> to<00:02:22.110> five<00:02:22.290> millimeter

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
taking at three to five millimeter

taking at three to five millimeter
circle<00:02:23.069> where<00:02:23.160> they've<00:02:23.280> pulled<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:23.700> two

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849

extra<00:02:30.930> hairs<00:02:31.640> so<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.760> body<00:02:32.970> tried<00:02:33.239> to

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
extra hairs so the body tried to

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.059 
extra hairs so the body tried to

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.400 
there
well<00:02:35.879> if<00:02:35.970> guess<00:02:36.150> what<00:02:36.420> how<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.840> make<00:02:37.019> your<00:02:37.200> work

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
well if guess what how to make your work

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.630 
well if guess what how to make your work
twice<00:02:37.620> as<00:02:37.680> hard<00:02:37.860> on<00:02:38.010> making<00:02:38.280> you<00:02:38.340> run<00:02:38.519> to

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
twice as hard on making you run to

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.850 
twice as hard on making you run to
producing<00:02:38.910> more<00:02:39.180> hair<00:02:39.450> so<00:02:40.019> you<00:02:40.290> can't<00:02:40.560> pull<00:02:40.739> it

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
producing more hair so you can't pull it

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.160 
producing more hair so you can't pull it
all<00:02:40.950> out<00:02:40.980> that's<00:02:41.879> what<00:02:42.150> happened<00:02:42.480> at<00:02:42.720> least<00:02:43.019> in

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
all out that's what happened at least in

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.990 
all out that's what happened at least in
animal<00:02:43.530> models<00:02:43.860> where<00:02:44.519> the<00:02:44.640> mean<00:02:44.790> of<00:02:44.879> the

animal models where the mean of the
future<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.780> needs<00:02:45.959> eventually<00:02:46.470> hopefully

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
future it needs eventually hopefully

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.770 
future it needs eventually hopefully
instead<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.459> plucking<00:02:47.910> hairs<00:02:48.150> out<00:02:48.420> in<00:02:48.569> three

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
head as to these that may sound

excluding excruciatingly painful maybe

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.199 
excluding excruciatingly painful maybe
eventually<00:02:55.620> they<00:02:56.190> may<00:02:56.370> come<00:02:56.579> up<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.790> blade<00:02:57.030> to

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
eventually they may come up a blade to

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.600 
eventually they may come up a blade to
create<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.569> micro<00:02:57.930> trauma<00:02:58.170> effect<00:02:59.129> that

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
create that micro trauma effect that

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.400 
create that micro trauma effect that
causes<00:02:59.819> though<00:03:00.269> or<00:03:00.480> mimics<00:03:00.870> that<00:03:00.989> quorum

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
causes though or mimics that quorum

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.869 
causes though or mimics that quorum
sensing<00:03:01.620> or<00:03:01.950> triggers<00:03:02.250> that<00:03:02.340> quorum<00:03:02.700> sensing

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
sensing or triggers that quorum sensing

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.449 
sensing or triggers that quorum sensing
and<00:03:03.269> therefore<00:03:04.110> you<00:03:05.010> can<00:03:05.129> end<00:03:05.250> up<00:03:05.280> with<00:03:05.340> a

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
and therefore you can end up with a

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.720 
and therefore you can end up with a
whole<00:03:05.730> head<00:03:06.599> of<00:03:06.980> extremely<00:03:07.980> thick<00:03:08.400> hair

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
whole head of extremely thick hair

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.789 
whole head of extremely thick hair
without<00:03:09.629> even<00:03:10.019> having<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.260> plucked<00:03:10.560> one

without even having the plucked one

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.740 
without even having the plucked one
hopefully<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.819> future<00:03:11.970> brings<00:03:12.329> that<00:03:12.480> but<00:03:12.690> if

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
hopefully the future brings that but if

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.690 
hopefully the future brings that but if
you<00:03:12.810> have<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.959> pluck<00:03:13.170> one<00:03:13.379> that's<00:03:14.280> not<00:03:14.400> so<00:03:14.519> bad

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
you have to pluck one that's not so bad

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.089 
you have to pluck one that's not so bad
