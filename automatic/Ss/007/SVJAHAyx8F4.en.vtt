00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.679
 hello welcome girls in this video 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.349
 as you can see from the title concerns one 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.939
 collaboration with shane site 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:23.509
 I wanted to do another reality video though 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:25.880
 since they sent me an email if and 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:28.640
 wondering if i had made the video i have 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.220
 said okay I do it today so I will 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.970
 I honestly say I take it out of the way and 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.989
 therefore the most received things are four 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:41.420
 704 so snow I show you then 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:44.500
 first thing I chose from the site then e 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.600
 I'll show you better with photos 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.760
 This is this God and a shirt 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.300
 super light mallet bar also 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.100
 because as you see, we say 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.399
 semitransparent animated by trocar 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.859
 behind is all white while during the 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:04.309
 which prompted me to choose it 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:06.350
 this cute fantasy all with 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.619
 but these roses are not red roses 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.869
 as you can see but they are very much colors 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.689
 clear on the little brownish fish then 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.590
 I liked it for this reason it is this 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.799
 here 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.189
 honestly, I feel a little short 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:24.100
 let's say life in short, why me 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.490
 like them as you know the things that 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.619
 they cover my little hips a little bit 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.350
 so what else did I get I took 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:37.159
 this one this enormous because this 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:40.600
 it is a suitable shirt in my opinion 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.909
 because it is abundantly abundant 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.310
 abundantly beyond the sides then 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.290
 covers all the parts that must be covered 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.180
 so in my opinion suitable for 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.960
 be worn with leggings and it is 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:57.170
 this one is nice heavy long sleeve 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:00.320
 and just as you will understand it here also has me 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.280
 pushed the plot to try this out 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.450
 jersey 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:09.079
 to the two side pockets here 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.700
 however this shirt is not worn much 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:12.560
 often not because I don't like them 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.400
 because on me it is very bad because 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.230
 perfect bagged makes this effect here 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.330
 that is, therefore it goes further on the sides 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.720
 a bomb yes precisely because of the presence 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.910
 of these of these pockets but me 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.480
 however, I like it sincerely 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.070
 a lot so if maybe you are very much 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.480
 more slim than me this shirt but 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:37.850
 this sweater may not be too bad 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.000
 then we move on to the thing I loved alla 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.500
 madness that I wear almost practically 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.930
 I always swear to you 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:50.630
 and it is this sweatshirt and it is this sweatshirt by 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.130
 gotham city is beautiful wonderful me 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.610
 fine of hands that suit me the 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:59.120
 hips this is exactly mine 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.610
 measure and as you see the print is 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.220
 beautiful I took it only for the 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:09.860
 press tell you the truth because of things 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:12.350
 gray I have several and we say that the 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.150
 wash 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.050
 in the note yes because it is still type 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.600
 touristic these these garments not washed 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.840
 yes I took it easy not washed a 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.600
 quite a few times and as you see the writing 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.720
 has remained intact has not done 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:33.890
 that kind of crumbling effect 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:36.530
 like the shirts a little more low cost him 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.450
 this day I can't talk like al 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.260
 I usually like it a lot and use it 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:45.890
 especially when I want to have a look 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.900
 a little bit of a nerdy look so me 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.260
 like to wear it when i have 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.930
 glasses in short with black frame and 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.070
 so this one I love to die for 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.670
 that's enough 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:01.489
 last thing i chose from china ed 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.989
 I saw this blues make up by kiss 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.420
 however he had seen it on her in 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.890
 initially emerald green color 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.910
 I also wanted to take this value 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.560
 of that color 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.989
 but in the end I took it I wanted 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.060
 to try it of a color I remain of a 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.750
 neutral color to then see how I do it 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.140
 it would have been 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.310
 in fact to this brusa here therefore to three 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.700
 powder pink and very much buoys 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.350
 transparent as you see and then to the profiles 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.640
 blacks start on the collar both on the 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:31.550
 length of the buttons and also on the 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:34.190
 sleeve cuff and of course like 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.190
 I always roll the sleeves 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.020
 because long sleeve things do not me 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.090
 like them a lot as you see this too 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.080
 I swear or roll up the sleeves I hope 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:47.470
 please in the frame and then 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:50.000
 these are the four items I chose 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.890
 honestly I felt good in 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.100
 quality terms with all four 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.660
 but the second one is on me 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.910
 knit the gray one the beautiful one 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.350
 composed is not very good for me 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:05.540
 and while this one is slightly up to me 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:08.270
 short but with a cake pan a little more 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.400
 long under the problem is not there 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.510
 so now I leave you with the photos of 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.000
 worn garments 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.290
 I don't do the video because it's late like 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.979
 as usual he has already had a day 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:21.110
 beautiful like all the others of this 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:23.150
 so last month the video is finished 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.700

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.840
