of the week for the storage and let's
look<00:00:58.170> at<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.859> ones<00:00:59.070> i<00:00:59.219> picked<00:00:59.460> out<00:00:59.670> so

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
look at the the ones i picked out so

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.060 
look at the the ones i picked out so
this<00:00:59.910> was<00:01:00.329> one<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.690> caught<00:01:00.899> me<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.260> like<00:01:01.890> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
this was one that caught me I like the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.690 
this was one that caught me I like the
color<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:03.270> like<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.110> hair<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:05.070> like<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.489> eyes

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
color I like the hair I like the eyes

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.149 
color I like the hair I like the eyes
this<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.450> guess<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:07.049> think<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.890> kind<00:01:08.100> of

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
this is I guess I think this is kind of

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.590 
this is I guess I think this is kind of
similar<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.700> edit<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.090> did<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:09.570> I

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
similar to the edit that I did so I

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.810 
similar to the edit that I did so I
gravitate<00:01:10.590> more<00:01:10.619> towards<00:01:10.830> things<00:01:11.369> with<00:01:11.610> more

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
gravitate more towards things with more

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.920 
gravitate more towards things with more
boom<00:01:12.150> ification<00:01:13.040> so<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.310> like<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.540> second

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
boom ification so I like that the second

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.109 
boom ification so I like that the second
one<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.080> did<00:01:16.350> it's<00:01:16.860> little<00:01:17.340> pulled<00:01:17.580> back<00:01:17.790> more

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
one I did it's little pulled back more

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.310 
one I did it's little pulled back more
but<00:01:18.330> look<00:01:18.450> at<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.659> eyes<00:01:18.810> look<00:01:19.110> at<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
but look at the eyes look at the

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.609 
but look at the eyes look at the
difference<00:01:19.710> between<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.640> two<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.970> these<00:01:21.619> it

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
difference between the two of these it

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.140 
difference between the two of these it
didn't<00:01:22.920> throw<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.250> crop<00:01:23.490> this<00:01:23.729> time<00:01:23.970> and

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.429 
read the name that is on the screen but
yeah<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.030> like<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.630> eyes<00:01:30.780> are<00:01:31.049> there<00:01:31.259> they

pop there's a little less boom ification
on<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.049> one<00:01:34.259> but<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.799> works<00:01:35.040> very<00:01:35.610> very<00:01:35.790> well

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
on this one but it works very very well

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.090 
on this one but it works very very well
so<00:01:36.570> that's<00:01:36.840> why<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.110> picked<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.500> one<00:01:37.740> up<00:01:37.799> and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
so that's why I picked this one up and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.399 
so that's why I picked this one up and
wanted<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.369> point<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.820> out<00:01:39.200> this<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.380> just

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
wanted to point it out this I just

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.870 
wanted to point it out this I just
thought<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.799> eyes<00:01:40.950> were<00:01:41.250> interesting<00:01:41.700> I'm

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
thought the eyes were interesting I'm

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.940 
thought the eyes were interesting I'm
not<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.210> big<00:01:42.450> fan<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:42.960> type<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.200> crop<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:43.920> I

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
not a big fan of this type of crop but I

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.710 
not a big fan of this type of crop but I
thought<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.220> eyes<00:01:44.490> were<00:01:45.119> interesting<00:01:45.600> it

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
thought the eyes were interesting it

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.200

trading card uh kawaii kawaii I'm not

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.910 
trading card uh kawaii kawaii I'm not
really<00:04:00.510> sure<00:04:00.600> what<00:04:00.840> that<00:04:00.870> is<00:04:01.020> i'm<00:04:01.290> supposed<00:04:01.830> to

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
really sure what that is i'm supposed to

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.610 
really sure what that is i'm supposed to
google<00:04:02.280> it<00:04:02.370> and<00:04:02.459> find<00:04:02.550> out<00:04:03.030> a<00:04:03.300> little<00:04:04.110> bit<00:04:04.260> i

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
google it and find out a little bit i

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.680 
google it and find out a little bit i
think<00:04:05.070> a<00:04:05.370> little<00:04:05.490> bit<00:04:05.640> more<00:04:05.820> contrast<00:04:06.209> in<00:04:06.510> here

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
think a little bit more contrast in here

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.530 
think a little bit more contrast in here
would<00:04:06.780> give<00:04:07.110> it<00:04:07.230> a<00:04:07.260> little<00:04:07.650> bit<00:04:07.890> more<00:04:08.130> oomph

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
would give it a little bit more oomph

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.910 
would give it a little bit more oomph
but<00:04:09.540> again<00:04:09.870> a<00:04:09.900> lot<00:04:10.140> of<00:04:10.230> people<00:04:10.380> went<00:04:10.650> into<00:04:10.830> the

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
but again a lot of people went into the

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.610 
but again a lot of people went into the
eyes<00:04:11.070> and<00:04:11.340> pulled<00:04:12.000> out<00:04:12.150> too<00:04:12.450> far<00:04:12.750> a<00:04:13.050> little<00:04:13.530> bit

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
eyes and pulled out too far a little bit

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.900 
eyes and pulled out too far a little bit
i<00:04:13.650> think<00:04:13.680> this<00:04:13.950> is<00:04:14.010> too<00:04:14.160> far<00:04:14.400> where<00:04:14.610> you<00:04:14.670> paint

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
i think this is too far where you paint

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.210 
i think this is too far where you paint
in<00:04:15.090> this<00:04:15.270> one<00:04:15.450> I<00:04:15.480> you<00:04:16.140> lose<00:04:16.410> the<00:04:16.650> black<00:04:16.890> of<00:04:17.130> the

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
in this one I you lose the black of the

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.710 
in this one I you lose the black of the
pupil<00:04:17.609> because<00:04:17.760> these<00:04:17.880> should<00:04:18.180> be<00:04:18.209> black

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
pupil because these should be black

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.050 
pupil because these should be black
because<00:04:18.930> our<00:04:19.169> pupils<00:04:19.440> are<00:04:20.070> black<00:04:20.580> and<00:04:20.820> I

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
because our pupils are black and I

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.150 
because our pupils are black and I
thought<00:04:21.239> this<00:04:21.480> was<00:04:21.690> pretty<00:04:21.900> cool<00:04:22.290> I<00:04:22.590> really

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:31.449 
there again it's cropped but I thought

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:33.209 
there again it's cropped but I thought
it<00:05:31.539> was<00:05:31.599> cool<00:05:31.810> you<00:05:32.020> show<00:05:32.169> the<00:05:32.319> eyes<00:05:32.469> nice<00:05:32.860> edit

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:33.219 
it was cool you show the eyes nice edit

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:35.670 
it was cool you show the eyes nice edit
on<00:05:33.310> that<00:05:33.460> a<00:05:33.490> little<00:05:33.849> too<00:05:33.969> strong<00:05:34.389> on<00:05:34.839> the

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
on that a little too strong on the

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.219 
on that a little too strong on the
sharpening<00:05:36.279> and<00:05:36.520> the<00:05:37.060> clarity<00:05:37.330> if<00:05:37.719> that<00:05:38.020> was

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:38.229 
sharpening and the clarity if that was

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:39.719 
sharpening and the clarity if that was
pulled<00:05:38.469> back<00:05:38.680> I<00:05:38.740> think<00:05:39.099> this<00:05:39.190> would<00:05:39.370> be<00:05:39.400> even

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
pulled back I think this would be even

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:41.309 
pulled back I think this would be even
more<00:05:39.759> solid<00:05:40.330> but<00:05:40.690> I<00:05:40.719> thought<00:05:40.900> it<00:05:41.020> was<00:05:41.110> cool

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:41.319 
more solid but I thought it was cool

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:43.890 
more solid but I thought it was cool
nice<00:05:41.710> try<00:05:42.009> and<00:05:42.339> a<00:05:42.669> nice<00:05:42.849> job<00:05:43.089> there<00:05:43.120> and<00:05:43.569> I

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
nice try and a nice job there and I

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.649 
nice try and a nice job there and I
believe<00:05:44.319> this<00:05:44.650> is<00:05:44.830> the<00:05:44.860> last<00:05:45.159> one<00:05:45.520> I<00:05:46.180> thought

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:46.659 
believe this is the last one I thought

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:48.480 
believe this is the last one I thought
this<00:05:46.839> was<00:05:46.900> cool<00:05:47.259> to<00:05:47.500> pulling<00:05:48.069> back<00:05:48.219> just

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
this was cool to pulling back just

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.879 
this was cool to pulling back just
leaving<00:05:48.759> the<00:05:48.849> color<00:05:49.060> of<00:05:49.180> the<00:05:49.360> hair<00:05:49.860> the<00:05:50.860> eyes

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889 
leaving the color of the hair the eyes

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:54.360 
leaving the color of the hair the eyes
