00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.450

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.710
 hi girls and guys how are you 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.550
 Welcome to the channel, well, today 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.939
 I come with another cooking recipe and it's going to 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.860
 be a sweet recipe but you're going to see 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.779
 it's going to be a sweet recipe but 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:34.410
 light suitable for diets in this case I'm going 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.200
 to make a cocoa cream nocilla 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.280
 nutella as you want to call him in agreement 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.399
 and you are going to say but to see a cream of 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.410
 cocoa suitable for dieting because I eat 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.940
 you are counting good 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.280
 surely those that you have done the 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.270
 dukan diet the famous dukan diet already 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:01:00.290
 you will know what I mean that 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.990
 nocilla dukan but good 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:07.520
 yes yes it's true that I did that 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:10.220
 diet some time ago and I did nothing 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.140
 one month two months at the most I was 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.490
 doing yes it is true that I went down 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:19.210
 about five kilos a thing like that 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.210
 good 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.569
 let's say I'm in favor and not that 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:26.569
 diet if it is to go down 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.240
 very few kilos, well, it seems like a 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.970
 option because it's something fast and also if 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.830
 you have to go down more than good ones 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.659
 how many kilos about ten kilos like that 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.960
 honestly it is not a diet that 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:45.440
 recommend because you take away from many 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:49.220
 foods that I think are good and that 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.380
 you have to eat them and take them but good 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.899
 if you have to see and I tell you if you have 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.500
 to be something of urgency and to be very 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.700
 few kilos then good otherwise 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.590
 another diet more than those in the 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.200
 market then well well I do not 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.970
 I roll more and I 'll explain the case 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.909
 is that I 'm not doing right now 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.759
 a diet but I'm taking care of the 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:14.580
 theme of the wedding operation and so that 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.860
 can enter the wedding dress not 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.630
 and well let's say I'm telling you I 'm not 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.730
 dieting but of course you have to 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.460
 get rid of something that I love 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.090
 what are the sweets the chocolate the 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.550
 do not mention all those topics and some 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.670
 way making me this cocoa cream 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.190
 Well, I take off that craving that 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.440
 I have for chocolate and well it is 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.170
 a recipe that I 'm telling you does not make you fat 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.360
 hungry if I eat you as if you eat in a 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.380
 sitting all the goal logically 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.480
 something will be done but if you are rationing 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.610
 you will see that it is a super light recipe 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.920
 and that you can use this cream 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:56.160
 cocoa to join where you want 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:00.510
 it will tell you the ingredients 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:05.270
 we need we need 2 teaspoons 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:09.260
 of these coffee liquid sweetener 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:11.390
 a spoonful of skimmed milk me in 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.800
 this case I use the kaiku without 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.810
 lactose because good I am intolerant 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.690
 so I have to drink this milk but 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.300
 any skim milk or it would serve a 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.780
 spoonful of normal milk a spoonful 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.090
 tureen 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.790
 We need 2 tablespoons of 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.620
 fresh cheese beaten in this case I 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.129
 I use this brand 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:36.250
 lines to the leader that goes very well two 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:39.730
 spoonfuls and finally we will need 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:43.660
 two tablespoons also of cocoa 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:46.890
 pure defatted powder I use this 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.510
 of value forgiveness I use this value 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:53.500
 It goes very well 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:57.090
 and well, if you want to see how I do 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.090
 this cocoa cream you will see 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.379
 Well, we started with the recipe 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.269
 the cocoa cream we will need 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:06.900
 said that two tablespoons of fresh cheese 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.900
 smoothie 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.010
 two tablespoons 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.000
 of fresh cheese milkshake 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.830
 a 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:33.600
 and 2 well then we continue with cocoa 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:35.970
 pure is that it is defatted is from 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.490
 the brand value and we continue with two 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.490
 tablespoons of cocoa 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.370
 a 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.310
 and 2 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:53.659
 we will also need a spoonful 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.159
 soup also of skimmed milk and 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:57.660
 this case I already told you that it's going to 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:05:01.200
 use this without lactose 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.930
 you have a video in which I tell my 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.180
 experience with the subject of 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.729
 lactose intolerance 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.729
 and finally and finally forgiveness 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:13.620
 we will also need sweetener and 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:16.350
 I use this one of carrefour but good of 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.510
 any brand including stevia and two 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:22.810
 teaspoons of these coffee 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:27.990
 of sweetener because cocoa is 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.990
 quite bitter agree a 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:38.020
 and 2 and now we pass 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.430
 little by little 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:48.470
 we are stirring 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.830
 with patience but you see that it has 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.830
 consistency 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.979
 and well, let's remove 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:05.270
 we keep stirring and well it's going 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:08.000
 taking that texture of cocoa cream 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:11.150
 I'll teach it more closely the truth 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.670
 that if you do it and you try it already 

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:17.690
 you will say that it is good because he does not know 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:20.810
 exactly like a news a nutella 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:23.210
 but it takes away is good 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:26.510
 assange since you can have for a 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:29.090
 Cocoa cream tastes super good very sweet 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:30.920
 and those that like chocolate as a 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.930
 me to the things pib the chocolate like to 

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:37.670
 Well, you are going to have to react 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:41.510
 because you are not going to take on 0.1 now 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:45.380
 simply when you already have good this 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:49.040
 texture so you put it one hour two 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:50.700
 you wait for the fridge and the good 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.580
 ice ration 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:56.430
 you always keep it in the fridge for 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.440
 that does not get bad and good then to 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:02.070
 being colder is another consistency 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:05.880
 also and well, this was the recipe 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:08.729
 today you can use it for other 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:12.900
 recipes to throw him 

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:16.020
 a bagel what you please 

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:18.630
 of bread bimbo but good is like a 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:21.060
 cookie Mary and makes that kind of cookies 

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:24.300
 Prince but I'll show you one 

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:27.300
 recipe a recipe later on that is 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:30.030
 some oatmeal cookies are also dukan 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:33.810
 but good yo 

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:35.610
 I do not do not do the dukan diet but I think 

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:38.010
 that there are certain recipes that 

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:40.650
 can adapt to other diets or eat 

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:43.320
 healthier healthier then you already 

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:47.010
 I will teach how to make cookies to which 

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:49.020
 they are doing very well this cocoa cream 

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:52.620
 Well, I hope that the proof that 

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:55.860
 you try it if you like it, tell me 

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:58.600
