00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 what a wave to greet you once again your 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.600
 friend ma jing or cable and this time such and 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.820
 as I did with the previous movie 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.559
 after seeing the battle of the gods 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.809
 in which the video was rumors and 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.059
 theories of dragon ball z 2 this time 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.670
 I will talk about theories and my predictions 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.710
 about dragon ball super if everything comes out 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.840
 well more than one thing of what I will say here 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.470
 will come true as several that I have given 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.680
 before we start we know that dragon ball 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.789
 super will be located after the chapter 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.189
 291 dragon ball z 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.320
 obviously following the original work of 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.690
 akira toriyama this time this anime 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.820
 will have 100% akira content 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.430
 toriyama as their prequels have been 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.800
 that is to say dragon ball z the battle of the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.050
 gods and dragon ball z the resurrection 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.090
 to frize things that were only seen 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.730
 in the anime they will not be taken into account 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.920
 in this new series for what I have 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.110
 as a theory that bellito will return as 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.570
 I have already mentioned above makes 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.910
 it seems to me a year I still think that 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.100
 Bellito will return but not very soon 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.030
 in the not too distant future but neither 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.979
 very closely 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.570
 I think this because the enemies to the 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.820
 who will face 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.280
 friends will not be simple villains but 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.650
 something gigantic that compares to the power 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.750
 of the super sayayin shipments by 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.750
 goku and vegeta of course to certain 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.979
 point they will face a villain 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.050
 extremely powerful and will not have 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.030
 another choice rather than using the merger 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.550
 and as I said the only merger 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.680
 existing between goku and vegeta is bellito 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.330
 with the power they will possess in the future 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.670
 blessed will be again in the extreme 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.530
 powerful possibly becoming 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.200
 again in the most powerful character 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.270
 of dragon ball another of my theories is 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.070
 that there will be more transformations I have 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.080
 estimated that two or three by part of 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.060
 goku and vegeta although possibly the 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.789
 only one that can use two or three 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.800
 q do transformations was pellita one 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.869
 unless I do this by logical logic 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.450
 that akira toriyama has been driving 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.270
 for years another of my theories is 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.369
 that as much as bojan they throw bronx pan e 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.560
 even bra will get transformations 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.020
 on the part of goian maybe even what 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.570
 let's see how super sayayin god and if not 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.060
 outside the case as super sayayin 3 or in 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.190
 its defect recovering its mystic state 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.410
 reaching new levels of power under 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.069
 an intense workout in this way 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.980
 the super 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.079
 and I would achieve a huge level I'll leave between 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:24.150
 the super sayayin god and the super sayayin 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:27.540
 mystic between 65 and 35 165 from the 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.359
 super sayayin god and 35% from the 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.799
 comeback of the super sayayin mystic another of 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:33.750
 the theories is the one that has come 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.060
 managing for a long time the 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.430
 next big rivals will be gods 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.169
 I follow this theory for years now 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.269
 that at the level where they are 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:44.549
 both goku and velita is currently 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.379
 incredibly big and after the 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.340
 resurrection of freezer take place 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.349
 four years 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.629
 obviously goku and war continued 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.030
 those years training with wish to be able 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.250
 face vines friendly 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.379
 logic at the end of the dragon ball z these 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.689
 two are even stronger than 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:02.639
 they were when they fought with frizer here 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:04.590
 is a spoiler for this theory but 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:06.269
 I'll put an annotation in the video to 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.129
 that they can jump if you do not want 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.750
 spoiler art the end of the movie 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.120
 fu cats 1 efe 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.219
 continuing with my theories I think that 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.079
 freezer will return in the resurrection of 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:18.239
 frizer you can appreciate its immense 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:20.129
 power although it is dying at the hands of goku 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.350
 and we see the end of the film 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.330
 new in him 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.790
 freezer to achieve its new form 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.980
 evolution transformation as you want 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.050
 tell him to achieve his blow state in his 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.450
 power increases in a brutal way 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.790
 and freezer is a character that can give 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.070
 more is to say that it can become a 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.900
 true rival again and the state 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.850
 frizer golden did not get all its 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.220
 potential in the movie since frizer 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.200
 did not dominate it rushed to attack is 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.060
 possible that frizer returns but dominating 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.310
 its golden state and that's not all 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.320
 including its 100% power 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.540
 becoming a true demon 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.670
 as it was in the jellyfish another of my 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.250
 theories is that not only freezer will return 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.260
 I think they will return majin wiesel yet 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.700
 I do not know how, but possibly 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.460
 with the help of some other character 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.440
 unknown can even be a 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.150
 god whose power allows him to enter and 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.640
 get out of hell when you give it the 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.650
 Earn well now by following the letter of 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.930
 look and trunk I think he too 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.700
 will return but following his training 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.190
 will possibly return already with his 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.440
 transformation in super sayayin 3 or in 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.170
 its defect the advanced 2 sayayin super 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.330
 continuing with the returns this is a 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.070
 somewhat crazy theory but I think that at 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.140
 heights in which they face 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.150
 no more powerful of all the universes 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.640
 they will need help against him and his 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.800
 possible minions for this will need 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.780
 help for a new mind but this 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.940
 would not be any desire to relive 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.770
 to a being would be to resurrect all 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.750
 Salamis who were killed by 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.120
 frizer the television special and 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.590
 episodes bards are not canonical but 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.960
 thanks to aira manga toriyama 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.490
 we can see that Bardach did face 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.710
 frizer what can be considered 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:57.290
 canonical of the television special is 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.090
 the end only that therefore he together 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.790
 to the others sayayin is killed by hands 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.920
 of frizer would need the help of the 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.170
 saya lines to fight the 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.450
 most powerful enemy of all or as now 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.760
 I said at least with his henchmen 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.530
 Akira Toriyama may have created 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.050
 dragon ball minus so that in the future 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.090
 give him use the characters as the 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.550
 case of jacó the galactic patrolman 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.010
 Goku finally reuniting with his 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.560
 although parents do not really know if 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.270
 they would return radice inapa well another theory 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.400
 What I have is that we will know who is 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.950
 really the first super sayayin god 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.840
 just like the previous theory I think 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.340
 that we will know what really happened with 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.800
 bardach and cinema 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:39.230
 another theory Akira Toriyama has never 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.550
 taken into account episodes bardot so 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.919
 that maybe explain to us who is 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.930
 really the first super sayayin not 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:47.000
 I count civilians as allies because 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.340
 that is more than obvious they will help 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.979
 against future enemies this is 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.389
 more clear than nothing and well in itself is everything 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:56.270
 what has happened to me in these 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:58.070
 weeks thinking logically and as I said 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.949
 with luck, more than one of my 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:04.540
 theories will come true greetings to all 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:04.540
 goodbye your friend ma jing ok
