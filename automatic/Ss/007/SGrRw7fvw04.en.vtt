I think it's a huge step up I think it

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.749

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:41.219 
I think technology's moved on

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:42.740 
I think technology's moved on
significantly<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.060> time<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.390> I've<00:01:42.509> owned

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
significantly in a time that I've owned

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.389 
significantly in a time that I've owned
it<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.170> thought<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.619> was<00:01:43.710> very<00:01:43.740> easy<00:01:44.069> to<00:01:44.219> use

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
it I thought it was very easy to use

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.730 
it I thought it was very easy to use
very<00:01:44.520> similar<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.689> tablet<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.409> also

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
very similar to it to a tablet and also

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.440 
very similar to it to a tablet and also
the<00:01:46.829> respond<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.310> time<00:01:47.490> seemed<00:01:47.909> really<00:01:48.149> quick

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
the respond to time seemed really quick

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.270

on the road I've only had a little

on the road I've only had a little
player<00:01:54.090> it's<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:54.479> far<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.959> don't<00:01:55.640> believe<00:01:56.640> it

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850

as<00:01:58.770> well<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:59.189> think<00:01:59.759> it's<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.909> good<00:02:00.000> thing<00:02:00.240> I

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
as well I think it's a good thing I

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.300 
as well I think it's a good thing I
think<00:02:00.479> it's<00:02:00.719> less<00:02:00.899> hassle<00:02:01.109> and<00:02:01.920> once<00:02:02.189> you

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
think it's less hassle and once you

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.469 
think it's less hassle and once you
learn<00:02:02.459> how<00:02:02.609> to<00:02:02.640> use<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.090> they're<00:02:03.270> quite

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
learn how to use it they're quite

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.139 
learn how to use it they're quite
normally<00:02:04.289> quite<00:02:04.470> simple<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.890> use<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.369> should

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
normally quite simple to use I should

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.789 
normally quite simple to use I should
imagine<00:02:06.329> it's<00:02:06.689> very<00:02:06.840> distracting<00:02:07.319> that<00:02:07.679> would

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
imagine it's very distracting that would

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.499 
imagine it's very distracting that would
be<00:02:07.920> my<00:02:08.099> only<00:02:08.250> concern<00:02:08.880> because<00:02:09.119> there's<00:02:09.299> a<00:02:09.329> lot

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
be my only concern because there's a lot

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.750 
be my only concern because there's a lot
of<00:02:09.690> things<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.140> will<00:02:10.410> do<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.709> tempt<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.519> to

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
of things it will do that tempt you to

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.059 
of things it will do that tempt you to
interact<00:02:12.569> with<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:13.079> so<00:02:13.319> when<00:02:13.769> you're<00:02:13.890> driving

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
interact with it so when you're driving

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:21.619 
interact with it so when you're driving
guess<00:02:14.400> that's<00:02:14.610> not<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.790> good<00:02:14.940> thing<00:02:20.599> I've<00:02:21.599> got

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
guess that's not a good thing I've got

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.900 
guess that's not a good thing I've got
five<00:02:21.989> children<00:02:22.349> and<00:02:22.829> so<00:02:23.310> we<00:02:23.459> would<00:02:23.610> be<00:02:23.760> using

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
five children and so we would be using

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.400 
five children and so we would be using
all<00:02:24.180> of<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.450> seats<00:02:24.690> all<00:02:24.959> of<00:02:25.079> the<00:02:25.170> time

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
all of the seats all of the time

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.259 
all of the seats all of the time
everything<00:02:26.069> just<00:02:26.190> seems<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.489> bit<00:02:26.519> squashed<00:02:26.940> so

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
everything just seems a bit squashed so

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.059 
everything just seems a bit squashed so
when<00:02:27.420> they're<00:02:27.569> sitting<00:02:27.750> in<00:02:28.019> it<00:02:28.170> they<00:02:28.709> seemed<00:02:28.950> a

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
when they're sitting in it they seemed a

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.130 
when they're sitting in it they seemed a
bit<00:02:29.160> squashed<00:02:29.549> when<00:02:30.510> they<00:02:30.660> were<00:02:30.720> in<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.930> back

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
bit squashed when they were in the back

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.020 
bit squashed when they were in the back
I<00:02:31.500> mean<00:02:31.680> I<00:02:31.769> tried<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.220> in<00:02:32.310> the<00:02:32.400> back<00:02:32.549> of<00:02:32.579> myself

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
I mean I tried it in the back of myself

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.660 
I mean I tried it in the back of myself
and<00:02:33.269> I<00:02:33.360> just<00:02:33.599> felt<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:34.230> felt<00:02:34.890> too<00:02:35.010> enclosed<00:02:35.400> and

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
and I just felt I felt too enclosed and

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.240 
and I just felt I felt too enclosed and
too<00:02:35.819> squashed<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:37.170> visibility<00:02:37.769> didn't<00:02:38.069> seem

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
too squashed the visibility didn't seem

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.370 
too squashed the visibility didn't seem
so<00:02:38.459> good<00:02:38.670> from<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.299> back<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.720> windows<00:02:40.079> seems

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
so good from the back the windows seems

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.979 
so good from the back the windows seems
a<00:02:40.500> little<00:02:40.590> bit<00:02:40.799> small<00:02:41.160> I<00:02:41.400> see<00:02:41.850> space<00:02:42.180> wise<00:02:42.480> it's

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
a little bit small I see space wise it's

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.770 
a little bit small I see space wise it's
not<00:02:43.260> best<00:02:43.980> future<00:02:44.340> it's<00:02:44.850> a<00:02:44.910> big<00:02:45.150> car<00:02:45.420> but<00:02:45.630> it's

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
not best future it's a big car but it's

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.949 
not best future it's a big car but it's
not<00:02:46.130> overly<00:02:47.130> roomy<00:02:47.609> for<00:02:47.760> seven<00:02:48.090> so<00:02:48.239> that<00:02:48.389> comes

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
not overly roomy for seven so that comes

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.020 
not overly roomy for seven so that comes
another<00:02:49.139> area<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:49.590> if<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:50.430> had<00:02:50.639> a<00:02:50.670> bit<00:02:50.880> more

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
another area that if you had a bit more

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.050 
another area that if you had a bit more
space<00:02:51.329> I<00:02:51.359> would<00:02:51.569> appreciate<00:02:52.819> but<00:02:53.819> otherwise

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
space I would appreciate but otherwise

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.660 
space I would appreciate but otherwise
I'd<00:02:54.299> say<00:02:54.450> it's<00:02:54.599> a<00:02:54.690> pretty<00:02:55.200> good<00:02:55.470> job<00:02:55.709> but<00:02:55.889> what

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
I'd say it's a pretty good job but what

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.430 
I'd say it's a pretty good job but what
it<00:02:56.790> sets<00:02:57.000> out<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.209> be<00:02:57.450> we<00:02:57.959> actually<00:02:58.049> wouldn't

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
it sets out to be we actually wouldn't

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.650 
it sets out to be we actually wouldn't
use<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.769> 7<00:02:59.040> seats<00:02:59.280> on<00:02:59.459> this<00:02:59.609> on<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.239> model<00:03:00.510> if

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
use the 7 seats on this on the model if

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.349 
use the 7 seats on this on the model if
we<00:03:00.750> went<00:03:00.930> for<00:03:01.049> one<00:03:01.579> but<00:03:02.579> we<00:03:02.760> would<00:03:02.970> use<00:03:03.180> the

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
we went for one but we would use the

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.960 
we went for one but we would use the
five<00:03:03.569> seats<00:03:04.310> we've<00:03:05.310> all<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:05.489> luggage<00:03:05.760> space

the mid solution who is not quite where
I<00:03:28.110> would<00:03:28.290> like<00:03:28.470> it<00:03:28.680> where<00:03:29.550> this<00:03:29.670> one<00:03:29.910> the

around it very impressive what I'd like
to<00:04:13.290> know<00:04:13.440> is<00:04:13.590> learn<00:04:13.800> more<00:04:14.040> about<00:04:14.160> the

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
to know is learn more about the

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.280 
to know is learn more about the
all-round<00:04:14.730> vision<00:04:15.150> that<00:04:15.270> was<00:04:15.390> mentioned<00:04:15.630> so

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
all-round vision that was mentioned so

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.479 
all-round vision that was mentioned so
if<00:04:16.410> I<00:04:16.500> could<00:04:16.620> actually<00:04:16.859> have<00:04:17.130> all-round

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
if I could actually have all-round

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:18.740 
if I could actually have all-round
vision<00:04:17.850> for<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.060> car<00:04:18.239> that<00:04:18.390> would<00:04:18.510> be<00:04:18.600> very

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
vision for the car that would be very

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.050 
vision for the car that would be very
helpful<00:04:19.020> to<00:04:19.980> maintain<00:04:20.310> the<00:04:20.460> value<00:04:20.549> of<00:04:20.790> the<00:04:20.880> car

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
helpful to maintain the value of the car

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.970 
helpful to maintain the value of the car
I<00:04:21.480> have<00:04:21.660> to<00:04:21.780> say<00:04:21.930> all<00:04:22.080> the<00:04:22.200> features<00:04:22.710> did

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
I have to say all the features did

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.550 
I have to say all the features did
certainly<00:04:23.370> impress<00:04:23.790> me<00:04:24.060> that<00:04:24.840> you're<00:04:24.960> able<00:04:25.380> to

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
certainly impress me that you're able to

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.410 
certainly impress me that you're able to
see<00:04:25.770> low<00:04:25.950> things<00:04:26.340> because<00:04:27.060> obviously<00:04:27.150> in<00:04:27.390> a

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
see low things because obviously in a

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.630 
see low things because obviously in a
big<00:04:27.570> car<00:04:27.780> you're<00:04:27.960> high<00:04:28.080> up<00:04:28.320> and<00:04:28.560> I<00:04:29.130> thought

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
big car you're high up and I thought

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.460 
big car you're high up and I thought
that<00:04:29.730> was<00:04:29.850> good<00:04:30.060> yeah<00:04:30.720> I<00:04:30.750> think<00:04:30.870> safety<00:04:31.350> isn't

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
that was good yeah I think safety isn't

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.240 
that was good yeah I think safety isn't
as<00:04:31.680> a<00:04:31.710> family<00:04:32.100> car<00:04:32.280> is<00:04:32.580> always<00:04:32.880> important

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
as a family car is always important

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.530 
as a family car is always important
quite<00:04:35.250> a<00:04:35.280> few<00:04:35.550> of<00:04:35.640> them<00:04:35.730> struck<00:04:36.060> me<00:04:36.210> as<00:04:36.300> perhaps

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
quite a few of them struck me as perhaps

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.940 
quite a few of them struck me as perhaps
being<00:04:38.270> more<00:04:39.270> than<00:04:39.480> when<00:04:39.660> necessary<00:04:39.960> but<00:04:40.440> it<00:04:40.710> I

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
being more than when necessary but it I

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.530 
being more than when necessary but it I
guess<00:04:41.310> I<00:04:41.430> need<00:04:41.610> to<00:04:41.700> understand<00:04:42.210> them<00:04:42.390> better

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
guess I need to understand them better

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.330 
guess I need to understand them better
so<00:04:42.900> a<00:04:43.110> lot<00:04:43.470> of<00:04:43.500> them<00:04:43.650> seem<00:04:43.860> to<00:04:43.890> be<00:04:44.010> maybe

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
so a lot of them seem to be maybe

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.320 
so a lot of them seem to be maybe
excusing<00:04:45.150> the<00:04:45.270> driver<00:04:45.570> for<00:04:46.200> poor<00:04:46.410> driving

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:54.010 

I<00:04:51.970> think<00:04:52.970> when<00:04:53.060> you<00:04:53.150> look<00:04:53.180> at<00:04:53.360> the<00:04:53.449> car<00:04:53.689> nothing

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
I think when you look at the car nothing

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.659 
I think when you look at the car nothing
stands<00:04:54.470> out<00:04:54.740> particularly<00:04:55.189> it's<00:04:55.490> very

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
stands out particularly it's very

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.670 
stands out particularly it's very
understated<00:04:56.210> but<00:04:57.139> then<00:04:57.259> the<00:04:57.379> overall

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
understated but then the overall

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.709 
understated but then the overall
impression<00:04:58.069> that<00:04:58.400> is<00:04:58.490> it's<00:04:58.819> a<00:04:58.939> superior<00:04:59.360> build

00:04:59.709 --> 00:04:59.719 
impression that is it's a superior build

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:02.950 
impression that is it's a superior build
quality<00:05:00.229> and<00:05:00.710> a<00:05:00.860> very<00:05:01.099> good<00:05:01.340> car<00:05:01.580> I<00:05:01.909> would<00:05:02.780> buy

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
quality and a very good car I would buy

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.679 
quality and a very good car I would buy
