for<00:02:02.280> many<00:02:02.460> so<00:02:02.970> many<00:02:03.000> point<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.690> I<00:02:03.810> guess<00:02:04.140> the

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
for many so many point and I guess the

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.490

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.480 
I thought we should have put that team
away<00:02:09.420> but<00:02:10.320> what<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:10.500> mean<00:02:10.709> by<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:10.860> is<00:02:11.040> get<00:02:11.370> up

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
away but what I mean by that is get up

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.610 
away but what I mean by that is get up
by<00:02:11.640> at<00:02:11.760> least<00:02:11.880> 24<00:02:12.390> 25<00:02:12.810> points<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.380> we<00:02:13.500> were

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
by at least 24 25 points and we were

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.800 
by at least 24 25 points and we were
unable<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:13.860> do<00:02:14.250> that<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.760> thought<00:02:15.600> we<00:02:15.750> should

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
unable to do that I thought we should

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.300 
unable to do that I thought we should
have<00:02:15.959> been<00:02:16.170> able<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.440> do<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:16.650> in<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:16.980> second

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
have been able to do that in a second

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:25.920 
have been able to do that in a second
half

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.989
