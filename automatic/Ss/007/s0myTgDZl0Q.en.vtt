ok today we're going to talk about

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.439 
ok today we're going to talk about
slide-out<00:00:02.550> rubber<00:00:02.820> so<00:00:03.120> if<00:00:03.210> you're<00:00:03.330> in

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
slide-out rubber so if you're in

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.329 
slide-out rubber so if you're in
Australia<00:00:03.540> you've<00:00:04.350> got<00:00:04.560> a<00:00:04.589> fifth<00:00:04.890> wheeler<00:00:05.130> or

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
Australia you've got a fifth wheeler or

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:06.440 
Australia you've got a fifth wheeler or
big<00:00:05.520> motorhome<00:00:05.940> and<00:00:05.970> you<00:00:06.150> need<00:00:06.299> some

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
big motorhome and you need some

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.110 
big motorhome and you need some
slide-out<00:00:06.960> rubber<00:00:07.200> we've<00:00:08.069> got<00:00:08.250> some<00:00:08.460> here<00:00:09.000> in

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
slide-out rubber we've got some here in

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.660 
slide-out rubber we've got some here in
Ballarat<00:00:09.300> so<00:00:10.019> this<00:00:10.200> is<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.380> keystone<00:00:10.950> slide<00:00:11.490> out

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
Ballarat so this is a keystone slide out

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.749 
Ballarat so this is a keystone slide out
rubber<00:00:11.940> this<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.200> wipe<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.830> it<00:00:14.160> pushes<00:00:14.460> on

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
rubber this is the wipe and it pushes on

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.580 
rubber this is the wipe and it pushes on
to<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.089> metal<00:00:15.450> edge<00:00:15.630> there<00:00:16.109> it's<00:00:16.289> got<00:00:16.440> these

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
to a metal edge there it's got these

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.040 
to a metal edge there it's got these
metal<00:00:17.100> things<00:00:17.130> in<00:00:17.490> there<00:00:17.670> that<00:00:17.699> grab<00:00:18.270> so<00:00:18.660> it's

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
metal things in there that grab so it's

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.019 
metal things in there that grab so it's
the<00:00:19.410> wiper<00:00:19.710> in<00:00:20.189> here<00:00:20.430> we'll<00:00:20.640> call<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:20.970> a

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
the wiper in here we'll call that a

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.370 
the wiper in here we'll call that a
keystone<00:00:21.600> wiper<00:00:22.640> typically<00:00:23.640> found<00:00:23.880> on

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
keystone wiper typically found on

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.759 
keystone wiper typically found on
sprinters<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.650> Mountaineers<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.369> Montana's

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
sprinters and Mountaineers and Montana's

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.759 
sprinters and Mountaineers and Montana's
Cougars<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:28.980> sort<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.340> thing<00:00:30.260> then<00:00:31.260> when<00:00:31.619> the

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
Cougars that sort of thing then when the

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.830 
Cougars that sort of thing then when the
slide-out<00:00:32.040> comes<00:00:32.489> in<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.790> has<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.120> Oh<00:00:33.300> seal

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
slide-out comes in it has this Oh seal

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.200 
slide-out comes in it has this Oh seal
the<00:00:34.410> Oh<00:00:34.440> seals<00:00:35.010> got<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.370> little<00:00:35.640> track<00:00:35.940> along

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
the Oh seals got a little track along

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.819 
the Oh seals got a little track along
the<00:00:36.360> edge<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:36.989> slides<00:00:37.350> into<00:00:37.739> the

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
the edge and it slides into the

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.180 
the edge and it slides into the
aluminium<00:00:38.340> extrusion<00:00:39.320> out<00:00:40.320> on<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.800> slide-out

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
aluminium extrusion out on the slide-out

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.090 
aluminium extrusion out on the slide-out
and<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:42.180> slip<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.750> in<00:00:42.899> like<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.379> that's<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
and you slip it in like this that's the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.430 
and you slip it in like this that's the
cheapest<00:00:44.550> one<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.879> all<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.180> rubbers<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:45.870> we've

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
cheapest one of all the rubbers so we've

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.610 
cheapest one of all the rubbers so we've
got<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.800> Keystone<00:00:47.399> Oh<00:00:47.640> seal<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.629> we've<00:00:49.410> got

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
got the Keystone Oh seal and we've got

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.420 
got the Keystone Oh seal and we've got
the<00:00:49.829> Keystone<00:00:50.370> wipe<00:00:50.789> rubber<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.719> pushes<00:00:52.140> on

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
the Keystone wipe rubber that pushes on

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.590 
the Keystone wipe rubber that pushes on
we'll<00:00:53.430> go<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.699> have<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.879> look<00:00:54.090> at<00:00:54.210> some<00:00:54.449> other

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
we'll go and have a look at some other

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.260 
we'll go and have a look at some other
units<00:00:55.050> used<00:00:55.320> on<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:56.120> heartlands<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:57.210> the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
units used on the heartlands in the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.349 
units used on the heartlands in the
Forest<00:00:57.629> River<00:00:57.809> Gear<00:00:58.670> right<00:00:59.670> here's<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.149> most

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
Forest River Gear right here's the most

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.939 
Forest River Gear right here's the most
popular<00:01:00.930> one<00:01:01.109> that's<00:01:01.260> found<00:01:01.590> on<00:01:01.710> all<00:01:01.859> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
popular one that's found on all the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.560 
popular one that's found on all the
fifth<00:01:02.190> wheelers<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:02.879> there's<00:01:03.149> heaps<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.510> them

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
fifth wheelers so there's heaps of them

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.210 
fifth wheelers so there's heaps of them
in<00:01:03.780> Australia<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.320> have<00:01:04.409> got<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.739> it's

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
in Australia that have got this it's

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.910 
in Australia that have got this it's
called<00:01:05.549> an<00:01:05.670> EK<00:01:06.240> track<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.380> there's<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.590> track

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
called an EK track so there's a track

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.600 
called an EK track so there's a track
here<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.510> the<00:01:09.510> bulb<00:01:09.810> seal<00:01:10.140> clips<00:01:10.680> onto<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.130> EK

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
here and the bulb seal clips onto the EK

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.170 
here and the bulb seal clips onto the EK
track<00:01:12.350> so<00:01:13.350> that's<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.890> finished<00:01:14.280> product<00:01:14.820> in

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
track so that's the finished product in

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.950 
track so that's the finished product in
there<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.560> both<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.159> items<00:01:17.640> are<00:01:17.909> on<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.750> wall

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
there so both the items are on the wall

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.870 
there so both the items are on the wall
of<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.200> fifth<00:01:19.439> wheeler<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:19.979> there's<00:01:20.400> nothing

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
of the fifth wheeler and there's nothing

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.690 
of the fifth wheeler and there's nothing
out<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.420> aluminium<00:01:21.659> extrusion<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:23.340> this

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
out on the aluminium extrusion so this

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.969 
out on the aluminium extrusion so this
one's<00:01:23.970> got<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.390> it's<00:01:24.540> white<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.290> white<00:01:25.560> bulb

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
one's got it it's white the white bulb

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.429 
one's got it it's white the white bulb
seal<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.729> clipped<00:01:27.090> onto<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.450> ek<00:01:27.780> track<00:01:28.170> in

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
seal is clipped onto the ek track in

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.179 
seal is clipped onto the ek track in
there<00:01:29.400> this<00:01:29.939> wears<00:01:30.270> out<00:01:30.570> or<00:01:30.720> stays<00:01:31.020> flat<00:01:31.590> and

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
there this wears out or stays flat and

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.859 
there this wears out or stays flat and
we<00:01:32.400> find<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.000> white<00:01:33.240> one's<00:01:33.570> not<00:01:33.840> too

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
we find that the white one's not too

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.020 
we find that the white one's not too
good<00:01:34.259> in<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.470> Sun<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.040> I've<00:01:35.159> only<00:01:35.340> got<00:01:35.640> black

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
good in the Sun so I've only got black

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.100 
good in the Sun so I've only got black
so<00:01:36.810> we've<00:01:37.049> got<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.530> ek<00:01:38.460> track<00:01:39.270> bulb<00:01:39.720> seal

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
so we've got the ek track bulb seal

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.170 
so we've got the ek track bulb seal
which<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.860> one<00:01:41.040> it's<00:01:41.670> about<00:01:41.729> an<00:01:42.030> inch

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
which is that one it's about an inch

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.690 
which is that one it's about an inch
wide<00:01:42.270> or<00:01:42.479> 23<00:01:43.350> Miller<00:01:43.590> thing<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.130> we've<00:01:44.520> got

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.030 
the ek track and white rubber heartland
Sundance<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.750> typical<00:01:49.290> one<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.619> runs<00:01:49.770> it

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
Sundance is a typical one that runs it

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.749 
Sundance is a typical one that runs it
