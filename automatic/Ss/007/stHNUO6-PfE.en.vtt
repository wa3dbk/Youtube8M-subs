Stanford<00:00:05.430> University<00:00:07.280> what<00:00:08.280> we're<00:00:08.460> proposing

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
Stanford University what we're proposing

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.900 
Stanford University what we're proposing
is<00:00:09.330> let's<00:00:09.630> open<00:00:10.139> up<00:00:10.290> camera<00:00:11.070> architectures<00:00:11.759> so

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
is let's open up camera architectures so

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.360 
is let's open up camera architectures so
that<00:00:12.059> anyone<00:00:12.330> can<00:00:12.929> reprogram<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.740> camera<00:00:14.250> and

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
that anyone can reprogram a camera and

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.400 
that anyone can reprogram a camera and
that's<00:00:15.330> what<00:00:15.570> we're<00:00:15.719> building<00:00:15.809> will<00:00:16.170> have<00:00:16.350> a

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
that's what we're building will have a

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.160 
that's what we're building will have a
paper<00:00:17.010> at<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:18.180> somers<00:00:18.510> computer<00:00:18.810> graphics

conference the siggraph conference and
will<00:00:21.660> be<00:00:21.900> releasing<00:00:22.619> code<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:23.730> runs<00:00:23.880> on

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
will be releasing code that runs on

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.150 
will be releasing code that runs on
nokia<00:00:24.689> smartphones<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.650> anyone<00:00:25.859> can

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
nokia smartphones so that anyone can

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.279 
nokia smartphones so that anyone can
reprogram<00:00:26.580> their<00:00:27.029> nokia<00:00:27.359> smartphone<00:00:27.810> the

release our FK API it's pretty dark in
this<00:00:34.050> room<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.410> normally<00:00:35.219> you'd<00:00:35.309> have<00:00:35.340> no

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
hope of capturing a blur-free handheld

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.790 
hope of capturing a blur-free handheld
shot<00:00:38.600> sometimes<00:00:39.600> however<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:40.110> do<00:00:40.260> get<00:00:40.440> lucky

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
shot sometimes however you do get lucky

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.650 
shot sometimes however you do get lucky
and<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.550> manage<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.910> capture<00:00:42.059> one<00:00:42.360> where<00:00:42.570> your

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
and you manage to capture one where your

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.720 
and you manage to capture one where your
hand<00:00:42.840> happen<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.290> be<00:00:43.379> still<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:43.860> it's<00:00:44.640> going

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
hand happen to be still and it's going

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.060 
hand happen to be still and it's going
to<00:00:44.789> take<00:00:45.030> about<00:00:45.149> ten<00:00:45.660> shots<00:00:46.020> each<00:00:46.739> with<00:00:47.039> a

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
to take about ten shots each with a

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.610 
to take about ten shots each with a
third<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.520> second<00:00:47.850> exposure<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.539> over<00:00:49.500> about

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
third of a second exposure in over about

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.889 
third of a second exposure in over about
three<00:00:49.920> seconds<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.420> was<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.600> sharpest

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
three seconds so this was the sharpest

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.270 
three seconds so this was the sharpest
shot<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.440> 10<00:00:52.620> which<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.010> one<00:00:53.129> would

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
shot of the 10 which is the one would

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.279 
shot of the 10 which is the one would
save<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.610> disk<00:00:53.760> just<00:00:54.360> for<00:00:54.480> fun<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:54.840> also<00:00:54.989> saved

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
save to disk just for fun we also saved

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.950 
save to disk just for fun we also saved
the<00:00:55.469> worst<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.010> ten<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.690> you<00:00:57.690> can<00:00:57.840> see

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
the worst of the ten and you can see

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.389 
the worst of the ten and you can see
that<00:00:58.109> it's<00:00:58.230> hopelessly<00:00:58.559> motion<00:00:58.980> blurred<00:00:59.160> so

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
that it's hopelessly motion blurred so

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.610 
that it's hopelessly motion blurred so
this<00:00:59.550> works<00:00:59.760> pretty<00:00:59.969> reliably<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:01.260> just<00:01:01.440> looks

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
this works pretty reliably it just looks

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.049 
this works pretty reliably it just looks
at<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.859> image<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.309> see<00:01:02.430> whether<00:01:02.609> it's<00:01:02.820> blurry

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
at the image to see whether it's blurry

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.640 
at the image to see whether it's blurry
or<00:01:03.180> sharp<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.809> saves<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.350> one<00:01:04.470> that's

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
or sharp and saves the one that's

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.350 
or sharp and saves the one that's
sharpest<00:01:04.949> out<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.250> 10<00:01:05.430> we're<00:01:05.880> working<00:01:06.030> on

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
sharpest out of the 10 we're working on

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.310 
sharpest out of the 10 we're working on
two<00:01:06.630> platforms<00:01:06.930> one<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.400> nokia<00:01:08.640> phones

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
two platforms one is the nokia phones

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.109 
two platforms one is the nokia phones
down<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.560> which<00:01:10.710> people<00:01:10.920> can<00:01:11.189> load<00:01:11.430> software

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
down to which people can load software

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.649 
down to which people can load software
and<00:01:12.510> reprogram<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.140> where<00:01:13.530> we<00:01:13.830> are<00:01:13.890> working<00:01:14.130> on

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
and reprogram it where we are working on

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.350 
and reprogram it where we are working on
to<00:01:15.659> make<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:16.189> applications<00:01:17.189> more<00:01:17.369> robust<00:01:17.939> so

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
to make this applications more robust so

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.820 
to make this applications more robust so
that<00:01:18.540> we<00:01:18.689> could<00:01:18.869> make<00:01:19.110> them<00:01:19.259> available<00:01:19.409> for

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
that we could make them available for

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.950 
that we could make them available for
consumers<00:01:20.520> because<00:01:21.270> they<00:01:21.420> are<00:01:21.509> still<00:01:21.659> close

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
consumers because they are still close

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.380 
consumers because they are still close
enough<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.380> each<00:01:22.500> other<00:01:22.710> we<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.189> combine<00:01:23.430> to

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
enough to each other we can combine to

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.780 
enough to each other we can combine to
take<00:01:24.780> ten<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.259> best<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.860> both<00:01:26.070> worlds<00:01:26.640> so

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
take ten of the best of both worlds so

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.819 
take ten of the best of both worlds so
we<00:01:26.939> can<00:01:27.060> get<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.509> smoother<00:01:27.930> colors<00:01:28.320> what<00:01:28.710> we

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
we can get the smoother colors what we

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.980 
we can get the smoother colors what we
want<00:01:29.040> hope<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.400> do<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.880> put<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.509> what<00:01:30.869> we

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
want hope to do is to put this what we

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.200 
want hope to do is to put this what we
just<00:01:31.200> showed<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:32.100> put<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.000> cell

that's what's pictured here as our
larger<00:01:42.240> Franken<00:01:42.659> camera<00:01:43.020> when<00:01:43.320> we<00:01:43.409> program

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
larger Franken camera when we program

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.109 
larger Franken camera when we program
this<00:01:43.829> camera<00:01:44.100> we<00:01:44.220> can<00:01:44.340> program<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.729> it's

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
this camera we can program it it's

completely open we will publish all the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.940 
completely open we will publish all the
details<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.750> system<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.229> anybody<00:01:49.439> can<00:01:49.710> add

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
details of the system so anybody can add

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.130 
details of the system so anybody can add
on<00:01:50.159> new<00:01:50.369> hardware<00:01:50.759> bits<00:01:51.030> like<00:01:51.450> we've<00:01:51.659> got<00:01:51.840> two

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
on new hardware bits like we've got two

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.800 
on new hardware bits like we've got two
flashes<00:01:52.860> there<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.549> then<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.210> idea<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.659> you

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
flashes there and then the idea is you

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.840 
flashes there and then the idea is you
can<00:01:55.170> program<00:01:55.320> them<00:01:55.649> however<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:56.130> want<00:01:56.159> so

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
can program them however you want so

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.010 
can program them however you want so
what<00:01:57.000> we<00:01:57.119> did<00:01:57.270> in<00:01:57.390> this<00:01:57.479> case<00:01:57.540> was<00:01:57.869> we

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
what we did in this case was we

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.899 
what we did in this case was we
programmed<00:01:58.409> one<00:01:58.649> flash<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.399> strobe

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
programmed one flash to strobe

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.109 
programmed one flash to strobe
continuously<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.649> second<00:02:02.009> flash<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.969> do

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
continuously and the second flash to do

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.429 
continuously and the second flash to do
what's<00:02:03.299> called<00:02:03.479> second<00:02:03.930> curtain<00:02:04.170> sync

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
what's called second curtain sync

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.590 
what's called second curtain sync
meaning<00:02:04.829> flash<00:02:05.100> strongly<00:02:05.850> at<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.210> end<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.479> the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
meaning flash strongly at the end of the

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.330 
meaning flash strongly at the end of the
shot<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.380> if<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.710> throw<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.890> bunch<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.129> cards

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
shot and if you throw a bunch of cards

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.529 
shot and if you throw a bunch of cards
in<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.580> air<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.879> do<00:02:09.090> those<00:02:09.270> two<00:02:09.509> things

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
in the air and do those two things

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.440 
in the air and do those two things
strobing<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.709> second<00:02:11.640> curtain<00:02:11.879> sync<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.330> get

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
strobing and second curtain sync you get

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.730 
strobing and second curtain sync you get
a<00:02:12.480> picture<00:02:12.690> like<00:02:12.870> this<00:02:13.050> one

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
a picture like this one

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.290 
a picture like this one
reason<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.190> mobile<00:02:14.580> manufacturers

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
reason that the mobile manufacturers

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.940 
reason that the mobile manufacturers
seem<00:02:15.690> to<00:02:15.810> be<00:02:15.900> ahead<00:02:16.020> of<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.350> traditional

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
seem to be ahead of the traditional

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.790 
seem to be ahead of the traditional
camera<00:02:17.340> makers<00:02:17.670> here<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.150> because<00:02:18.750> this<00:02:19.590> is

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
camera makers here is because this is

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.560 
camera makers here is because this is
about<00:02:20.010> software<00:02:20.610> more<00:02:21.150> than<00:02:21.300> it's<00:02:21.420> about

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
about software more than it's about

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.750 
about software more than it's about
hardware<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.260> mobile<00:02:23.220> manufacturers

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
hardware and the mobile manufacturers

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:31.180 
hardware and the mobile manufacturers
are<00:02:24.150> very<00:02:24.300> comfortable<00:02:24.720> with<00:02:24.780> software

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190
