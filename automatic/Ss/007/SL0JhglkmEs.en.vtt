00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:11.989
 and the real advantage of robotic surgery was basically 

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:16.999
 in having a very accurate view of what the operating field is 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:18.029
 of having 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.409
 astute tools absolutely precise 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:25.819
 and with excellent mobility to be able to afford to do 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:30.849
 inside from the beauty of the patient's body what he did not allow 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.890
 laparoscopy and here I had rigid instrument in that movement comes 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.810
 in the hands of the surgeon who is out of the operating field here instead at the 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.770
 robotic arm that moves inside the coconut ice cream al 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.640
 patient movements so ended 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.609
 so tenfold without the minimum for love 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:54.559
 and with such delicate instruments for which a megastreaming surgery 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.470
 you can think of completing cont 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.470
 greater chances of success 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.780
 any technology or any surgical approach one must ask oneself 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.420
 online gossip function of a cancer indication that ours 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.900
 primary goal that we are treating a tumor here is robotic surgery 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.939
 definitely respect to what 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.100
 my experience of being latin from that age has enormous potential from 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.020
 this point of view, however 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.860
 the features a of the equipment actually us 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.410
 this is also important to retrace the same type of intervention we do 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.719
 in open surgery 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:39.829
 It's a let's go to take bobicic kings and amplification of 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:41.450
 images with the camera 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.170
 such that this in the surgical field is much sharper 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.150
 there is - bleeding because we work intra-corporeally then with pressure 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.790
 positive the field and therefore cleaner we see better we have the tools 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.520
 they are particularly delicate 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.000
 we realized in the approach of that with this type of open to 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.880
 instrumentation 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.979
 as the name in the house you live in, the approach increases 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.359
 laparoscopic robot assisted decidedly intuitive 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:14.359
 which traditional laparoscopy is not 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:18.389
 in my view for various reasons 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:22.349
 1 the fact that we work in a three-dimensional view so we have a field 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.459
 which is very similar to what we regularly see of a depth 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.850
 and therefore obviously respect 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.009
 to the classic laparoscopic flat image where 

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:32.769
 being on its size 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.120
 orientation difficulties exist 2 we work perfectly 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:41.769
 correct on the operating field we have no intention of grains 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.959
 even an expert Lazio already open we do not even have interference 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.799
 of the help that is helping us but inevitably in open surgery 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.459
 you had used 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.199
 the wad hand the obstacle and learning indeed was 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:58.479
 absolutely brilliant from the point of view 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:03.029
 so let's talk about the result, let's talk about the result later 

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:05.959
 speaking of surgical time 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.789
 leopards and considering the first 19 patients we have an average time of 360 

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:11.739
 minutes 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:18.069
 in the following 19 our average time was 300 minutes of the last 19 that 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.069
 average time and status of 250 minutes 

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:26.269
 always considering the three groups of patients learning curves first 19 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.479
 second 19 thirds 19 we see that and bleeding has always remained for 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:34.489
 all three faces of the groups then from the first patient 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.449
 until the 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:41.569
 then 57 his patient into one 200 cc of average loss what into surgery 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.449
 this is very difficult for the uterus to hold 

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:47.229
 regarding continence 

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:52.259
 and we are talking about continence in three months continence 3 months 

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:54.019
 that is 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.139
 the first are the patients of second 19 thirds 19 of continence was three 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:03.579
 months in 70% of cases in all three groups so reality and is 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.639
 superimposable to what we have more open today 3 months 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.199
 we did not charge the patient 

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:13.790
 cult. is a murano with very important 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.259
 nothing in the ninco's field 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:19.999
 equally as regards sexual activity always in the 

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:22.139
 rake weighs 3 months 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:27.220
 three months after sexual activity in the first patients 19 19 19 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:31.629
 it stands at 33 32 27% so in reality 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:33.500
 there is a 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.909
 recovery of sexual activity one gene drupi 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:39.879
 first then from the first to 57th 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:42.740
 and not to variation compared to what 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:43.969
 the open activity
