00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.170 

I've<00:00:02.500> had<00:00:02.650> done<00:00:02.920> a<00:00:02.950> tutorial<00:00:03.430> a<00:00:03.700> while<00:00:03.879> so<00:00:04.149> I

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:04.180 
I've had done a tutorial a while so I

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.570 
I've had done a tutorial a while so I
thought<00:00:04.540> eh<00:00:04.779> I'll<00:00:05.590> make<00:00:05.770> one<00:00:05.980> to<00:00:06.130> answer<00:00:06.400> a

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:06.580 
thought eh I'll make one to answer a

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.580 
thought eh I'll make one to answer a
question<00:00:06.819> I've<00:00:07.089> had<00:00:07.210> a<00:00:07.240> few<00:00:07.450> people<00:00:07.600> asking

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:08.590 
question I've had a few people asking

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.580 
question I've had a few people asking
quite<00:00:08.860> often<00:00:09.040> recently<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:10.750> so<00:00:11.290> this<00:00:11.440> one

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:11.590 
quite often recently and so this one

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:12.810 
quite often recently and so this one
shouldn't<00:00:11.800> be<00:00:11.889> too<00:00:12.040> long<00:00:12.190> it's<00:00:12.580> going<00:00:12.700> to<00:00:12.760> be

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:12.820 
shouldn't be too long it's going to be

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.589 
shouldn't be too long it's going to be
how<00:00:13.330> to<00:00:13.360> loop<00:00:14.230> a<00:00:14.639> particle<00:00:15.639> effect<00:00:15.790> in<00:00:16.209> a<00:00:16.299> gif

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:16.599 
how to loop a particle effect in a gif

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.229 
how to loop a particle effect in a gif
um<00:00:17.009> like<00:00:18.009> I<00:00:18.039> have<00:00:18.310> here<00:00:18.550> you<00:00:18.699> can<00:00:18.730> see<00:00:19.029> that

00:00:19.229 --> 00:00:19.239 
um like I have here you can see that

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:21.239 
um like I have here you can see that
there's<00:00:19.509> there's<00:00:19.960> no<00:00:20.140> transition<00:00:20.829> that<00:00:21.159> you

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:21.249 
there's there's no transition that you

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:22.919 
there's there's no transition that you
can<00:00:21.399> see<00:00:21.550> where<00:00:21.759> suddenly<00:00:21.999> the<00:00:22.480> particles

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:22.929 
can see where suddenly the particles

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:25.139 
can see where suddenly the particles
jump<00:00:23.229> being<00:00:23.769> the<00:00:23.890> particles<00:00:24.339> are<00:00:24.489> completely

00:00:25.139 --> 00:00:25.149 
jump being the particles are completely

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:28.429 
jump being the particles are completely
random<00:00:25.390> you<00:00:26.140> can't<00:00:26.380> really<00:00:26.710> animate<00:00:27.429> them

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
random you can't really animate them

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.400 
random you can't really animate them
can't<00:00:29.439> loop<00:00:29.710> them<00:00:29.979> so<00:00:30.630> but<00:00:31.630> in<00:00:31.869> here<00:00:32.050> you<00:00:32.230> see

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
can't loop them so but in here you see

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.160 
can't loop them so but in here you see
that<00:00:32.649> you<00:00:32.920> really<00:00:33.309> can't<00:00:33.670> see<00:00:33.879> the<00:00:34.030> seam<00:00:34.329> where

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
that you really can't see the seam where

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.560 
that you really can't see the seam where
the<00:00:35.230> the<00:00:35.859> loop<00:00:36.039> goes<00:00:36.219> to<00:00:36.370> restart<00:00:36.730> so<00:00:36.940> I'm

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
the the loop goes to restart so I'm

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.029 
the the loop goes to restart so I'm
gonna<00:00:37.660> show<00:00:37.960> you<00:00:37.989> a<00:00:38.079> trick<00:00:38.350> that<00:00:38.410> I<00:00:38.649> learned<00:00:38.829> on

00:00:39.029 --> 00:00:39.039 
gonna show you a trick that I learned on

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.860 
gonna show you a trick that I learned on
how<00:00:39.219> to<00:00:39.280> make<00:00:39.609> these<00:00:39.760> loop<00:00:40.000> it<00:00:40.539> may<00:00:40.690> not<00:00:40.809> work

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
how to make these loop it may not work

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.660 
how to make these loop it may not work
all<00:00:41.199> the<00:00:41.320> time<00:00:41.350> but<00:00:41.620> anything<00:00:42.100> that<00:00:42.219> kind<00:00:42.460> of

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
all the time but anything that kind of

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.549 
all the time but anything that kind of
random<00:00:43.179> and<00:00:43.359> moving<00:00:43.839> in<00:00:43.929> the<00:00:43.989> background<00:00:44.199> like

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
random and moving in the background like

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.880 
random and moving in the background like
this<00:00:44.800> it<00:00:45.579> should<00:00:45.850> work<00:00:46.059> with<00:00:46.269> the<00:00:47.260> way<00:00:47.379> I<00:00:47.410> do<00:00:47.620> it

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
this it should work with the way I do it

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.259 
this it should work with the way I do it
is<00:00:48.010> going<00:00:48.129> to<00:00:48.219> be<00:00:48.309> in<00:00:48.399> Photoshop<00:00:48.940> there's

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
is going to be in Photoshop there's

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:50.279 
is going to be in Photoshop there's
going<00:00:49.390> to<00:00:49.449> be<00:00:49.510> other<00:00:49.660> ways<00:00:49.780> you<00:00:50.050> can<00:00:50.140> probably

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 
going to be other ways you can probably

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:52.349 
going to be other ways you can probably
do<00:00:50.499> it<00:00:50.530> as<00:00:50.739> well<00:00:50.920> but<00:00:51.249> this<00:00:51.489> is<00:00:51.670> the<00:00:51.879> way<00:00:51.999> that<00:00:52.179> I

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:52.359 
do it as well but this is the way that I

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:54.509 
do it as well but this is the way that I
kind<00:00:52.600> of<00:00:52.719> know<00:00:52.780> how<00:00:52.989> you<00:00:53.980> can<00:00:54.100> do<00:00:54.190> it<00:00:54.309> in<00:00:54.429> an

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519 
kind of know how you can do it in an

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:56.430 
kind of know how you can do it in an
aftereffect<00:00:54.820> as<00:00:55.089> well<00:00:55.300> but<00:00:55.659> I'm<00:00:56.230> going<00:00:56.289> to

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
aftereffect as well but I'm going to

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.869 
aftereffect as well but I'm going to
show<00:00:56.530> you<00:00:56.620> how<00:00:56.739> to<00:00:56.769> do<00:00:56.980> in<00:00:57.100> here<00:00:57.309> and<00:00:57.519> I'm<00:00:57.609> using

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
show you how to do in here and I'm using

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.369 
show you how to do in here and I'm using
Photoshop<00:00:59.100> Creative<00:01:00.100> Cloud<00:01:00.460> version<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:01.690> I'm

here one I just did recently with little

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.139 
here one I just did recently with little
pip<00:01:07.600> here<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.979> I'm<00:01:09.490> not<00:01:09.579> sure<00:01:09.759> how<00:01:09.850> to<00:01:09.909> make<00:01:10.119> a

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
pip here and I'm not sure how to make a

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:12.359 
pip here and I'm not sure how to make a
gif<00:01:10.360> just<00:01:10.689> kind<00:01:10.930> of<00:01:11.079> how<00:01:11.439> to<00:01:11.470> how<00:01:12.040> to<00:01:12.070> do<00:01:12.340> this

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369

portion of it so you don't know how to

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.510 
portion of it so you don't know how to
make<00:01:13.899> a<00:01:13.960> gif<00:01:14.200> make<00:01:14.590> you<00:01:14.950> look<00:01:15.130> somewhere<00:01:15.430> else

here so I'm just going to open up and
this<00:01:18.640> is<00:01:18.759> 30<00:01:18.939> frames<00:01:19.090> per<00:01:19.240> second<00:01:20.100> this

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
this is 30 frames per second this

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.760 
this is 30 frames per second this
animation<00:01:21.549> and<00:01:22.049> if<00:01:23.049> you<00:01:23.290> don't<00:01:23.469> have<00:01:23.649> the

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
animation and if you don't have the

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.069 
animation and if you don't have the
timeline<00:01:24.009> open<00:01:24.549> under<00:01:25.299> window<00:01:25.600> little<00:01:25.840> Evie

window here now this is a 5 second

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:35.520 
window here now this is a 5 second
animation<00:01:34.450> but<00:01:34.810> you'll<00:01:34.930> notice<00:01:35.110> I<00:01:35.229> actually

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
animation but you'll notice I actually

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.910 
animation but you'll notice I actually
have<00:01:35.860> 15<00:01:36.460> seconds<00:01:37.000> here<00:01:37.270> whenever<00:01:38.140> I<00:01:38.350> export

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
have 15 seconds here whenever I export

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.370 
have 15 seconds here whenever I export
just<00:01:39.310> about<00:01:39.460> any<00:01:39.700> animation<00:01:40.299> I<00:01:40.539> make<00:01:41.140> sure

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
just about any animation I make sure

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.099 
just about any animation I make sure
that<00:01:41.590> I<00:01:41.860> have<00:01:42.250> all<00:01:42.640> three<00:01:43.509> times<00:01:43.750> but<00:01:43.960> I'll

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.109

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:47.910 
that I have all three times but I'll
technically<00:01:44.740> need<00:01:45.070> um<00:01:46.350> that's<00:01:47.350> to<00:01:47.649> play<00:01:47.890> a

technically need um that's to play a

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.510 
technically need um that's to play a
little<00:01:48.159> bit<00:01:48.369> safe<00:01:48.640> but<00:01:49.329> oh<00:01:49.750> and<00:01:50.469> also<00:01:50.979> you<00:01:51.340> can

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
little bit safe but oh and also you can

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.429 
little bit safe but oh and also you can
custom<00:01:51.909> the<00:01:52.030> issues<00:01:52.299> I<00:01:52.509> closing<00:01:53.049> so<00:01:53.200> you<00:01:53.289> want

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
custom the issues I closing so you want

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.020 
custom the issues I closing so you want
to<00:01:53.530> have<00:01:53.619> a<00:01:53.680> little<00:01:53.920> bit<00:01:54.009> of<00:01:54.039> buffer<00:01:54.369> room<00:01:54.490> but

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
to have a little bit of buffer room but

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.249 
to have a little bit of buffer room but
I'll<00:01:55.180> show<00:01:55.359> you<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:55.600> other<00:01:55.630> reason<00:01:55.810> that<00:01:56.079> I'd

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
I'll show you the other reason that I'd

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.819 
I'll show you the other reason that I'd
do<00:01:56.380> this<00:01:56.500> though<00:01:57.250> if<00:01:57.579> you<00:01:58.299> look<00:01:58.649> I'm<00:01:59.649> just

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829 
do this though if you look I'm just

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:00.719 
do this though if you look I'm just
going<00:01:59.950> to<00:01:59.979> grab<00:02:00.070> the<00:02:00.219> middle<00:02:00.460> here<00:02:00.640> because

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
going to grab the middle here because

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.520 
going to grab the middle here because
it's<00:02:00.969> Ava<00:02:01.179> spot<00:02:01.479> so<00:02:01.719> I'm<00:02:01.810> going<00:02:01.929> to<00:02:02.020> move<00:02:02.289> these

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
it's Ava spot so I'm going to move these

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.179 
it's Ava spot so I'm going to move these
bars<00:02:02.829> and<00:02:02.950> that<00:02:04.229> we're<00:02:05.229> selecting<00:02:05.649> only<00:02:05.770> 5

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
bars and that we're selecting only 5

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:08.820 
bars and that we're selecting only 5
second<00:02:06.609> range<00:02:06.789> now<00:02:07.539> you<00:02:07.600> see<00:02:07.899> if<00:02:08.289> I<00:02:08.440> let<00:02:08.650> this

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
second range now you see if I let this

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.690 
second range now you see if I let this
buffer<00:02:09.310> here<00:02:09.550> I<00:02:10.260> off<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.470> animation

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
buffer here I off the animation

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.440 
buffer here I off the animation
date<00:02:13.680> that<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.980> models<00:02:15.430> themselves<00:02:15.700> will<00:02:16.300> be

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
date that the models themselves will be

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.120 
date that the models themselves will be
a<00:02:16.780> good<00:02:17.380> loop<00:02:17.640> in<00:02:18.640> here<00:02:18.849> um<00:02:19.830> you'll<00:02:20.830> see<00:02:20.890> those

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
a good loop in here um you'll see those

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.699 
a good loop in here um you'll see those
of<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.430> models<00:02:22.090> loop<00:02:22.300> smoothly<00:02:22.959> but<00:02:23.620> as

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
of the the models loop smoothly but as

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.620 
of the the models loop smoothly but as
soon<00:02:23.860> as<00:02:23.920> it<00:02:24.040> hits<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:24.280> end<00:02:24.459> here<00:02:24.849> you'll

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
soon as it hits the end here you'll

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.870 
soon as it hits the end here you'll
notice<00:02:25.870> that<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.860> background<00:02:27.310> changes<00:02:27.610> will

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
notice that the background changes will

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.400 
notice that the background changes will
that<00:02:28.090> cloud<00:02:28.420> effect<00:02:28.599> that<00:02:28.900> I<00:02:28.930> have<00:02:29.140> is

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
that cloud effect that I have is

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.600 
that cloud effect that I have is
particles<00:02:30.840> so<00:02:31.840> they're<00:02:32.709> moving<00:02:32.980> but<00:02:33.310> as<00:02:33.430> soon

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
particles so they're moving but as soon

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.059 
particles so they're moving but as soon
as<00:02:33.670> this<00:02:33.880> loop<00:02:34.060> goes<00:02:34.420> to<00:02:34.569> restart<00:02:35.020> if<00:02:35.260> I<00:02:35.860> keep

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
as this loop goes to restart if I keep

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.410 
as this loop goes to restart if I keep
going<00:02:36.220> past<00:02:36.520> this<00:02:36.760> point<00:02:36.940> you'll<00:02:37.030> notice<00:02:37.120> it's

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
going past this point you'll notice it's

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.520 
going past this point you'll notice it's
smooth<00:02:37.630> well<00:02:37.870> that's<00:02:37.989> because<00:02:38.140> I'm<00:02:38.319> going

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
smooth well that's because I'm going

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.309 
smooth well that's because I'm going
into<00:02:38.709> an<00:02:38.769> area<00:02:38.950> that<00:02:39.280> I'm<00:02:40.180> not<00:02:40.239> if<00:02:40.930> it's<00:02:41.170> not

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
into an area that I'm not if it's not

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.589 
into an area that I'm not if it's not
looped<00:02:41.680> it's<00:02:41.890> not<00:02:42.040> restarting<00:02:42.670> as<00:02:43.239> soon<00:02:43.480> as

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
looped it's not restarting as soon as

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:44.970 
looped it's not restarting as soon as
this<00:02:43.720> actually<00:02:44.140> does<00:02:44.290> restart<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:44.739> notice

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
this actually does restart you notice

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.309 
this actually does restart you notice
the<00:02:45.160> clouds<00:02:45.310> will<00:02:45.640> skip<00:02:45.970> ahead<00:02:46.150> that's<00:02:47.140> not

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
the clouds will skip ahead that's not

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:48.479 
the clouds will skip ahead that's not
going<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:47.530> affect<00:02:47.769> you<00:02:47.830> want<00:02:48.069> you<00:02:48.220> can<00:02:48.340> see

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
going to affect you want you can see

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:49.920 
going to affect you want you can see
that<00:02:48.640> Seaman<00:02:49.030> it<00:02:49.120> actually<00:02:49.420> makes<00:02:49.600> it<00:02:49.720> feel

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
that Seaman it actually makes it feel

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.539 
that Seaman it actually makes it feel
like<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.140> model<00:02:50.590> themselves<00:02:50.769> are<00:02:51.250> skipping

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
like the model themselves are skipping

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.840 
like the model themselves are skipping
so<00:02:52.450> you<00:02:53.350> can<00:02:53.560> cheat<00:02:54.100> and<00:02:54.280> fix<00:02:54.459> this<00:02:54.580> a<00:02:54.640> little

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
so you can cheat and fix this a little

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.850 
so you can cheat and fix this a little
bit<00:02:55.030> this<00:02:55.780> is<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:55.989> reason<00:02:56.350> that<00:02:56.440> I<00:02:56.500> have<00:02:56.830> a

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
bit this is the reason that I have a

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.770 
bit this is the reason that I have a
little<00:02:57.220> bit<00:02:57.310> of<00:02:57.370> this<00:02:57.459> buffer<00:02:57.790> room<00:02:57.940> if<00:02:58.150> you

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
little bit of this buffer room if you

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.220 
little bit of this buffer room if you
look<00:02:59.220> here<00:03:00.220> if<00:03:00.880> I<00:03:01.000> start<00:03:01.299> here<00:03:01.660> even<00:03:02.140> though

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
look here if I start here even though

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.930 
look here if I start here even though
this<00:03:02.319> were<00:03:02.500> isn't<00:03:02.680> an<00:03:02.950> area<00:03:03.130> that's<00:03:03.370> currently

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
this were isn't an area that's currently

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.809 
this were isn't an area that's currently
in<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.120> animation<00:03:04.450> it<00:03:05.200> does<00:03:06.040> smoothly<00:03:06.459> go

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
in the animation it does smoothly go

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.880 
in the animation it does smoothly go
into<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.090> next<00:03:07.330> one<00:03:07.420> though<00:03:08.110> this<00:03:08.410> is<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.709> key

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
into the next one though this is the key

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.500 
into the next one though this is the key
right<00:03:09.040> here<00:03:09.100> is<00:03:09.340> making<00:03:09.549> trying<00:03:09.970> to<00:03:10.060> get<00:03:10.239> this

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
right here is making trying to get this

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.930 
right here is making trying to get this
transition<00:03:11.290> to<00:03:11.769> work<00:03:11.950> instead<00:03:12.340> of<00:03:12.489> going<00:03:12.819> from

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
transition to work instead of going from

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
the end of this to here so what I'm

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.880 
the end of this to here so what I'm
going<00:03:15.610> to<00:03:15.670> do<00:03:15.790> here<00:03:16.090> is<00:03:16.239> I'm<00:03:17.019> going<00:03:17.380> to<00:03:17.470> split

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
going to do here is I'm going to split

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.880 
going to do here is I'm going to split
this<00:03:18.010> video<00:03:18.489> or<00:03:18.940> a<00:03:19.000> split<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.660> saw<00:03:20.290> this<00:03:20.680> image

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
this video or a split the saw this image

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.400 
this video or a split the saw this image
sequence<00:03:21.310> right<00:03:21.370> here<00:03:21.579> I'll<00:03:21.959> put<00:03:22.959> that<00:03:23.140> it's

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
sequence right here I'll put that it's

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.670 
sequence right here I'll put that it's
two<00:03:23.620> pieces<00:03:24.040> and<00:03:24.250> then<00:03:25.090> a<00:03:25.150> group<00:03:25.450> drag<00:03:25.900> one

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
two pieces and then a group drag one

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.890 
two pieces and then a group drag one
down<00:03:26.950> but<00:03:27.850> now<00:03:27.970> they<00:03:28.180> aren't<00:03:28.329> two<00:03:28.540> separate

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
down but now they aren't two separate

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.210 
down but now they aren't two separate
timelines<00:03:29.940> now<00:03:31.260> I'm<00:03:32.260> going<00:03:32.470> to<00:03:32.530> move<00:03:32.769> this<00:03:33.010> one

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
timelines now I'm going to move this one

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.039 
timelines now I'm going to move this one
over<00:03:33.430> well<00:03:33.910> I'll<00:03:34.209> keep<00:03:34.450> it<00:03:34.570> within<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:34.810> range

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
over well I'll keep it within the range

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.340 
over well I'll keep it within the range
here<00:03:35.230> so<00:03:35.470> I'll<00:03:35.590> move<00:03:36.060> this<00:03:37.060> this<00:03:37.750> is<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.049> front

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
here so I'll move this this is the front

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.870 
here so I'll move this this is the front
piece<00:03:38.590> this<00:03:38.799> is<00:03:38.859> the<00:03:38.950> front<00:03:39.310> third<00:03:39.549> and<00:03:39.820> this

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
piece this is the front third and this

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.930 
piece this is the front third and this
is<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.209> second<00:03:40.600> to<00:03:40.720> third<00:03:40.930> so<00:03:41.109> that's<00:03:41.410> the

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
is the second to third so that's the

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.880 
is the second to third so that's the
first<00:03:42.940> third<00:03:43.120> second<00:03:44.049> third<00:03:44.230> and<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.859> last

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
first third second third and the last

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.729 
first third second third and the last
third<00:03:45.329> now<00:03:46.329> this<00:03:46.989> is<00:03:47.170> that<00:03:47.290> point<00:03:47.530> of

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
third now this is that point of

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.590 
third now this is that point of
transition<00:03:48.190> that<00:03:48.250> was<00:03:48.430> smooth<00:03:48.670> so<00:03:49.000> from<00:03:49.239> from

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
transition that was smooth so from from

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.069 
transition that was smooth so from from
this<00:03:49.989> point<00:03:51.329> transitioning<00:03:52.329> to<00:03:52.480> this<00:03:52.720> point

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
this point transitioning to this point

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.580 
this point transitioning to this point
is<00:03:53.350> smooth<00:03:54.190> there<00:03:54.549> is<00:03:54.700> should<00:03:55.060> be<00:03:55.209> fine<00:03:55.590> so

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
is smooth there is should be fine so

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.920 
is smooth there is should be fine so
we're<00:03:57.040> going<00:03:57.160> to<00:03:57.250> use<00:03:57.370> a<00:03:57.400> little<00:03:57.670> bit<00:03:57.760> of<00:03:58.030> a

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
we're going to use a little bit of a

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.539 
we're going to use a little bit of a
transparency<00:03:59.620> effect<00:03:59.980> a<00:04:00.100> little<00:04:00.340> bit<00:04:00.459> of

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
transparency effect a little bit of

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.470 
transparency effect a little bit of
transition<00:04:01.030> so<00:04:01.959> I'm<00:04:02.200> at<00:04:02.290> a<00:04:02.319> keyframe<00:04:02.799> of<00:04:03.480> MSE

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
transition so I'm at a keyframe of MSE

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.539 
transition so I'm at a keyframe of MSE
I'm<00:04:04.720> gonna<00:04:04.870> do<00:04:04.930> about<00:04:05.109> two<00:04:05.260> seconds<00:04:05.620> here<00:04:05.799> I'm

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
I'm gonna do about two seconds here I'm

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:07.770 
I'm gonna do about two seconds here I'm
gonna<00:04:06.700> go<00:04:06.790> to<00:04:06.850> this<00:04:06.970> video<00:04:07.269> group<00:04:07.480> and<00:04:07.720> I'm

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
gonna go to this video group and I'm

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.610 
gonna go to this video group and I'm
gonna<00:04:07.930> be<00:04:08.739> frame<00:04:09.069> opacity<00:04:09.790> here<00:04:10.620> keyframe

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
gonna be frame opacity here keyframe

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.350 
gonna be frame opacity here keyframe
opacity

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
opacity

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.150 
opacity
the<00:04:13.900> very<00:04:14.170> end<00:04:14.470> right<00:04:14.830> there<00:04:16.950> just<00:04:17.950> a<00:04:17.980> little

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
the very end right there just a little

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.740 
the very end right there just a little
bit<00:04:18.250> more<00:04:18.580> I<00:04:18.760> want<00:04:19.090> to<00:04:19.150> catch<00:04:19.300> on<00:04:19.450> that<00:04:19.570> last

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
bit more I want to catch on that last

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.520 
bit more I want to catch on that last
stream<00:04:20.080> though<00:04:21.070> but<00:04:22.000> this<00:04:22.120> is<00:04:22.270> doing<00:04:22.660> it<00:04:23.140> all

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
stream though but this is doing it all

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.940 
stream though but this is doing it all
first<00:04:24.130> let's<00:04:24.610> go<00:04:24.760> back<00:04:24.940> to<00:04:25.060> this<00:04:25.120> other<00:04:25.270> one

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
first let's go back to this other one

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
first let's go back to this other one
I'm<00:04:26.950> going<00:04:27.070> to<00:04:27.130> set<00:04:27.340> this<00:04:27.430> one<00:04:27.640> to<00:04:27.700> zero<00:04:29.970> but

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
I'm going to set this one to zero but

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.390 
I'm going to set this one to zero but
what<00:04:31.180> the<00:04:31.270> saying<00:04:31.540> is<00:04:31.720> that<00:04:31.930> this<00:04:32.650> top<00:04:33.070> layer

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
what the saying is that this top layer

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:41.820 
what the saying is that this top layer
is<00:04:33.900> invisible<00:04:35.010> let's<00:04:36.010> go<00:04:37.710> there<00:04:38.710> we<00:04:38.800> go<00:04:38.890> oh<00:04:40.830> I'm

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
is invisible let's go there we go oh I'm

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.400 
is invisible let's go there we go oh I'm
breaking<00:04:42.280> things<00:04:42.520> okay<00:04:42.940> so<00:04:43.090> this<00:04:43.750> top<00:04:44.170> layer

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
breaking things okay so this top layer

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.660 
breaking things okay so this top layer
is<00:04:44.710> invisible<00:04:45.640> up<00:04:46.210> until<00:04:47.170> this<00:04:47.590> point<00:04:47.710> at<00:04:48.160> this

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:48.670 
is invisible up until this point at this

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.570 
is invisible up until this point at this
point<00:04:48.790> it<00:04:49.300> slowly<00:04:50.050> changes<00:04:50.620> interest<00:04:51.430> the

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
point it slowly changes interest the

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.940 
point it slowly changes interest the
opacity<00:04:51.820> until<00:04:52.630> this<00:04:52.750> point<00:04:53.020> where<00:04:53.200> it's<00:04:53.320> 100%

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
opacity until this point where it's 100%

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.760 
opacity until this point where it's 100%
you<00:04:54.070> can<00:04:54.190> see<00:04:54.430> here<00:04:55.300> it's<00:04:55.450> about<00:04:55.660> half<00:04:55.900> here

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
you can see here it's about half here

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.550 
you can see here it's about half here
it's<00:04:56.920> about<00:04:57.070> 20<00:04:57.370> step<00:04:57.610> 5%<00:04:58.150> so<00:04:58.780> this<00:04:59.230> is<00:04:59.410> saying

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
it's about 20 step 5% so this is saying

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.220 
it's about 20 step 5% so this is saying
it<00:04:59.740> in<00:05:00.630> you're<00:05:01.630> probably<00:05:01.810> used<00:05:02.020> to<00:05:02.050> key

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
it in you're probably used to key

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.280 
it in you're probably used to key
framing<00:05:02.470> if<00:05:02.650> you're<00:05:02.740> doing<00:05:02.920> the<00:05:02.980> animating<00:05:03.400> um

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
framing if you're doing the animating um

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.710 
framing if you're doing the animating um
so<00:05:05.370> right<00:05:06.370> now<00:05:06.520> I'm<00:05:06.640> seeing<00:05:06.910> this<00:05:07.090> below<00:05:07.420> one

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
so right now I'm seeing this below one

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.540 
so right now I'm seeing this below one
at<00:05:08.020> this<00:05:08.350> point<00:05:08.830> at<00:05:10.500> this<00:05:11.500> point<00:05:11.620> it<00:05:12.040> starts

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
at this point at this point it starts

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.320 
at this point at this point it starts
 transitioning<00:05:15.040> that<00:05:15.550> I<00:05:15.790> only<00:05:15.940> see<00:05:16.060> this

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
 transitioning that I only see this

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.360 
 transitioning that I only see this
top<00:05:16.570> layer<00:05:16.840> at<00:05:17.080> this<00:05:17.320> point<00:05:17.620> well<00:05:18.130> at<00:05:18.220> this

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
top layer at this point well at this

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.400 
top layer at this point well at this
point<00:05:18.490> now<00:05:18.910> when<00:05:19.180> this<00:05:19.300> transitions<00:05:19.870> back<00:05:20.350> to

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
point now when this transitions back to

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.290 
point now when this transitions back to
this<00:05:20.800> lower<00:05:21.010> one<00:05:21.220> is<00:05:21.430> going<00:05:21.640> to<00:05:21.730> be<00:05:21.850> perfectly

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
this lower one is going to be perfectly

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.120 
this lower one is going to be perfectly
smooth<00:05:22.600> because<00:05:22.780> that<00:05:23.080> is<00:05:23.290> that<00:05:23.470> point<00:05:23.770> where

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
smooth because that is that point where

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.280 
smooth because that is that point where
it<00:05:24.400> was<00:05:24.550> a<00:05:24.580> smooth<00:05:24.940> transition<00:05:25.360> from<00:05:25.990> one

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
it was a smooth transition from one

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.010 
it was a smooth transition from one
layer<00:05:26.440> to<00:05:26.470> the<00:05:26.740> next<00:05:27.070> but<00:05:27.610> now<00:05:27.910> if<00:05:28.480> I<00:05:28.630> buffer

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
layer to the next but now if I buffer

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.190 
layer to the next but now if I buffer
this<00:05:29.970> you<00:05:30.970> know<00:05:31.210> we<00:05:31.420> should<00:05:31.570> see<00:05:31.750> that<00:05:31.930> this

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
this you know we should see that this

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.160 
this you know we should see that this
this<00:05:32.830> endpoint<00:05:33.190> here<00:05:33.460> now<00:05:33.640> has<00:05:34.330> a<00:05:34.360> nice<00:05:34.840> smooth

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.170 
this endpoint here now has a nice smooth

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:39.900 
this endpoint here now has a nice smooth
transition<00:05:35.350> that<00:05:35.890> you<00:05:35.920> can't<00:05:36.250> notice<00:05:38.790> if<00:05:39.790> you

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
transition that you can't notice if you

if<00:05:48.520> you<00:05:48.610> may<00:05:48.730> give<00:05:49.000> this<00:05:49.150> too<00:05:49.450> short

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
if you may give this too short

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.560 
if you may give this too short

particle effect this having that little

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.330 
particle effect this having that little
buffer<00:05:56.169> is<00:05:56.230> going<00:05:56.410> to<00:05:56.470> be<00:05:56.590> very<00:05:57.040> difficult

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.340 
buffer is going to be very difficult

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.230 
buffer is going to be very difficult
because<00:05:57.640> you're<00:05:57.820> they're<00:05:57.910> gonna<00:05:58.000> have<00:05:58.150> to

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
because you're they're gonna have to

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.820 
because you're they're gonna have to
fade<00:05:58.480> the<00:05:58.660> whole<00:05:58.810> thing<00:05:59.110> which<00:05:59.290> could<00:05:59.470> destroy

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
fade the whole thing which could destroy

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.490 
fade the whole thing which could destroy
some<00:06:00.070> of<00:06:00.160> the<00:06:00.220> particle<00:06:00.550> effects<00:06:00.820> or<00:06:01.500> you're

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
some of the particle effects or you're

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.260 
some of the particle effects or you're
it's<00:06:02.860> going<00:06:03.100> to<00:06:03.160> be<00:06:03.250> very<00:06:03.460> noticeable<00:06:03.730> you're

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
it's going to be very noticeable you're

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.790 
it's going to be very noticeable you're
doing<00:06:04.630> so<00:06:04.930> there's<00:06:05.380> still<00:06:05.560> going<00:06:05.680> to<00:06:05.740> be

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
doing so there's still going to be

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.960 
doing so there's still going to be
situations<00:06:05.980> where<00:06:06.400> you're<00:06:06.490> not<00:06:06.520> going<00:06:06.850> to<00:06:06.910> be

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970 
situations where you're not going to be

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.080 
situations where you're not going to be
able<00:06:07.030> to<00:06:07.180> use<00:06:07.300> it<00:06:07.480> but<00:06:07.660> this<00:06:07.840> works<00:06:08.050> for<00:06:09.090> like

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.090 
able to use it but this works for like

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.560 
able to use it but this works for like
fog<00:06:10.390> effects<00:06:10.830> like<00:06:11.830> it<00:06:12.010> like<00:06:12.580> here<00:06:12.970> with<00:06:13.450> the

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:13.570 
fog effects like it like here with the

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.090 
fog effects like it like here with the
spinning<00:06:13.840> ones<00:06:13.990> there<00:06:14.169> is<00:06:14.320> a<00:06:14.350> transition<00:06:14.830> here

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
spinning ones there is a transition here

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.170 
spinning ones there is a transition here
where<00:06:15.250> they're<00:06:15.340> fading<00:06:15.700> but<00:06:15.820> you<00:06:15.940> but<00:06:16.090> we

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
where they're fading but you but we

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.380 
where they're fading but you but we
can't<00:06:16.390> tell<00:06:16.600> when<00:06:17.260> it<00:06:17.380> is<00:06:17.560> um<00:06:17.940> it<00:06:18.940> also<00:06:19.090> works

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.390 
can't tell when it is um it also works

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.190 
can't tell when it is um it also works
for<00:06:19.830> volumetric<00:06:20.830> lights<00:06:21.070> that<00:06:21.250> have<00:06:21.370> noise

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200 
for volumetric lights that have noise

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.659 
for volumetric lights that have noise
because<00:06:23.200> they'll<00:06:23.650> actually<00:06:24.040> shift<00:06:24.310> and<00:06:24.520> move

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:24.669 
because they'll actually shift and move

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:26.200 
because they'll actually shift and move
randomly

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210 
randomly

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.410 
randomly
and<00:06:27.040> it's<00:06:28.040> actually<00:06:28.250> just<00:06:28.820> a<00:06:29.000> whole<00:06:29.150> bunch<00:06:29.360> of

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:29.420 
and it's actually just a whole bunch of

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:31.840 
and it's actually just a whole bunch of
other<00:06:29.600> stuff<00:06:29.870> that<00:06:29.900> doing<00:06:30.740> this<00:06:31.220> can<00:06:31.670> actually

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:31.850 
other stuff that doing this can actually

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.150 
other stuff that doing this can actually
come<00:06:32.240> in<00:06:32.390> handy<00:06:32.810> with<00:06:33.080> and<00:06:33.350> I<00:06:33.680> try<00:06:33.710> to<00:06:33.920> do<00:06:34.070> it

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 
come in handy with and I try to do it

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.640 
come in handy with and I try to do it
for<00:06:34.310> most<00:06:34.430> up<00:06:34.700> and<00:06:34.880> don't<00:06:35.780> worry<00:06:36.050> about<00:06:36.380> you

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
for most up and don't worry about you

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.770 
for most up and don't worry about you
losing<00:06:36.920> like<00:06:37.280> focus<00:06:37.730> on<00:06:37.760> the<00:06:38.360> edges<00:06:38.630> of<00:06:38.720> the

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:38.780 
losing like focus on the edges of the

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.550 
losing like focus on the edges of the
model<00:06:39.140> because<00:06:40.630> the<00:06:41.630> animation<00:06:41.900> should<00:06:42.380> be

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 
model because the animation should be

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.710 
model because the animation should be
and<00:06:42.860> as<00:06:42.950> long<00:06:43.100> as<00:06:43.250> all<00:06:43.430> three<00:06:43.700> all<00:06:43.970> pieces<00:06:44.480> are

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 
and as long as all three all pieces are

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.200 
and as long as all three all pieces are
exactly<00:06:44.870> the<00:06:45.620> same<00:06:45.650> by<00:06:46.250> way<00:06:46.400> of<00:06:46.430> animating<00:06:46.820> it

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.210 
exactly the same by way of animating it

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:49.450 
exactly the same by way of animating it
doesn't<00:06:47.750> matter<00:06:48.020> what<00:06:48.710> the<00:06:48.860> background<00:06:49.040> is

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460 
doesn't matter what the background is

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.840 
doesn't matter what the background is
doing<00:06:49.850> it<00:06:50.600> the<00:06:51.050> models<00:06:51.470> and<00:06:51.710> stuff<00:06:51.890> will<00:06:52.340> still

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:52.850 
doing it the models and stuff will still

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.820 
doing it the models and stuff will still
still<00:06:53.120> maintain<00:06:53.570> and<00:06:53.930> that<00:06:54.380> was<00:06:54.500> a<00:06:54.560> pretty

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:54.830 
still maintain and that was a pretty

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.000 
still maintain and that was a pretty
sharp<00:06:55.130> focus<00:06:55.640> though<00:06:56.650> that's<00:06:57.650> kind<00:06:57.860> of<00:06:57.890> how<00:06:57.980> I

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.010 
sharp focus though that's kind of how I

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.090 
sharp focus though that's kind of how I
go<00:06:58.160> about<00:06:58.190> it<00:06:58.490> if<00:06:58.640> you<00:06:59.650> have<00:07:00.650> another<00:07:00.860> program

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:01.100 
go about it if you have another program

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.590 
go about it if you have another program
I'm<00:07:01.550> not<00:07:01.820> sure<00:07:01.970> how<00:07:02.090> that's<00:07:02.270> going<00:07:02.390> to<00:07:02.480> work

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:02.600 
I'm not sure how that's going to work

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.230 
I'm not sure how that's going to work
this<00:07:02.810> is<00:07:02.870> just<00:07:03.170> my<00:07:03.290> way<00:07:03.440> on<00:07:03.560> here<00:07:03.890> but<00:07:04.160> that<00:07:05.000> did

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.240 
this is just my way on here but that did

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.530 
this is just my way on here but that did
should<00:07:05.510> be<00:07:05.660> a<00:07:05.690> pretty<00:07:06.320> similar<00:07:07.180> that's<00:07:08.180> that's

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:08.540 
should be a pretty similar that's that's

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.760 
should be a pretty similar that's that's
really<00:07:08.780> all<00:07:08.870> I<00:07:08.960> wanted<00:07:09.170> to<00:07:09.260> show<00:07:09.380> on<00:07:09.500> this<00:07:09.590> one

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:09.770 
really all I wanted to show on this one

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.710 
really all I wanted to show on this one
so<00:07:10.040> if<00:07:10.730> you<00:07:10.820> were<00:07:11.090> trying<00:07:11.330> to<00:07:11.360> make<00:07:11.420> your<00:07:11.630> own

so if you were trying to make your own

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.930 
so if you were trying to make your own

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:13.940 
gifts and particle effects try this out

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.760 
gifts and particle effects try this out
see<00:07:14.180> if<00:07:14.210> see<00:07:14.900> if<00:07:14.960> it<00:07:15.050> works<00:07:15.200> for<00:07:15.380> you<00:07:15.470> for<00:07:15.500> your

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:15.770 
see if see if it works for you for your

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.580 
see if see if it works for you for your
giving<00:07:16.040> uh<00:07:16.160> then<00:07:16.490> I<00:07:16.520> smooth<00:07:16.880> a<00:07:17.540> nice<00:07:18.320> smooth

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:18.590 
giving uh then I smooth a nice smooth
