00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.600 
movie due to i read about him in the
book<00:02:33.720> he<00:02:33.750> was<00:02:33.960> in<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.410> book<00:02:34.590> as<00:02:34.860> i<00:02:35.160> believe<00:02:35.310> he

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
book he was in the book as i believe he

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.020 
book he was in the book as i believe he
was<00:02:35.790> um<00:02:36.830> but<00:02:37.830> he<00:02:37.920> was<00:02:38.040> not<00:02:38.190> in<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.370> movie<00:02:38.670> I<00:02:38.820> guess

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
was um but he was not in a movie I guess

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.570
