let's get rid of them using the

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.270 
let's get rid of them using the
holographic<00:04:44.830> cat<00:04:46.530> basically<00:04:47.530> whenever<00:04:48.160> you

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
holographic cat basically whenever you

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.170 
holographic cat basically whenever you
see<00:04:48.430> an<00:04:48.520> animal<00:04:48.840> use<00:04:49.840> the<00:04:50.050> cat<00:04:50.290> I<00:04:50.710> think<00:04:51.700> that's

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
see an animal use the cat I think that's

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.740 
see an animal use the cat I think that's
the<00:04:52.420> basic<00:04:52.810> idea<00:04:53.110> of<00:04:53.230> that<00:04:53.380> puzzle<00:04:54.060> and<00:04:55.060> let<00:04:55.510> me

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
the basic idea of that puzzle and let me

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.060 
the basic idea of that puzzle and let me
see<00:04:56.200> we<00:04:56.860> have<00:04:56.980> a<00:04:57.010> mask<00:04:57.370> oh<00:04:58.560> and<00:04:59.560> this<00:04:59.650> is<00:04:59.830> hollow

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
see we have a mask oh and this is hollow

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.920 
see we have a mask oh and this is hollow
that's<00:05:00.730> hollow<00:05:01.000> yep<00:05:01.540> that's<00:05:01.810> definitely

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
that's hollow yep that's definitely

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.600 
that's hollow yep that's definitely
hollow<00:05:03.330> did<00:05:04.330> you<00:05:04.420> deduce<00:05:04.630> so<00:05:05.470> let's<00:05:06.130> go<00:05:06.460> up

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
hollow did you deduce so let's go up

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.960 
hollow did you deduce so let's go up
here<00:05:06.910> and<00:05:07.090> use<00:05:07.270> the<00:05:07.450> mask<00:05:08.520> here's<00:05:09.520> a<00:05:09.610> puzzle

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
here and use the mask here's a puzzle

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.870 
here and use the mask here's a puzzle
where<00:05:10.090> you<00:05:10.240> want<00:05:10.450> to<00:05:10.570> make<00:05:10.720> the<00:05:10.840> eyes<00:05:11.080> fit<00:05:11.890> so

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
where you want to make the eyes fit so

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.700 
where you want to make the eyes fit so
for<00:05:13.060> example<00:05:13.390> this<00:05:13.510> guy<00:05:13.720> has<00:05:13.990> like<00:05:14.260> star<00:05:14.680> eye

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
for example this guy has like star eye

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.790 
for example this guy has like star eye
is<00:05:15.040> starburst<00:05:15.820> eyes<00:05:16.180> so<00:05:16.660> move<00:05:16.960> the<00:05:17.170> eyes<00:05:17.320> over

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
is starburst eyes so move the eyes over

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
is starburst eyes so move the eyes over
there<00:05:18.360> put<00:05:19.360> them<00:05:19.540> in<00:05:19.720> that<00:05:19.900> thing<00:05:20.610> let<00:05:21.610> me<00:05:21.640> see

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
there put them in that thing let me see

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.150 
there put them in that thing let me see
this<00:05:21.970> is<00:05:22.150> an<00:05:22.300> eagle<00:05:22.690> eagle<00:05:22.990> wants<00:05:23.560> eagle<00:05:23.950> eyes

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
this is an eagle eagle wants eagle eyes

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.490 
this is an eagle eagle wants eagle eyes
makes<00:05:25.090> sense

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.920
