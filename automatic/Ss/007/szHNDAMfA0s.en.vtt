something that old I understand that and

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:55.990 
something that old I understand that and
normally<00:01:54.709> we<00:01:54.860> wouldn't<00:01:55.130> expect<00:01:55.310> to<00:01:55.580> get<00:01:55.729> soft

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
normally we wouldn't expect to get soft

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
you'd like to carbon-14 at the same time

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.999 
you'd like to carbon-14 at the same time
in<00:02:08.030> fact<00:02:08.810> in<00:02:08.989> the<00:02:09.049> last<00:02:09.259> couple<00:02:09.470> weeks<00:02:09.619> I've

anything<00:02:50.810> over<00:02:51.139> maybe<00:02:51.980> fifty<00:02:52.430> thousand<00:02:52.880> years

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
anything over maybe fifty thousand years

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.259 
anything over maybe fifty thousand years
or<00:02:53.209> so<00:02:53.709> but<00:02:54.709> I've<00:02:55.160> done<00:02:55.609> a<00:02:55.639> talk<00:02:55.910> show<00:02:56.120> in

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
or so but I've done a talk show in

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.750 
or so but I've done a talk show in
Denver<00:02:56.420> for<00:02:56.630> fifteen<00:02:57.139> years<00:02:57.400> there's<00:02:58.400> a<00:02:58.489> group

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
Denver for fifteen years there's a group

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.660 
Denver for fifteen years there's a group
of<00:02:58.910> folks<00:02:59.019> interested<00:03:00.019> in<00:03:00.139> science<00:03:00.620> of<00:03:00.829> course

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
of folks interested in science of course

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.479 
of folks interested in science of course
that<00:03:01.940> discovery<00:03:02.510> caught<00:03:03.049> their<00:03:03.230> attention

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
that discovery caught their attention

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.979 
that discovery caught their attention
and<00:03:04.489> they<00:03:04.609> thought<00:03:04.819> well<00:03:05.060> it'd<00:03:05.239> be<00:03:05.389> logical<00:03:05.959> to

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
and they thought well it'd be logical to

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.860 
and they thought well it'd be logical to
do<00:03:06.260> this<00:03:06.609> to<00:03:07.609> just<00:03:07.850> go<00:03:08.000> ahead<00:03:08.090> and<00:03:08.329> do<00:03:08.420> it<00:03:08.600> even

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
do this to just go ahead and do it even

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.870 
do this to just go ahead and do it even
though<00:03:09.019> nobody<00:03:09.530> would<00:03:09.769> be<00:03:09.920> inclined<00:03:10.340> to<00:03:10.459> do<00:03:10.700> it

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
though nobody would be inclined to do it

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.150 
though nobody would be inclined to do it
just<00:03:11.630> like<00:03:11.690> nobody<00:03:12.139> would<00:03:12.319> be<00:03:12.530> inclined<00:03:12.980> to

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
just like nobody would be inclined to

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.789 
just like nobody would be inclined to
look<00:03:13.340> for<00:03:13.700> soft<00:03:13.940> tissue<00:03:14.380> inside<00:03:15.380> of<00:03:15.530> a<00:03:15.590> t-rex

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
look for soft tissue inside of a t-rex

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.429 
look for soft tissue inside of a t-rex
well<00:03:16.760> you<00:03:17.030> know<00:03:17.090> and<00:03:17.389> you<00:03:17.959> know<00:03:18.080> we're<00:03:18.260> still

00:03:18.429 --> 00:03:18.439 
well you know and you know we're still

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:20.320 
well you know and you know we're still
trying<00:03:18.709> to<00:03:18.739> figure<00:03:18.920> out<00:03:19.040> what<00:03:19.280> it<00:03:19.400> is<00:03:19.489> well

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
trying to figure out what it is well

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.860 
trying to figure out what it is well
it's<00:03:20.480> actually<00:03:20.599> made<00:03:21.049> up<00:03:21.230> right

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
it's actually made up right

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.930 
it's actually made up right
exactly<00:03:22.290> whether<00:03:22.470> it's<00:03:22.730> hemoglobin<00:03:23.730> or

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
exactly whether it's hemoglobin or

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.360 
exactly whether it's hemoglobin or
whatever<00:03:24.420> well<00:03:27.080> Jack<00:03:28.080> is<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.379> amount<00:03:28.950> too

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
whatever well Jack is the amount too

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.190 
whatever well Jack is the amount too
small<00:03:29.760> that<00:03:29.790> it's<00:03:30.090> just<00:03:30.360> not<00:03:30.569> worth<00:03:30.840> the

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
small that it's just not worth the

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.259 
small that it's just not worth the
consideration<00:03:32.159> no<00:03:33.060> that's<00:03:33.690> not<00:03:33.930> it

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
consideration no that's not it

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.449 
consideration no that's not it
what<00:03:36.269> if<00:03:36.390> I<00:03:36.510> were<00:03:36.720> able<00:03:36.989> to<00:03:37.530> raise<00:03:37.980> more<00:03:38.400> money

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
what if I were able to raise more money

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.420 
what if I were able to raise more money
know<00:03:39.450> that<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:40.260> amount<00:03:40.590> of<00:03:40.769> money<00:03:40.950> has

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
know that the amount of money has

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.330 
know that the amount of money has
nothing<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:41.849> do<00:03:42.060> with<00:03:42.150> it<00:03:42.360> mm-hmm

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.220 

because<00:03:47.340> carbon-14<00:03:48.239> doesn't<00:03:48.900> work<00:03:49.049> on

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
because carbon-14 doesn't work on

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.500 
because carbon-14 doesn't work on
something<00:03:49.500> like<00:03:49.680> this<00:03:50.010> right<00:03:51.709> your<00:03:52.709> results

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
something like this right your results

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.809 
something like this right your results
that<00:03:54.510> you<00:03:54.660> get<00:03:54.950> could<00:03:55.950> be<00:03:56.069> all<00:03:56.280> over<00:03:56.310> the<00:03:56.670> place

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
that you get could be all over the place

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.809 
that you get could be all over the place
well<00:03:57.780> they<00:03:57.930> should<00:03:58.230> be<00:03:58.470> infinity<00:03:59.069> it<00:03:59.609> should

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
well they should be infinity it should

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.910 
well they should be infinity it should
be<00:03:59.970> not<00:04:00.150> dateable<00:04:00.720> in<00:04:01.440> other<00:04:01.590> words<00:04:01.769> it

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
be not dateable in other words it

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.339 
be not dateable in other words it
shouldn't<00:04:02.250> come<00:04:02.400> back<00:04:02.629> saying<00:04:03.629> it's<00:04:03.870> 25

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
shouldn't come back saying it's 25

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.500 
shouldn't come back saying it's 25
thousand<00:04:04.799> years<00:04:04.950> old<00:04:05.220> right<00:04:05.910> it<00:04:06.269> should<00:04:06.480> be

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
thousand years old right it should be

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.170 
thousand years old right it should be
infinity<00:04:07.010> and<00:04:08.010> so<00:04:08.190> that<00:04:08.370> will<00:04:08.459> be<00:04:08.609> a<00:04:08.640> work<00:04:08.940> oh<00:04:09.120> i

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
infinity and so that will be a work oh i

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.500 
infinity and so that will be a work oh i
infinite<00:04:09.840> infinity<00:04:10.530> isn't<00:04:10.709> exactly<00:04:11.359> what<00:04:12.359> you

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
infinite infinity isn't exactly what you

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.640 
infinite infinity isn't exactly what you
get<00:04:12.690> okay

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
get okay

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.379 
get okay
I<00:04:14.420> mean<00:04:15.420> it's<00:04:15.750> like<00:04:16.220> soy<00:04:17.220> trying<00:04:17.609> to<00:04:17.789> date<00:04:18.060> a

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
I mean it's like soy trying to date a

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:23.029 
I mean it's like soy trying to date a
piece<00:04:19.199> of<00:04:19.350> concrete<00:04:21.470> right<00:04:22.470> you<00:04:22.770> would<00:04:22.919> have

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
piece of concrete right you would have

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.830 
piece of concrete right you would have
to<00:04:23.190> have<00:04:23.280> carbon<00:04:23.760> in<00:04:23.910> it<00:04:24.000> right<00:04:24.330> you<00:04:24.570> wouldn't

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
to have carbon in it right you wouldn't

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.920 
to have carbon in it right you wouldn't
use<00:04:24.990> carbon-14<00:04:25.680> now<00:04:26.010> the<00:04:26.070> skeleton<00:04:26.729> is<00:04:26.930> not

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
use carbon-14 now the skeleton is not

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.050 
use carbon-14 now the skeleton is not
fossilized<00:04:28.680> isn't<00:04:29.160> that<00:04:29.280> true<00:04:29.520> or<00:04:29.729> largely

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
fossilized isn't that true or largely

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.909 
fossilized isn't that true or largely
not<00:04:31.430> well<00:04:32.430> it's<00:04:32.840> well<00:04:33.840> it's<00:04:34.110> you<00:04:34.530> know<00:04:34.620> the

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
not well it's well it's you know the

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:46.210 
not well it's well it's you know the
bone<00:04:35.729> is<00:04:36.000> made<00:04:36.210> of<00:04:36.360> calcium<00:04:36.870> phosphate<00:04:40.970> and

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.409 

like<00:04:47.220> I<00:04:47.370> say<00:04:47.550> we're<00:04:47.700> still<00:04:47.910> trying<00:04:48.150> to<00:04:48.180> figure

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
like I say we're still trying to figure

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.159 
like I say we're still trying to figure
out<00:04:48.479> what<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:49.470> actual<00:04:49.710> soft<00:04:50.550> tissue<00:04:50.940> is<00:04:51.330> right

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
out what the actual soft tissue is right

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.620 
out what the actual soft tissue is right
and<00:04:52.500> see<00:04:53.160> we<00:04:53.280> were<00:04:53.400> hoping<00:04:53.789> that<00:04:53.849> a<00:04:54.060> test<00:04:54.419> like

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
and see we were hoping that a test like

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.439 
and see we were hoping that a test like
this<00:04:54.870> would<00:04:55.199> just<00:04:55.620> add<00:04:55.800> a<00:04:55.830> another<00:04:56.520> bit<00:04:57.419> of

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
this would just add a another bit of

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.589 
this would just add a another bit of
scientific<00:04:58.320> information<00:04:58.680> that<00:04:59.419> that<00:05:00.419> you

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:00.599 
scientific information that that you

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:02.689 
scientific information that that you
would<00:05:00.750> have<00:05:00.900> at<00:05:01.020> your<00:05:01.139> disposal<00:05:01.199> and<00:05:01.949> also<00:05:02.370> in

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
would have at your disposal and also in

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:06.050 
would have at your disposal and also in
that<00:05:03.419> grant<00:05:03.750> letter<00:05:04.099> we<00:05:05.099> asked<00:05:05.760> if<00:05:05.849> it<00:05:06.030> could

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
that grant letter we asked if it could

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.290 
that grant letter we asked if it could
be<00:05:06.210> a<00:05:06.360> blind<00:05:07.050> test<00:05:07.460> with<00:05:08.460> five<00:05:09.030> different

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
be a blind test with five different

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.779 
be a blind test with five different
specimens<00:05:10.169> and<00:05:10.410> therefore<00:05:11.130> then<00:05:11.310> the<00:05:11.430> museum

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
specimens and therefore then the museum

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:14.480 
specimens and therefore then the museum
could<00:05:12.120> test<00:05:12.389> for<00:05:12.630> other<00:05:13.190> specimens<00:05:14.190> that<00:05:14.250> you

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
could test for other specimens that you

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.969 
could test for other specimens that you
