here<00:01:13.950> by<00:01:14.159> showing<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> size<00:01:15.030> comparison<00:01:15.360> of

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
here by showing you a size comparison of

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.859 
here by showing you a size comparison of
the<00:01:16.110> two<00:01:16.259> mac<00:01:16.439> books<00:01:17.030> so<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.119> can<00:01:18.360> see<00:01:18.600> there's

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
the two mac books so you can see there's

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.050 
the two mac books so you can see there's
a<00:01:19.220> significant<00:01:20.450> significant<00:01:22.310> size<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.790> these

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
a significant significant size and these

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.109 
a significant significant size and these
two<00:01:24.479> computers<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.500> one<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.890> fair<00:01:26.850> bit

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
two computers this one is fair bit

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:41.220 
two computers this one is fair bit
bigger<00:01:27.360> than<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.990> 13-inch<00:01:28.740> MacBook<00:01:29.130> Pro

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:49.200 

13<00:01:42.100> inch<00:01:42.310> and<00:01:43.350> 15<00:01:44.350> inch<00:01:46.770> yep<00:01:47.770> right<00:01:48.760> here<00:01:48.850> guys

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
13 inch and 15 inch yep right here guys

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.820 
13 inch and 15 inch yep right here guys
you<00:01:49.480> can<00:01:49.660> definitely<00:01:49.870> see<00:01:50.470> the<00:01:50.500> size

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
you can definitely see the size

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.550 
you can definitely see the size
difference<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:52.180> these<00:01:52.450> two<00:01:52.720> computers<00:01:53.020> I'm

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
difference of these two computers I'm

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.830 
difference of these two computers I'm
gonna<00:01:53.740> show<00:01:53.950> you<00:01:54.010> the<00:01:54.220> ports<00:01:54.640> first<00:01:55.390> off<00:01:55.600> there

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
gonna show you the ports first off there

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.830 
gonna show you the ports first off there
we<00:01:55.990> have<00:01:56.200> a<00:01:56.230> Meg<00:01:56.680> safe<00:01:57.010> power<00:01:57.280> adapter<00:01:57.910> second

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
we have a Meg safe power adapter second

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.150 
we have a Meg safe power adapter second
we<00:01:58.960> have<00:01:59.200> a<00:01:59.470> Ethernet<00:02:00.510> port<00:02:01.510> third<00:02:02.290> we<00:02:02.560> have<00:02:02.890> a

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
we have a Ethernet port third we have a

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.410 
we have a Ethernet port third we have a
firewire<00:02:03.730> 800<00:02:04.110> then<00:02:05.110> a<00:02:05.530> mini<00:02:06.190> display<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:06.970> to

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
firewire 800 then a mini display and to

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.330 
firewire 800 then a mini display and to
your<00:02:07.570> speed<00:02:07.840> 2.0<00:02:08.470> it<00:02:09.100> puts<00:02:09.690> also<00:02:10.690> on<00:02:10.930> the<00:02:11.340> first

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
your speed 2.0 it puts also on the first

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.880 
your speed 2.0 it puts also on the first
for<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:12.610> mid-2009<00:02:13.240> model<00:02:13.840> I<00:02:13.930> think<00:02:13.960> is<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.710> SD

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
for the mid-2009 model I think is the SD

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.460 
for the mid-2009 model I think is the SD
card<00:02:15.340> reader<00:02:15.490> and<00:02:15.880> then<00:02:16.390> your<00:02:16.600> audio<00:02:16.960> in<00:02:17.230> and

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
card reader and then your audio in and

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.500 
card reader and then your audio in and
audio<00:02:17.530> out<00:02:18.130> and<00:02:18.750> also<00:02:19.750> yeah<00:02:20.170> we<00:02:20.470> do<00:02:20.680> have<00:02:20.710> this

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
audio out and also yeah we do have this

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.790 
audio out and also yeah we do have this
push<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.540> button<00:02:22.960> and<00:02:23.140> it<00:02:23.290> shows<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:23.740> your

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
push the button and it shows you your

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.790 
push the button and it shows you your

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
now we're going to do with a boot up

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:45.870 
now we're going to do with a boot up
speed

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:56.380 

fifteen<00:03:46.720> inches<00:03:47.050> a<00:03:47.110> head<00:03:47.890> a<00:03:48.160> little<00:03:48.640> bit

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:58.829 
may take off a little bit of space but
significantly<00:05:51.849> faster<00:05:52.800> 15<00:05:53.800> inch<00:05:54.009> model<00:05:57.839> so

00:05:58.829 --> 00:05:58.839 
significantly faster 15 inch model so

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:00.989 
significantly faster 15 inch model so
that's<00:05:58.899> clocking<00:05:59.529> in<00:05:59.680> at<00:05:59.949> thirty<00:06:00.339> to<00:06:00.639> forty

00:06:00.989 --> 00:06:00.999 
that's clocking in at thirty to forty

00:06:00.999 --> 00:06:05.279 
that's clocking in at thirty to forty
three<00:06:01.180> I<00:06:01.569> can<00:06:02.199> get<00:06:02.349> up<00:06:02.469> to<00:06:02.740> 30<00:06:03.520> to<00:06:03.789> 50<00:06:04.449> out<00:06:05.139> of

three I can get up to 30 to 50 out of

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:06.899 
three I can get up to 30 to 50 out of
this<00:06:05.439> one<00:06:05.619> so<00:06:05.649> thirty<00:06:06.189> three<00:06:06.520> thousand<00:06:06.849> two

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:06.909 
this one so thirty three thousand two

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:08.459 
this one so thirty three thousand two
