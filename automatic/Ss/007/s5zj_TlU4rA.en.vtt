because<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.670> didn't<00:00:26.970> work<00:00:27.210> last<00:00:27.510> time<00:00:27.750> I

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
because that didn't work last time I

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.759 
because that didn't work last time I
left<00:00:28.529> out<00:00:28.740> so<00:00:29.539> it's<00:00:30.539> pretty<00:00:30.689> easy<00:00:30.810> if<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.679> can

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
left out so it's pretty easy if you can

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.889 
left out so it's pretty easy if you can
see<00:00:31.980> you're<00:00:32.130> standing<00:00:32.730> disconnect<00:00:33.270> level<00:00:33.719> and

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
see you're standing disconnect level and

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.630 
see you're standing disconnect level and
it<00:00:34.350> stands<00:00:34.649> loader<00:00:35.750> by<00:00:36.800> default<00:00:37.800> if<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.460> want

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
it stands loader by default if you want

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.549 
it stands loader by default if you want
to<00:00:38.760> have<00:00:39.059> something<00:00:39.450> else<00:00:39.809> but<00:00:40.170> I'm<00:00:40.320> just

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559

to have something else but I'm just
gonna<00:00:40.680> leave<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:41.010> uploader<00:00:41.370> that's<00:00:42.210> this

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
gonna leave it uploader that's this

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.229 
gonna leave it uploader that's this
scene<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.320> empty<00:00:43.620> scene<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.190> then<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.059> just

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
scene and empty scene and then you just

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.150 
scene and empty scene and then you just
need<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.570> add<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.200> would<00:00:46.320> file<00:00:46.710> both

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
need to add it you would file both

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.080 
need to add it you would file both
settings<00:00:47.730> i<00:00:47.850> need<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.300> add<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:49.050> your<00:00:50.090> seeds

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
settings i need to add it to your seeds

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.020 
settings i need to add it to your seeds
in<00:00:51.360> both<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:52.280> now<00:00:53.280> I'm<00:00:53.430> that's<00:00:53.640> all<00:00:53.820> I'm

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
in both I now I'm that's all I'm

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.290 
in both I now I'm that's all I'm
disconnect<00:00:54.600> will<00:00:54.840> work<00:00:55.050> fine<00:00:55.760> okay<00:00:56.760> but<00:00:56.820> if

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
disconnect will work fine okay but if

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.810 
disconnect will work fine okay but if
some<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:58.109> already<00:00:58.440> test<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.430> the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
some of you already test in the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.020 
some of you already test in the
multiplayer<00:01:00.149> or<00:01:00.620> network<00:01:01.670> you<00:01:02.670> will<00:01:02.789> notice

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
multiplayer or network you will notice

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.170 
multiplayer or network you will notice
that<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.420> didn't<00:01:03.780> work<00:01:04.430> it's<00:01:05.430> pretty<00:01:05.729> easy<00:01:06.030> to

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
that it didn't work it's pretty easy to

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.050 
that it didn't work it's pretty easy to
solve<00:01:07.490> if<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:10.130> connect<00:01:11.130> now<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.760> server

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
solve if you connect now to the server

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.300 
solve if you connect now to the server
the<00:01:12.659> only<00:01:12.900> work<00:01:13.260> if<00:01:13.530> you're<00:01:13.799> on<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.010> same

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
the only work if you're on the same

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.300 
the only work if you're on the same
network<00:01:14.820> if<00:01:15.509> your<00:01:15.750> other<00:01:16.020> networks<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.860> won't

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
network if your other networks it won't

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.550 
network if your other networks it won't
work<00:01:17.490> now<00:01:18.119> I'm<00:01:18.299> not<00:01:18.509> going<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:20.750> let<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.780> work<00:01:22.110> so

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
work now I'm not going to let it work so

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.149 
work now I'm not going to let it work so
basically<00:01:23.400> are<00:01:24.060> we<00:01:24.360> go<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:25.340> what's<00:01:27.439> my<00:01:28.439> IP<00:01:28.650> dub

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
basically are we go to what's my IP dub

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.960 
basically are we go to what's my IP dub
orc<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:30.619> then<00:01:31.619> you're<00:01:31.829> all<00:01:31.979> standing<00:01:32.250> your<00:01:32.700> IP

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
orc and then you're all standing your IP

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.330 
orc and then you're all standing your IP
address<00:01:33.530> now<00:01:34.530> just<00:01:34.950> track<00:01:35.310> your<00:01:35.579> IP<00:01:35.700> dress

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340
