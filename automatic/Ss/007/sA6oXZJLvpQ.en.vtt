00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
case we were told we had no problem that

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.740 
case we were told we had no problem that
the<00:00:19.830> dikes<00:00:20.100> would<00:00:20.369> hold<00:00:20.670> they<00:00:21.300> were<00:00:21.359> built<00:00:21.689> by

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
the army engineers and we didn't have to

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.790 
the army engineers and we didn't have to
worry<00:00:24.359> about<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.779> flood<00:00:24.990> at<00:00:25.140> all<00:00:25.320> just<00:00:25.619> go<00:00:25.769> to

worry about the flood at all just go to

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.370 
worry about the flood at all just go to
bed<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:26.310> mean<00:00:26.880> there<00:00:27.029> was<00:00:27.150> still<00:00:27.359> people<00:00:27.630> you

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
bed I mean there was still people you

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.380 
bed I mean there was still people you
know<00:00:28.500> down<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:29.010> Corning<00:00:29.460> at<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.730> time<00:00:30.060> and

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
know down in Corning at that time and

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.889 
know down in Corning at that time and
the<00:00:31.289> river<00:00:31.560> was<00:00:31.830> right<00:00:32.130> at<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.430> top<00:00:32.820> of<00:00:33.180> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
two years seeing it covered with plywood

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.980 
two years seeing it covered with plywood
and<00:03:16.350> being<00:03:16.740> a<00:03:16.890> sign<00:03:17.160> of<00:03:17.370> defeat<00:03:17.790> I<00:03:18.090> think<00:03:18.900> the

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
and being a sign of defeat I think the

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.050 
and being a sign of defeat I think the
reaction<00:03:19.230> was<00:03:19.620> was<00:03:19.920> similar<00:03:20.310> to<00:03:20.340> other<00:03:20.700> Tom

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
reaction was was similar to other Tom

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.240 
reaction was was similar to other Tom
Bikaner<00:03:21.450> proposals<00:03:22.110> it<00:03:22.320> was<00:03:22.470> this<00:03:22.680> is<00:03:22.890> totally

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
Bikaner proposals it was this is totally

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.000 
Bikaner proposals it was this is totally
impossible<00:03:23.690> but<00:03:24.690> you<00:03:24.930> know<00:03:25.110> he<00:03:25.320> led<00:03:25.560> by<00:03:25.590> his

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
impossible but you know he led by his

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.280 
impossible but you know he led by his
force<00:03:26.340> of<00:03:26.550> personality<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:27.570> so<00:03:27.780> you<00:03:28.080> just

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
force of personality and so you just

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.440 
force of personality and so you just
worked<00:03:28.620> as<00:03:28.860> hard<00:03:29.220> as<00:03:29.400> you<00:03:29.550> could<00:03:29.790> we<00:03:30.180> took<00:03:30.330> it

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
worked as hard as you could we took it

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.270 
worked as hard as you could we took it
as<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.570> challenge<00:03:31.050> and<00:03:31.200> we<00:03:31.350> all<00:03:31.500> worked<00:03:31.770> because

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
as a challenge and we all worked because

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.300 
as a challenge and we all worked because
it<00:03:32.490> was<00:03:32.760> important<00:03:33.210> to<00:03:33.270> our<00:03:33.510> morale<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:35.070> get<00:03:35.220> it

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
it was important to our morale to get it

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.640 
it was important to our morale to get it
open<00:03:35.550> again<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:36.030> not<00:03:36.780> just<00:03:36.990> sort<00:03:37.170> of<00:03:37.260> give<00:03:37.500> up

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
open again and not just sort of give up

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.950 
open again and not just sort of give up
the<00:03:37.860> way<00:03:37.980> things<00:03:38.250> were<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:39.000> goal<00:03:39.330> seemed

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
the way things were the goal seemed

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.500 
the way things were the goal seemed
unachievable<00:03:40.920> at<00:03:41.460> the<00:03:41.610> time<00:03:41.880> because<00:03:42.330> there

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
unachievable at the time because there

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.979 
unachievable at the time because there
were<00:03:42.630> so<00:03:42.870> few<00:03:42.900> of<00:03:43.200> us<00:03:43.470> and<00:03:44.239> that<00:03:45.239> was<00:03:45.480> when<00:03:45.750> we

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
were so few of us and that was when we

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.990 
were so few of us and that was when we
learned<00:03:46.260> that<00:03:46.680> volunteers<00:03:47.310> would<00:03:47.550> be<00:03:47.730> coming

again so when the cases were opened it

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.770 
again so when the cases were opened it
became<00:04:29.700> a<00:04:30.650> real<00:04:31.650> challenge<00:04:32.370> to<00:04:33.090> get<00:04:33.300> in<00:04:33.480> there

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
became a real challenge to get in there

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.430 
became a real challenge to get in there
and<00:04:34.310> remove<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.910> pieces<00:04:36.480> which<00:04:37.050> were

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
and remove the pieces which were

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.280 
and remove the pieces which were

of one another and get them out without
breaking<00:04:43.710> them<00:04:43.890> there<00:04:44.160> was<00:04:44.280> a<00:04:44.310> case<00:04:44.970> that<00:04:45.270> a

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
breaking them there was a case that a

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.180 
breaking them there was a case that a
producing<00:04:46.169> glass<00:04:46.410> that<00:04:46.740> was<00:04:46.800> a<00:04:46.860> special

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
producing glass that was a special

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.980 
producing glass that was a special
exhibition<00:04:47.970> and<00:04:48.210> that<00:04:48.390> one<00:04:48.690> had<00:04:48.810> actually

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
exhibition and that one had actually

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.920 
exhibition and that one had actually
fallen<00:04:49.470> forward<00:04:49.979> and<00:04:50.460> the<00:04:51.180> coveri<00:04:51.510> glass<00:04:51.720> had

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
fallen forward and the coveri glass had

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:52.640 
fallen forward and the coveri glass had
broken

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
broken

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.530 
broken
and<00:04:52.740> some<00:04:53.100> of<00:04:53.190> the<00:04:53.250> glass<00:04:53.460> had<00:04:53.639> broken<00:04:54.330> under

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
and some of the glass had broken under

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.590 
and some of the glass had broken under
it<00:04:54.780> so<00:04:55.380> some<00:04:56.160> of<00:04:56.190> the<00:04:56.340> pieces<00:04:56.610> of<00:04:57.090> that<00:04:57.360> were

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
it so some of the pieces of that were

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.140 
it so some of the pieces of that were
mixed<00:04:58.020> into<00:04:58.410> the<00:04:58.530> mud<00:04:58.770> eventually<00:04:59.639> what<00:05:00.000> they

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
mixed into the mud eventually what they

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.820 
mixed into the mud eventually what they
did<00:05:00.360> is<00:05:00.479> they<00:05:00.509> had<00:05:00.630> to<00:05:00.870> take<00:05:01.020> all<00:05:01.229> the<00:05:01.350> mud<00:05:01.560> and

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
did is they had to take all the mud and

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.240 
did is they had to take all the mud and
pass<00:05:02.100> it<00:05:02.310> through<00:05:02.340> sir<00:05:02.900> strainers<00:05:04.009> like<00:05:05.009> in<00:05:05.160> an

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
pass it through sir strainers like in an

fragments<00:05:07.770> pieces<00:05:08.090> that<00:05:09.090> were<00:05:09.330> had<00:05:10.050> been

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
fragments pieces that were had been

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.960 
fragments pieces that were had been
originally<00:05:10.830> glued<00:05:11.100> together<00:05:11.250> with<00:05:11.699> a

originally glued together with a
water-soluble<00:05:12.600> adhesive<00:05:13.110> course<00:05:13.560> fell<00:05:13.770> apart

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
water-soluble adhesive course fell apart

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:16.330 
water-soluble adhesive course fell apart
in<00:05:14.250> the<00:05:14.340> water<00:05:14.520> and<00:05:14.759> had<00:05:15.270> to<00:05:15.360> be<00:05:15.479> painstakingly

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
in the water and had to be painstakingly

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.969 
in the water and had to be painstakingly
reconstructed<00:05:17.810> so<00:05:18.810> every<00:05:19.169> piece<00:05:19.410> had<00:05:19.740> to<00:05:19.830> be

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 
reconstructed so every piece had to be

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:23.560 
reconstructed so every piece had to be
handled<00:05:20.610> with<00:05:21.030> really<00:05:21.539> great<00:05:22.350> care<00:05:22.680> and

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:23.570 
handled with really great care and

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.719 
handled with really great care and

examined meticulously I wasn't
interested<00:05:27.210> at<00:05:27.300> all<00:05:27.510> in<00:05:27.870> the<00:05:28.020> cases<00:05:28.440> in<00:05:28.620> the

interested at all in the cases in the
glass<00:05:28.949> I<00:05:29.280> just<00:05:29.550> went<00:05:30.060> on<00:05:30.210> I<00:05:30.240> wanted<00:05:30.690> to<00:05:30.750> see

glass I just went on I wanted to see

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.750 
glass I just went on I wanted to see
what<00:05:31.199> happened<00:05:31.350> to<00:05:31.680> my<00:05:31.830> books<00:05:32.100> the<00:05:32.580> library

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
what happened to my books the library

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.840 
what happened to my books the library
was<00:05:33.270> damaged<00:05:33.750> much<00:05:34.050> more<00:05:34.410> than<00:05:34.919> the<00:05:35.280> glass

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
was damaged much more than the glass

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.060 
was damaged much more than the glass
when<00:05:36.389> these<00:05:36.570> books<00:05:36.870> got<00:05:37.169> wet<00:05:37.410> they<00:05:37.650> swelled

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
when these books got wet they swelled

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.490 
when these books got wet they swelled
and<00:05:38.490> to<00:05:39.030> walk<00:05:39.240> through<00:05:39.570> the<00:05:39.720> library<00:05:40.139> and<00:05:40.229> see

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
all these books just just in such bad

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.270 
all these books just just in such bad
shape<00:05:44.060> it<00:05:45.060> was<00:05:45.270> like<00:05:45.590> hundreds<00:05:46.590> of<00:05:46.680> deaths<00:05:46.949> all

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
shape it was like hundreds of deaths all

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.490 
shape it was like hundreds of deaths all
at<00:05:47.460> once<00:05:47.669> the<00:05:48.389> librarians<00:05:48.900> had<00:05:49.050> heard<00:05:49.260> that

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
at once the librarians had heard that

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.140 
at once the librarians had heard that
the<00:05:49.620> thing<00:05:49.830> to<00:05:49.979> do<00:05:50.099> after<00:05:50.490> a<00:05:50.520> flood<00:05:50.789> was<00:05:51.000> to

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
the thing to do after a flood was to

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.939 
the thing to do after a flood was to
freeze<00:05:51.449> all<00:05:51.690> the<00:05:51.810> books<00:05:52.050> you<00:05:52.349> freeze<00:05:52.680> them<00:05:52.889> in

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:52.949 
freeze all the books you freeze them in

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:56.270 
freeze all the books you freeze them in
order<00:05:53.220> to<00:05:53.430> keep<00:05:54.090> them<00:05:54.360> from<00:05:54.599> becoming<00:05:55.590> mildew

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
order to keep them from becoming mildew

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.490 
order to keep them from becoming mildew
a<00:05:56.310> moldy<00:05:56.849> and<00:05:57.030> then<00:05:57.360> you<00:05:57.510> decided<00:05:58.050> later<00:05:58.260> what

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
a moldy and then you decided later what

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.740 
a moldy and then you decided later what
to<00:05:58.650> do<00:05:58.800> with<00:05:58.949> them<00:05:59.190> if<00:05:59.550> we<00:05:59.789> had<00:05:59.910> not<00:06:00.060> frozen<00:06:00.630> the

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
to do with them if we had not frozen the

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.360 
to do with them if we had not frozen the
books<00:06:00.990> think<00:06:01.500> what<00:06:01.650> would<00:06:01.800> have<00:06:01.889> happened

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
books think what would have happened

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.400 
books think what would have happened
they<00:06:02.520> would<00:06:02.699> have<00:06:02.849> been<00:06:03.030> moldy<00:06:03.539> the<00:06:03.900> paper

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:04.410 
they would have been moldy the paper

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.560 
they would have been moldy the paper
would<00:06:04.680> have<00:06:04.740> disintegrated<00:06:05.220> the<00:06:06.210> the
