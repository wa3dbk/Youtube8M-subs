00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:08.700
 hi guys today I present a tablet 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.910
 completely analogical no screens 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.820
 nothing when you drop no batteries but 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.520
 capacity with a do-it-yourself application 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.949
 you to learn the letters of the alphabet 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.260
 the brand oak roof offers it 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.820
 Italian object completely made in 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.080
 italy 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.720
 we open and inside this box 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.060
 we find all the elements are 64 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.309
 pieces that make up our game for 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.800
 children attention from 3 years upwards then 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.510
 perfect for preschool to learn 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.649
 the alphabet which also had a manual 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.690
 after we see how it works and since not 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.750
 use should my younger age also 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.059
 if it is certainly the magnetism of craxi 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.039
 it is very charming for the little ones 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.809
 in the pieces as you can see they are also a lot 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.969
 but very small so as I remember the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.840
 three-year package 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.170
 inside we also find the 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:03.359
 possibility to insert a clip into 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.760
 This way a dry-erase marker that 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.030
 he will then allow the Pope's strength 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.460
 to insert it and you will also see of 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.500
 write on the tape itself and cancel 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.720
 thanks to the dedicated spending and two 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.670
 support thabet to tilt it either way 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.790
 that vertically in this way that 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.229
 to be able to work comfortably using 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.450
 of campbell and do not depend on composing 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.460
 the letters now look just like 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.770
 works and tablet that teaches us how to 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.799
 letters of the alphabet shown le 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.500
 capital letters that are composed of strokes 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.270
 horizontal verticals and curves that 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.430
 we can match to achieve 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.829
 completely the entire alphabet in 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.979
 this case is made by two sides let us give 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.230
 vertical lines while working is made by 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.740
 two 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.990
 from a smart point he punishes two traits 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.820
 vertical with the star marker pen 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.030
 we can go to the space indicated 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.410
 on the tablet to rebuild to learn 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.500
 just write our letters to her 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.720
 then going with a vertical stroke 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.380
 a vertical section and one that connects 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.230
 two vertical sections a vertical section 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.640
 a vertical trait and a clever one 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.530
 then leads by going to learn 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.610
 just the formation of the letters e 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.350
 why not 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.450
 obviously did not word 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:25.670
 sense to you but we can also think 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:31.030
 obviously going to combine them do 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:34.130
 then give it a meaning then yours more 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.330
 accomplished this way to go to 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.120
 creating maybe even our first 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.180
 words one side of the tablet is dedicated 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.140
 so the learning letters 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.420
 alphabet 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.610
 the other side of the syllogism tablet is 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.590
 free as we see from the manual that 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.270
 teaches us competition through various 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.770
 elements of the letters 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.260
 we have that chance 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.380
 some ideas to make some 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:01.550
 figures for example very very much 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:07.459
 rapid nyama realize to humanize not 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:13.360
 was very well accomplished in this 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:13.360
 so his account that I have many pieces 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:21.989
 to go and make eyelashes a 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:26.000
 nose that we can make blue and smile 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.000
 we can achieve in this world 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.829
 this then the abc tablet of the 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.480
 concepts for reviews of upcoming e 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.890
 demonstrations of how they work 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.690
 Upcoming games you can register 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.569
 clicking above on the games channel 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.879
 with mini and girls and for information

 this video convinced you find it here 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.370
 under 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.370
