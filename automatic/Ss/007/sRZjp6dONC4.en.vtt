00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
acclaimed maybe not right at first but

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.600 
acclaimed maybe not right at first but
more<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.829> more<00:00:43.860> through<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.280> years<00:00:44.309> they

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
music from back in the day this would be

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.109 
music from back in the day this would be
an<00:01:10.140> album<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.770> would<00:01:10.920> throw<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.400> Madonna

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
an album that you would throw on Madonna

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.820 
an album that you would throw on Madonna
shows<00:01:12.479> off<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:12.780> she's<00:01:13.140> definitely<00:01:13.680> got

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
shows off that she's definitely got

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.890 
shows off that she's definitely got
vocal<00:01:14.310> talent<00:01:14.760> not<00:01:15.030> right<00:01:15.299> off<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.630> bat

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
vocal talent not right off the bat

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.810 
vocal talent not right off the bat
though<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.350> opening<00:01:16.680> track<00:01:16.890> lucky<00:01:17.490> star

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
though the opening track lucky star

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.179 
though the opening track lucky star
feels<00:01:18.210> like<00:01:18.450> it's<00:01:18.600> slightly<00:01:19.110> like<00:01:19.290> off-key<00:01:19.950> or

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
feels like it's slightly like off-key or

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.289 
feels like it's slightly like off-key or
maybe<00:01:20.369> it's<00:01:20.580> just<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.880> way<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.150> the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
maybe it's just the way that the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.390 
maybe it's just the way that the
synthesizers<00:01:22.020> kind<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.350> clash<00:01:22.710> with<00:01:23.250> her

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
synthesizers kind of clash with her

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.640 
synthesizers kind of clash with her
voice<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.880> tone<00:01:24.390> or<00:01:24.420> something<00:01:25.140> on<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.320> song

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
voice the tone or something on that song

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.280 
voice the tone or something on that song
is<00:01:25.890> just<00:01:26.100> not<00:01:26.610> quite<00:01:27.000> right<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.600> hurts<00:01:27.900> me

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
is just not quite right and it hurts me

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.260 
is just not quite right and it hurts me
so<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.950> keeps<00:01:29.070> me<00:01:29.220> from<00:01:29.490> fully<00:01:29.670> enjoying

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
so that keeps me from fully enjoying

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.600 
so that keeps me from fully enjoying
that<00:01:30.689> one<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:31.290> there<00:01:31.409> are<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:32.009> lot<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.310> moments

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
that one but there are a lot of moments

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.460

whole lot I think it's got a lot of

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.990 
whole lot I think it's got a lot of
spunk<00:02:14.380> and<00:02:14.620> spirit<00:02:15.010> it's<00:02:15.130> definitely<00:02:15.610> groovy

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
spunk and spirit it's definitely groovy

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.760 
spunk and spirit it's definitely groovy
it's<00:02:16.150> got<00:02:16.270> a<00:02:16.300> nice<00:02:16.510> bass<00:02:16.900> line<00:02:17.230> on<00:02:17.440> it<00:02:17.620> that

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
it's got a nice bass line on it that

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.980 
it's got a nice bass line on it that
feels<00:02:17.950> a<00:02:18.070> little<00:02:18.190> bit<00:02:18.370> funky<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.300> I'm<00:02:19.720> into

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
feels a little bit funky and I'm into

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.110 
feels a little bit funky and I'm into
that<00:02:20.020> but<00:02:20.470> it<00:02:20.800> just<00:02:21.010> drags<00:02:21.340> on<00:02:21.580> for<00:02:21.640> a<00:02:21.910> long

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
that but it just drags on for a long

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.360 
that but it just drags on for a long
time<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.660> it's<00:02:22.750> a<00:02:22.840> fact<00:02:23.080> physical<00:02:23.800> attraction

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
time and it's a fact physical attraction

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.890 
time and it's a fact physical attraction
and<00:02:24.460> burning<00:02:24.820> up<00:02:24.970> or<00:02:25.150> two<00:02:25.270> tracks<00:02:25.540> that<00:02:25.720> don't

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
and burning up or two tracks that don't

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.270 
and burning up or two tracks that don't
really<00:02:26.110> mess<00:02:26.320> around<00:02:26.350> don't<00:02:26.770> beat<00:02:26.980> around<00:02:27.070> the

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
really mess around don't beat around the

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.920 
really mess around don't beat around the
bush<00:02:27.460> they<00:02:27.670> just<00:02:27.880> kind<00:02:28.120> of<00:02:28.180> get<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.390> job<00:02:28.690> done

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
bush they just kind of get the job done

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.630 
bush they just kind of get the job done
and<00:02:29.230> that's<00:02:29.320> why<00:02:29.560> I<00:02:29.590> think<00:02:29.860> that<00:02:30.190> they're<00:02:30.430> two

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
and that's why I think that they're two

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.760 
and that's why I think that they're two
of<00:02:30.670> my<00:02:30.790> top<00:02:30.940> favorites<00:02:31.810> because<00:02:32.380> of<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.560> fact

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
of my top favorites because of the fact

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.380 
of my top favorites because of the fact
that<00:02:32.920> they<00:02:33.010> don't<00:02:33.130> drag<00:02:33.520> on<00:02:33.760> forever<00:02:34.030> it

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
that they don't drag on forever it

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.300 
that they don't drag on forever it
doesn't<00:02:34.420> feel<00:02:34.840> like<00:02:35.050> it<00:02:35.650> gets<00:02:35.830> eventually

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
doesn't feel like it gets eventually

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.730 
doesn't feel like it gets eventually
lifeless<00:02:36.820> and<00:02:37.030> I'm<00:02:37.090> like<00:02:37.300> I<00:02:37.450> can't<00:02:38.320> hear<00:02:38.590> this

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
lifeless and I'm like I can't hear this

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.320 
lifeless and I'm like I can't hear this
anymore<00:02:38.860> else<00:02:39.370> I'm<00:02:39.580> not<00:02:39.730> gonna<00:02:39.880> come<00:02:40.060> back<00:02:40.090> to

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
anymore else I'm not gonna come back to

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.300 
anymore else I'm not gonna come back to
this<00:02:40.450> for<00:02:40.660> a<00:02:40.690> long<00:02:40.930> time<00:02:40.960> I<00:02:41.530> think<00:02:41.770> that's<00:02:41.980> why

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
this for a long time I think that's why

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.400 
this for a long time I think that's why
those<00:02:42.880> two<00:02:42.910> have<00:02:43.360> stuck<00:02:43.660> with<00:02:43.810> me<00:02:44.050> over<00:02:44.080> the

those two have stuck with me over the
years<00:02:44.740> as<00:02:45.280> far<00:02:45.580> as<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.790> lyrics<00:02:46.150> go<00:02:46.240> there's

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
years as far as the lyrics go there's

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.420 
years as far as the lyrics go there's
nothing<00:02:46.660> mind-blowing<00:02:47.470> here<00:02:47.710> but<00:02:47.860> it<00:02:47.980> is<00:02:48.100> nice

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
nothing mind-blowing here but it is nice

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.130 
nothing mind-blowing here but it is nice
