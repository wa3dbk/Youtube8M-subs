00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
cutting this large is leaf wilt browning

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:57.959

at<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:56.799> ends<00:00:56.979> of<00:00:57.039> the<00:00:57.129> tips<00:00:57.370> I<00:00:57.489> don't<00:00:57.670> see<00:00:57.819> any

buried it in the existing soil it has a

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:08.880 
buried it in the existing soil it has a
little<00:01:06.070> bit<00:01:06.219> of<00:01:06.280> topsoil<00:01:06.759> and<00:01:07.270> Cowan<00:01:08.110> or<00:01:08.229> mixed

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.950 
little bit of topsoil and Cowan or mixed
in<00:01:09.039> but<00:01:09.250> it's<00:01:09.399> a<00:01:09.490> very<00:01:09.610> loose<00:01:09.880> soil<00:01:10.210> I<00:01:10.450> also

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
in but it's a very loose soil I also

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.020 
in but it's a very loose soil I also
planted<00:01:11.560> it<00:01:11.770> in<00:01:11.950> a<00:01:12.100> place<00:01:12.430> where<00:01:12.460> it<00:01:12.820> will<00:01:12.939> be

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
planted it in a place where it will be

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.599 
planted it in a place where it will be
shady<00:01:13.299> until<00:01:13.689> it<00:01:13.780> reaches<00:01:14.110> a<00:01:14.399> decent<00:01:15.399> height

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:15.609 
shady until it reaches a decent height

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:17.399 
shady until it reaches a decent height
and<00:01:15.909> that's<00:01:16.719> something<00:01:17.079> that<00:01:17.200> you<00:01:17.289> definitely

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
and that's something that you definitely

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.300 
and that's something that you definitely
want<00:01:17.799> to<00:01:17.829> consider<00:01:18.159> these<00:01:18.430> are<00:01:20.009> from<00:01:21.009> the<00:01:21.159> rain

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
want to consider these are from the rain

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.410 
want to consider these are from the rain
forest<00:01:21.700> and<00:01:21.909> I<00:01:21.969> like<00:01:22.149> to<00:01:22.299> grow<00:01:22.509> start<00:01:23.500> in<00:01:23.740> shade

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
forest and I like to grow start in shade

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.999 
forest and I like to grow start in shade
so<00:01:25.420> when<00:01:25.689> you<00:01:25.780> take<00:01:26.289> cuttings<00:01:26.680> you<00:01:26.799> want<00:01:26.950> to

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
so when you take cuttings you want to

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.849 
so when you take cuttings you want to
make<00:01:27.100> sure<00:01:27.250> you<00:01:27.340> plant<00:01:27.609> them<00:01:27.729> there<00:01:28.859> here's

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:29.859 
make sure you plant them there here's

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:33.090 
make sure you plant them there here's
another<00:01:30.189> one<00:01:30.689> now<00:01:31.689> this<00:01:31.990> one<00:01:32.049> is<00:01:32.560> showing<00:01:32.890> a

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
another one now this one is showing a

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.990 
another one now this one is showing a
sign<00:01:33.340> of<00:01:33.700> not<00:01:34.409> being<00:01:35.409> successful<00:01:35.700> look<00:01:36.700> right

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
sign of not being successful look right

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.669 
sign of not being successful look right
here<00:01:37.240> you<00:01:37.299> can<00:01:37.570> tell<00:01:37.810> that<00:01:38.049> the<00:01:38.170> leaf<00:01:38.380> is

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:38.679 
here you can tell that the leaf is

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:40.020 
here you can tell that the leaf is
starting<00:01:39.070> to<00:01:39.159> show<00:01:39.340> a<00:01:39.369> different<00:01:39.759> kind<00:01:39.939> of

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
starting to show a different kind of

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.109 
starting to show a different kind of
color<00:01:40.859> like<00:01:41.859> it's<00:01:42.039> drying<00:01:42.340> out<00:01:42.640> that's<00:01:42.909> not<00:01:42.999> a

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
color like it's drying out that's not a

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.020 
color like it's drying out that's not a
good<00:01:43.359> sign<00:01:44.219> I'm<00:01:45.219> not<00:01:45.399> too<00:01:45.549> worried<00:01:45.820> about<00:01:45.850> that

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
good sign I'm not too worried about that

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.849 
good sign I'm not too worried about that
anyway<00:01:46.509> because<00:01:46.840> this<00:01:47.109> wasn't<00:01:47.350> a<00:01:47.499> great

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:47.859 
anyway because this wasn't a great

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:50.489 
anyway because this wasn't a great
location<00:01:48.609> for<00:01:48.640> it<00:01:48.999> anyhow<00:01:49.869> these<00:01:50.079> leaves<00:01:50.320> get

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:50.499 
location for it anyhow these leaves get

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:52.050 
location for it anyhow these leaves get
gigantic<00:01:51.070> and<00:01:51.219> even<00:01:51.429> just<00:01:51.579> planting<00:01:51.939> this

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
gigantic and even just planting this

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.029 
gigantic and even just planting this
cutting<00:01:52.420> he's<00:01:53.259> blocking<00:01:53.740> one<00:01:53.890> of<00:01:53.979> the

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
cutting he's blocking one of the

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:59.010 
cutting he's blocking one of the
pathways<00:01:54.549> out<00:01:54.850> of<00:01:55.689> my<00:01:55.990> backyard<00:01:56.229> so<00:01:56.890> I<00:01:58.020> will

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
pathways out of my backyard so I will

will<00:02:20.730> do<00:02:21.200> once<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:22.320> gets<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.560> little<00:02:22.680> bigger<00:02:23.540> and

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
will do once it gets a little bigger and

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.480 
will do once it gets a little bigger and
here's<00:02:24.750> another<00:02:24.900> one<00:02:25.200> that<00:02:25.440> I've<00:02:25.950> planted<00:02:26.220> in

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
here's another one that I've planted in

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.630 
here's another one that I've planted in
a<00:02:26.720> little<00:02:27.720> bit<00:02:27.840> more<00:02:28.020> sunny<00:02:28.290> area<00:02:28.680> it<00:02:29.460> also

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
a little bit more sunny area it also

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.310 
a little bit more sunny area it also
looks<00:02:29.970> like<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.510> leaves<00:02:30.720> are<00:02:30.930> doing<00:02:31.140> quite

sunlight<00:02:36.980> again<00:02:37.980> burying<00:02:38.700> it

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
sunlight again burying it
