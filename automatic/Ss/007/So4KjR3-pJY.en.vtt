00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.020
 2 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.020
 goo 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:15.910
 Whiskey and other teachers let me see the parliament so far from the ground we have come from here on 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:21.279
 Stylish but But where you want to say and immediately bought a house 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:22.390
 First of all important to me we live is in the air you are living it a recap of the junior high school large to finance I, et al. 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:27.320
 Of course not oxygen 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:33.800
 In 80 per small 0 present in 20% of the entire me that I have entered co2 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:38.420
 Gotei Well it this gag without the book Ya that carbon dioxide is 0.03% Gon is 1% 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:44.420
 By the way, we talk about living things , but we breathe this air and 20% of the house 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:47.310
 Return to brother carbon monoxide with 4% oxygen Regular oxygen and 4% decrease to 16% 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.460
 Carbon dioxide is increased by 4% included 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:54.060
 Thanks to the opposite Keema cup still remain 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:58.500
 If it were not trigeminal or along Yaroa no meaning to the bank breathing 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:04.410
 Really, that band is 1013 if it is 1 atm hpa on the ground normally 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:07.330
 If it is mercury, 760mm is this Chia 2 It is about the degree of the clogging of the air Even by train 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:11.020
 Most if clogged receives a force that it sounds hollow force 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.450
 Jammed in place, such as clogged the creaking leather is something like that Yaro received a 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:18.280
 We receive power from place to place not clogged 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:23.350
 Then there is air pressure even on the ground where we live , so the pressure of air pressure is generated 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:27.340
 In our books, we usually feel the barometric pressure almost as much as our air- packed products our mothers are also packed 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:31.390
 If you say flowers and pressure, it's clogged up and it's so strong and so skunky so weak 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.049
 Nothing say I feel members because of Tteyuu If you are waiting for the same month is push back with the same force 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.759
 Weird 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.840
 With a force of about 1 km to the place of the roughly 1 centimeter 1 centimeter in this atmospheric pressure 1 contract Chinami 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.920
 It is pressed 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.370
 a It is strange that nothing is felt though it is pushed by such strong power 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.470
 Fuji tree is nothing of ours 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:52.940
 The train is Fukkafuka also next to the crammed in pretty well see for example the train in one Article 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:56.720
 I 'm going to try to get in on people from the low nine cows to Skaska who are stuck and attached 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:02:01.550
 Creaking leather KarasuKatsu back home say the force of the flow Ya do such things very natural Te 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.360
 Evaporation want Toka Sukkasuka is entered or Then again I et al Toka space blood to the contrary from the house 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:08.039
 It is imagining that other teachers come to me 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.899
 Another Gusha' If we had been in that jammed suddenly scratches like a midst of the sea to reverse or become station goods so 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:15.120
 I because it is said it would be a dispute Chanko Te 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:19.560
 In the case of water, it is about 1000 times heavier than air, so the air is at a height of 10,000 meters. 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:23.350
 Even if 1 atm pressure is packed with water and dad 10 meters , it can be packed as much 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:28.480
 The pressure is increased by about 1 atmosphere every 10m, usually in the water. 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.320
 I gotta I Now Do you can say one shot every time if you go say evolution but Hen go because Ya contracted more 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.100
 Tara Aunt 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:36.220
 It may be really motivated by tube worms to Senju Namako 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:40.570
 I have seen articles from buckwheat are saying No Puramai zero Ya 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:44.110
 Well anyway Ya do this pressure to make the weather to be good due to the influence of the water 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:48.220
 Change of state of the water is now before you do this action next time in the anime 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:53.120
 Konasui I Osadaiya of water evaporates at 100 degrees to the ice at 0 degrees 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:58.280
 But I want to say I want to go I want to answer each of the state Katama occur will answer 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:03.379
 Determine the reverse reason above the first as it comes to times expectation that dissolves in coagulation reverse Nde 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.489
 Both answer is expected to reverse or become fuselage say would answer and I want this continue to gulp 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:09.290
 Speaking of a show car 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:11.510
 By the way, warm and go when the temperature want to go or want to go from clean to up to kun Ya no answer 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.110
 When the state change to say that came from 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.620
 As the temperature rises, leaves 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:20.790
 Seen in one shot in when I except the world of micro If you say or why 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:24.420
 The water is completely after ice and the patient is in the knitting room 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:29.280
 Even this is in liquid now and moving around but everyone Hagaren 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:33.100
 Just everyone gathered when it comes to the body to feeling Zahara shooting rampage but not in the house 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:38.140
 I fly out to the outside out house there is a chase freedom to N thread eyes even away 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:39.460
 And reservoir had the same Oh Sayaka 0 taken in order to transform and come as far as the state changes 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.320
 Energy is used 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:48.280
 I thought the start of the above, et al. Now when you and uh also rise transformed into a whole liquid it if good for Transformation 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.550
 When they respond to expectations , they have the energy to transform into a healthy state 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.140
 Oh dear 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:57.940
 However , it's because I feel like I'm going to sweat at home when I wipe it at home 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:02.980
 It What Ya from taking heat from the minute body of this edit energy when the sweat is the body 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:07.690
 It does not say the heat of vaporization and it is this weak, and when the gas returns to the liquid, soldier energy also changes 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.540
 Three late become hot Ya do here was hiding Oh Oh anywhere until this Yue Ya Nde become What 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:14.120
 I was lurking 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:15.230
 Spacious enough to become hot in do better as strong as become hot as vivid after 3 type that I heat 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.650
 Write in a runaway 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:24.050
 Because become Sukkasuka it basically came liquid gas 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:25.039
 Janja gets bigger as it moves, and in the case of water only, special ice colder than water 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.529
 Big but 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:33.779
 This is the May zone in the case of ice, so its split 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:34.889
 In the case of the patient or water from 4 degrees is the smallest clogged in 

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:40.889
 By thought 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:41.219
 There is pressure and Mecha relationship this gloss just this change of state of the state change that was first to speak in such things 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.699
 The 

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:48.550
 If it is 1 atmospheric pressure, it boils at 100 degrees and burns high mountains and so on 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:53.170
 If the pressure is low, even tick ions will evaporate and if the pressure is high 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:57.760
 Even if the temperature exceeds 100 degrees, the vaporizer or pressure can not use this. 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:05:02.900
 The point is that if you are under pressure to convert the customer's location, you will go wild 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:07.250
 Rutteko go out easier than usual when little he does taste force it like that your cans 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:14.229
 In particular, Toko of this state change or okay but there was quite gallop in not What 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:14.229
 Good luck firm Connor nation Chapter 3, such are holding meeting a to dawn by east
