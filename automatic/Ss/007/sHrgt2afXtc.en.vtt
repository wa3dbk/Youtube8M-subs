whatever<00:02:02.479> like<00:02:03.440> it<00:02:03.470> still<00:02:03.860> takes<00:02:04.250> a<00:02:04.399> little

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:04.489

work<00:02:04.670> to<00:02:04.729> do<00:02:04.940> all<00:02:05.000> that<00:02:05.030> kind<00:02:05.330> of<00:02:05.450> stuff

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
work to do all that kind of stuff

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.139 
work to do all that kind of stuff
especially<00:02:06.619> in<00:02:07.039> your<00:02:07.220> style<00:02:07.819> which<00:02:08.000> is

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
especially in your style which is

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.699 
especially in your style which is
different<00:02:08.360> when<00:02:08.599> we<00:02:08.750> were<00:02:08.810> to<00:02:08.989> style<00:02:09.349> which

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
different when we were to style which

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.150 
different when we were to style which
means<00:02:09.979> that<00:02:10.069> you<00:02:10.160> have<00:02:10.250> your<00:02:10.640> own<00:02:10.670> style<00:02:11.180> but<00:02:12.160> i

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
means that you have your own style but i

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.110 
means that you have your own style but i
guess<00:02:14.470> i'm<00:02:15.470> just<00:02:15.830> an<00:02:16.220> ultimate<00:02:16.640> failure<00:02:16.849> in

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
guess i'm just an ultimate failure in

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.869 
guess i'm just an ultimate failure in
life<00:02:17.300> because<00:02:17.750> I<00:02:18.080> Drive<00:02:18.440> which<00:02:19.400> is<00:02:19.610> sad

life because I Drive which is sad

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:24.729 
life because I Drive which is sad
because<00:02:20.140> I<00:02:21.140> really<00:02:21.500> do<00:02:21.620> enjoy<00:02:21.650> it<00:02:22.270> so<00:02:23.739> I'm

because I really do enjoy it so I'm

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.900 
because I really do enjoy it so I'm
