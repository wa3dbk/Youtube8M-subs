00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
see I'm using a very very cheap airbrush

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.899 
see I'm using a very very cheap airbrush
that's<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.860> one<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.010> have<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.490> I'm<00:01:14.700> applying

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
that's the one I have and I'm applying

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.810 
that's the one I have and I'm applying
the<00:01:15.509> polar<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.259> white<00:01:16.890> primer<00:01:17.299> from<00:01:18.299> Vallejo

the<00:01:20.820> PSI<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.930> around<00:01:22.520> 25<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.670> 30<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.180> don't

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
the PSI is that around 25 to 30 I don't

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.609 
the PSI is that around 25 to 30 I don't
really<00:01:25.520> pay<00:01:26.520> much<00:01:26.729> attention<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.619> just

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
really pay much attention to that I just

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.390 
really pay much attention to that I just
find<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.759> PSI<00:01:30.150> on<00:01:30.479> which<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:31.020> think<00:01:31.380> it's<00:01:31.650> doing

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
find the PSI on which I think it's doing

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.200 
find the PSI on which I think it's doing
a<00:01:32.490> good<00:01:32.820> job<00:01:32.880> if<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.930> need<00:01:34.110> more<00:01:34.259> pressure<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.619> I

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
a good job if I need more pressure I I

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.719 
a good job if I need more pressure I I
turn<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.329> off<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.509> notch<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.750> little<00:01:36.960> bit<00:01:37.079> but

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
turn it off a notch a little bit but

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.510 
turn it off a notch a little bit but
it's<00:01:38.729> just<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:39.180> priming<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.470> very<00:01:41.100> simple

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
it's just a priming it's a very simple

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.539 
it's just a priming it's a very simple
as<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.180> can<00:01:42.299> see<00:01:42.420> I'm<00:01:42.600> doing<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.960> with<00:01:43.079> a

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
as you can see I'm doing it with a

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.359 
as you can see I'm doing it with a
$15.00<00:01:44.549> airbrush

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
$15.00 airbrush

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:52.139 
$15.00 airbrush
and<00:01:46.840> it's<00:01:47.840> very<00:01:48.350> very<00:01:48.950> easy

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
sure that the primer gets into all of

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.559 
sure that the primer gets into all of
the<00:01:57.319> little<00:01:57.590> cracks<00:01:57.920> and<00:01:58.039> crevices<00:01:58.130> and<00:01:58.609> be

00:01:59.559 --> 00:01:59.569 
the little cracks and crevices and be

the little cracks and crevices and be
sure<00:01:59.719> to<00:02:00.079> have<00:02:01.009> the<00:02:01.429> bottle<00:02:02.179> completely

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
sure to have the bottle completely

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.740 
sure to have the bottle completely
covered<00:02:02.990> like<00:02:03.289> I<00:02:03.319> have<00:02:03.590> here

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
retained primer and I'm coloring in some

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.290 
retained primer and I'm coloring in some
shadows<00:02:33.630> some<00:02:34.050> appreciating<00:02:34.970> for<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.060> next

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
shadows some appreciating for the next

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.800 
shadows some appreciating for the next
step<00:02:36.480> for<00:02:36.960> the<00:02:37.020> color<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:38.480> yeah<00:02:39.480> I'm<00:02:39.630> using

step for the color and yeah I'm using

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.510 
step for the color and yeah I'm using
the<00:02:39.990> black<00:02:40.170> blurring<00:02:40.740> and<00:02:40.830> primer<00:02:41.130> through

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
the black blurring and primer through

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.370 
the black blurring and primer through
the<00:02:41.670> airbrush<00:02:42.030> it's<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.720> same<00:02:42.930> as<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.170> white

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
the airbrush it's the same as the white

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.410 
the airbrush it's the same as the white
but<00:02:43.709> just<00:02:44.010> from<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.250> bottom<00:02:44.610> and<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:45.150> places

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
but just from the bottom and the places

black was a little bit thick I don't
know<00:03:16.050> if<00:03:16.200> it's<00:03:16.380> if<00:03:16.830> it's<00:03:16.980> because<00:03:17.220> it's<00:03:17.400> old

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
know if it's if it's because it's old

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.479 
know if it's if it's because it's old
but<00:03:18.570> I<00:03:18.630> just<00:03:18.930> add<00:03:19.140> a<00:03:19.170> little<00:03:19.560> bit<00:03:19.739> of<00:03:19.769> water<00:03:20.400> to

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
but I just add a little bit of water to

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:28.910 
but I just add a little bit of water to
help<00:03:20.790> help<00:03:21.480> it<00:03:21.900> out<00:03:22.050> a<00:03:22.110> bit<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:23.690> and<00:03:24.690> that's<00:03:24.870> it

now<00:03:29.920> this<00:03:30.130> is<00:03:30.220> how<00:03:30.400> the<00:03:30.460> model<00:03:30.910> looks<00:03:31.180> after

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
now this is how the model looks after

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:42.800 
now this is how the model looks after
applying<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:32.620> shades

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
as you can see from the top looks almost

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:53.190 
as you can see from the top looks almost
white<00:03:46.360> from<00:03:46.930> the<00:03:47.050> bottom<00:03:47.320> looks<00:03:47.820> black<00:03:52.200> next

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.230 
I'm going back to the shadows with the
black<00:05:30.270> primer<00:05:30.980> just<00:05:31.980> to<00:05:32.190> redefine<00:05:33.090> the

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
black primer just to redefine the

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.820 
black primer just to redefine the
shadows<00:05:33.510> a<00:05:33.540> little<00:05:33.810> bit<00:05:33.900> more<00:05:34.110> on<00:05:34.380> the

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
shadows a little bit more on the

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
shadows a little bit more on the
exaggerator

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:35.850 
exaggerator

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.590 
exaggerator
because<00:05:36.570> I<00:05:36.660> really<00:05:36.900> like<00:05:36.930> to<00:05:37.200> look<00:05:37.430> very

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
because I really like to look very

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.750 
because I really like to look very
contrasting<00:05:39.600> look<00:05:40.190> at<00:05:41.190> the<00:05:41.280> beginning<00:05:41.460> and

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
contrasting look at the beginning and

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.000 
contrasting look at the beginning and
the<00:05:42.420> end<00:05:42.570> result<00:05:42.840> turned<00:05:43.410> out<00:05:43.530> a<00:05:43.650> little<00:05:43.800> bit

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
the end result turned out a little bit

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:46.790 
the end result turned out a little bit
too<00:05:44.160> subtle<00:05:44.310> for<00:05:44.490> me<00:05:44.810> but<00:05:45.810> if<00:05:46.410> you<00:05:46.530> like<00:05:46.680> it

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
too subtle for me but if you like it

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.800 
too subtle for me but if you like it
like<00:05:46.920> it<00:05:47.070> was<00:05:47.250> you<00:05:47.820> can<00:05:47.940> live<00:05:48.090> like<00:05:48.240> that<00:05:48.390> but

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
like it was you can live like that but

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.680 
like it was you can live like that but
to<00:05:49.290> my<00:05:49.380> taste<00:05:49.620> I<00:05:49.890> want<00:05:50.790> very<00:05:51.090> very<00:05:51.240> deep

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
to my taste I want very very deep

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.390 
to my taste I want very very deep
shadows<00:05:52.110> and<00:05:52.320> a<00:05:52.830> good<00:05:53.430> transition<00:05:54.150> like<00:05:54.480> this

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
shadows and a good transition like this

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.510 
shadows and a good transition like this
also<00:05:56.400> the<00:05:57.000> Castilian<00:05:57.480> green<00:05:57.690> is<00:05:57.900> a<00:05:57.960> very<00:05:58.530> dark

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
also the Castilian green is a very dark

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.930 
also the Castilian green is a very dark
green<00:05:59.640> so<00:06:00.270> black<00:06:01.110> works<00:06:02.070> just<00:06:02.520> fine<00:06:02.670> as<00:06:02.910> a

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 
green so black works just fine as a

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.660 
green so black works just fine as a
shadow<00:06:03.240> for<00:06:03.540> it<00:06:03.660> and<00:06:04.130> this<00:06:05.130> is<00:06:05.190> how<00:06:05.400> the<00:06:05.460> model

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:05.670 
shadow for it and this is how the model

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:10.780 
shadow for it and this is how the model
looks<00:06:06.140> at<00:06:07.140> the<00:06:07.290> end<00:06:07.470> of<00:06:07.680> the<00:06:08.370> airbrushing<00:06:08.880> I

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:10.790 
looks at the end of the airbrushing I
