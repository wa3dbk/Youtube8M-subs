00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.580
 soon there will be behind my back 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.650
 new high ground dominant north 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.120
 capital and lahta center which 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.910
 will simultaneously become an attraction and 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.199
 business activity of our city 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.820
 it is necessary to solve the transport problem 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.130
 this territory and today we will see 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.050
 what came up with the city to provide 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.820
 Entrance class at the center of a new business 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.830
 the center of power was the impetus for development 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.320
 new road network in the seaside area 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.790
 who does not take the lead on 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.130
 construction of new housing in St. Petersburg 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.079
 residential is built only in yntolovo 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.450
 Quarter accommodation for about 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.140
 60 thousand people for them new roads 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.140
 will be salvation 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.700
 so let's figure out what to build and 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.950
 where is the main highway which should 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.710
 solve accessibility problems and quarters 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.660
 buildings and lakhta center this m 49 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.100
 it will start from the overpass in 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.020
 Olgino where it is now 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.000
 railway crossing further she 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.020
 will go through horse lacquer there western 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.680
 speed diameter 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.930
 m 49 connects the coastal highway with the area 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.460
 heaters and western with a red diameter and 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.990
 motorists will be able to get on 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.560
 parachute glider curfew 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.630
 Avenue 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.100
 while you drive up to new buildings you can either 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.200
 along the seaside highway through 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.910
 Olgino further spider on the Latin road 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.729
 either through western speed diameter 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.440
 or as with departure on the same road new 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.450
 the track will firstly become optional 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.399
 by entry-exit to this territory in 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.500
 secondly, it kind of unloads the ring 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.240
 you can really count on that 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.160
 such a decision that is essentially 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.830
 let on a short stretch but an understudy 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.479
 Ring Road will allow well though 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.899
 somehow maneuver and slightly 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.789
 unload the seaside highway and end 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.740
 the result may even Vyborg highway while 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.240
 Primorskoe highway can not be called the 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.039
 problematic place in petersburg 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.960
 but whether it will still work when it starts 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.860
 lakhta center food costs the whole volume 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.860
 planned housing 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.250
 to the entrance to the very center of Lahti will 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.020
 built several turning congresses 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.210
 alignment of the seaside Volgin street 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.060
 and at the end of the street savushkina and also 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.830
 one new road take route m32 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.480
 back is the seaside highway i and 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.250
 sister rail branch 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.270
 directions apparently around here 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.930
 must pass 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.700
 promising highway m32 which will go around 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.080
 Olga village is located literally in 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.660
 50 meters from where we are now 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.980
 we are and connect with the projected 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.140
 routes m 49 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.970
 here we will also plan an overpass over 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.980
 railroad with access to the seaside 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.340
 highway with access to lakhta 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.340
 center 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.620
 ultimately the general traffic pattern in 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.110
 northwestern part of the seaside region 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.099
 would look like this m32 from 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.040
 seaside highway 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.569
 skirting olgino goes to m 49th 49 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.799
 go parallel to the cat cross 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.750
 western speed diameter 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.580
 and then connect with the road to the heater 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.319
 and Suzdal Avenue in the final 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.030
 account if there are city authorities 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.080
 means for complete and speedy 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.760
 implementation of these plans 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.709
 residents of new districts of Yuntolovo and 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.569
 employees and visitors of the lakhta center 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.470
 will be easy and without traffic jams to get to 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.750
 work or at home 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.920
