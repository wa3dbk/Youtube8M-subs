00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
the little commercial that they had you

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.840 
the little commercial that they had you
could<00:03:28.290> fold<00:03:28.560> it<00:03:28.709> up<00:03:28.830> pull<00:03:29.280> it<00:03:29.310> like<00:03:29.520> this<00:03:31.850> like

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
could fold it up pull it like this like

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.630 
could fold it up pull it like this like
that

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.460 

close<00:03:36.240> it<00:03:36.450> I<00:03:37.490> gotta<00:03:38.490> say<00:03:38.819> it<00:03:38.880> is<00:03:39.210> it<00:03:40.110> feels<00:03:40.350> very

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
close it I gotta say it is it feels very

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:47.780 
close it I gotta say it is it feels very
nice<00:03:43.130> so<00:03:44.130> I<00:03:44.569> guess<00:03:45.569> without<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.770> ipad<00:03:47.130> 2<00:03:47.400> or

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
nice so I guess without the ipad 2 or

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.390 
nice so I guess without the ipad 2 or
that<00:03:48.030> not<00:03:48.870> add<00:03:49.140> too<00:03:49.350> attached<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:49.680> it<00:03:50.010> feels

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
that not add too attached to it feels

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.240 
that not add too attached to it feels
very<00:03:50.520> some<00:03:51.860> fragile<00:03:53.510> but<00:03:54.510> these<00:03:55.190> look<00:03:56.190> like

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
very some fragile but these look like

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.330 
very some fragile but these look like
they<00:03:56.700> hold<00:03:57.060> it<00:03:57.180> pretty<00:03:57.450> good<00:03:57.510> and<00:03:58.470> I<00:03:59.280> don't

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
they hold it pretty good and I don't

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.310 
they hold it pretty good and I don't
think<00:03:59.640> I<00:03:59.700> have<00:03:59.790> to<00:03:59.910> worry<00:04:00.060> about<00:04:00.209> its<00:04:00.900> falling

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
think I have to worry about its falling

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.490 
think I have to worry about its falling
off<00:04:03.590> so<00:04:04.910> that's<00:04:05.910> cool<00:04:06.239> so<00:04:06.750> compared<00:04:07.319> to<00:04:07.410> the

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
off so that's cool so compared to the

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.460 
off so that's cool so compared to the
ipad<00:04:07.620> i<00:04:08.220> mean<00:04:09.000> compared<00:04:09.510> to<00:04:09.600> the<00:04:09.750> macbook<00:04:10.260> pro

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
ipad i mean compared to the macbook pro

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.540 
ipad i mean compared to the macbook pro
13-inch<00:04:11.540> it<00:04:12.540> really<00:04:13.070> makes<00:04:14.070> you<00:04:14.160> look<00:04:14.310> like<00:04:14.489> a

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
13-inch it really makes you look like a

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.080 
13-inch it really makes you look like a
netbook<00:04:15.440> so<00:04:16.440> that's<00:04:16.919> a<00:04:17.070> comparison<00:04:17.760> the

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
netbook so that's a comparison the

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.550 
netbook so that's a comparison the
buttons<00:04:18.450> you<00:04:18.630> can<00:04:18.660> really<00:04:18.959> push<00:04:19.260> here<00:04:19.530> and

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
buttons you can really push here and

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.800 
buttons you can really push here and
over<00:04:19.950> here<00:04:19.980> there's<00:04:20.340> there<00:04:20.910> is<00:04:21.209> no<00:04:21.450> actual

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.810 
so basically you can't put the ipad like
this<00:05:07.950> down<00:05:08.490> and<00:05:09.419> expect<00:05:09.930> I've<00:05:10.350> ipad<00:05:11.040> 2<00:05:11.340> to

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.750 
this down and expect I've ipad 2 to
sleep<00:05:12.530> it<00:05:13.530> has<00:05:13.740> to<00:05:13.950> be<00:05:13.979> on<00:05:14.280> the<00:05:14.430> heavier<00:05:14.729> side

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
sleep it has to be on the heavier side

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.840 
sleep it has to be on the heavier side
over<00:05:15.630> here<00:05:15.870> so<00:05:16.620> the<00:05:16.740> ipad<00:05:17.100> 2<00:05:17.250> has<00:05:17.430> clothes<00:05:17.700> like

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
over here so the ipad 2 has clothes like

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.760 
over here so the ipad 2 has clothes like
a<00:05:17.880> laptop<00:05:18.360> if<00:05:18.510> you<00:05:18.660> want<00:05:18.900> to<00:05:19.110> unpair<00:05:19.620> the

device there's a off button right here

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.330 
device there's a off button right here
so<00:05:24.330> right<00:05:24.660> now<00:05:24.690> it<00:05:25.200> has<00:05:25.680> some<00:05:26.070> it<00:05:26.340> responds<00:05:26.990> and
