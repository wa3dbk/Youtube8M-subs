00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
and we found that it's premature to

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.740 
and we found that it's premature to
start<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.439> program<00:02:01.950> like<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:03.020> simply<00:02:04.020> because

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750

a lot<00:02:14.100> of<00:02:14.130> qualified<00:02:14.790> professors<00:02:15.480> at<00:02:15.900> this

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
a lot of qualified professors at this

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.240 
a lot of qualified professors at this
level<00:02:18.050> secondly<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.320> requires<00:02:19.830> the

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
level secondly it requires the

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.180 
level secondly it requires the
availability<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.110> authentic<00:02:22.110> books<00:02:22.380> that

availability of authentic books that

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.090 
availability of authentic books that
would<00:02:23.550> fit<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.150> curriculum<00:02:24.810> that<00:02:25.230> should<00:02:25.950> be

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
would fit the curriculum that should be

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.550 
would fit the curriculum that should be
selected<00:02:26.310> by<00:02:27.210> our<00:02:27.240> University<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.200> this<00:02:28.440> is

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
selected by our University and this is

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.040 
selected by our University and this is
not<00:02:28.680> available<00:02:29.010> yet<00:02:29.310> so<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.000> don't<00:02:30.240> think<00:02:30.750> that

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
not available yet so I don't think that
