00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.570
 Hi everyone, guys, welcome to this 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.480
 new video is pay and today we are 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.770
 back on farneti 4 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.390
 right now I think I understand 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.490
 a little better how they work 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.810
 dynamics of the whole game so I think 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.240
 to be able to finish at least the second one 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.710
 loved we say that more or less the sequel 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.260
 it would be a little bit always moving 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.930
 and often look behind why 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.280
 obviously I turned to look 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.930
 what happens in our room 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.450
 more behind us will accumulate 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.510
 cold bad that I did not understand 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:41.050
 what they do but they hurt or that 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:44.730
 you have to be very careful to 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.730
 example if you hear breathing 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.879
 that's why he thinks more about me 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.809
 in the wardrobe cefop yes no is one of 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.640
 night 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:59.440
 I hear steps even though it is not there 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.850
 nothing however just ok ok then always 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.290
 now I think there is foxy 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.450
 in the closet we keep the door closed for a moment 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.210
 door 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.200
 ok ok ok it 's a little bit calming 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.210
 get 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.100
 ok calmed down seca another we see a 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.150
 moment only if by chance there is pony who 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.150
 wants to come and get it 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:25.080
 ok ok he did run away we see a 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.080
 moment to federal 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:38.640
 no if you don't like hovels now 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:40.409
 I close the door because right now 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.820
 I also feel that I don't like them from 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:47.490
 this door we say here more or less 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:52.159
 always if it's all right 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.159
 here are the bad brakes that fucking 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.570
 however, I realized that this is what it is 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.700
 there is to do is often look behind is 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.709
 get close to the doors to see if there is 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:08.640
 someone and this part is heard here 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:12.860
 someone breathe no ok ok it's just from 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.860
 that boats then we see here that 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.910
 madonna to that pie for that 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.920
 which I mean that more or less this 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.989
 game has always had monsters not 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.299
 cap very restless others but 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.849

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:32.310

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.820
 this is the theme and long of the blue 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.980

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.200

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.890
