00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
but the very end of the song is worth it

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.360 
but the very end of the song is worth it
really<00:05:12.419> makes<00:05:12.630> the<00:05:12.870> strongest<00:05:13.260> point<00:05:13.620> if<00:05:13.860> I

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
really makes the strongest point if I

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.550

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
live performance is through a website

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.350 
live performance is through a website
called<00:05:43.530> concert<00:05:44.160> window<00:05:44.580> which<00:05:44.820> I<00:05:45.030> have<00:05:45.180> not

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
called concert window which I have not

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.940 
called concert window which I have not
heard<00:05:45.510> of<00:05:45.660> before<00:05:45.780> but<00:05:46.169> it's<00:05:46.289> interesting<00:05:46.560> it

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
heard of before but it's interesting it

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.909 
heard of before but it's interesting it
looks<00:05:47.099> like<00:05:47.280> a<00:05:47.310> way<00:05:47.550> for<00:05:48.000> bands<00:05:48.900> to<00:05:49.530> perform

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
looks like a way for bands to perform

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:51.800 
looks like a way for bands to perform
for<00:05:50.220> an<00:05:50.460> audience<00:05:50.550> without<00:05:51.030> without<00:05:51.510> having

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
for an audience without without having

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.260 
for an audience without without having
to<00:05:51.900> actually<00:05:51.960> rent<00:05:52.889> the<00:05:53.039> space<00:05:53.070> and<00:05:53.820> do<00:05:54.120> all

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
to actually rent the space and do all

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:55.969 
to actually rent the space and do all
the<00:05:54.449> logistics<00:05:54.990> of<00:05:55.139> setting<00:05:55.500> that<00:05:55.620> up<00:05:55.680> they

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
the logistics of setting that up they

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:57.800 
the logistics of setting that up they
basically<00:05:56.400> do<00:05:56.940> their<00:05:57.120> performance<00:05:57.690> and

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
basically do their performance and

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.719 
basically do their performance and
stream<00:05:58.229> it<00:05:58.260> out<00:05:58.560> and<00:05:58.830> people<00:05:59.220> who<00:05:59.340> have<00:05:59.520> paid

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
stream it out and people who have paid

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:01.670 
stream it out and people who have paid
can<00:06:00.120> then<00:06:00.300> log<00:06:00.539> in<00:06:00.870> and<00:06:01.080> watch<00:06:01.470> the

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
can then log in and watch the

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.680 
can then log in and watch the
performance<00:06:02.220> I<00:06:02.370> think<00:06:02.729> they<00:06:02.849> can<00:06:03.060> set<00:06:03.300> varying

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
performance I think they can set varying

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.420 
performance I think they can set varying
amounts<00:06:04.080> you<00:06:04.169> have<00:06:04.320> to<00:06:04.440> pay<00:06:04.620> but<00:06:04.680> Uncle<00:06:05.310> bond

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
amounts you have to pay but Uncle bond

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.640 
amounts you have to pay but Uncle bond
