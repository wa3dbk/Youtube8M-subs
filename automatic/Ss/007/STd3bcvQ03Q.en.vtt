00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.300
 and then the economic cycle, the name of the 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.100
 today and today I will be with you as 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.220
 play the full version in the song 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:28.360
 I liked you so much the May solution 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:46.150
 has two chords the most 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:50.400
 with the total of the month of 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.400
 pay and following quarreled easy 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:11.160
 two videos 23 peace in the first part we 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.170
 let's put it down once and on 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.030
 The sequence we are going to attack on the back 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.150
 with the palm of the right hand or 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:29.010
 support the cup of the hand on the back and 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:30.630
 to play one of the most recent on the second 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:42.540
 We'll focus on the sequel to 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:46.700
 up and down three times three times the 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.700
 first and second parts with the following 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.369
 in the third part we'll play the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:00.060
 work called him back and forth 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:03.200
 down and another in the queue the sequence 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.200
 complete to get 20 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:26.910
 those after the first pass there with seventh 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.910
 higher if smaller with seven 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:34.470
 our smallest secret with 7m Mar 17 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:44.160
 as soon as you're gone 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.190
 How many I miss and feel alive. 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.090
 that goodbye 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:55.350
 Today was my life, my death. 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:57.500
 my story of the future or not 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.500
 good 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:06.030
 the last two verses of the first part 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:09.230
 the chords of themselves smaller with 7 thousand m 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.460
 higher with seven 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.380
 We have a pass with people. 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.380
 different next 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:25.410
 Well let's put bets of this minor with 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.030
 seven and play once down and over 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.450
 once down but drowned out the 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.450
 things 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.160
 as a result when we were changing 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:41.160
 the bridge that is passing to achieve 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.730
 largest with headquarters in this range 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:49.640
 We will play a place above and the 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.640
 next job 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:12.840
 let's ride the mayo with seven and play 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:15.060
 with once up is the following when 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.620
 We played this time up with ge 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.440
 higher with seven 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:24.139
 we'll cut just put the blue whiting 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.139
 on the strings of this damn thing 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:31.889
 following up and play for or 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:37.190
 job 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:37.190
 the greater contribution grants next 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:50.930
 Then you know it down to 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:50.930
 up twice following 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:05:01.229
 The last chord is your refrain. 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:06.479
 last passing of the song is 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:12.990
 this is loneliness 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:14.849
 I think I have already entered 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.240
 we will assemble the package of this minor 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:19.560
 seventh and playing bass and 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.930
 Brazil 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:25.879
 now we will loosen the fingers of 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:30.349
 left hand to mute the sound 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:36.270
 open again and dollar down 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:42.060
 This is how the grandparents begin to 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:53.339
 function better with seventh there with 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:56.509
 seventh largest and highest with seven goals 

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:56.509
 fernando de you 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:00.860
 I liked you so much 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.320
 these video some simple houses that 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.870
 any doubt you have on the site 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.740
 only access if by the people tv 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.740
 I hope the request
