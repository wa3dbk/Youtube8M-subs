 sea ​​of ​​silver- 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.129
 there are many many places we go 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.230
 showing some the cars talk to 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.649
 the boys too 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:55.460
 I cross on camera should not do but 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:57.409
 for as always Maria Velez but what 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.329

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:02.379
 the key for when friends come 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:05.210
 because we know that this car too 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.759
 Well, I'm going to show you how to see 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.450
 see here I'm pe cable but I think not 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:15.640
 has use this car directly 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:19.170
 even with the angel this detail is not 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.729
 the impeccable user manual 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.810
 as it came to that moment we are going to 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.140
 ask the boys what model of 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:30.819
 this car but do not notice you this 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:41.229
 this original healthy have nothing 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:42.939
 absolutely studied how we were 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.970
 asking and this one particularly that 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:49.119
 we are seeing what model is a gtx 2.2 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:53.470
 model 88 88 this other was manufactured up 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:55.119
 the year 1995 now these 92 92 this the 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.450
 last year of 7 x 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:03.520
 the following year the 7th appears as 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:06.610
 89 grams as if from 82 that 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.259
 start the Argentine production in 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.660
 Saint Elizabeth 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.780
 start the gtx 2 liters 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:17.740
 in the year for the 86 range it changes to the 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:22.960
 gtx phase 2 that changed the gtx tires 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:25.690
 2.2 in 87 thousand 988 we pay 89 90 with the 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.540
 people who is purple blue 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.489
 what we have there 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.060
 now that I would ask what can be 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.950
 raise calories as the mind 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.540
 but this one look at the truth that gives us a 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.640
 joy maria belen jammedia all the 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.010
 because we are going to make this a 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.610
 classic with classic cars how much 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.610
 was worth the fire kingdom in its time to see 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.930
 how much cheap and $ 28,000 and it arrived 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:53.060
 to be worth 32 thousand and of these the most 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.519
 different series and there were always let's say 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.400
 a single model like that was taken out two 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:01.610
 versions at some time for the year 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:05.930
 in progress was a single model was capped 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.489
 range and from the year 87 began to 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.140
 bring some option to what the 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.640
 leather upholstery first floor 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.120
 leather series and then went from being 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.400
 optional I'm going to ask the question 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.349
 evil what was better the one that came from 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.840
 the two-liter the first the French 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.489
 which I think is this or the gta that came 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.580
 after that was the last true version 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.200
 good you chose the latest version in 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.900
 reality was the gta max that was a 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.239
 evolution of both the gta and the gta 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.690
 max are they were designed nothing more than 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.480
 for the Argentine market 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.430
 already had a greater evolution in the 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.010
 chassis had the back gauge more 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.640
 wide and share the engine with this one that 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.380
 gtx 2.2 and people to maxia brings another 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.260
 camshaft a little more compression 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.300
 and a few more cases the issue is like this 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.580
 this I put the sea if after 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.990
 Maria Belen well and you drive them so 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.990
 with me I go companion 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.710
 if you want to see who is going to 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.750
 lend the car maria belen after 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.640
 they arrange with her but to me who gives me 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.910
 the keys to make see love one the 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.910
 of yours 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.919
 let's share a little bit we're going to 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.620
 ask the people of the club the 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.880
 fire yes yes indeed in argentina had 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.079
 more impact than any other part 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.320
 of the world because in France it was not a 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:28.470
 important truth so important model 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.110
 in the first years that they still had 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.129
 The coupe of this size that is 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.139
 they call industrial coupe 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:39.080
 then a later and then 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:41.479
 let's hear this 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:45.150
 look at noriega to see 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:46.490
 April the engine shows it to the engine and 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.890
 then put it back watching with programs 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.180
 Go ahead 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.600
 at this point I think he's a pilot 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.600
 frustrated 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:04.680
 I believe that it is little sasha and in sunchales 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.190
 has wanted to have dreamed of being a knick and 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.190
 the doubt 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.570
 He did very well in his profession but 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:15.710
 I think that in your forums we intuited that you wanted 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.710
 being racer 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:27.930
 a boy with a new toy 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:31.830
 because apart from the whistle car that 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:35.990
 has this motor barbarian suffered not 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:38.520
 you suffer a little, I can not accelerate 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.380
 I do not put quiet first but Maria 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.340
 belen the race grab one is so 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.340
 hide when it comes 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.230
 [Music] 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:57.010
 well we are in our sauce this is 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:06:00.370
 very good what was gained with this 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:02.950
 skinny to the owner of the reindeer beni's 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.260
 the fire keeps saved by the size no 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:08.200
 you offer it for doubt because seven 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.720
 boys if this boy gets angry 7 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.040
 many of us who are complicated 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.650
 good with contours like this one a man 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:18.220
 first radio fabio big the truth 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:20.260
 with this you gained enough either me 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.790
 I retired done in another time I know that 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.220
 is watching that shows a look at the 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:26.650
 time I could win with this still 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.600
 not handled well so it will be clear and 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.880
 today how much is a car in the market 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:33.040
 well in these conditions in condition 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.730
 classic like this one that is a car with 62 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.950
 thousand real miles that I a classic 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:42.040
 has no pressure but when it is published 

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:44.890
 a car of this more or less than the 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:47.639
 price is a thing value is another and this 

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:49.499
 this sells that sells more 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:52.289
 the taste that the person has to come to 

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:55.159
 buy them at the value of the price of the place 

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:55.159
 about these vehicles 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:03.330
