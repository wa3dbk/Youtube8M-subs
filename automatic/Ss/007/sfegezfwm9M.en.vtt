first impressions lost and unfortunately
for<00:00:10.380> Rena<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:11.219> first<00:00:11.460> impression<00:00:11.880> that<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:12.030> lot

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
for Rena the first impression that a lot

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.580 
for Rena the first impression that a lot
of<00:00:12.269> South<00:00:12.420> Africans<00:00:12.809> had<00:00:12.960> with<00:00:13.110> their<00:00:13.259> product

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
of South Africans had with their product

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.129 
of South Africans had with their product
was<00:00:13.710> for<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.280> few<00:00:14.610> reasons<00:00:14.759> not<00:00:15.570> that<00:00:15.839> good

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
was for a few reasons not that good

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.260 
was for a few reasons not that good
which<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:16.980> perhaps<00:00:17.130> why<00:00:17.340> they<00:00:17.609> now<00:00:17.730> make<00:00:17.940> cars

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
which is perhaps why they now make cars

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.510 
which is perhaps why they now make cars
with<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.480> 5<00:00:18.750> year<00:00:18.779> 100,000<00:00:19.680> kilometers<00:00:20.160> service

with a 5 year 100,000 kilometers service
plan<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:20.939> perhaps<00:00:21.570> why<00:00:21.869> they<00:00:22.020> now<00:00:22.170> make<00:00:22.380> cars

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740

like this this is the new macadam and we
drove<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.840> 1.9<00:00:28.410> liter<00:00:28.710> diesel<00:00:28.920> version

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.220 
car I imagine the coupe a which is much
prettier<00:03:44.580> be<00:03:45.450> that<00:03:45.570> as<00:03:45.690> it<00:03:45.720> may<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.050> hatchback

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
prettier be that as it may the hatchback

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.870 
prettier be that as it may the hatchback
is<00:03:46.530> still<00:03:46.709> a<00:03:46.739> decent<00:03:47.190> looking<00:03:47.340> French<00:03:47.670> thing

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880
