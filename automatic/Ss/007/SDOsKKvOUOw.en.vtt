00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:40.550
 lessons of good manners and I'm shocked 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:50.009
 hello dear friends today we are with 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.130
 you learn the culture of telephone 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.159
 communication it turned out that not all and yet 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:03.119
 own unfortunately sneak 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:05.399
 what is she like pebbles and so so let's 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.220
 continue in our time there are phones 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.229
 almost all have mobile or home or 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.350
 he and the other so it is very important to be able 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.620
 right on the phone so 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.840
 This and Zhora when communicating with each 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.340
 friend you may not abide by all 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.709
 rules but the older you are 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.230
 become the more often you have to 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.300
 communicate with adults often strangers 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.440
 people and here the main thing as the Japanese say 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.810
 not to lose face is how it means not 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.739
 disgrace not lose respect with 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.079
 side of other people i don't want zory not 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:45.209
 want then remembers all the rest 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:48.180
 by the way, too, so where do we start well 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.799
 I think that you all know how we start with 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.340
 what we say alla 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:57.269
 or yes well if they called you if 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.190
 We called something after hearing this very Alla 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.329
 first thing we will say hello and 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.530
 introduce ourselves 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:08.579
 for example like this cooking well 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:12.209
 Jora but this is only on mobile so 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:15.750
 it is possible and if at home it is unknown 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:18.900
 who picked up the phone is logical in this case 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:23.239
 the words will be so hello 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.239
 can i talk to varya 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.370
 and this is just not polite first 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.439
 need to say hello and secondly yours 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.269
 girlfriend probably learns from your 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:39.189
 parents by the voice in this case is not 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.620
 nice to pretend you don't know with 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:44.040
 who do you talk to? 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.040
 name and patronymic 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:50.379
 please try further 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:52.870
 it should be calm 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:57.250
 voice and feel free to talk 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.260
 smile on the phone you can't see it 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.810
 it seems but by intonation it 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.760
 felt if you picked up the phone 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.359
 and ask for the phone for example mom 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.060
 answer so please wait now 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:11.980
 I'll call her 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:17.039
 then go and call her 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:20.889
 and do not shout across the apartment and you 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:23.349
 because there is someone who can not call 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.820
 phone come but ask 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:26.740
 call back through some definite 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.789
 time but don't talk 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.380
 caller and daddy is sleeping or mom is in the bathroom 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:36.630
 to little children also by no means 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.630
 we should not say that no one is at home 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.530
 Of course, we should not forget that 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.780
 You can not call at any time 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.930
 it's better not to do it before nine o'clock 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.820
 am and no later than ten in the evening and if that 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:56.139
 who do you call always dinners from an hour to 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:59.020
 two call another time why am I 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:01.509
 they don't always have a call 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.729
 urgent then do not forget to apologize for 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:05.889
 the fact that you tear a person away from food 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.930
 anything else and in any case not 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.720
 hurt to ask whether it is convenient 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:14.860
 Now speak to whom you are calling 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:18.880
 Well, if this is the same as the type 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:21.490
 uncomfortable now Jora you're just walking 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.820
 encyclopedia of word parasites 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:28.449
 Well, what kind of parasites yet yes these 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:31.630
 all yours is the very same type and what is there like 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:33.099
 would this be the word parasites know 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.500
 how they make speech makes her 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:37.960
 ugly so better avoid 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:41.569
 similar words even in conversation with 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.599
 friends and by the way not only by phone 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:47.300
 in me itâ€™s called parasites 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:49.729
 that the place is occupied and the meaning does not carry 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:53.659
 no girls still love to talk 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:54.429
 the word is so well we are so worth it 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:57.679
 are coming 

00:05:54.429 --> 00:05:59.990
 Putin's well approaching the end 

00:05:57.679 --> 00:06:02.599
 conversations of course we must not forget 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:06.619
 say goodbye and the rule here is 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:08.869
 the first one is forgiven who called and when 

00:06:06.619 --> 00:06:13.009
 he chats and chats 

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:17.990
 I once well then should apologize 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:19.939
 politely give him a hint of it and i'm hinting 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:36.949
 to you that my lesson is over today 

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:41.349
 goodbye what problems oh that is not 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:44.959

00:06:41.349 --> 00:06:48.169

00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:51.649

 for no no no not forget I promise that 

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:59.139
 I will never do it again, and I will atone for my own 

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:59.139
 great guilt
