00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.610 
doing it for a Titan this method works
pretty<00:00:34.200> much<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.559> same<00:00:34.710> for<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.950> warlock<00:00:36.620> the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
pretty much the same for a warlock the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.090 
pretty much the same for a warlock the
only<00:00:37.860> difference<00:00:38.190> between<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.730> three<00:00:40.100> things

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
only difference between the three things

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.299 
only difference between the three things
is<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.540> boots<00:00:42.780> that's<00:00:43.140> what<00:00:43.440> matters<00:00:43.860> in

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
is that the boots that's what matters in

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.250 
is that the boots that's what matters in
this<00:00:45.180> particular<00:00:46.219> method<00:00:47.219> no<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:48.120> say<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.079> the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
this particular method no I say that the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.930 
this particular method no I say that the
same<00:00:49.530> method<00:00:49.920> works<00:00:50.100> with<00:00:50.280> warlock<00:00:50.610> cuz<00:00:50.820> they

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
same method works with warlock cuz they

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.910 
same method works with warlock cuz they
sign<00:00:51.719> in<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.960> warlock<00:00:52.260> have<00:00:52.410> pretty<00:00:52.710> much<00:00:52.770> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
sign in the warlock have pretty much the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.849 
sign in the warlock have pretty much the
same<00:00:53.219> boost

codecs that matters
don't<00:01:59.590> have<00:01:59.709> this<00:01:59.950> one<00:02:00.190> and<00:02:00.399> that<00:02:00.759> one<00:02:01.149> make

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
don't have this one and that one make

sure you have up the increased height

00:02:03.129 --> 00:02:07.919 
sure you have up the increased height
lift<00:02:04.080> because<00:02:05.080> you<00:02:05.649> will<00:02:06.420> need<00:02:07.420> to<00:02:07.569> get<00:02:07.720> to

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
lift because you will need to get to

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.800 
lift because you will need to get to
maximum<00:02:08.500> height<00:02:08.649> now<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:10.270> may<00:02:10.539> take<00:02:10.780> a

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
maximum height now this may take a

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.680 
maximum height now this may take a
couple<00:02:10.899> tries<00:02:11.379> for<00:02:11.680> me

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690

weapon that has +2 agility like that

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.850 
weapon that has +2 agility like that
extra<00:02:22.400> perk<00:02:22.790> I<00:02:23.120> don't<00:02:23.810> actually<00:02:24.140> think<00:02:24.410> I<00:02:24.830> have

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
extra perk I don't actually think I have

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.630 
extra perk I don't actually think I have
one<00:02:25.460> that<00:02:25.670> has<00:02:25.850> that<00:02:26.210> at<00:02:26.840> least<00:02:27.170> upgraded<00:02:27.830> so

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
one that has that at least upgraded so

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
it i'm very surprising me on my first

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.790 
it i'm very surprising me on my first
shot<00:03:21.489> now<00:03:22.270> at<00:03:22.900> this<00:03:23.170> point<00:03:23.410> you<00:03:23.530> should<00:03:23.560> have

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
shot now at this point you should have

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.610 
shot now at this point you should have
your<00:03:24.040> super<00:03:24.540> what<00:03:25.540> up<00:03:25.660> what<00:03:25.959> what<00:03:26.319> else<00:03:26.470> you

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
your super what up what what else you

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.449 
your super what up what what else you
can<00:03:26.800> do<00:03:26.950> is<00:03:27.190> if<00:03:27.580> you<00:03:27.790> don't<00:03:28.140> you<00:03:29.140> can<00:03:29.459> shoot

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
can do is if you don't you can shoot

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.520 
can do is if you don't you can shoot
them<00:03:30.670> from<00:03:30.910> here<00:03:31.269> but<00:03:31.900> it's<00:03:32.019> just<00:03:32.080> gonna<00:03:32.290> take

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
them from here but it's just gonna take

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.440 
them from here but it's just gonna take
longer<00:03:32.560> because<00:03:33.280> now<00:03:33.550> my<00:03:33.790> weight<00:03:33.970> of<00:03:34.090> darkness

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
longer because now my weight of darkness

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.009 
longer because now my weight of darkness
is<00:03:34.600> at<00:03:34.720> 10<00:03:34.930> and<00:03:35.260> now<00:03:36.040> i<00:03:36.069> can<00:03:36.340> only<00:03:36.489> walk<00:03:36.760> so<00:03:37.180> once

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
is at 10 and now i can only walk so once

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.660 
is at 10 and now i can only walk so once
you're<00:03:38.170> actually<00:03:38.890> another<00:03:39.130> way<00:03:39.310> of<00:03:39.430> doing

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
you're actually another way of doing

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.090 
you're actually another way of doing
that<00:03:39.790> is<00:03:40.030> if<00:03:40.780> you're<00:03:40.989> not<00:03:41.230> if<00:03:41.560> you're<00:03:41.830> seeing

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
that is if you're not if you're seeing

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.000 
that is if you're not if you're seeing
that<00:03:42.190> you're<00:03:42.340> not<00:03:42.549> making<00:03:43.000> it<00:03:43.470> you<00:03:44.470> can<00:03:44.620> switch

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
that you're not making it you can switch

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.600 
that you're not making it you can switch
over<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.970> striker<00:03:46.930> class<00:03:47.260> and<00:03:47.560> use<00:03:48.400> your

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
over to the striker class and use your

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.400 
over to the striker class and use your
super<00:03:49.000> as<00:03:49.209> you<00:03:49.420> do<00:03:49.569> that<00:03:49.780> make<00:03:49.959> sure<00:03:49.989> you<00:03:50.200> don't

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
super as you do that make sure you don't

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.140 
super as you do that make sure you don't
have<00:03:50.530> depth<00:03:50.830> from<00:03:51.010> above<00:03:51.340> or<00:03:51.580> anything<00:03:51.910> like

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
have depth from above or anything like

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.890 
have depth from above or anything like
that

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
that

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.960 
that
make<00:03:53.350> sure<00:03:53.470> this<00:03:53.560> is<00:03:53.739> normal<00:03:53.950> so<00:03:54.340> you'll<00:03:54.549> jump

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
make sure this is normal so you'll jump

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.840 
make sure this is normal so you'll jump
up<00:03:55.180> you'll<00:03:55.780> get<00:03:55.959> that<00:03:56.110> increased<00:03:56.560> lift<00:03:57.280> just<00:03:57.700> a

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
up you'll get that increased lift just a

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.059 
up you'll get that increased lift just a
bit<00:03:58.030> more<00:03:58.180> at<00:03:58.330> the<00:03:58.480> ending<00:03:58.750> i<00:03:58.900> tried<00:03:59.620> that<00:03:59.769> once

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
bit more at the ending i tried that once

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:01.920 
bit more at the ending i tried that once
it<00:04:00.280> didn't<00:04:00.580> really<00:04:00.850> work<00:04:01.030> I<00:04:01.180> guess<00:04:01.360> bad<00:04:01.600> timing

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
it didn't really work I guess bad timing

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.860 
it didn't really work I guess bad timing
on<00:04:02.110> my<00:04:02.319> part<00:04:02.790> but<00:04:03.790> this<00:04:04.060> is<00:04:04.329> the<00:04:04.450> methodology

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
on my part but this is the methodology

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.009 
on my part but this is the methodology
so<00:04:05.470> once<00:04:05.709> you<00:04:05.859> get<00:04:06.269> up<00:04:07.269> here<00:04:07.540> you<00:04:07.660> want<00:04:07.810> to<00:04:07.870> walk

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
so once you get up here you want to walk

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.190 
so once you get up here you want to walk
all<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:08.320> way<00:04:08.500> to<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:08.799> edge<00:04:08.920> and<00:04:09.750> you<00:04:10.750> want<00:04:10.930> and

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
all the way to the edge and you want and

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.470 
all the way to the edge and you want and
here's<00:04:11.799> the<00:04:11.950> length<00:04:12.160> now<00:04:12.670> there<00:04:12.880> is<00:04:13.060> a<00:04:13.090> night

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
here's the length now there is a night

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.449 
here's the length now there is a night
at<00:04:13.660> this<00:04:13.810> lamp<00:04:14.019> and<00:04:14.230> if<00:04:14.470> this<00:04:14.650> is<00:04:14.829> on<00:04:14.980> normal<00:04:15.340> or

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
at this lamp and if this is on normal or

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.430 
at this lamp and if this is on normal or
on<00:04:15.700> the<00:04:15.790> hard<00:04:15.970> it<00:04:16.060> doesn't<00:04:16.450> matter<00:04:16.570> you<00:04:17.109> can

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
on the hard it doesn't matter you can

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.009 
on the hard it doesn't matter you can
kill<00:04:17.890> the<00:04:18.669> night<00:04:19.239> if<00:04:19.510> you<00:04:19.539> want<00:04:19.660> now

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
kill the night if you want now

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.230 
kill the night if you want now
personally<00:04:20.350> I<00:04:20.799> don't<00:04:21.130> like<00:04:21.340> to<00:04:21.489> risk<00:04:21.820> it<00:04:22.060> I

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
personally I don't like to risk it I

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.730 
personally I don't like to risk it I
just<00:04:22.300> like<00:04:22.600> to<00:04:22.750> crouch<00:04:23.020> behind<00:04:23.050> this<00:04:23.500> rock

right around over here and starts to

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.729 
right around over here and starts to
shoot<00:06:40.509> at<00:06:40.659> you<00:06:40.779> you<00:06:40.869> want<00:06:41.019> to<00:06:41.110> pop<00:06:41.349> your<00:06:41.589> bubble

00:06:49.769 --> 00:06:49.779 
I know that that has additional ward of

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:52.369 
I know that that has additional ward of
dawn<00:06:49.839> length<00:06:50.349> so<00:06:51.099> it'll<00:06:51.610> give<00:06:51.789> you<00:06:51.879> extra<00:06:52.209> time

00:06:52.369 --> 00:06:52.379 
dawn length so it'll give you extra time

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:58.079 
dawn length so it'll give you extra time
this<00:06:53.379> should<00:06:53.679> last<00:06:54.009> a<00:06:56.639> fair<00:06:57.639> amount<00:06:57.729> of<00:06:57.909> time

00:06:58.079 --> 00:06:58.089 
this should last a fair amount of time

00:06:58.089 --> 00:07:01.619 
this should last a fair amount of time
like<00:06:58.299> it<00:06:58.419> should<00:06:58.629> last<00:06:58.919> until<00:06:59.919> the<00:06:59.979> end<00:07:00.629> once

00:07:01.619 --> 00:07:01.629 
like it should last until the end once

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:03.419 
like it should last until the end once
the<00:07:01.749> pot<00:07:01.989> once<00:07:02.319> it<00:07:02.469> says<00:07:02.649> the<00:07:02.829> path<00:07:03.039> forward<00:07:03.369> is

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:03.429 
the pot once it says the path forward is
