there's<00:02:26.710> quite<00:02:26.890> a<00:02:26.920> few<00:02:26.980> ideas<00:02:27.280> that<00:02:27.640> were<00:02:28.480> from

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
there's quite a few ideas that were from

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.340 
there's quite a few ideas that were from
long<00:02:29.710> periods<00:02:30.160> ago<00:02:30.310> you<00:02:30.610> know<00:02:30.730> that<00:02:30.910> became

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
long periods ago you know that became

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.070 
long periods ago you know that became
with<00:02:32.350> that<00:02:32.500> we<00:02:32.590> updated<00:02:32.980> if<00:02:33.250> you<00:02:33.370> like<00:02:33.550> but<00:02:33.820> I

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
with that we updated if you like but I

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.210 
with that we updated if you like but I
think<00:02:35.080> with<00:02:35.260> big<00:02:35.410> music<00:02:35.740> that<00:02:35.890> was<00:02:35.950> probably

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
think with big music that was probably

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.020 
think with big music that was probably
the<00:02:36.430> oldest<00:02:36.850> one<00:02:37.000> then<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:38.410> music<00:02:39.030> probably

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
the oldest one then the music probably

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.350 
the oldest one then the music probably
kept<00:02:40.980> escaping<00:02:41.980> us<00:02:42.340> Charlie<00:02:42.880> brought<00:02:43.180> the

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
kept escaping us Charlie brought the

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.840 
kept escaping us Charlie brought the
music<00:02:43.800> most<00:02:44.800> of<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.010> music<00:02:45.220> about<00:02:45.460> 10<00:02:45.670> years

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
music most of the music about 10 years

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.170 
music most of the music about 10 years
ago<00:02:46.290> couldn't<00:02:47.290> quite<00:02:47.410> get<00:02:47.620> it<00:02:47.910> kept<00:02:48.910> going<00:02:49.060> on

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
ago couldn't quite get it kept going on

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:59.590 
ago couldn't quite get it kept going on
the<00:02:49.270> backbone<00:02:49.720> when<00:02:50.350> we

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.720
