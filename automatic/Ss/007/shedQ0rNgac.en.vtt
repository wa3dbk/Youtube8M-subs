00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:11.370
 indicated this reign with music swing the 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.770
 music can dance in many ways 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.770
 one of them the indian is a dance that 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.180
 he adhered two of the twenties and he 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.619
 develops until mid- year 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.169
 forty when it is already transforming 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.320
 a little more in google rock and roll and 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.960
 such 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.240
 and that arises then in a time of the 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.949
 years 20 that 's when the 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.290
 crisis that then combines with the 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.930
 crisis of 29 as a way of escape 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.670
 of real life then basically a 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.160
 dance to have a great time very 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.760
 fun not much energy and in madrid 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.870
 it's true that it has emerged in the past 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.870
 four years is when there has been the boom 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.930
 We are teaching in the oven once 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.480
 per week completely 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.690
 amateur and suddenly we are having 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.739
 more students if summer happens with marten 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:06.130
 javi and I decided 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.229
 assembled today we have three levels the 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.700
 classes in the pool the dance is not a 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.470
 dance that does not stay only in the classroom 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.270
 you can dance swing in Madrid today 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.990
 in practically every day of the 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.570
 week in different walls in centers 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.580
 cultural dance halls etc and that 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.680
 It is very good because you can practice 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.689
 because you learn in class besides 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.689
 sociability with others as conscious 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.829
 parties 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.400
 Y 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.010
 but at the end of each exercise you go 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.010
 changing partners 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.729
 like other activities that you think that a 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.729
 the long you end up looking for 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:15.100
 it's fun and we're going to have a 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.570
 song wherever 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.739
 as soon as we have opportunity with 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.739
 anything light 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.880
 it would allow the music since it takes then 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.750
 to dance with people that the boy 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.050
 carries 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:39.380
 it's all very fun and very easy that's not 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.540
 have enough purchases 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:47.230
 and enjoy as to move in the 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.230
 song and be able to have a good time 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.840
 all better is amazing that is when 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.240
 you start the professional and the 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.240
 fame 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.240
 4 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.830
 it's true that you tend to do a lot 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.830
 Energy 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.090
 and also 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.900
 of couples 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.420
 the aesthetics of that era as of late 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.860
 from 20 to mid 40 women 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:34.709
 very feminine with pretty clothes collected 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.319
 almost always or hairs the waves these 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.030
 rita hayworth's reviews 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.739
 in very simple makeups 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.359
 precisely because the time of crisis 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.969
 there was no money for very 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:46.400
 sober but very elegant because to me 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:49.010
 especially like when performing bear 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.719
 everyone dresses to dance but 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.840
 depending on the party you go to 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:56.239
 Madrid yes there are some who 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.370
 will arrange the uruguay tribal in madrid 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.109
 there has been one swing this year other than 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.880
 blues the swing a few years ago that has 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:04.340
 resurged and 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.470
 and it's in full blast you want to 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.690
 fun to learn to dance 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.070
 meet people and what you do have 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.380
 to be careful because it hooks a 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.450
 heap is a video is a very site 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.250
 strong but good is what we say 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.250
 provided that at least it is a healthy drug
