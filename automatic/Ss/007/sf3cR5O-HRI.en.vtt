 samoa is made under license pepsico 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:48.680
 after the very sorry in kriens 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.220
 sabine has the axis perspective 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:03:00.350
 the extracts of the customer experience 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:32.629
 this will be portfolio said jenny 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:04:36.960
 newsmax de beers paysafe's constancy 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:39.030
 displaysearch trained to tokyo 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.270
 You could tell his lips are tasty 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.270
 even so 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.670
 the normally frostier at 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.630
 room temperature is now cooled this time 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:52.260
 make no difference so the 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.360
 difference is just that one at the beginning 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.130
 I consider advertise again perk 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.320
 must and in the end you can taste it as well 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.820
 It's actually a little trick 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.250
 actually just reduces the taste 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.590
 you are always clean but turn 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.530
 Yes, we said the English part 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.660
 Look how do you like the close up 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.670
 POV trick with the tripod 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.450
 here 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:15.360
 I think I still have time to me so 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:21.750
 now part between scratchy here 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:23.490
 separate things and in any case there 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:27.120
 Tastes lipton but in all cases 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:30.780
 I think the rocker is three calories 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:34.650
 can almost not go well I 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:37.050
 Every day so I find all and 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.980
 sweetened soft drinks daily 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:44.310
 with water i get clear mineral water 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:46.500
 I drink myself but I get the 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:49.470
 I do not understand why I do not 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.900
 you have a nice taste you 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:56.040
 then ruined by those stupid ones 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:57.000
 sweeteners i believe the people are the ones 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.070
 drink 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.470
 they got used to it, I think 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:03.920
 especially women in front of the main 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:08.820
 Target group is women's sweetener 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:12.030
 Drinking so I think so 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:14.310
 karl lagerfeld has just that 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.670
 one was now a man but then he has 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:21.300
 also said the day kick 2 liter coca 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:23.059
 cola light and probably someday 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:26.939
 engage 

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:32.519
 how do you see that and yes I have too 

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:34.679
 stevia what do I want we yes me 

00:06:32.519 --> 00:06:36.749
 would have to times with battle sweetener 

00:06:34.679 --> 00:06:40.169
 make stevia against sugar that I do 

00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:41.819
 are times and then we'll see exactly 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:42.899
 yes against sugar between then go 

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:45.569
 we have to have such an animal again 

00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:48.899
 tablets sucrose tablets and then 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:51.659
 can tell you what is best exactly 

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:53.069
 so that was the result then yes is one 

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:55.919
 smarter if the product itself 

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:58.199
 tasted then says it tastes good 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:59.459
 I really like him so this one 

00:06:58.199 --> 00:07:04.889
 typical taste 

00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:06.389
 he already has something but I have eight o'clock 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:08.029
 I have not given a fee now 

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:10.169
 because somehow I have to 

00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:12.059
 accept that there are in the market and 

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:12.659
 that is quasi people are the the 

00:07:12.059 --> 00:07:14.819
 do to 

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:16.589
 and if you really do not have any 

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:19.489
 then wants to have sugar product 

00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:25.169
 you get a little bit more here 

00:07:19.489 --> 00:07:28.069
 Taste and yes I was full 

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:28.069
 thought that he agreed
