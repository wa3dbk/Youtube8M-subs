built after World War Two and of course

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.400 
built after World War Two and of course
we<00:00:42.590> had<00:00:42.710> the<00:00:42.829> baby<00:00:43.040> boom<00:00:43.399> and<00:00:43.870> on<00:00:44.870> the<00:00:44.989> heels<00:00:45.200> of

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
we had the baby boom and on the heels of

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.680 
we had the baby boom and on the heels of
that<00:00:45.469> we<00:00:45.770> had<00:00:45.980> the<00:00:46.129> building<00:00:46.460> boom<00:00:46.700> the<00:00:47.390> price

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
that we had the building boom the price

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.020 
that we had the building boom the price
price<00:00:48.680> became<00:00:49.160> the<00:00:49.489> big<00:00:50.480> focus<00:00:50.899> point<00:00:51.170> and

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
price became the big focus point and

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.029 
price became the big focus point and
coming<00:00:53.030> out<00:00:53.149> of<00:00:53.180> the<00:00:53.329> war<00:00:53.539> we<00:00:53.780> had<00:00:54.020> oil<00:00:54.410> being<00:00:54.860> a

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
coming out of the war we had oil being a

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:56.650 
coming out of the war we had oil being a
big<00:00:55.219> issue<00:00:55.430> and<00:00:55.789> they<00:00:55.879> were<00:00:55.940> looking<00:00:56.149> for<00:00:56.510> ways

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
big issue and they were looking for ways

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.400 
big issue and they were looking for ways
to<00:00:56.950> use<00:00:57.950> oil<00:00:58.250> else<00:00:59.030> asphalt<00:00:59.629> shingles<00:00:59.690> became

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
to use oil else asphalt shingles became

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.549 
to use oil else asphalt shingles became
a<00:01:00.440> big<00:01:00.739> part<00:01:01.070> of<00:01:01.190> that<00:01:01.989> longevity<00:01:02.989> is

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
a big part of that longevity is

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.769 
a big part of that longevity is
definitely<00:01:04.129> one<00:01:04.309> of<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:04.639> the<00:01:05.029> big<00:01:05.239> factors

00:01:05.769 --> 00:01:05.779 
definitely one of the the big factors

00:01:05.779 --> 00:01:08.050 
definitely one of the the big factors
when<00:01:06.289> we're<00:01:06.469> talking<00:01:06.619> about<00:01:06.920> steel<00:01:07.549> roofing

or any of the metal roofings outside of
that<00:01:11.359> residential<00:01:12.020> market<00:01:12.639> we<00:01:13.639> think<00:01:13.909> of

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
that residential market we think of

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.219 
that residential market we think of
commercial<00:01:15.079> buildings<00:01:15.759> whether<00:01:16.759> it<00:01:17.029> be<00:01:17.229> barns

00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:21.889 
or sheds or buildings that industry

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:24.550 
or sheds or buildings that industry
would<00:01:22.039> use<00:01:22.450> rarely<00:01:23.450> do<00:01:23.749> we<00:01:23.779> see<00:01:23.899> shingles<00:01:24.439> on

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
would use rarely do we see shingles on

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.769 
would use rarely do we see shingles on
those<00:01:24.709> buildings<00:01:25.130> so<00:01:25.849> metal<00:01:26.209> roofing<00:01:26.569> has

00:01:26.769 --> 00:01:26.779 
those buildings so metal roofing has

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:29.679 
those buildings so metal roofing has
been<00:01:27.200> typically<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:28.009> default<00:01:28.429> for<00:01:28.609> that<00:01:28.729> it's

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
the attics so what I hear you saying is

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.670 
the attics so what I hear you saying is
that<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.760> metal<00:03:18.000> roofings<00:03:18.480> made<00:03:18.959> typically

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
that the metal roofings made typically

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.140 
that the metal roofings made typically
with<00:03:19.890> with<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.220> percentage<00:03:20.520> of<00:03:20.760> recycled

with with a percentage of recycled
material<00:03:21.540> this<00:03:22.320> longevity<00:03:22.739> issue<00:03:23.220> involved

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
material this longevity issue involved

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.699 
material this longevity issue involved
here<00:03:24.000> so<00:03:24.209> that<00:03:24.450> that<00:03:24.840> metal<00:03:25.200> roof<00:03:25.380> that<00:03:25.560> gets

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
here so that that metal roof that gets

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.740 
here so that that metal roof that gets
put<00:03:25.890> on<00:03:26.040> its<00:03:26.220> not<00:03:26.400> being<00:03:26.580> replaced<00:03:26.940> every<00:03:27.420> 10

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
put on its not being replaced every 10

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.740 
put on its not being replaced every 10
years<00:03:28.140> or<00:03:28.470> so<00:03:28.530> like<00:03:29.340> like<00:03:29.970> an<00:03:30.120> asphalt<00:03:30.420> roof

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
years or so like like an asphalt roof

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.720 
years or so like like an asphalt roof
might<00:03:31.050> be<00:03:31.200> but<00:03:31.800> if<00:03:31.950> it<00:03:32.070> does<00:03:32.250> need<00:03:32.459> to<00:03:32.520> be

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
might be but if it does need to be

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.790 
might be but if it does need to be
redone<00:03:33.270> it<00:03:33.660> could<00:03:33.870> be<00:03:33.959> recycled<00:03:34.380> itself<00:03:34.650> I

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
redone it could be recycled itself I

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.890 
redone it could be recycled itself I
guess<00:03:34.950> it<00:03:35.340> could<00:03:35.520> be<00:03:35.670> yeah<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:36.239> in<00:03:36.480> fact<00:03:36.720> we

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
guess it could be yeah and in fact we

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.470 
guess it could be yeah and in fact we
have

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.700

eat off the roof right and then you talk

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.410 
eat off the roof right and then you talk
about<00:04:08.700> an<00:04:09.330> air<00:04:09.480> pocket<00:04:10.310> between<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.550> metal

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
about an air pocket between the metal

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.410 
about an air pocket between the metal
and<00:04:12.660> the<00:04:12.780> roof<00:04:12.990> itself<00:04:13.820> earlier<00:04:14.820> on<00:04:14.910> we<00:04:15.270> were

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
and the roof itself earlier on we were

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.610 
and the roof itself earlier on we were
talking<00:04:15.720> about<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:15.989> longevity<00:04:16.169> of<00:04:16.530> the

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
talking about the longevity of the

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.729 
talking about the longevity of the
product<00:04:17.010> and<00:04:17.220> you<00:04:17.940> mentioned<00:04:18.329> how<00:04:18.739> post-war

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
product and you mentioned how post-war

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.470 
product and you mentioned how post-war
they<00:04:20.400> were<00:04:20.489> looking<00:04:20.609> for<00:04:20.760> products<00:04:21.239> that<00:04:21.299> were

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
they were looking for products that were

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.080 
they were looking for products that were
cheaper<00:04:21.810> and<00:04:21.930> so<00:04:22.079> far<00:04:22.410> so<00:04:22.740> by<00:04:23.190> implication<00:04:23.730> I

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
cheaper and so far so by implication I

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.940 
cheaper and so far so by implication I
assume<00:04:24.390> that<00:04:24.630> metal<00:04:25.080> roofing<00:04:25.410> tends<00:04:25.710> to<00:04:25.860> be

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
assume that metal roofing tends to be

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.840 
assume that metal roofing tends to be
more<00:04:26.070> expensive<00:04:26.870> yes<00:04:27.870> it<00:04:28.050> is<00:04:28.400> steel<00:04:29.400> is<00:04:29.640> more

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
more expensive yes it is steel is more

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.750 
more expensive yes it is steel is more
expensive<00:04:30.060> than<00:04:30.830> many<00:04:31.830> other<00:04:32.010> things<00:04:32.340> when
