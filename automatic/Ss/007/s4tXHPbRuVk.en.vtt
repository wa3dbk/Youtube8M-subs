00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
right it's not rocket science really it

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:03.839 
right it's not rocket science really it
just<00:03:54.500> needs<00:03:54.920> someone<00:03:55.250> to<00:03:57.040> show<00:03:58.040> you

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
actually performs a little bit better if

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:08.530
