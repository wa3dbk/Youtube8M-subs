00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.210
 m 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.369
 pollock dripping is a technique 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.080
 which is to run from the 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:17.540
 painting on a blank canvas or 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.580
 previously prepared for that we have 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.800
 used rather liquid paints 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:26.649
 we to realize this work we have 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:29.689
 used an acrylic paint that we are going 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:33.680
 more or less diluted with them bnd ex 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:37.489
 is a water addition so I prepare my 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.140
 always strong with the ama cube and we're going 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:46.730
 let it dry about half a 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:48.699
 time I take the populo the same because 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.219
 that we often mislead the brush 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:53.989
 it's more convenient to budget then the 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.359
 buttes tired of the apn thing that is 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.609
 even more said he had tested my 

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:00.350
 red paint to know is enough 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:01.760
 liquid and heaven suits me I 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.620
 I realize that it is not really flowing 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.170
 so I'm going to make it more liquid 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.170
 when i add a few ex bndes 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:20.380
 little bit of water mixing and joro tests 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:20.380
 on my canvas 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.020
 according to and I attack 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.310
 so here we are going to spend a third 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.619
 color I made a white mix and 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.820
 black to get gray I make my 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:02:03.619
 still more liquid painting and the 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.619
 bnd ex a little water 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:33.840
 the white to emphasize is very black in 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.840
 the 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.970
 good as long as we are not satisfied with 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.840
 result that multiplied the operations there 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.670
 I want to come back with blue after I 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.660
 can come back with red over 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.790
 and so on 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:56.050
 we will let it dry and 24 hours 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.880
 touch flat on flat roof our the 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.470
 vertical chart to avoid 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.000
 runs that in 24 hours is not 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.430
 satisfied we can return to it 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.430
 continues barely to infinity
