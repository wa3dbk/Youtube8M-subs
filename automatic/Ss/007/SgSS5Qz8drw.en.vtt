00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.290
 most consumers consider 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:09.650
 what is the range 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.169
 alarms indicated on the box 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:13.849
 this is the distance they can 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:15.129
 guaranteed to receive a signal 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:16.609
 anxiety 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.070
 then they reason at this distance 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.119
 can be safely removed from the car 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.359
 Further consumer argues so 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.239
 why do I need a range of 3 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:27.220
 kilometers 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.210
 I still did not have time to reach the car 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.830
 faster than end and if i 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.629
 I'll get to Europe on a key chain at a distance 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:36.220
 let's say at 1200 meters for fifteen minutes 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.820
 years offense to machine successes 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.910
 we forget that the communication range 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:41.680
 specified characteristics 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.050
 The alarm is measured in 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.820
 ideal field conditions 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.660
 so what actually happens in 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.790
 this range in the city 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.500
 urban conditions with large 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.770
 the amount of building signal can 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.400
 delivered in dozens and even hundreds 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.510
 time 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.940
 so with poor quality 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.640
 radio channels in the city this signal nape 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.260
 just will not come 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.110
 radio propagation is possible 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.380
 compare with the light and for you because they 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.520
 have the same nature 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.830
 that's how the media alarm shines 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.800
 long range building area 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.660
 medium density in many places keychain 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.700
 the alarm systems just don't see the light 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.760
 on the windows 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.360
 however in the same place 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.720
 alarms total fight 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.770
 radio channels 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.220
 will see a picture of the spread 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.890
 light differently 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.940
 more with a source of light he echoes him 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.530
 another alarm is the same but this one 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.950
 trick more sensitive 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:35.930
 of view 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.000
 so absolutely dark areas in 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 this month has been significantly less 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.990
 in densely built areas all 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.800
 more critical 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.960
 medium range key fob 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.960
 became virtually blind 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.189
 doubles decree increased range 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.360
 fast those of course better 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.390
 the opening of dark places has become more 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.200
 yes definitely a figure with a range 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.330
 short last choice argument 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.310
 systems 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.509
 they took guarantee 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.509
 message delivery 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.459
 familiar to the pain situation left 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.939
 car and went to the supermarket 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.459
 what does research say here 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.090
 intricate metallic internal 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.530
 partitions of similar structures up to 90 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.920
 percent blocks admission course systems 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.529
 usual radio channel 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:29.359
 extended range key fob 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:31.139
 such conditions is able to catch 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:33.089
 Russia find worthy of our laughter 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:34.229
 car 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:35.269
 but also observed here 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.269
 absolutely 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.389
 so is it still possible to be sure that 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:44.179
 alarm messages limit 

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:45.609
 You can see 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:47.599
 range of alarm 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:48.399
 in the town 

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:50.039
 more dependent on the very 

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:52.409
 the city than reflected channel alarms 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.779
 than long-range radio channel 

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:56.969
 the greater the chances of steady work in 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:58.639
 difficult conditions which city 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.849
 meet at every turn 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:02.249
 but guarantee a certain 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:04.399
 the range of the alarm in the city 

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:05.579
 which means guarantee 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.699
 delivering an alarm message is simple 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:08.979
 is impossible 

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:10.719
 availability of control function system 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:13.089
 the channel guarantees confidence that you are not 

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:15.559
 skip the alarm message 

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:17.749
 so choosing a system is imperative 

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:19.279
 take an interest in functions 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:21.209
 automatic control of the communication channel
