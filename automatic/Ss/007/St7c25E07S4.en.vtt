00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:03.399
 6 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.459
 hello today i'm going to talk to you about the votes she's crying a lot 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:10.730
 or not in a club next to English 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.199
 that's what to do 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:15.639
 so not crying does that mean what's so good 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.230
 outside in addition to the balls twice so we did not 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.119
 a small fold time that plugs directly 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.349
 on the diack output of the guitar 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:32.429
 the likes plague comes in three different flavor we have this one that 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.470
 not give lessons close to the voc sa c30 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.980
 this one 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.190
 who he is rather typical rock so classic rock 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.090
 and 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.020
 for the big bad guys 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.820
 a keiper job 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.840
 that they all work the same way they all need 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.100
 two batteries 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.800
 for energy 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.570
 and it has all three 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.990
 a good 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.489
 a tone 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.280
 that can be set here 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.280
 the connection is simple a headphone output 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.670
 sword an entry line to plug in your mp3 or your cd player and 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.190
 to play 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.110
 normally I should have plugged the headset on the job from May to this 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.290
 that moment you would not have heard anything we did what 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.810
 we took the headphone output and we only sent to a table of 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.930
 mixing so you can enjoy it 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.700
 so here we have the employer 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.370
 at 7 30 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.370
 we will see what it gives 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.070
 I play on the tone 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.160
 establish a peace of volume too 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.819
 good 

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:37.499
 we then go to classic rock, which, as its name indicates, covers it 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:42.029
 range of his role as classic rock to the borders of the d-8 

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:45.029
 hard rock 

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:29.049
 we end with the example the metal 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.010
 for which we preferred to take a guitar equipped with 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.519
 the museum what seemed more coherent 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.519
 nothing 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.469
 when you could see that job it's really the perfect companion for 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:12.979
 go on a trip to play in his garden 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:13.870
 we could 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.009
 without disturbing his neighbors whatever the musical style 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:21.150
 we do not like we will find warm on his feet and then saw the price that it 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.080
 cost you can even afford the 3 finally good me I leave you any 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.620
 way I found what I like 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.740
 then notice to all
