results are that women find men more
sexy<00:00:08.580> in<00:00:08.610> red<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:09.510> we<00:00:10.019> showed<00:00:10.530> women<00:00:11.340> pictures

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
sexy in red and we showed women pictures

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.509 
sexy in red and we showed women pictures
of<00:00:12.240> men<00:00:12.719> in<00:00:12.929> various<00:00:13.290> colors<00:00:13.679> red<00:00:14.070> blue<00:00:14.490> green

gray white and we found that women

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.540 
gray white and we found that women
viewed<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.600> men<00:00:19.050> in<00:00:19.260> red<00:00:19.500> as<00:00:19.949> particularly

viewed the men in red as particularly

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.410 
viewed the men in red as particularly
attractive<00:00:21.119> they<00:00:22.340> also<00:00:23.340> rated<00:00:23.609> them<00:00:23.910> as<00:00:24.150> more

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
attractive they also rated them as more

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.330 
attractive they also rated them as more
sexually<00:00:24.840> desirable<00:00:25.170> why<00:00:25.740> might<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.039> be<00:00:26.220> the

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
sexually desirable why might that be the

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.609 
sexually desirable why might that be the
case<00:00:26.670> we<00:00:26.910> also<00:00:27.090> found<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.539> women<00:00:28.080> viewed<00:00:28.349> men

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
case we also found that women viewed men

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.189 
case we also found that women viewed men
in<00:00:28.800> red<00:00:29.039> as<00:00:29.369> higher<00:00:29.670> in<00:00:29.939> status<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.869> more

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
in red as higher in status so more

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.040 
in red as higher in status so more
likely<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.590> make<00:00:31.769> money<00:00:32.390> more<00:00:33.390> likely<00:00:33.809> to

likely to make money more likely to

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.799

high<00:00:37.649> status<00:00:38.309> judgement<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:38.910> leads<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
high status judgement that leads to the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.830 
high status judgement that leads to the
attraction<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.320> overall<00:00:40.950> women<00:00:41.940> who<00:00:42.329> view<00:00:42.600> men

the basic explanation here is likely to
fold<00:00:55.989> one<00:00:56.320> is<00:00:56.710> very<00:00:57.399> straightforward<00:00:57.760> learned

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
fold one is very straightforward learned

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.090 
fold one is very straightforward learned
association<00:00:59.199> the<00:00:59.320> other<00:00:59.469> is<00:00:59.680> a<00:00:59.710> more

association the other is a more

the<00:01:03.100> learned<00:01:03.339> association<00:01:03.969> idea<00:01:04.210> is<00:01:04.330> that<00:01:04.479> I

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
the learned association idea is that I

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:06.749 
the learned association idea is that I
think<00:01:04.900> in<00:01:05.049> our<00:01:05.229> culture<00:01:05.530> we<00:01:05.830> tend<00:01:05.860> to<00:01:06.220> view<00:01:06.400> red

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:06.759 
think in our culture we tend to view red

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:09.510 
think in our culture we tend to view red
as<00:01:07.030> a<00:01:07.060> powerful<00:01:07.509> or<00:01:07.840> a<00:01:07.869> strong<00:01:08.290> color<00:01:08.649> and<00:01:09.009> so

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
as a powerful or a strong color and so

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.670 
as a powerful or a strong color and so
it's<00:01:10.080> straightforward<00:01:11.080> to<00:01:11.200> see<00:01:11.409> women

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
it's straightforward to see women

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.310 
it's straightforward to see women
viewing<00:01:12.280> men<00:01:12.490> in<00:01:12.700> red<00:01:12.940> as<00:01:13.270> more<00:01:13.780> powerful

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
viewing men in red as more powerful

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.469 
viewing men in red as more powerful
high-end<00:01:14.890> status<00:01:15.369> and<00:01:15.610> then<00:01:15.700> that<00:01:15.880> to<00:01:16.119> lead<00:01:16.300> to

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
high-end status and then that to lead to

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.330 
high-end status and then that to lead to
them<00:01:16.630> liking<00:01:17.530> them<00:01:17.860> and<00:01:18.040> being<00:01:18.159> more

attracted<00:01:18.940> to<00:01:19.030> them<00:01:19.210> the<00:01:19.899> more<00:01:20.050> provocative

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
attracted to them the more provocative

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.410 
attracted to them the more provocative
explanation<00:01:20.830> is<00:01:21.430> the<00:01:21.580> biologically<00:01:22.240> based

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
explanation is the biologically based

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.480 
explanation is the biologically based
explanation<00:01:23.170> that<00:01:23.380> there's<00:01:24.100> a<00:01:24.160> parallel

human females who view a man in red are

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.850 
human females who view a man in red are
more<00:01:49.300> likely<00:01:49.539> to<00:01:49.690> be<00:01:49.899> a<00:01:49.929> track<00:01:50.229> to<00:01:50.409> do<00:01:50.530> and<00:01:50.679> want

more likely to be a track to do and want

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.600

aren't<00:01:54.850> aware<00:01:54.970> of<00:01:55.149> this<00:01:55.420> it's<00:01:55.630> a<00:01:55.720> very

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
aren't aware of this it's a very

underlying deeply ingrained kind of

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.229 
underlying deeply ingrained kind of
tendency<00:01:58.989> so<00:01:59.349> we<00:01:59.619> say<00:02:00.399> in<00:02:00.580> our<00:02:00.670> culture<00:02:01.179> that

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:01.239 
tendency so we say in our culture that

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:03.749 
tendency so we say in our culture that
men<00:02:01.690> act<00:02:02.140> like<00:02:02.349> animals<00:02:02.619> in<00:02:03.009> the<00:02:03.130> sexual<00:02:03.459> realm

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
men act like animals in the sexual realm

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.219 
men act like animals in the sexual realm
well<00:02:03.940> it<00:02:04.060> looks<00:02:04.239> like<00:02:04.300> women<00:02:04.780> maybe<00:02:04.959> are

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
well it looks like women maybe are

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.350 
well it looks like women maybe are
acting<00:02:05.590> like<00:02:05.709> animals<00:02:06.009> as<00:02:06.429> well<00:02:06.670> in<00:02:06.910> that<00:02:06.940> same

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
acting like animals as well in that same

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.250 
acting like animals as well in that same
sort<00:02:07.660> of<00:02:07.750> way

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.830 

I<00:02:11.409> really<00:02:12.189> don't<00:02:12.310> think<00:02:12.610> we<00:02:12.760> have<00:02:13.000> a<00:02:13.030> cultural

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
I really don't think we have a cultural

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.860 
I really don't think we have a cultural
sense<00:02:14.260> that<00:02:14.650> red<00:02:15.340> is<00:02:15.519> an<00:02:15.640> aphrodisiac<00:02:15.970> for<00:02:16.659> men

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
sense that red is an aphrodisiac for men

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.649 
sense that red is an aphrodisiac for men
we<00:02:17.140> do<00:02:17.379> have<00:02:17.620> that<00:02:17.769> sense<00:02:18.129> for<00:02:18.400> women<00:02:18.730> so<00:02:19.060> the

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:19.659 
we do have that sense for women so the

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.319 
we do have that sense for women so the
lady<00:02:19.900> in<00:02:20.079> red<00:02:20.110> is<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.950> sexy<00:02:21.459> lady<00:02:21.730> right<00:02:22.209> we

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
lady in red is the sexy lady right we

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.300 
lady in red is the sexy lady right we
don't<00:02:22.450> have<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.780> analog<00:02:23.349> in<00:02:23.680> men<00:02:23.890> we<00:02:24.099> don't

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
don't have the analog in men we don't

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.830 
don't have the analog in men we don't
have<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.640> gentleman<00:02:25.120> in<00:02:25.239> red<00:02:25.480> being

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
have the gentleman in red being

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.559 
have the gentleman in red being
provocative<00:02:26.650> or<00:02:26.769> sexy<00:02:27.250> so<00:02:27.970> I<00:02:28.000> don't<00:02:28.329> think

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
provocative or sexy so I don't think

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.350 
provocative or sexy so I don't think
it's<00:02:28.810> something<00:02:29.019> that<00:02:29.409> our<00:02:29.440> culture<00:02:30.220> is<00:02:30.489> aware

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
it's something that our culture is aware

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.750 
it's something that our culture is aware
of<00:02:31.390> we<00:02:32.079> do<00:02:32.290> however<00:02:32.530> have<00:02:32.799> a<00:02:32.980> sense<00:02:33.340> that<00:02:33.549> red

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
of we do however have a sense that red

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.119 
of we do however have a sense that red
is<00:02:33.909> a<00:02:33.940> powerful<00:02:34.510> color<00:02:34.780> so<00:02:35.260> I<00:02:35.290> think<00:02:35.500> that<00:02:35.860> men

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 
is a powerful color so I think that men

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:39.089 
is a powerful color so I think that men
know<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:36.489> grab<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.239> red<00:02:37.900> tie<00:02:38.349> if<00:02:38.680> they<00:02:38.799> want<00:02:39.040> to

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:39.099 
know to grab the red tie if they want to

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.229 
know to grab the red tie if they want to
give<00:02:39.220> a<00:02:39.250> particularly<00:02:39.700> impactful

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
give a particularly impactful

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.940 
give a particularly impactful
presentation<00:02:40.989> at<00:02:41.140> work<00:02:41.379> or<00:02:41.680> what-have-you

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
presentation at work or what-have-you

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.759 
presentation at work or what-have-you
and<00:02:42.459> this<00:02:43.060> this<00:02:43.450> brings<00:02:43.750> up<00:02:43.870> Tiger<00:02:44.290> Woods<00:02:44.530> so

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
and this this brings up Tiger Woods so

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.339 
and this this brings up Tiger Woods so
Tiger<00:02:45.190> Woods<00:02:45.459> wears<00:02:45.970> red<00:02:46.329> on<00:02:46.569> Sunday<00:02:47.079> when<00:02:47.290> he

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
Tiger Woods wears red on Sunday when he

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.520 
Tiger Woods wears red on Sunday when he
wants<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.680> intimidate<00:02:48.159> his<00:02:48.280> opponents<00:02:49.530> he's

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
wants to intimidate his opponents he's

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.410 
wants to intimidate his opponents he's
done<00:02:50.769> this<00:02:50.920> for<00:02:51.190> years<00:02:51.579> it's<00:02:51.849> actually<00:02:52.030> known

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
done this for years it's actually known

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.720 
done this for years it's actually known
as<00:02:52.450> Tiger<00:02:53.109> red<00:02:53.379> so<00:02:53.739> he's<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.010> very<00:02:54.129> good<00:02:54.489> golfer

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
as Tiger red so he's a very good golfer

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.069 
as Tiger red so he's a very good golfer
and<00:02:55.030> he<00:02:55.090> probably<00:02:55.359> doesn't<00:02:55.750> need<00:02:55.930> to

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
and he probably doesn't need to

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:57.930 
and he probably doesn't need to
intimidate<00:02:56.560> his<00:02:56.650> opponents<00:02:57.190> but<00:02:57.730> when<00:02:57.849> he

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
intimidate his opponents but when he

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.000 
intimidate his opponents but when he
gets<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.209> Sunday<00:02:58.720> he<00:02:58.959> typically<00:02:59.409> wears<00:02:59.650> red

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
gets to Sunday he typically wears red

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.330 
gets to Sunday he typically wears red
and<00:03:00.340> that<00:03:01.209> presumably<00:03:02.109> is<00:03:02.470> having<00:03:02.980> an<00:03:03.069> effect

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
and that presumably is having an effect

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.979 
and that presumably is having an effect
on<00:03:03.670> his<00:03:03.970> opponents<00:03:04.510> it<00:03:04.629> makes<00:03:04.810> them

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
on his opponents it makes them

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.580 
on his opponents it makes them
intimidated<00:03:05.560> play<00:03:05.829> worse<00:03:06.099> etc<00:03:06.790> it<00:03:07.750> also<00:03:08.019> based
