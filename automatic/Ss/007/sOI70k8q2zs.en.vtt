one and then do a propeller so I don't
have<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.080> make<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.500> drydock<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.040> little<00:01:17.280> bit

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369

from underneath so you'll be able to get
into<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.220> when<00:01:26.400> it's<00:01:26.580> out<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.880> drydock<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.600> I

you<00:02:10.680> would<00:02:10.830> probably<00:02:11.130> have<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.310> sealed<00:02:11.550> off

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
you would probably have it sealed off

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.790 
you would probably have it sealed off
like<00:02:12.570> a<00:02:12.600> real<00:02:12.810> inch<00:02:12.960> rim<00:02:13.110> so<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.290> can't<00:02:13.470> see<00:02:13.680> in

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
like a real inch rim so you can't see in

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.520 
like a real inch rim so you can't see in
it<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.070> everything<00:02:14.280> works<00:02:14.660> but<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:15.930> wanted<00:02:16.470> to

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
it so everything works but I wanted to

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.420 
it so everything works but I wanted to
show<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.650> guys<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.160> motor<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:18.390> my<00:02:19.190> my<00:02:20.190> goal

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
show you guys the motor and my my goal

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.940 
show you guys the motor and my my goal
was<00:02:20.580> to<00:02:20.610> make<00:02:20.820> it<00:02:20.910> as<00:02:20.970> compact<00:02:21.360> as<00:02:21.540> possible<00:02:21.950> I

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
was to make it as compact as possible I

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.070 
was to make it as compact as possible I
could<00:02:23.550> have<00:02:23.640> made<00:02:23.820> like<00:02:24.060> some<00:02:24.570> cylinders<00:02:24.840> on

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
could have made like some cylinders on

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.510 
could have made like some cylinders on
this<00:02:25.230> side<00:02:25.440> and<00:02:25.650> some<00:02:25.830> cylinders<00:02:26.100> on<00:02:26.340> this

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
this side and some cylinders on this

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.000 
this side and some cylinders on this
side<00:02:26.730> but<00:02:27.660> that<00:02:28.200> would<00:02:28.350> just<00:02:28.500> make<00:02:28.620> it<00:02:28.830> bigger

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
side but that would just make it bigger

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.370 
side but that would just make it bigger
it<00:02:29.730> would<00:02:29.850> make<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.120> sub<00:02:30.360> bigger<00:02:30.570> because<00:02:31.020> of

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
it would make the sub bigger because of

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.050 
it would make the sub bigger because of
the<00:02:31.500> way<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.680> circuitry<00:02:32.190> is<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.670> piston

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
the way the circuitry is and the piston

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.600 
the way the circuitry is and the piston
so<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.690> just<00:02:34.350> tried<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.560> I<00:02:34.980> just<00:02:35.280> had<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.490> make

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
so I just tried to I just had to make

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.000 
so I just tried to I just had to make
one<00:02:35.880> in<00:02:36.180> line<00:02:36.390> now<00:02:37.110> once<00:02:37.410> it's<00:02:37.560> in<00:02:37.680> line<00:02:37.860> you

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
one in line now once it's in line you

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.740 
one in line now once it's in line you
could<00:02:38.130> go<00:02:38.250> as<00:02:38.640> far<00:02:38.880> as<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.120> want<00:02:39.330> so<00:02:39.600> I<00:02:39.630> think

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
could go as far as you want so I think

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.790 
could go as far as you want so I think
it's<00:02:40.050> three<00:02:40.890> or<00:02:40.920> four<00:02:42.290> column<00:02:43.290> cylinders<00:02:43.680> I

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
it's three or four column cylinders I

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.920 
it's three or four column cylinders I
guess<00:02:44.090> alright<00:02:45.090> so<00:02:45.360> I'm<00:02:45.540> going<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.720> turn<00:02:45.840> on

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
guess alright so I'm going to turn on

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
guess alright so I'm going to turn on
first<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:46.380> I'll<00:02:46.500> show<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.620> guys<00:02:46.680> how's<00:02:46.890> it

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
first and I'll show you guys how's it

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:47.590 
first and I'll show you guys how's it
works

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
works

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.360 
works
so<00:02:48.600> here<00:02:48.840> we<00:02:48.900> got<00:02:49.020> a<00:02:49.050> power<00:02:49.470> on<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:49.890> off<00:02:49.980> and

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
so here we got a power on and off and

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.860 
so here we got a power on and off and
start<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.090> stop<00:02:51.270> so<00:02:51.480> let's<00:02:51.600> go<00:02:51.690> ahead<00:02:51.750> and

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
start and stop so let's go ahead and

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.440 
start and stop so let's go ahead and
turn<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.560> power<00:02:52.680> on<00:02:52.830> and<00:02:53.280> let's<00:02:53.970> go<00:02:54.120> ahead<00:02:54.209> and

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
turn the power on and let's go ahead and

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.740 
turn the power on and let's go ahead and
give<00:02:54.600> it<00:02:54.630> a<00:02:54.750> start

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
give it a start

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.680 
give it a start
alright<00:02:57.750> so<00:02:58.020> that's<00:02:58.170> I<00:02:58.850> guess<00:02:59.850> that's<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.450> guys

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
alright so that's I guess that's it guys

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.210 
alright so that's I guess that's it guys
I<00:03:01.050> don't<00:03:01.260> I<00:03:01.440> don't<00:03:01.590> know<00:03:01.680> if<00:03:01.770> you<00:03:01.830> thought<00:03:02.010> this

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
I don't I don't know if you thought this

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.290 
I don't I don't know if you thought this
stuff<00:03:02.340> was<00:03:02.430> gonna<00:03:02.580> start<00:03:02.820> moving<00:03:03.000> or

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
stuff was gonna start moving or

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.040 
stuff was gonna start moving or
something<00:03:03.450> but<00:03:04.130> that's<00:03:05.130> just<00:03:05.370> basically<00:03:05.760> it

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
something but that's just basically it

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.600 
something but that's just basically it
alright<00:03:07.050> so<00:03:07.080> let's<00:03:07.380> go<00:03:07.500> ahead<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.709> stop<00:03:08.459> this

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
alright so let's go ahead and stop this

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.949 
alright so let's go ahead and stop this
bad<00:03:08.790> boy

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.410 

and<00:03:11.959> there<00:03:12.440> it<00:03:12.560> is<00:03:12.700> now<00:03:13.700> I'm<00:03:14.300> not<00:03:14.510> using<00:03:14.540> any

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
and there it is now I'm not using any

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.670 
and there it is now I'm not using any
like<00:03:17.420> torch<00:03:17.720> glitches<00:03:18.140> or<00:03:18.170> anything<00:03:18.440> like

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
like torch glitches or anything like

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.900 
like torch glitches or anything like
that<00:03:18.709> I<00:03:19.099> don't<00:03:19.130> want<00:03:19.400> to<00:03:19.430> use<00:03:19.550> any<00:03:19.670> of<00:03:19.790> that

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
that I don't want to use any of that

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.250 
that I don't want to use any of that
stuff

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
stuff

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.589 
stuff
I'm<00:03:21.620> sure<00:03:21.920> there's<00:03:22.099> simpler<00:03:23.090> ways<00:03:23.239> to<00:03:23.450> do<00:03:23.569> it

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 
I'm sure there's simpler ways to do it

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.740 
I'm sure there's simpler ways to do it
but<00:03:23.930> well<00:03:24.890> to<00:03:25.520> get<00:03:25.670> this<00:03:25.849> thing<00:03:26.270> to<00:03:26.420> work<00:03:26.569> the

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
but well to get this thing to work the

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.620 
but well to get this thing to work the
way<00:03:26.870> it<00:03:26.989> will<00:03:27.110> is<00:03:28.030> let<00:03:29.030> me<00:03:29.120> show<00:03:29.330> you<00:03:29.390> guys

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
way it will is let me show you guys

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.530 
way it will is let me show you guys
let's<00:03:30.319> just<00:03:30.830> go<00:03:30.890> ahead<00:03:30.950> and<00:03:31.099> get<00:03:31.190> up<00:03:31.280> in<00:03:31.370> there

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
let's just go ahead and get up in there

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.479 
let's just go ahead and get up in there
all<00:03:33.470> right<00:03:33.590> so<00:03:33.769> basically<00:03:34.040> what<00:03:34.220> we<00:03:34.310> have<00:03:34.459> is

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
all right so basically what we have is

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.990 
all right so basically what we have is
we<00:03:34.790> have<00:03:34.819> ourselves<00:03:35.090> a<00:03:35.540> a<00:03:36.370> little<00:03:37.370> track<00:03:37.700> here

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
we have ourselves a a little track here

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.300 
we have ourselves a a little track here
power<00:03:38.989> it<00:03:39.170> on<00:03:39.230> both<00:03:39.410> sides<00:03:39.650> with<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.099> power

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
power it on both sides with the power

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.090 
power it on both sides with the power
switch<00:03:40.640> and<00:03:40.940> a<00:03:41.720> piston<00:03:42.140> some<00:03:42.560> redstone<00:03:42.739> on

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
switch and a piston some redstone on

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.140 
switch and a piston some redstone on
both<00:03:43.250> sides<00:03:43.519> and<00:03:45.730> you<00:03:46.730> know<00:03:46.790> what<00:03:46.910> let<00:03:47.060> me

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
both sides and you know what let me

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.199 
both sides and you know what let me
clear<00:03:47.390> all<00:03:47.420> this<00:03:47.600> out<00:03:47.810> and<00:03:48.880> you<00:03:49.880> guys<00:03:50.030> can

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
clear all this out and you guys can

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:59.020 
clear all this out and you guys can
really<00:03:50.330> see<00:03:50.510> how<00:03:50.660> everything<00:03:50.989> works<00:03:58.030> all

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
really see how everything works all

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.600 
really see how everything works all
right<00:03:59.180> man<00:04:00.080> I<00:04:00.110> love<00:04:00.500> creative<00:04:00.950> with<00:04:01.280> breaking

stuff all right so so basically your
power<00:04:05.269> on<00:04:05.769> gives<00:04:06.769> power<00:04:07.069> to<00:04:07.250> you<00:04:07.549> the<00:04:07.730> two

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
power on gives power to you the two

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:16.940 
power on gives power to you the two
tracks<00:04:08.150> and<00:04:09.340> then<00:04:11.200> start<00:04:12.790> piston<00:04:13.790> pushes

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:23.460 

and<00:04:17.950> then<00:04:18.070> the<00:04:18.160> other<00:04:22.230> all<00:04:23.230> right<00:04:23.260> so

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
and then the other all right so

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.050 
and then the other all right so
basically<00:04:23.560> what<00:04:23.830> happens<00:04:24.100> is<00:04:24.220> the<00:04:24.760> start

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
basically what happens is the start

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.330 
basically what happens is the start
button<00:04:26.550> triggers<00:04:27.550> the<00:04:27.640> piston<00:04:28.030> which<00:04:28.240> pushes

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
button triggers the piston which pushes

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.400 
button triggers the piston which pushes
this<00:04:30.340> thing<00:04:30.670> which<00:04:31.420> goes<00:04:31.630> up<00:04:31.780> and<00:04:31.960> down<00:04:31.990> and

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
this thing which goes up and down and

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.810 
this thing which goes up and down and
just<00:04:32.680> gravity<00:04:33.040> itself<00:04:33.280> is<00:04:33.430> gonna<00:04:33.550> make<00:04:33.700> it

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
just gravity itself is gonna make it

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.780 
just gravity itself is gonna make it
fall<00:04:34.180> back<00:04:34.330> down<00:04:34.600> with<00:04:35.560> the<00:04:35.860> power<00:04:36.400> tracks

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
fall back down with the power tracks

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.120 
fall back down with the power tracks
will<00:04:37.750> keep<00:04:37.990> it<00:04:38.110> going<00:04:38.140> back<00:04:38.440> and<00:04:38.590> forth<00:04:38.830> and

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
will keep it going back and forth and

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.700 
will keep it going back and forth and
then<00:04:40.620> what<00:04:41.620> keeps<00:04:41.950> it<00:04:42.130> from<00:04:42.190> stopping<00:04:43.120> is<00:04:43.710> the

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
then what keeps it from stopping is the

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.470 
then what keeps it from stopping is the
piston<00:04:45.100> being<00:04:45.310> in<00:04:45.520> the<00:04:45.610> on<00:04:45.730> position<00:04:45.760> so<00:04:46.360> when

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
piston being in the on position so when

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.720 
piston being in the on position so when
the<00:04:46.540> piston<00:04:46.870> is<00:04:46.900> in<00:04:47.020> the<00:04:47.110> on<00:04:47.260> position<00:04:47.730> the

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
the piston is in the on position the

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.820 
the piston is in the on position the
minecart<00:04:49.360> is<00:04:49.600> forced<00:04:50.050> to<00:04:50.110> go<00:04:50.200> back<00:04:50.410> down<00:04:50.620> and

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
minecart is forced to go back down and

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.270 
minecart is forced to go back down and
hit<00:04:50.980> the<00:04:51.100> track<00:04:51.340> so<00:04:51.910> when<00:04:52.180> you<00:04:52.770> put<00:04:53.770> the<00:04:53.890> piston

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
hit the track so when you put the piston

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.940 
hit the track so when you put the piston
in<00:04:54.400> the<00:04:54.430> off<00:04:54.580> position<00:04:54.760> that<00:04:55.380> the<00:04:56.380> minecart

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
in the off position that the minecart

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.770 
in the off position that the minecart
goes<00:04:57.220> up<00:04:57.430> and<00:04:57.670> it's<00:04:58.210> not<00:04:58.300> gonna<00:04:58.450> fall<00:04:58.660> back

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
goes up and it's not gonna fall back

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.910 
goes up and it's not gonna fall back
down<00:04:58.960> which<00:04:59.200> means<00:04:59.380> not<00:04:59.530> going<00:04:59.620> to<00:04:59.740> hit<00:04:59.890> the

00:04:59.910 --> 00:04:59.920 
down which means not going to hit the

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.390 
down which means not going to hit the
track<00:05:00.450> blah<00:05:01.450> blah<00:05:01.750> blah<00:05:01.990> so<00:05:02.530> one<00:05:02.740> more<00:05:02.860> time

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
track blah blah blah so one more time

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:16.070 
track blah blah blah so one more time
powers<00:05:03.970> on

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.320 

and<00:05:17.080> there<00:05:17.500> you<00:05:17.590> go<00:05:17.710> alright<00:05:18.550> so<00:05:18.699> let<00:05:18.819> me<00:05:18.909> let's

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
and there you go alright so let me let's

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.790 
and there you go alright so let me let's
let's<00:05:19.840> walk<00:05:19.960> over<00:05:20.169> here<00:05:20.259> you<00:05:20.349> guys<00:05:20.409> can<00:05:20.590> take<00:05:20.740> a

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
let's walk over here you guys can take a

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.129 
let's walk over here you guys can take a
look<00:05:20.979> at<00:05:21.159> the<00:05:21.819> circuitry<00:05:22.330> and<00:05:22.599> probably<00:05:23.020> get

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
look at the circuitry and probably get

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:33.809 
look at the circuitry and probably get
an<00:05:23.229> idea<00:05:23.500> of<00:05:23.560> how<00:05:23.800> everything<00:05:23.889> works<00:05:32.669> and<00:05:33.669> I

00:05:33.809 --> 00:05:33.819 
an idea of how everything works and I

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:35.040 
an idea of how everything works and I
think<00:05:34.030> about<00:05:34.150> I'm<00:05:34.300> you<00:05:34.389> know<00:05:34.509> why<00:05:34.659> put<00:05:34.960> the

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
think about I'm you know why put the

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:41.600 
think about I'm you know why put the
glass<00:05:35.229> up<00:05:35.469> I<00:05:35.650> just<00:05:35.860> probably<00:05:36.069> bored<00:05:39.900> alright

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
glass up I just probably bored alright

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.619 
glass up I just probably bored alright
now<00:05:42.610> these<00:05:42.759> right<00:05:42.939> here<00:05:43.090> don't<00:05:43.210> serve<00:05:43.479> our

00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:43.629 
now these right here don't serve our

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:46.679 
now these right here don't serve our
purpose<00:05:43.960> this<00:05:44.080> is<00:05:44.139> just<00:05:45.180> where<00:05:46.180> I'm<00:05:46.270> gonna<00:05:46.389> put

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:46.689 
purpose this is just where I'm gonna put

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:48.839 
purpose this is just where I'm gonna put
the<00:05:46.919> propeller<00:05:47.919> on<00:05:48.069> the<00:05:48.189> outside<00:05:48.520> so<00:05:48.729> it's

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:48.849 
the propeller on the outside so it's

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:54.540 
the propeller on the outside so it's
just<00:05:48.909> kind<00:05:49.210> of<00:05:49.330> a<00:05:52.139> way<00:05:53.139> to<00:05:53.169> measure<00:05:53.550> where

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
just kind of a way to measure where

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.379 
just kind of a way to measure where
everything<00:05:54.759> is<00:05:54.819> gonna<00:05:54.939> go<00:05:55.620> alright<00:05:56.620> so<00:05:57.270> like<00:05:58.270> I

00:05:58.379 --> 00:05:58.389 
everything is gonna go alright so like I

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:00.860 
everything is gonna go alright so like I
said<00:05:58.449> this<00:05:58.750> power<00:05:58.990> is<00:05:59.349> just<00:05:59.620> here<00:05:59.830> to<00:05:59.949> power

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
said this power is just here to power

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:08.550 
said this power is just here to power
this<00:06:02.009> this<00:06:03.360> and<00:06:04.360> that's<00:06:04.539> it<00:06:04.830> and<00:06:07.259> you<00:06:08.259> come<00:06:08.439> in

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
this this and that's it and you come in

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.230 
this this and that's it and you come in
here<00:06:09.180> you<00:06:10.180> have<00:06:10.300> your<00:06:10.599> red<00:06:10.900> torches<00:06:11.969> so<00:06:12.969> that

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
here you have your red torches so that

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.580 
here you have your red torches so that
everything<00:06:13.629> is<00:06:13.750> in<00:06:13.900> the<00:06:13.990> on<00:06:14.110> position<00:06:16.590> alright

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
everything is in the on position alright

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.499 
everything is in the on position alright
so<00:06:17.979> yeah<00:06:18.250> we<00:06:18.370> got<00:06:18.490> four<00:06:20.610> and<00:06:21.610> then<00:06:22.029> I<00:06:22.360> don't

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:22.509 
so yeah we got four and then I don't

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:23.610 
so yeah we got four and then I don't
think<00:06:22.539> I<00:06:22.659> can<00:06:22.719> get<00:06:22.870> in<00:06:22.990> there<00:06:23.110> can<00:06:23.289> I<00:06:23.379> get<00:06:23.440> in

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
think I can get in there can I get in

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.390 
think I can get in there can I get in
there<00:06:23.650> no<00:06:23.949> alright<00:06:25.740> and<00:06:26.740> then<00:06:26.889> let<00:06:27.159> me<00:06:27.250> show

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:27.400 
there no alright and then let me show

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.369 
there no alright and then let me show
you<00:06:27.490> what<00:06:27.610> happens<00:06:27.909> when<00:06:28.089> we<00:06:28.949> turn<00:06:29.949> it<00:06:30.069> on

00:06:31.369 --> 00:06:31.379 
you what happens when we turn it on

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:34.920 
you what happens when we turn it on
powers<00:06:32.379> off<00:06:32.879> sees<00:06:33.879> everything<00:06:34.240> start<00:06:34.779> your

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:34.930 
powers off sees everything start your

00:06:34.930 --> 00:07:15.899 
powers off sees everything start your
strong<00:06:35.169> are<00:06:35.469> on<00:06:35.680> start<00:06:36.400> again

00:07:15.899 --> 00:07:15.909 

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:21.300 

all<00:07:16.909> right<00:07:17.060> there<00:07:17.210> you<00:07:17.330> go<00:07:17.599> so<00:07:19.629> I'm<00:07:20.629> wondering

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:21.310 
all right there you go so I'm wondering

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.379 
all right there you go so I'm wondering
like<00:07:22.310> I<00:07:22.460> haven't<00:07:22.580> really<00:07:22.669> played<00:07:22.999> with<00:07:23.180> the

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:23.389 
like I haven't really played with the

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:25.899 
like I haven't really played with the
timing<00:07:23.840> so<00:07:24.439> I'm<00:07:24.560> sure<00:07:24.800> if<00:07:25.129> I<00:07:25.279> play<00:07:25.550> with<00:07:25.669> daily

00:07:25.899 --> 00:07:25.909 
timing so I'm sure if I play with daily

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:27.459 
timing so I'm sure if I play with daily
maybe<00:07:26.090> I'll<00:07:26.240> just<00:07:26.479> get<00:07:26.599> up<00:07:26.779> two<00:07:27.169> up<00:07:27.319> two<00:07:27.439> down

00:07:27.459 --> 00:07:27.469 
maybe I'll just get up two up two down

00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:29.790
