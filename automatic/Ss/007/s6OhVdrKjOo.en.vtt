 Hello everyone, I am Nicolas from the SimFonIA team. 

00:00:02.717 --> 00:00:04.943
 Welcome to this video, we will be in this video 

00:00:04.944 --> 00:00:07.754
 Introducing Google SketchUp 

00:00:07.755 --> 00:00:11.100
 SimFonIA Animation Maker (SAT) installation process. 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.511
 First we will introduce how to install 

00:00:13.512 --> 00:00:16.183
 Google SketchUp 3D drawing modeling software. 

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:19.677
 Then we will show how to install our SAT plugin. 

00:00:19.677 --> 00:00:23.072
 Finally we will tell you how to set 

00:00:23.073 --> 00:00:25.498
 Temporary folder in the SAT. 

00:00:25.498 --> 00:00:29.365
 First you need to download and install the Google SketchUp software. 

00:00:29.365 --> 00:00:32.307
 You only need to go to the Google.com URL. 

00:00:35.415 --> 00:00:38.172
 Then enter SketchUp in the search bar. 

00:00:38.172 --> 00:00:40.775
 Click on the first link that appears in Google SketchUp. 

00:00:44.371 --> 00:00:48.365
 This way you are on the official website of Google SketchUp. 

00:00:48.365 --> 00:00:53.671
 Click the Google SketchUp download icon on the right. 

00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:56.471
 There are two different versions of SketchUp to choose from: 

00:00:56.472 --> 00:00:59.798
 A free version and a professional version. 

00:00:59.798 --> 00:01:07.844
 Use the free version to get the most out of all the features of the SAT plugin. 

00:01:07.844 --> 00:01:11.392
 Once again click on the download icon on the right to download. 

00:01:11.392 --> 00:01:16.041
 You need to choose your operating system 

00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:22.480
 The SAT plugin can only be run on Windows XP and higher PC operating systems. 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.303
 Finally click again to agree and download 

00:01:27.304 --> 00:01:30.318
 Start the official download. 

00:01:30.318 --> 00:01:32.568
 When the download is complete, 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:35.691
 You only need to install this download file. 

00:01:35.691 --> 00:01:38.729
 Once installed, 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.028
 Or you have already installed this software, 

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:44.893
 You are ready to start running Google SketchUp. 

00:01:44.893 --> 00:01:47.646
 If you already own this software, 

00:01:47.647 --> 00:01:51.651
 Please make sure it is the latest version. 

00:01:51.651 --> 00:01:54.157
 In order to verify your software version, please go to the help menu. 

00:01:54.158 --> 00:01:56.436
 Then click Check for updates. 

00:01:56.436 --> 00:01:59.329
 Here, the version of the software is already up to date. 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.590
 If your software is not the latest version, the system will guide you to 

00:02:02.591 --> 00:02:05.148
 Google SketchUp official website. 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.601
 There you can download the latest version. 

00:02:08.601 --> 00:02:11.328
 In order to ensure the normal operation of the SAT plugin, 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:16.371
 SketchUp software must be run in administrator mode. 

00:02:16.371 --> 00:02:17.655
 In order to set this mode, 

00:02:17.656 --> 00:02:20.496
 Please go to the SketchUp installation folder. 

00:02:20.496 --> 00:02:24.106
 After finding the sketchup.exe file 

00:02:24.106 --> 00:02:26.511
 Right click to open "Properties". 

00:02:26.511 --> 00:02:30.052
 In the window that appears later 

00:02:30.052 --> 00:02:33.877
 Select the Compatibility tab and click Select 

00:02:33.878 --> 00:02:36.889
 And choose to run this program as an administrator. 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:40.259
 Click Apply and OK. 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:42.659
 Now let's go back to the SketchUp interface. 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.675
 In order to install the SAT plugin, 

00:02:45.676 --> 00:02:49.813
 Click on the window menu first, then click on Options. 

00:02:49.813 --> 00:02:53.381
 Click on the extension app on the left. 

00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:58.647
 All installed plugins will be displayed in the list. 

00:02:58.647 --> 00:03:01.615
 Click the Install Extensions icon. 

00:03:01.615 --> 00:03:07.371
 Then select the SAT installation file and click Open. 

00:03:08.906 --> 00:03:11.946
 The following message will appear. 

00:03:11.946 --> 00:03:16.512
 This message will appear when all plugins are installed. 

00:03:16.512 --> 00:03:18.699
 It reminds you of this plugin 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.616
 A new file will be created on your hard drive. 

00:03:21.616 --> 00:03:24.380
 Because the SAT plugin is in use 

00:03:24.381 --> 00:03:29.698
 Some new images, backups or web files will be created in the temporary folder. 

00:03:29.698 --> 00:03:33.121
 These files are completely secure. 

00:03:33.121 --> 00:03:36.851
 Click YES and the installer will start. 

00:03:42.158 --> 00:03:45.227
 When the installer runs successfully, 

00:03:45.227 --> 00:03:47.257
 The following window will appear 

00:03:47.257 --> 00:03:49.883
 Please click OK to complete the installation. 

00:03:49.883 --> 00:03:55.755
 You will then need to close and restart SketchUp to complete the installation. 

00:03:55.755 --> 00:03:57.715
 Go back to SketchUp again, 

00:03:57.716 --> 00:04:01.201
 You will see the SAT toolbar. 

00:04:01.201 --> 00:04:09.027
 This toolbar can be moved around the window at will. 

00:04:11.792 --> 00:04:14.948
 If your toolbar is not visible, 

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:17.316
 Click on the view in the menu and select the toolbar. 

00:04:17.317 --> 00:04:21.261
 And make sure the SimFonIA Animation Tools toolbar is selected. 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:25.293
 Before using the SAT plugin 

00:04:25.294 --> 00:04:27.607
 Still need to do the last thing. 

00:04:27.607 --> 00:04:30.607
 That is, create your temporary working folder. 

00:04:30.607 --> 00:04:36.277
 This folder will be used to store the images, backups and web files that will be created. 

00:04:36.277 --> 00:04:39.644
 To do this, you just have to click on the plugin menu. 

00:04:39.645 --> 00:04:43.386
 Then select the SimFonIA option and edit the temporary folder settings. 

00:04:43.386 --> 00:04:46.521
 The upcoming window will display the name and path of your temporary folder. 

00:04:46.522 --> 00:04:52.259
 And ask if you need to create another temporary folder. 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:05:01.406
 If you choose OK, you can choose a new temporary folder name and path. 

00:05:01.406 --> 00:05:05.223
 For the sake of illustration, let's create a new one here. 

00:05:05.224 --> 00:05:08.684
 Temporary folder named TempData2 

00:05:10.635 --> 00:05:13.345
 Click the Save and OK button to confirm your changes. 

00:05:16.986 --> 00:05:18.784
 The above is a demo video of the installation process of the SimFonIA animation tool. 

00:05:18.784 --> 00:05:20.482
 You can now enjoy 

00:05:20.483 --> 00:05:22.588
 Enjoy the features that this software brings to you. 

00:05:22.588 --> 00:05:24.343
 Please remember to refer to the SimFonIA website. 

00:05:24.344 --> 00:05:27.790
 Help documentation for each feature you have prepared. 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.722
 Demonstration videos of other features will be released in the future 

00:05:30.723 --> 00:05:32.507
 We will demonstrate to you step by step 

00:05:32.508 --> 00:05:34.738
 The various features of this SAT plugin. 

00:05:34.738 --> 00:05:38.686
 I and the SimFonIA team thank you for watching this video.
