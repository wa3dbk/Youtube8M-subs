00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.480
 and hello to all and welcome to 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.920
 this video 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.429
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.510
 make a trampoline on minecraft 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:11.730
 firstly I would like to thank so 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.420
 Damien rather deadly of the chain 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.970
 she will be in the second video that has me 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.199
 who helped me make this trampoline on 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.609
 did some tests to make one of 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.710
 videos a video without but it did not 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.789
 market so I end up doing this 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.730
 video alone 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.140
 so this is it for you then for 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.179
 start troponin you will need 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.350
 of a command block so does this 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.700
 so order this to your name 8le for 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.649
 have a patent commented on 37 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:42.739
 the idea you will need barriers there 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.809
 ya i think 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.340
 here you will need barriers and 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.750
 len will have to take any 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.670
 this one ward led what you want 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.570
 that's all there is to be a barrier 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.940
 so you make four of length 3 in 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.559
 diagonal a fourth diagonally 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.430
 to go on four two lengths 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.590
 this is actually one of two rounds like that 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.140
 so I'm doing big but after leers 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.729
 a little silly but do like you 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:18.240
 want to be here then you have more 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.100
 than to put wool over it so 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.250
 you ask on each ticket as 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.250
 it 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.549
 here we are almost 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.490
 that's me sorry then they will you 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:55.720
 show more you rest has handed over to 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:02:01.330
 inside so that gives it so 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:04.720
 you put the blocks for that I want to 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:07.149
 thank you for your support 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.640
 on youtube machine so that's me 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.110
 great pleasure and thank you 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.530
 and I hope I will continue to 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.300
 make videos 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:18.370
 I do not know if you noticed there 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:21.100
 is already 1 1 is a being like scotty of 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.180
 games finally you see I got 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.010
 improved in video quality 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.000
 because before that it's the win in the 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.810
 I hope I did it 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.400
 it's a bit less 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.750
 I noticed it's gone a little bit more 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.950
 more fluid he speaks one is also level 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.200
 sound I hope it's more fluid 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.690
 as eleven years old - the under-11s 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.620
 less blues and keyboard noises 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.829
 so then you will need to 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.320
 golden redstone peter and easter of 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:49.239
 pressure let's start so you go 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.620
 ask the control block one can 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.630
 does it matter better you ask on the first 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.220
 side like that so the order is this 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.480
 the ehtp further to rob aspects of which I 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.760
 will put the order in the wound and 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.810
 the video so to rebase further the 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.650
 little wave when you do not leave 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:11.470
 the little wave is halting and I believe 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.730
 no I was looking for small space wave 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.230
 waves of this fact the number of blocks 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.840
 you're going to want to jump but you 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.200
 trampoline we want to put before yet 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.000
 a vag space is so click on 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.230
 it makes me give it to you for 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.989
 respite shots from each side so on 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.640
 the imposition 1 you touch it and 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.489
 then you will fill everything with 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.410
 their exodus 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.239
 I noticed that without this trampoline 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.440
 had never been done so it's for 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.150
 that I did this video normally 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.560
 metropolis and above all finally the 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.580
 tutorials are mostly on 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.940
 with the TNT so they tear off a single 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.640
 time so that's its limits and then 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.750
 we may have at the end when you 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.549
 you look at jumping you will have less 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.049
 the impression you want 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.849
 really end if you really have 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:58.110
 even a little bit less than for example 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.420
 that for example at kano troponin that I 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.049
 will show you can tell from our video 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.379
 I will try business accompanied by 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.610
 dhamir here are my parents when you 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.060
 will watch a player who will jump on the 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.370
 trampoline 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.110
 it will be important to you that this drama 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.000
 then you lay blocks over 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.200
 the red stone for repeater you 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.660
 then try the numbers you have 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.720
 accomplish and also for the block of 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:25.050
 command you press shift here is 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:27.870
 so asked ask the blocks I do not want 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.039
 accelerated because in case if ever 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.160
 you can try to reproduce 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:33.180
 this tutorial down like that one could 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.880
 do it at the same time as me because I 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.660
 am slow enough to ask the block so 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.539
 baba which you can follow at the same 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.669
 time otherwise you have only to advance in 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:46.520
 the video maybe I would put I 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.840
 will you tell which advanced moment to see 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.039
 sees the end result everything is 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.530
 maybe I would put rather editing 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:54.530
 the final rejected from the beginning we will see 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.630
 I have practically finished 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.050
 yesterday I have some minor problems 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.820
 registration so I would say part 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.080
 would be a lot of times then you 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.750
 go lay pressure plates so 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:20.930
 absolutely everywhere I say it's more 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:24.000
 a pressure plate is called 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:27.420
 there is no link none none 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.910
 limit then you can talk to them 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:32.010
 gold printing plates and in fact do not 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:35.220
 not walking there are only oboe stone 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.360
 who walks and what to do 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.470
 is that in our pauline then me 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.330
 I put 20 blocks that I blow 20 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.210
 blog of the author but for example you 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.280
 allow a block over a 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.330
 dozen blocks because the plate 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.420
 print will not have time to 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:50.490
 put the 100 m back in position 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.350
 position because one difference will have 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:57.060
 no time to leave this role of will be 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:06:02.160
 elevated so here you have to go 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:03.660
 others and not like that and then 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.550
 we just have to jump then you 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.050
 can put a small staircase or 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:12.960
 scales 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:15.030
 I'll do it quickly like this and 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.460
 that's what it gives in sauce like that 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.420
 so the little problem also to the cat 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:22.770
 so that will help you the options of 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:24.450
 to remove it 1 that's what it gives 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:25.500
 we have the impression that we see it 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:27.690
 the print jumps so I'm going to change 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:31.110
 for sure I saw it's 5 here it is 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:32.160
 like that that's it jumps like that you 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.870
 know of course a lot higher a 

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:40.220
 month I put it like that so remove 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:44.610
 anyway in case the cat 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:45.240
 here and here and there I hope tutorial 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.920
 you will have liked 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.830
 so if you liked it do not hesitate to 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:52.140
 leave a green thumb where was happening a 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.550
 changed to blue it seems if you are not 

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:56.210
 no more to put a red beanbag to 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.770
 put in the mouth red pardon 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:00.410
 so here I just you my through something 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:01.910
 just you can change so I have 

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.080
 put @ country at the very beginning 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.599
 that's how besides I even know 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.190
 not what I forgot to tell you that 

00:07:05.599 --> 00:07:10.580
 you saw on the screen 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:12.199
 @ peace then actually @ pc to put the 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.180
 blow up the person who is the most 

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:16.520
 close 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.960
 the proof of orders @ enough for 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.630
 blow up all the players that are 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:23.690
 on a server and @ rc to blow up 

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.800
 a player one day randomly actually 

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:27.130
 it's going to be you have to choose 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.960
 automatically a player already set to 

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:33.259
 come a bass solo part felt that 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:35.000
 me but yeah it's j to show must 

00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:36.380
 they need especially that in fact it takes 

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.669
 absolutely put pressure everywhere 

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.300
 meaning should especially put the ads from 

00:07:37.669 --> 00:07:40.520
 pressure on rome 

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.810
 you have them peter and the levels of 

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.199
 orders if ever you a case it's 

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:46.669
 it's not going to work 

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:50.680
 I think that's about all 

00:07:46.669 --> 00:07:52.400
 this fate this tutorial 

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:56.180
 what can I tell you a lot 

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.990
 there is another type of trampoline if a 

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.400
 Such a thing I want to tell you 

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:05.949
 is that you can jump because we 

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:05.949
 alone on his wrist this is going hi
