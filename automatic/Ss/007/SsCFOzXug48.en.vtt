00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
so i think the other ones would be a

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.820 
so i think the other ones would be a
little<00:03:38.000> more<00:03:38.239> exciting<00:03:38.750> oh<00:03:38.959> but<00:03:39.620> the<00:03:39.709> other

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
little more exciting oh but the other

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.490 
little more exciting oh but the other
one<00:03:40.010> does<00:03:40.220> involve<00:03:40.550> another<00:03:40.820> hacker<00:03:41.090> so<00:03:41.600> have

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
one does involve another hacker so have
