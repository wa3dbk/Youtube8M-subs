00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
heard the food reacts to the body what I

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.710 
heard the food reacts to the body what I
could<00:00:45.020> do<00:00:45.230> to<00:00:45.500> then<00:00:45.950> enhance<00:00:46.309> my<00:00:46.730> physique<00:00:47.059> the

could do to then enhance my physique the
muscle<00:00:48.650> groups

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
muscle groups

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.150 
muscle groups
I<00:00:49.100> find<00:00:49.460> easiest<00:00:50.239> to<00:00:50.540> train<00:00:50.870> would<00:00:51.559> probably

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
I find easiest to train would probably

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.899 
I find easiest to train would probably
be<00:00:52.430> my<00:00:53.330> chest<00:00:53.660> and<00:00:54.190> it's<00:00:55.190> not<00:00:55.430> necessarily

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:55.909 
be my chest and it's not necessarily

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:57.689 
be my chest and it's not necessarily
strongest<00:00:56.629> part<00:00:56.900> my<00:00:57.050> body<00:00:57.440> it's<00:00:57.620> not

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
strongest part my body it's not

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.060 
strongest part my body it's not
necessarily<00:00:58.699> the<00:00:59.690> best<00:00:59.870> part<00:01:00.260> but<00:01:00.650> I<00:01:00.710> find

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
necessarily the best part but I find

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.149 
necessarily the best part but I find
that<00:01:01.309> just<00:01:01.699> because<00:01:02.120> I<00:01:02.510> can<00:01:03.140> really<00:01:03.530> focus<00:01:03.769> on

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
that just because I can really focus on

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.220 
that just because I can really focus on
the<00:01:04.220> contraction<00:01:04.790> so<00:01:05.269> I<00:01:05.330> can<00:01:05.449> really<00:01:05.659> focus<00:01:05.900> on

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.230 
the contraction so I can really focus on

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.780 
the contraction so I can really focus on
the<00:01:06.290> exercises<00:01:07.159> that<00:01:07.190> I<00:01:07.310> have<00:01:07.460> a<00:01:07.490> lot<00:01:07.760> more

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
the exercises that I have a lot more

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.149 
the exercises that I have a lot more
control<00:01:08.360> I<00:01:08.960> don't<00:01:09.290> really<00:01:09.620> need<00:01:09.800> somebody

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
control I don't really need somebody
