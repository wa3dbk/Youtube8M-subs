00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
interesting with it so for example when

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.560 
interesting with it so for example when
you<00:01:22.920> finish<00:01:23.310> somebody<00:01:23.580> office<00:01:24.000> it's<00:01:24.360> much

more<00:01:24.720> interesting<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.350> run<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.619> sort

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
more interesting to like run to sort

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.630 
more interesting to like run to sort
through<00:01:26.040> them<00:01:26.130> they're<00:01:26.340> just

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
through them they're just

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.700 
through them they're just

when the other big features of this is

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.650 
when the other big features of this is
its<00:01:47.400> co-op<00:01:47.610> can<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.030> describe<00:01:48.270> how<00:01:48.600> that

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
its co-op can you describe how that

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.380 
its co-op can you describe how that
whole<00:01:48.930> system<00:01:49.380> works<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:50.640> co-op<00:01:50.909> system<00:01:51.270> is

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
whole system works the co-op system is
