up with a material but i think is going
to<00:03:01.069> be<00:03:01.190> very<00:03:01.220> very<00:03:01.850> good<00:03:02.060> for<00:03:02.600> the<00:03:02.690> desks<00:03:02.989> that

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
to be very very good for the desks that

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.780 
to be very very good for the desks that
i<00:03:03.140> want<00:03:03.410> now<00:03:03.890> I<00:03:03.920> wanted<00:03:04.160> it<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.400> be<00:03:04.489> white

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
i want now I wanted it to be white

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.100 
i want now I wanted it to be white
because<00:03:05.000> as<00:03:05.209> you<00:03:05.330> guys<00:03:05.510> know<00:03:05.540> I've<00:03:05.930> got<00:03:06.080> a

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
because as you guys know I've got a

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.840 
because as you guys know I've got a
white<00:03:06.380> wardrobe<00:03:06.890> I've<00:03:07.010> got<00:03:07.160> this<00:03:07.340> white<00:03:07.610> desk

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
white wardrobe I've got this white desk

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.420 
white wardrobe I've got this white desk
here<00:03:08.209> and<00:03:08.720> I<00:03:08.780> just<00:03:08.810> like<00:03:09.410> white<00:03:09.739> furniture<00:03:10.010> is

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
here and I just like white furniture is

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.520 
here and I just like white furniture is
very<00:03:10.670> kind<00:03:11.239> of<00:03:11.390> easy<00:03:11.630> to<00:03:11.959> keep<00:03:12.110> clean<00:03:12.170> because

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
very kind of easy to keep clean because

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.430 
very kind of easy to keep clean because
you<00:03:12.650> can<00:03:12.769> obviously<00:03:12.860> see<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.430> dirt<00:03:13.750> so<00:03:14.750> this

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
you can obviously see the dirt so this

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.280 
you can obviously see the dirt so this
material<00:03:16.100> i<00:03:16.280> believe<00:03:16.880> is<00:03:17.239> some<00:03:17.989> kind<00:03:18.230> of

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
material i believe is some kind of

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.680 
material i believe is some kind of
polycarbonate<00:03:18.980> maybe<00:03:19.820> polyester<00:03:20.630> or

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
polycarbonate maybe polyester or

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.720 
polycarbonate maybe polyester or
polyurethane<00:03:21.380> whatever<00:03:22.010> it<00:03:22.100> might<00:03:22.250> be<00:03:22.310> i'm

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
polyurethane whatever it might be i'm

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.880 
polyurethane whatever it might be i'm
not<00:03:22.940> entirely<00:03:23.420> sure<00:03:23.630> but<00:03:24.049> as<00:03:24.500> you<00:03:24.620> can<00:03:24.709> see

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
not entirely sure but as you can see

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.039 
not entirely sure but as you can see
this<00:03:25.010> is<00:03:25.160> a<00:03:25.190> solid<00:03:25.640> slab<00:03:26.030> of<00:03:26.299> essentially

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
this is a solid slab of essentially

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.569 
this is a solid slab of essentially
