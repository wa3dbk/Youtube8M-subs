vote<00:00:36.490> I<00:00:36.640> think<00:00:36.820> they've<00:00:36.940> always<00:00:37.090> had<00:00:37.240> in

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
vote I think they've always had in

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.880 
vote I think they've always had in
common<00:00:37.510> probably<00:00:38.200> similarities<00:00:38.740> between

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
common probably similarities between

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.490 
common probably similarities between
them<00:00:39.690> kinda<00:00:40.690> and<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.930> it's<00:00:44.200> going<00:00:44.320> to<00:00:44.410> be<00:00:44.470> I

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
them kinda and so it's going to be I

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.020 
them kinda and so it's going to be I
think<00:00:44.650> it'd<00:00:44.800> be<00:00:44.829> I've<00:00:45.220> always<00:00:45.460> liked<00:00:45.670> to<00:00:45.700> see

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
think it'd be I've always liked to see

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.660 
think it'd be I've always liked to see
how<00:00:46.270> this<00:00:46.450> would<00:00:46.630> turn<00:00:46.840> out<00:00:47.250> now<00:00:48.250> for<00:00:48.310> the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
how this would turn out now for the

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.760 
how this would turn out now for the
battle<00:00:48.970> I'm<00:00:49.150> going<00:00:49.390> to<00:00:49.480> take<00:00:49.720> away<00:00:50.050> green

for the flight advantage and putted be

for the flight advantage and putted be
unfair<00:00:56.650> for<00:00:56.680> the<00:00:57.040> Joker<00:00:57.280> so<00:00:58.000> let's<00:00:58.480> just<00:00:58.630> say

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
unfair for the Joker so let's just say

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.150 
unfair for the Joker so let's just say
he<00:00:58.870> doesn't<00:00:59.110> have<00:00:59.230> it<00:00:59.260> and<00:00:59.530> they<00:00:59.710> are<00:00:59.830> on<00:00:59.980> the

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
he doesn't have it and they are on the

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.160 
he doesn't have it and they are on the
ground<00:01:00.310> and<00:01:02.100> what<00:01:03.100> would<00:01:03.220> go<00:01:03.340> down<00:01:03.490> from<00:01:03.790> there

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
ground and what would go down from there

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.320 
ground and what would go down from there
now<00:01:05.340> that<00:01:06.340> both<00:01:06.549> form<00:01:06.820> really<00:01:07.060> don't<00:01:07.240> need

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
now that both form really don't need

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.999 
now that both form really don't need
introductions<00:01:07.570> they're<00:01:08.290> both<00:01:08.439> probably<00:01:08.890> the

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
introductions they're both probably the

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:10.859 
introductions they're both probably the
some<00:01:09.549> of<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:09.670> most<00:01:09.820> popular<00:01:10.060> villains<00:01:10.750> of

their respective universes the Green

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.670 
their respective universes the Green
Goblin<00:01:15.280> one<00:01:15.759> of<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:15.909> best<00:01:16.259> if<00:01:17.259> not<00:01:17.320> the<00:01:17.530> best

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
Goblin one of the best if not the best

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.389 
Goblin one of the best if not the best
villain<00:01:18.249> for<00:01:18.460> spider-man<00:01:18.929> and<00:01:19.979> he<00:01:20.979> basically

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
villain for spider-man and he basically

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.489 
villain for spider-man and he basically
has<00:01:21.969> at<00:01:22.299> least<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:22.780> same<00:01:22.960> strength<00:01:23.320> as

00:01:23.489 --> 00:01:23.499 
has at least the same strength as

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:26.160 
has at least the same strength as
spider-man<00:01:24.070> he's<00:01:24.549> roughly<00:01:24.880> around<00:01:25.060> 10<00:01:25.420> to<00:01:25.840> 15

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
spider-man he's roughly around 10 to 15

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.069 
spider-man he's roughly around 10 to 15
tons<00:01:26.469> so<00:01:27.159> of<00:01:27.999> course<00:01:28.149> the<00:01:28.329> Joker<00:01:28.539> just<00:01:28.840> has

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
tons so of course the Joker just has

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:31.319 
tons so of course the Joker just has
normal<00:01:29.590> human<00:01:30.069> strength<00:01:30.340> so<00:01:30.729> the<00:01:31.030> strength

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:31.329 
normal human strength so the strength

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:33.599 
normal human strength so the strength
advantage<00:01:31.600> will<00:01:32.109> definitely<00:01:32.920> go<00:01:33.100> to<00:01:33.159> Green

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:33.609 
advantage will definitely go to Green

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:37.859 
advantage will definitely go to Green
Goblin<00:01:34.950> but<00:01:35.950> what<00:01:36.159> about<00:01:36.369> in<00:01:36.869> intelligence

and uh and various other things you know

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.550 
and uh and various other things you know
because<00:01:49.869> he<00:01:50.469> created<00:01:51.009> the<00:01:52.049> thing<00:01:53.049> that<00:01:53.350> made

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
because he created the thing that made

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.379 
because he created the thing that made
him<00:01:53.649> the<00:01:53.770> green<00:01:54.009> goblin<00:01:54.159> or<00:01:54.579> his<00:01:54.819> scientists

him the green goblin or his scientists

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:58.169 
him the green goblin or his scientists
help<00:01:55.600> do<00:01:55.840> it<00:01:55.960> but<00:01:56.170> I<00:01:56.459> think<00:01:57.459> you<00:01:57.639> got<00:01:57.729> the<00:01:57.850> Joker

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
help do it but I think you got the Joker

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:00.840 
help do it but I think you got the Joker
who<00:01:58.959> is<00:01:59.109> also<00:01:59.350> has<00:01:59.590> a<00:01:59.619> genius-level<00:02:00.459> intellect

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
who is also has a genius-level intellect

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.749 
who is also has a genius-level intellect
but<00:02:01.439> it's<00:02:02.439> kinda<00:02:02.799> you<00:02:03.130> kind<00:02:03.520> of<00:02:03.549> think

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
but it's kinda you kind of think

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.370 
but it's kinda you kind of think
sometimes<00:02:04.450> he's<00:02:04.600> not<00:02:04.689> very<00:02:04.810> smart<00:02:05.139> just

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
sometimes he's not very smart just

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.629 
sometimes he's not very smart just
because<00:02:05.469> you<00:02:05.709> know<00:02:05.799> he's<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.039> Joker<00:02:06.189> he<00:02:06.459> does

00:02:06.629 --> 00:02:06.639 
because you know he's the Joker he does

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:08.699 
because you know he's the Joker he does
like<00:02:07.630> random<00:02:07.990> things<00:02:08.200> but<00:02:08.380> you<00:02:08.470> know<00:02:08.560> he

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
like random things but you know he

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.070 
like random things but you know he
always<00:02:08.910> has<00:02:09.910> a<00:02:09.940> reason<00:02:10.119> for<00:02:10.509> everything<00:02:10.840> he

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
always has a reason for everything he

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.770 
always has a reason for everything he
does<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:12.670> joker<00:02:12.910> basically<00:02:13.330> has<00:02:13.480> everything

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
does the joker basically has everything

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.170 
does the joker basically has everything
planned<00:02:14.050> out<00:02:14.350> like<00:02:15.340> with<00:02:15.490> with<00:02:15.760> Mozart<00:02:15.940> with

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
planned out like with with Mozart with

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.290 
planned out like with with Mozart with
most<00:02:16.390> random<00:02:16.810> things<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:17.819> before<00:02:18.819> it<00:02:19.090> comes

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
most random things so before it comes

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.869 
most random things so before it comes
intellect<00:02:19.840> between<00:02:20.200> them<00:02:20.459> I'd<00:02:21.459> probably<00:02:21.640> give

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
intellect between them I'd probably give

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.240 
intellect between them I'd probably give
it<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.150> Joker<00:02:22.450> I<00:02:22.780> do<00:02:23.739> believe<00:02:23.830> the<00:02:23.980> Joker

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
it to the Joker I do believe the Joker

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.630 
it to the Joker I do believe the Joker
smarter<00:02:24.750> with<00:02:25.750> prep<00:02:26.140> time

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
smarter with prep time

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.510 
smarter with prep time
the<00:02:28.120> Joker<00:02:28.450> would<00:02:28.540> probably<00:02:29.140> win<00:02:29.290> but<00:02:30.280> this<00:02:30.400> is

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
the Joker would probably win but this is

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.890 
the Joker would probably win but this is
there's<00:02:30.880> no<00:02:31.000> prep<00:02:31.240> time<00:02:31.420> just<00:02:31.630> straight<00:02:31.870> a

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
there's no prep time just straight a

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.559 
there's no prep time just straight a
battle<00:02:32.260> it'd<00:02:33.010> be<00:02:33.130> different<00:02:33.310> but<00:02:34.030> still<00:02:34.330> the

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
battle it'd be different but still the

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.070 
battle it'd be different but still the
intelligence<00:02:34.990> would<00:02:35.050> go<00:02:35.200> to<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.500> Joker<00:02:36.030> now

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
intelligence would go to the Joker now

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.460 
intelligence would go to the Joker now
they<00:02:38.080> are<00:02:38.110> both<00:02:39.060> now<00:02:40.060> for<00:02:40.630> hand-to-hand<00:02:40.870> The

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
they are both now for hand-to-hand The

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.980 
they are both now for hand-to-hand The
Joker<00:02:41.709> is<00:02:41.860> not<00:02:42.130> one<00:02:42.400> for<00:02:42.850> hand-to-hand<00:02:43.300> but<00:02:43.840> in

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
Joker is not one for hand-to-hand but in

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.840 
Joker is not one for hand-to-hand but in
certain<00:02:44.200> comic<00:02:44.680> books<00:02:44.890> he's<00:02:45.160> shown<00:02:45.610> he<00:02:45.820> can

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
certain comic books he's shown he can

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.110 
certain comic books he's shown he can
you<00:02:46.150> know<00:02:46.300> actually<00:02:46.990> do<00:02:47.500> give<00:02:48.459> Batman<00:02:48.880> a<00:02:48.910> hard

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
you know actually do give Batman a hard

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.820 
you know actually do give Batman a hard
time<00:02:49.300> in<00:02:49.480> hand-to-hand<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:50.260> other<00:02:50.440> people

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
time in hand-to-hand and other people

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.410 
time in hand-to-hand and other people
but<00:02:51.250> other<00:02:51.370> times<00:02:51.640> you<00:02:51.790> know<00:02:51.910> you<00:02:52.209> can<00:02:52.390> just

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
but other times you know you can just

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.470 
but other times you know you can just
get<00:02:52.720> beat<00:02:52.930> up<00:02:52.959> so<00:02:53.860> it's<00:02:53.980> hard<00:02:54.130> to<00:02:54.160> gauge<00:02:54.370> his<00:02:54.580> so

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
get beat up so it's hard to gauge his so

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.940 
get beat up so it's hard to gauge his so
I<00:02:55.510> would<00:02:56.110> just<00:02:56.260> say<00:02:56.320> he'd<00:02:56.560> probably<00:02:56.739> he's

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
I would just say he'd probably he's

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.460 
I would just say he'd probably he's
probably<00:02:56.980> an<00:02:57.250> average<00:02:57.640> fighter<00:02:58.120> it<00:02:59.020> may<00:02:59.170> be

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
probably an average fighter it may be

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.160 
probably an average fighter it may be
better<00:02:59.770> than<00:02:59.980> at<00:03:00.160> an<00:03:00.340> average<00:03:00.520> fighter<00:03:00.900> but<00:03:01.900> uh

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
better than at an average fighter but uh

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.580 
better than at an average fighter but uh
the<00:03:02.680> Green<00:03:02.860> Goblin<00:03:02.890> is<00:03:03.520> I<00:03:04.170> probably<00:03:05.170> give<00:03:05.380> him

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
the Green Goblin is I probably give him

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.290 
the Green Goblin is I probably give him
a<00:03:05.769> the<00:03:06.190> fighting<00:03:06.489> ability<00:03:06.880> to<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.120> fact<00:03:07.269> that

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
a the fighting ability to the fact that

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.290 
a the fighting ability to the fact that
he<00:03:07.480> is<00:03:07.510> enhanced<00:03:08.080> and<00:03:08.910> probably<00:03:09.910> a<00:03:10.000> greater

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
he is enhanced and probably a greater

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.540 
he is enhanced and probably a greater
reaction<00:03:10.930> time<00:03:11.170> and<00:03:11.470> everything<00:03:11.680> since<00:03:12.459> he

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
reaction time and everything since he

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.810 
reaction time and everything since he
can<00:03:12.670> keep<00:03:12.850> up<00:03:12.970> with<00:03:13.000> spider-man<00:03:14.100> so<00:03:15.100> that's

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
can keep up with spider-man so that's

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.390 
can keep up with spider-man so that's
going<00:03:15.970> to<00:03:16.030> be<00:03:16.180> a<00:03:16.530> tough<00:03:17.530> one<00:03:17.769> for<00:03:17.800> the<00:03:18.160> Joker

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
going to be a tough one for the Joker

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.400 
going to be a tough one for the Joker
but<00:03:18.760> you<00:03:18.850> know<00:03:18.970> Joker<00:03:19.360> has<00:03:19.540> also<00:03:19.780> handled<00:03:20.320> you

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
but you know Joker has also handled you

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.130 
but you know Joker has also handled you
know<00:03:20.560> stronger<00:03:21.489> people<00:03:21.670> then<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.930> Green

know stronger people then the Green
Goblin<00:03:23.170> before<00:03:23.739> so<00:03:24.840> may<00:03:25.840> not<00:03:25.989> be<00:03:26.110> a<00:03:26.140> factor

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440

that<00:04:27.400> stuff<00:04:27.520> you<00:04:28.890> know<00:04:29.890> cuz<00:04:30.190> he<00:04:30.310> because<00:04:30.520> the

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
that stuff you know cuz he because the

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.790 
that stuff you know cuz he because the
Joker's<00:04:31.060> also<00:04:31.330> varies<00:04:31.630> expert<00:04:32.110> with<00:04:32.350> an

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
Joker's also varies expert with an

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.279 
Joker's also varies expert with an
expert<00:04:33.190> and<00:04:33.310> with<00:04:33.490> explosives<00:04:34.150> uh<00:04:34.570> he's<00:04:35.110> an

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.289 
expert and with explosives uh he's an

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:37.400 
expert and with explosives uh he's an
expert<00:04:35.620> in<00:04:35.890> chemistry<00:04:36.490> and<00:04:36.580> engineering<00:04:36.669> so

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
expert in chemistry and engineering so

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.980 
expert in chemistry and engineering so
he<00:04:38.410> probably<00:04:39.120> depending<00:04:40.120> on<00:04:40.330> what<00:04:40.599> he<00:04:40.840> may

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
he probably depending on what he may

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.399 
he probably depending on what he may
have

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:41.409 
have

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:43.350 
have
better<00:04:41.529> equipments<00:04:42.069> it's<00:04:42.369> probably<00:04:42.999> just<00:04:43.269> a

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
better equipments it's probably just a

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.509 
better equipments it's probably just a
route<00:04:43.569> even<00:04:43.899> but<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.679> Joker's<00:04:45.069> is<00:04:45.249> probably

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:45.519 
route even but the Joker's is probably

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:47.759 
route even but the Joker's is probably
more<00:04:45.669> genius<00:04:46.119> on<00:04:46.449> some<00:04:47.050> of<00:04:47.110> the<00:04:47.199> things<00:04:47.379> he<00:04:47.559> has

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:47.769 
more genius on some of the things he has

00:04:47.769 --> 00:04:53.159 
more genius on some of the things he has
come<00:04:48.009> up<00:04:48.129> with<00:04:49.080> but<00:04:50.080> uh<00:04:51.029> so<00:04:52.029> it's<00:04:52.719> very<00:04:52.839> very

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
come up with but uh so it's very very

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.009 
come up with but uh so it's very very
very<00:04:53.319> very<00:04:53.589> tough<00:04:53.889> battle<00:04:54.339> but<00:04:54.669> the<00:04:55.419> Green

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:56.019 
very very tough battle but the Green

00:04:56.019 --> 00:04:58.529 
very very tough battle but the Green
Goblin<00:04:56.050> does<00:04:56.800> have<00:04:57.069> you<00:04:57.099> know<00:04:57.309> his<00:04:57.849> armor<00:04:58.300> that

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
Goblin does have you know his armor that

00:04:58.539 --> 00:04:59.929 
Goblin does have you know his armor that
he<00:04:58.659> wears<00:04:58.839> you<00:04:58.989> know<00:04:59.080> it's<00:04:59.229> a<00:04:59.289> bulletproof

00:04:59.929 --> 00:04:59.939 
he wears you know it's a bulletproof

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:03.659 
he wears you know it's a bulletproof
costume<00:05:00.939> and<00:05:01.419> all<00:05:01.929> that<00:05:02.139> so<00:05:02.379> guns<00:05:02.979> might<00:05:03.639> not

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
costume and all that so guns might not

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:10.229 
costume and all that so guns might not
work<00:05:04.239> when<00:05:04.509> it<00:05:04.629> comes<00:05:04.839> to<00:05:05.169> a<00:05:07.619> the<00:05:08.619> Joker<00:05:09.519> well

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:10.239 
work when it comes to a the Joker well

00:05:10.239 --> 00:05:13.290 
work when it comes to a the Joker well
when<00:05:10.330> it<00:05:10.419> comes<00:05:10.479> to<00:05:10.599> Green<00:05:10.749> Goblin<00:05:11.489> in<00:05:12.489> the

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
when it comes to Green Goblin in the

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.269 
when it comes to Green Goblin in the
guns<00:05:13.479> probably<00:05:13.809> won't<00:05:13.959> work<00:05:14.110> so<00:05:14.469> that<00:05:14.739> might

00:05:15.269 --> 00:05:15.279 
guns probably won't work so that might

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:16.589 
guns probably won't work so that might
be<00:05:15.429> taken<00:05:15.579> out<00:05:15.849> it's<00:05:16.059> probably<00:05:16.269> same<00:05:16.449> with

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:16.599 
be taken out it's probably same with

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:22.829 
be taken out it's probably same with
knives<00:05:17.399> so<00:05:18.779> and<00:05:20.579> the<00:05:21.579> thing<00:05:21.789> is<00:05:21.849> with<00:05:22.300> also

00:05:22.829 --> 00:05:22.839 
knives so and the thing is with also

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:25.169 
knives so and the thing is with also
hallucis<00:05:23.409> instead<00:05:24.039> the<00:05:24.279> pumpkin<00:05:24.579> bombs<00:05:24.849> can

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:25.179 
hallucis instead the pumpkin bombs can

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:27.569 
hallucis instead the pumpkin bombs can
use<00:05:25.389> so<00:05:25.749> now<00:05:25.839> gasps<00:05:26.079> The<00:05:26.589> Joker<00:05:26.860> is<00:05:26.979> immune<00:05:27.429> to

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:27.579 
use so now gasps The Joker is immune to

00:05:27.579 --> 00:05:31.049 
use so now gasps The Joker is immune to
poisons<00:05:28.239> different<00:05:28.899> types<00:05:29.110> of<00:05:29.289> poisons<00:05:30.059> so

00:05:31.049 --> 00:05:31.059 
poisons different types of poisons so

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:32.699 
poisons different types of poisons so
that<00:05:31.239> can<00:05:31.419> actually<00:05:31.659> give<00:05:32.019> him<00:05:32.199> the<00:05:32.289> edge<00:05:32.439> he's

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:32.709 
that can actually give him the edge he's

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:36.449 
that can actually give him the edge he's
immune<00:05:33.039> to<00:05:33.069> his<00:05:33.429> own<00:05:33.639> gases<00:05:34.329> so<00:05:35.219> he's<00:05:36.219> probably

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:36.459 
immune to his own gases so he's probably

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:38.129 
immune to his own gases so he's probably
build<00:05:36.789> an<00:05:36.939> immunity<00:05:37.239> to<00:05:37.509> all<00:05:37.689> types<00:05:38.050> of

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139 
build an immunity to all types of

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:39.540 
build an immunity to all types of
different<00:05:38.259> poison<00:05:38.709> so<00:05:38.860> it<00:05:39.099> would<00:05:39.219> probably

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
different poison so it would probably

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.850 
different poison so it would probably
not<00:05:40.149> work<00:05:40.509> on<00:05:40.779> the<00:05:41.019> Joker<00:05:42.779> but<00:05:43.779> also<00:05:43.959> in<00:05:44.409> the

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
not work on the Joker but also in the

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.909 
not work on the Joker but also in the
green<00:05:45.069> Goblin's<00:05:45.490> favor<00:05:45.779> he<00:05:46.779> has<00:05:46.990> said<00:05:47.679> he<00:05:47.889> has

green Goblin's favor he has said he has

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.449 
green Goblin's favor he has said he has
a<00:05:48.309> his<00:05:49.089> mask<00:05:49.389> allows<00:05:50.019> him<00:05:50.379> to<00:05:50.619> protect<00:05:51.009> him

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:51.459 
a his mask allows him to protect him

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:59.009 
a his mask allows him to protect him
from<00:05:51.669> also<00:05:52.379> gases<00:05:53.379> and<00:05:53.709> other<00:05:53.949> things<00:05:54.339> also<00:05:58.019> so

00:05:59.009 --> 00:05:59.019 
from also gases and other things also so

00:05:59.019 --> 00:06:03.629

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:43.900 
probably will definitely try and use the

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.270 
probably will definitely try and use the
his<00:06:44.650> is<00:06:45.040> uh<00:06:45.070> the<00:06:45.639> gas<00:06:45.850> he<00:06:46.090> uses<00:06:46.740> but<00:06:47.740> it's

his is uh the gas he uses but it's

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.939 
his is uh the gas he uses but it's

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:50.949 
probably not going to work on the joke

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:53.040 
probably not going to work on the joke
on<00:06:51.130> the<00:06:51.460> Green<00:06:51.669> Goblin<00:06:51.699> same<00:06:52.660> thing<00:06:52.870> with

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050 
on the Green Goblin same thing with

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.200 
on the Green Goblin same thing with
Green<00:06:53.949> Goblin<00:06:54.130> he's<00:06:54.699> going<00:06:54.880> to<00:06:54.940> be<00:06:55.000> probably

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.210 
Green Goblin he's going to be probably

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.820 
Green Goblin he's going to be probably
the<00:06:55.300> pumpkin<00:06:55.690> bomb<00:06:55.840> if<00:06:56.050> it<00:06:56.169> doesn't<00:06:56.410> explode

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:56.830 
the pumpkin bomb if it doesn't explode

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.920 
the pumpkin bomb if it doesn't explode
and<00:06:57.070> hurt<00:06:57.250> the<00:06:57.430> Joker<00:06:57.699> and<00:06:57.910> he<00:06:58.000> uses<00:06:58.210> gas<00:06:58.570> it's

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930 
and hurt the Joker and he uses gas it's

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.960 
and hurt the Joker and he uses gas it's
not<00:06:59.080> going<00:06:59.229> to<00:06:59.410> work<00:06:59.530> on<00:06:59.680> the<00:06:59.860> Joker<00:07:00.130> I<00:07:00.400> believe

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:00.970 
not going to work on the Joker I believe

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.960 
not going to work on the Joker I believe
so<00:07:02.250> eventually<00:07:03.250> they're<00:07:03.400> both<00:07:03.550> going<00:07:03.759> to<00:07:03.820> have

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:03.970 
so eventually they're both going to have

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.029 
so eventually they're both going to have
to<00:07:04.150> come<00:07:04.870> in<00:07:04.990> once<00:07:05.259> they<00:07:05.350> run<00:07:05.470> it<00:07:05.530> of<00:07:05.710> items

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:06.039 
to come in once they run it of items

00:07:06.039 --> 00:07:07.469 
to come in once they run it of items
that<00:07:06.160> they're<00:07:06.520> done<00:07:06.699> throwing<00:07:07.030> at<00:07:07.180> each<00:07:07.270> other

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:07.479 
that they're done throwing at each other

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:09.270 
that they're done throwing at each other

hand-to-hand and it's going to go to the

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.520 
hand-to-hand and it's going to go to the
Green<00:07:12.340> Goblin<00:07:12.370> with<00:07:13.030> his<00:07:13.240> superior<00:07:14.139> strength

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:14.530
