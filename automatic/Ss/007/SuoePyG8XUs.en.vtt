00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
have a fit with the glass screen

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.880 
have a fit with the glass screen
protector<00:02:25.720> there's<00:02:25.990> one<00:02:26.290> thing<00:02:26.470> I'm<00:02:26.620> kind<00:02:26.860> of

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
protector there's one thing I'm kind of

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:38.160 
protector there's one thing I'm kind of
worried<00:02:27.130> about

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.240 

looks<00:02:38.740> like<00:02:38.890> it<00:02:39.040> does<00:02:39.930> perfectly<00:02:41.130> actually<00:02:42.130> it

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
looks like it does perfectly actually it

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:54.110 
looks like it does perfectly actually it
looks<00:02:42.780> pretty<00:02:43.780> nice<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:49.000> here's<00:02:49.270> the<00:02:49.390> back

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.619 

there's<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.420> ports<00:02:57.030> they're<00:02:58.030> accessible<00:02:58.599> I

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
there's the ports they're accessible I

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:59.850 
there's the ports they're accessible I
think<00:02:58.660> they<00:02:58.930> could<00:02:59.080> have<00:02:59.110> made<00:02:59.319> that<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.530> little

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
think they could have made that a little

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.020 
think they could have made that a little
more<00:03:00.040> flush<00:03:00.970> but<00:03:01.680> maybe<00:03:02.680> for<00:03:02.980> the<00:03:03.129> snaps<00:03:03.790> they

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
more flush but maybe for the snaps they

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.619 
more flush but maybe for the snaps they
wanted<00:03:04.360> to<00:03:04.450> do<00:03:04.569> it<00:03:04.690> that<00:03:04.840> way

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
wanted to do it that way
