00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
hey guys this is galactic and in this

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.249 
hey guys this is galactic and in this
part<00:00:03.120> of<00:00:03.149> the<00:00:03.240> tutorial<00:00:03.360> we're<00:00:03.929> pretty<00:00:04.140> much

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
part of the tutorial we're pretty much

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.619 
part of the tutorial we're pretty much
just<00:00:04.470> going<00:00:04.830> to<00:00:04.950> add<00:00:05.160> some<00:00:05.190> background<00:00:06.180> music

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
just going to add some background music

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.839 
just going to add some background music
and<00:00:06.839> make<00:00:07.529> that<00:00:07.799> your<00:00:07.950> main<00:00:08.130> character<00:00:08.400> can

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
and make that your main character can

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.720 
and make that your main character can
actually<00:00:09.179> get<00:00:09.269> damaged<00:00:13.490> alright<00:00:14.490> so<00:00:14.639> the

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
actually get damaged alright so the

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.939 
actually get damaged alright so the
first<00:00:14.759> thing<00:00:15.059> that<00:00:15.269> we're<00:00:15.389> going<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.690> do<00:00:15.839> is<00:00:16.139> go

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
first thing that we're going to do is go

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.300 
first thing that we're going to do is go
into<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.250> damage<00:00:17.640> aspect<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.660> tutorial

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
into the damage aspect of the tutorial

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.529 
into the damage aspect of the tutorial
because<00:00:20.310> it's<00:00:20.550> kind<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.850> difficult<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.510> I

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
because it's kind of difficult and I

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.929 
because it's kind of difficult and I
just<00:00:21.689> want<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.900> get<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:22.140> out<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.470> way<00:00:22.939> the

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
just want to get that out of the way the

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.790 
just want to get that out of the way the
first<00:00:24.150> part<00:00:24.449> of<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:24.960> going<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.470> your<00:00:25.619> main

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
first part of it is going to your main

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.279 
first part of it is going to your main
character<00:00:26.099> object<00:00:26.880> this<00:00:27.689> should<00:00:27.840> be<00:00:27.869> object

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
character object this should be object

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.660 
character object this should be object
number<00:00:28.349> one<00:00:28.650> or<00:00:28.830> main<00:00:29.010> character<00:00:29.429> whatever

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
number one or main character whatever

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.130 
number one or main character whatever
you<00:00:29.730> named<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.740> uncheck<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.920> solid<00:00:32.369> box

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
you named it and uncheck the solid box

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.510 
you named it and uncheck the solid box
it's<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.200> very<00:00:34.469> important<00:00:34.980> but<00:00:35.160> still<00:00:35.399> make

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
it's a very important but still make

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.639 
it's a very important but still make
sure<00:00:35.670> it's<00:00:35.790> visible<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.239> course<00:00:36.480> then<00:00:37.380> add

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
sure it's visible of course then add

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.310 
sure it's visible of course then add
another<00:00:37.680> event<00:00:38.420> collision<00:00:39.420> with<00:00:39.899> object

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
another event collision with object

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.069 
another event collision with object
number<00:00:40.410> two<00:00:40.680> or<00:00:40.890> your<00:00:41.070> enemy<00:00:41.399> whichever

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
number two or your enemy whichever

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.369 
number two or your enemy whichever
whatever<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.170> named<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:44.780> going<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.960> score

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
whatever you named it and going to score

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.610 
whatever you named it and going to score
lives<00:00:47.600> negative<00:00:48.600> 1<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.260> then<00:00:49.980> relative<00:00:50.520> and

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
lives negative 1 and then relative and

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.080 
lives negative 1 and then relative and
pretty<00:00:52.620> much<00:00:52.680> what<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:53.070> does<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.699> when<00:00:53.969> you

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
pretty much what this does is when you

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.490 
pretty much what this does is when you
collide<00:00:54.390> into<00:00:54.719> your<00:00:54.960> enemy<00:00:55.640> you<00:00:57.199> lose<00:00:58.199> one

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
collide into your enemy you lose one

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.389 
collide into your enemy you lose one
life<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.629> what<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.840> solid<00:01:01.320> thing<00:01:01.500> does<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:02.100> if

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
life and what the solid thing does is if

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.329 
life and what the solid thing does is if
it's<00:01:02.850> checked<00:01:03.480> then<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.960> makes<00:01:04.110> your<00:01:04.379> actual

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
it's checked then it makes your actual

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.160 
it's checked then it makes your actual
character<00:01:05.790> like<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> solid<00:01:06.510> block<00:01:06.659> so<00:01:07.140> you

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
character like a solid block so you

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.380 
character like a solid block so you
wouldn't<00:01:07.650> actually<00:01:07.860> collide<00:01:08.850> with<00:01:09.090> object

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
wouldn't actually collide with object

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.660 
wouldn't actually collide with object
number<00:01:09.479> two<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:10.710> that's<00:01:11.070> why<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.250> had<00:01:11.640> to

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
number two so that's why you had to

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.560 
number two so that's why you had to
uncheck<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:13.220> but<00:01:14.220> we're<00:01:14.369> also<00:01:14.580> what<00:01:15.390> we're

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
uncheck it but we're also what we're

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.350 
uncheck it but we're also what we're
also<00:01:15.750> going<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.200> do<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.759> we're<00:01:17.759> going<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.090> make

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
also going to do is we're going to make

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.030 
also going to do is we're going to make
it<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.659> your<00:01:18.900> main<00:01:19.080> character<00:01:19.320> goes<00:01:19.740> back

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
it so that your main character goes back

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.929 
it so that your main character goes back
to<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.369> starting<00:01:20.820> position<00:01:21.890> once<00:01:22.890> he<00:01:23.729> gets

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
to the starting position once he gets

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.899 
to the starting position once he gets
hit<00:01:24.150> by<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.360> main<00:01:24.950> by<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.009> enemy<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.610> what

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
hit by the main by the enemy so what

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.330 
hit by the main by the enemy so what
you're<00:01:27.090> going<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.360> do<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.570> drag<00:01:27.900> am<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:30.650> jump<00:01:31.650> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
you're going to do is drag am I jump the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.980 
you're going to do is drag am I jump the
start<00:01:34.759> event<00:01:35.759> right<00:01:36.150> over<00:01:36.450> into<00:01:36.810> your

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
start event right over into your

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.440 
start event right over into your
collision<00:01:37.740> event<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.310> you're<00:01:38.939> going<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.329> make

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
collision event and you're going to make

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.840 
collision event and you're going to make
one<00:01:39.509> for<00:01:40.079> yourself<00:01:40.170> as<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:41.100> see<00:01:41.310> me<00:01:41.490> just<00:01:41.729> you

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
one for yourself as you see me just you

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.330 
one for yourself as you see me just you
right<00:01:42.000> there<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.420> then<00:01:42.960> one<00:01:43.259> for<00:01:43.649> object

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
right there and then one for object

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.630 
right there and then one for object
object<00:01:45.060> number<00:01:45.329> two<00:01:45.950> this<00:01:46.950> basically<00:01:47.369> makes

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
object number two this basically makes

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.240 
object number two this basically makes
it<00:01:47.820> set<00:01:48.030> all<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.869> object<00:01:49.860> number<00:01:49.920> two<00:01:50.189> is

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
it set all of the object number two is

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.010 
it set all of the object number two is
go<00:01:50.520> back<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.759> their<00:01:51.090> position<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.869> go

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
go back to their position and you go

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.139 
go back to their position and you go
back<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.229> your<00:01:52.350> decision<00:01:52.829> once<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.880> lose<00:01:54.119> a

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
back to your decision once you lose a

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.450 
back to your decision once you lose a
life<00:01:54.390> just<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.380> can't<00:01:55.619> lose<00:01:55.770> like<00:01:56.040> 90

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
life just so that you can't lose like 90

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.920 
life just so that you can't lose like 90
lives<00:01:56.610> in<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.939> row<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.450> just<00:01:57.659> makes<00:01:57.810> the

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
lives in a row and it just makes the

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.999 
lives in a row and it just makes the
game<00:01:58.049> really<00:01:58.439> bad<00:01:58.680> um<00:01:59.719> then<00:02:00.719> click<00:02:00.930> OK<00:02:01.049> after

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
game really bad um then click OK after

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.469 
game really bad um then click OK after
that<00:02:02.310> you're<00:02:02.430> going<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.759> want<00:02:02.969> to<00:02:03.119> add<00:02:03.450> a

that you're going to want to add a

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.969 
that you're going to want to add a

editing<00:04:10.599> program<00:04:11.549> you<00:04:12.549> could<00:04:12.699> probably<00:04:12.970> edit

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
editing program you could probably edit

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.770 
editing program you could probably edit
the<00:04:13.479> sound<00:04:13.720> I<00:04:14.049> don't<00:04:14.639> but<00:04:15.639> I<00:04:15.699> think<00:04:16.150> audacity

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
the sound I don't but I think audacity

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.240 
the sound I don't but I think audacity
might<00:04:16.959> work<00:04:17.109> for<00:04:17.139> that<00:04:17.440> so<00:04:17.739> if<00:04:17.979> you're<00:04:18.130> on<00:04:18.220> a

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
might work for that so if you're on a

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.149 
might work for that so if you're on a
Windows<00:04:18.609> computer<00:04:18.639> you<00:04:19.120> can<00:04:19.239> do<00:04:19.389> that<00:04:19.949> then<00:04:20.949> go

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:21.159 
Windows computer you can do that then go

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:26.460 
Windows computer you can do that then go
into<00:04:21.340> score<00:04:22.710> game<00:04:23.710> start<00:04:24.070> and<00:04:24.669> I<00:04:25.090> believe

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
into score game start and I believe

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.630 
into score game start and I believe
we're<00:04:26.620> over<00:04:26.890> here<00:04:27.220> the<00:04:28.210> under<00:04:28.450> me<00:04:28.600> yes<00:04:29.640> sounds

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
we're over here the under me yes sounds

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.290 
we're over here the under me yes sounds
drag<00:04:31.120> that<00:04:31.240> over<00:04:31.360> here<00:04:32.160> sound<00:04:33.160> number<00:04:33.610> 0<00:04:33.970> and

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
drag that over here sound number 0 and

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.300 
drag that over here sound number 0 and
then<00:04:34.630> true<00:04:35.020> this<00:04:35.530> just<00:04:35.740> makes<00:04:35.920> it<00:04:36.130> so<00:04:36.280> that

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
then true this just makes it so that

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.700 
then true this just makes it so that
when<00:04:36.760> your<00:04:37.120> game<00:04:37.390> actually<00:04:37.780> starts<00:04:38.050> playing

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
when your game actually starts playing

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.560 
when your game actually starts playing
on<00:04:40.320> a<00:04:41.320> sound<00:04:41.920> where<00:04:42.760> background<00:04:43.240> music<00:04:43.480> will
