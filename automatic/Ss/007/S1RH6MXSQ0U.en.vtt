00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 welcome you ladies and gentlemen and 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.830
 in this video we will look at 5 gold 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.500
 winter landscape preparation rules 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.110
 outings now overboard and we have -34 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.070
 degrees we arrived at the location 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.609
 in advance 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.890
 about half an hour wanted to come but 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.830
 arrived an hour before dawn now sit 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.449
 in the car and would like to tell you 5 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.720
 rules to follow 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.230
 so as not to freeze when 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.170
 forays into the winter landscape and to 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.360
 get good results and beautiful 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.840
 mood is the first rule with which we 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.730
 wanted to start this always dress in 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.100
 two times warmer than you plan because 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.350
 what's the weather thing 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.629
 changeable and never guess how much 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.840
 year will always be predicted look 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.600
 one shows but in reality everything else is like 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.640
 Today we got the second rule 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.629
 which we would like to say what 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.530
 the second rule is what is always needed 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.880
 pre-plan your route 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.830
 It is possible to take a gps navigator 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.030
 mark post on so always 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.860
 look on the map if you 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.960
 approximately you only know the route 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.909
 if you were not in this place we are now 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.500
 We are located 140 kilometers from the house 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.900
 we shoot blue lakes very much 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.790
 interesting hydrosulphuric lake which 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.400
 formed in the karst crater in winter 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.810
 it does not freeze there is very much 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.200
 interesting 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.960
 blue rich color well photos you 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.850
 still see and now we'll talk about 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.280
 the third rule is just take with 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.490
 a navigator if you have it take with 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.439
 by itself if there are no paper cards 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.930
 all sorts of things to you 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.740
 navigate exactly on the way so you 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.439
 don't get lost 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.829
 there are special routers possible 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.630
 if you have any friends 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.320
 tourism active holidays there somewhere 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.850
 climbs out 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.619
 they can be a router already 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.580
 laid route especially this 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.840
 true if you go through the forest in winter 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.819
 just go this route and 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.550
 get to the place as quickly as possible 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.240
 and comfortable 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:19.030
 The following rule charge all gadgets 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.750
 in advance if the battery performer is up to 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.280
 if a 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.540
 be sure to take with you 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.830
 extra batteries for 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.280
 cameras 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.380
 since today the frost is -34 degrees and 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.630
 batteries will be discharged 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.860
 very quickly more accurately will not be very 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.750
 quickly lose capacity always 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.270
 Batteries need to be kept inside 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.160
 a pocket in a cup in one pocket shoved 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.130
 batteries in the second if you have 2 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.920
 came to the place of shooting insert 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.940
 battery camera and produce 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.930
 series of shots 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.820
 if you move to another location 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.040
 again pulled the battery stuck it 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.530
 in the inside pocket so he warmed up 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.410
 this way my 35 capacity will return 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.980
 and here is the meter it will last longer you can 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.530
 make no more frames and 5 what we still 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.320
 wish 7 so speak family and friends 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.940
 where are you going to friends why do I need these like 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.300
 how long will it take you with 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.330
 very committed to the situation someone calls 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.709
 just in case as they say on 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.840
 sin and rake shoot better 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.730
 err and be sure to say 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.500
 where are you going approximately 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.370
 at least in which square and where to find you 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.720
 and after what time you approximately 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.330
 plan to go back that is 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.370
 if you did not call back here like this 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.590
 Now the connection is bad enough and 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.290
 call in principle will be enough 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:42.130
 problematic what else would like 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.110
 say on the way to the location location if 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.720
 you push too far always 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.510
 look first refueling 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.850
 look at the tank of your car then 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.950
 Do you have enough gas in advance? 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.080
 think over and see some workarounds 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.510
 ways if you are very cold 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:02.290
 any hotel or cafe where you can 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:09.310
 will call in here to bask in it 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:11.470
 I think this is all up to be sure to take 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.380
 something hot either 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.359
 drinks tea coffee or hot food if 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.090
 there is such an opportunity, there are terms and 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.019
 specially for eating with wide water for free 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.360
 bags 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.300
 hot food on you first warm and 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.810
 when it is very cold and more 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:31.150
 give strength and raise old men 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.280
 but on this i think this part of the video 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.430
 ends if not too 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:39.069
 strong wind i think we are already on the lake 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.979
 take another video and show you 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:45.479
 what kind of places are there plots and yet 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.479
 some may be let 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.020
 34 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.960
 Mounted all sorts of course
