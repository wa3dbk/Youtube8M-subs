00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
majority of the spirits so the first

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.030 
majority of the spirits so the first
phase<00:01:00.640> of<00:01:00.670> the<00:01:00.850> fight<00:01:01.000> is<00:01:01.210> just<00:01:01.239> like<00:01:01.540> normal

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
so you can see here he's doing the dead

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.109 
so you can see here he's doing the dead
zones<00:01:04.839> and<00:01:05.140> pulling<00:01:05.560> him<00:01:05.649> out<00:01:05.909> dpsing<00:01:06.909> him

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
zones and pulling him out dpsing him

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.719 
zones and pulling him out dpsing him
down<00:01:07.299> and<00:01:07.829> we<00:01:08.829> tried<00:01:09.009> a<00:01:09.040> few<00:01:09.189> different<00:01:09.250> method

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
down and we tried a few different method

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.389 
down and we tried a few different method
methods<00:01:10.210> but<00:01:10.479> what<00:01:11.229> we<00:01:11.350> found<00:01:11.530> worked<00:01:12.070> best

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
methods but what we found worked best

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:14.940 
methods but what we found worked best
was<00:01:13.090> to<00:01:14.020> pull<00:01:14.200> him<00:01:14.320> to<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:14.439> back<00:01:14.680> of<00:01:14.710> his

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
was to pull him to the back of his

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.550 
was to pull him to the back of his
platform<00:01:15.219> here<00:01:15.670> and<00:01:15.850> once<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:17.170> phase

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
platform here and once the phase

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.350 
platform here and once the phase
transitions<00:01:18.280> are<00:01:18.460> a<00:01:18.490> little<00:01:18.610> bit<00:01:18.790> before<00:01:18.909> we

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
transitions are a little bit before we

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.160 
transitions are a little bit before we
have<00:01:19.540> our<00:01:20.310> shaman<00:01:21.310> healer<00:01:21.670> actually<00:01:22.510> run<00:01:22.900> down

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
have our shaman healer actually run down

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.980 
have our shaman healer actually run down
to<00:01:23.610> if<00:01:24.610> you<00:01:24.700> look<00:01:24.820> on<00:01:24.940> my<00:01:25.030> mini<00:01:25.180> map<00:01:25.390> it's<00:01:25.780> kind

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
to if you look on my mini map it's kind

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.859 
to if you look on my mini map it's kind
of<00:01:26.110> south<00:01:26.440> west<00:01:27.280> and<00:01:27.580> he's<00:01:28.330> sort<00:01:28.540> of<00:01:28.600> on<00:01:28.720> that

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
of south west and he's sort of on that

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.910 
of south west and he's sort of on that
bridge<00:01:29.670> when<00:01:30.670> you<00:01:30.820> enter<00:01:31.090> this<00:01:31.210> area<00:01:31.440> and<00:01:32.440> he

bridge when you enter this area and he
goes<00:01:33.070> there<00:01:33.250> before<00:01:33.670> this<00:01:33.820> phase<00:01:34.060> starts

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
goes there before this phase starts

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.240 
goes there before this phase starts
because<00:01:34.869> this<00:01:35.110> twisted<00:01:35.530> spirits<00:01:35.830> don't<00:01:36.040> spawn

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
because this twisted spirits don't spawn

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.810 
because this twisted spirits don't spawn
and<00:01:36.460> tell<00:01:36.580> him<00:01:36.700> that<00:01:36.729> right<00:01:37.210> now<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:38.590> then<00:01:38.820> once

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
and tell him that right now so then once

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.940 
and tell him that right now so then once
the<00:01:40.060> spirits<00:01:40.390> spawn<00:01:40.690> you<00:01:41.200> can<00:01:41.320> see<00:01:41.470> I<00:01:41.500> drop

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
the spirits spawn you can see I drop

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.820 
the spirits spawn you can see I drop

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
down and blow my tank cooldowns so I can

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.560 
down and blow my tank cooldowns so I can
soak<00:01:45.010> some<00:01:45.159> of<00:01:45.280> the<00:01:45.340> damage<00:01:45.490> and<00:01:45.820> agro<00:01:46.240> just<00:01:46.450> a

soak some of the damage and agro just a
pack<00:01:47.260> of<00:01:47.470> them<00:01:47.560> and<00:01:47.619> then<00:01:48.580> our<00:01:48.670> shaman<00:01:49.030> who's

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
standing on the bridge here that I'm

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.530 
standing on the bridge here that I'm
just<00:01:50.470> crossing<00:01:50.670> he's<00:01:51.670> going<00:01:51.850> to<00:01:51.909> heal<00:01:52.150> me<00:01:52.330> and

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
just crossing he's going to heal me and

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.190 
just crossing he's going to heal me and
get<00:01:53.530> heal<00:01:53.830> a<00:01:53.860> girl<00:01:54.159> on<00:01:54.250> them<00:01:54.430> and<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:56.020> is

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
get heal a girl on them and this is

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.480 
get heal a girl on them and this is
really<00:01:56.350> the<00:01:56.560> key<00:01:56.590> that<00:01:56.950> we<00:01:57.040> found<00:01:57.220> is<00:01:57.460> that

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
really the key that we found is that

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.570 
really the key that we found is that
because<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.270> spirits<00:01:58.750> have<00:01:58.810> so<00:01:59.409> low<00:02:00.220> health

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
because the spirits have so low health

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.600 
because the spirits have so low health
they<00:02:01.090> have<00:02:01.180> 29,000<00:02:01.900> health<00:02:02.610> any

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
they have 29,000 health any

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.100 
they have 29,000 health any
miscellaneous<00:02:04.299> damage<00:02:04.600> can<00:02:04.869> pretty<00:02:05.020> much

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
miscellaneous damage can pretty much

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.350 
miscellaneous damage can pretty much
kill<00:02:05.439> them<00:02:05.590> very<00:02:06.070> quickly<00:02:06.159> and<00:02:06.520> obviously<00:02:07.180> you

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
kill them very quickly and obviously you

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.929 
kill them very quickly and obviously you
want<00:02:07.570> to<00:02:07.950> keep<00:02:08.950> them<00:02:09.099> alive<00:02:09.220> but<00:02:09.579> you<00:02:09.670> need<00:02:09.819> to

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:09.939 
want to keep them alive but you need to

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:11.699 
want to keep them alive but you need to
keep<00:02:10.269> thread<00:02:10.569> on<00:02:10.659> them<00:02:10.810> somehow<00:02:11.049> while<00:02:11.560> you're

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
keep thread on them somehow while you're

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.119 
keep thread on them somehow while you're
running<00:02:11.890> around<00:02:12.099> gathering<00:02:12.640> them<00:02:12.840> so<00:02:14.040> like<00:02:15.040> I

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
running around gathering them so like I

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.369 
running around gathering them so like I
said<00:02:15.189> what<00:02:15.400> we<00:02:15.489> did<00:02:15.640> is<00:02:15.810> decided<00:02:16.810> to<00:02:17.049> have<00:02:17.349> our

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
said what we did is decided to have our

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.740 
said what we did is decided to have our
shaman<00:02:17.829> run<00:02:18.040> out<00:02:18.159> before<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:19.150> second<00:02:19.599> phase

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
shaman run out before the second phase

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.949 
shaman run out before the second phase
starts<00:02:20.049> and<00:02:20.470> then<00:02:21.480> without<00:02:22.480> doing<00:02:22.660> damage<00:02:22.780> to

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
starts and then without doing damage to

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.660 
starts and then without doing damage to
them<00:02:23.200> I<00:02:23.319> picked<00:02:23.530> them<00:02:23.680> up<00:02:23.770> and<00:02:23.980> blow<00:02:24.099> my<00:02:24.280> tank

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
them I picked them up and blow my tank

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.800 
them I picked them up and blow my tank
cooldowns<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:25.390> then<00:02:25.870> he<00:02:26.080> will<00:02:26.200> heal<00:02:26.470> them

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
cooldowns and then he will heal them

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.470 
cooldowns and then he will heal them
and<00:02:27.110> get<00:02:27.290> healed<00:02:27.530> threat<00:02:27.970> so<00:02:28.970> now<00:02:29.090> our<00:02:29.120> shaman

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
and get healed threat so now our shaman

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.390 
and get healed threat so now our shaman
has<00:02:29.599> most<00:02:29.900> of<00:02:30.080> these<00:02:30.200> a<00:02:30.530> groat<00:02:30.860> I'm<00:02:31.010> picking<00:02:31.310> up

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
has most of these a groat I'm picking up

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.070 
has most of these a groat I'm picking up
a<00:02:31.520> few<00:02:31.730> more<00:02:31.940> because<00:02:32.360> I<00:02:32.390> just<00:02:32.540> want<00:02:32.989> to<00:02:33.020> make

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
a few more because I just want to make

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.860 
a few more because I just want to make
sure<00:02:33.170> we<00:02:33.440> have<00:02:33.530> 20<00:02:33.830> and<00:02:34.360> you<00:02:35.360> can<00:02:35.480> see<00:02:35.660> here

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
sure we have 20 and you can see here

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.890 
sure we have 20 and you can see here
there's<00:02:36.110> quite<00:02:36.709> a<00:02:36.739> few<00:02:37.150> these<00:02:38.150> hit<00:02:38.540> really

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
there's quite a few these hit really

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.930 
there's quite a few these hit really
hard<00:02:39.050> because<00:02:39.560> its<00:02:39.830> shadow<00:02:40.010> base<00:02:40.220> damage<00:02:40.430> so

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
hard because its shadow base damage so

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.089 
hard because its shadow base damage so
it<00:02:41.480> doesn't<00:02:41.810> actually<00:02:42.290> benefit<00:02:42.890> you<00:02:42.980> if

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
it doesn't actually benefit you if

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.410 
it doesn't actually benefit you if
you're<00:02:43.220> a<00:02:43.250> tank<00:02:43.550> since<00:02:44.390> it's<00:02:44.630> not<00:02:44.810> physical<00:02:46.420> so

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
you're a tank since it's not physical so

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.330 
you're a tank since it's not physical so
you<00:02:47.480> just<00:02:47.569> need<00:02:47.630> to<00:02:47.780> be<00:02:47.870> careful<00:02:48.069> like<00:02:49.069> you<00:02:49.190> can

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
you just need to be careful like you can

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.949 
you just need to be careful like you can
see<00:02:49.519> that<00:02:49.730> I'm<00:02:49.819> stayed<00:02:50.180> in<00:02:50.300> cat<00:02:50.480> form<00:02:50.510> for<00:02:50.870> the

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
see that I'm stayed in cat form for the

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.370 
see that I'm stayed in cat form for the
speed<00:02:51.170> boost<00:02:51.410> that<00:02:51.769> helps<00:02:52.010> a<00:02:52.069> lot<00:02:52.239> but

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
speed boost that helps a lot but

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.259 
speed boost that helps a lot but
essentially<00:02:54.790> you<00:02:55.790> just<00:02:55.940> want<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.090> make<00:02:56.209> sure

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
essentially you just want to make sure

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:57.880 
essentially you just want to make sure
you<00:02:56.540> can<00:02:56.690> gather<00:02:56.870> up<00:02:57.080> enough<00:02:57.170> of<00:02:57.530> them<00:02:57.680> and

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
you can gather up enough of them and

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.170 
you can gather up enough of them and
then<00:02:58.670> get<00:02:58.940> them<00:02:59.090> focused<00:02:59.330> on<00:02:59.750> one<00:03:00.019> person<00:03:00.500> and

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
then get them focused on one person and

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.820 
then get them focused on one person and
again<00:03:02.180> we<00:03:02.330> found<00:03:02.600> that<00:03:02.840> just<00:03:03.410> because<00:03:03.650> of<00:03:03.769> the

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
again we found that just because of the

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.910 
again we found that just because of the
low<00:03:03.950> health<00:03:04.220> it<00:03:04.459> was<00:03:04.580> too<00:03:04.730> difficult<00:03:04.850> for<00:03:05.920> DPS

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
low health it was too difficult for DPS

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.440 
low health it was too difficult for DPS
to<00:03:07.190> keep<00:03:07.430> thread<00:03:07.730> on<00:03:07.819> them<00:03:07.940> without<00:03:08.150> doing

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
to keep thread on them without doing

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.020 
to keep thread on them without doing
damage<00:03:08.600> so<00:03:09.350> we<00:03:10.100> had<00:03:10.220> our<00:03:10.370> healer<00:03:10.549> do<00:03:10.760> it<00:03:10.850> here

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
damage so we had our healer do it here

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.530 
damage so we had our healer do it here
and<00:03:12.220> so<00:03:13.220> yeah<00:03:13.880> you<00:03:13.940> can<00:03:14.120> kind<00:03:14.269> of<00:03:14.299> see<00:03:14.420> the

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
and so yeah you can kind of see the

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.470 
and so yeah you can kind of see the
basic<00:03:14.900> idea<00:03:15.230> this<00:03:16.069> was<00:03:16.250> not<00:03:16.430> perfect<00:03:17.330> by<00:03:17.450> any

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
basic idea this was not perfect by any

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.620 
basic idea this was not perfect by any
means<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:19.370> we<00:03:19.519> had<00:03:19.640> a<00:03:19.670> few<00:03:19.880> people<00:03:20.150> die<00:03:20.299> but

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
means and we had a few people die but

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.600 
means and we had a few people die but
another<00:03:21.200> key<00:03:21.500> thing<00:03:21.530> to<00:03:21.980> remember<00:03:22.130> about<00:03:22.400> this

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
another key thing to remember about this

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.059 
another key thing to remember about this
achievement<00:03:22.880> is<00:03:23.150> it<00:03:24.140> does<00:03:24.319> not<00:03:24.440> require<00:03:24.620> that

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
achievement is it does not require that

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.339 
achievement is it does not require that
you<00:03:25.160> defeat<00:03:25.489> you<00:03:25.670> know<00:03:25.910> to<00:03:26.599> get<00:03:26.750> it<00:03:26.870> you<00:03:27.170> only

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
you defeat you know to get it you only

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:29.380 
you defeat you know to get it you only
have<00:03:27.590> to<00:03:27.620> defeat<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.160> 20<00:03:28.430> spirits<00:03:28.880> in<00:03:29.030> 15

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
have to defeat the 20 spirits in 15

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.970 
have to defeat the 20 spirits in 15
seconds<00:03:29.950> so<00:03:31.420> even<00:03:32.420> if<00:03:32.540> you<00:03:32.829> get<00:03:33.829> the

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
seconds so even if you get the

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.500 
seconds so even if you get the
achievement<00:03:34.070> and<00:03:34.549> don't<00:03:35.030> have<00:03:35.150> any<00:03:35.209> way<00:03:35.420> to

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
achievement and don't have any way to

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.330 
achievement and don't have any way to
actually<00:03:35.720> defeat<00:03:36.200> Jindo<00:03:36.590> on<00:03:36.709> that<00:03:36.829> attempt<00:03:37.250> it

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
actually defeat Jindo on that attempt it

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.849 
actually defeat Jindo on that attempt it
doesn't<00:03:37.609> matter<00:03:37.959> so<00:03:38.959> our<00:03:38.989> plan<00:03:39.410> was<00:03:39.560> just<00:03:39.739> to

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
doesn't matter so our plan was just to

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:41.800 
doesn't matter so our plan was just to
focus<00:03:40.640> on<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:40.910> achievement<00:03:41.329> and<00:03:41.420> then<00:03:41.540> die

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
focus on the achievement and then die

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.069 
focus on the achievement and then die
and<00:03:42.079> come<00:03:42.410> back<00:03:42.470> for<00:03:42.799> the<00:03:42.920> actual<00:03:43.190> fight<00:03:44.079> you

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
and come back for the actual fight you

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:46.780 
and come back for the actual fight you
can<00:03:45.230> also<00:03:45.440> if<00:03:45.769> you<00:03:45.890> happen<00:03:46.160> to<00:03:46.250> die<00:03:46.459> on

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
can also if you happen to die on

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.090 
can also if you happen to die on
accident<00:03:47.329> doing<00:03:47.600> this<00:03:47.750> which<00:03:48.260> is<00:03:48.590> pretty<00:03:48.859> easy

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
accident doing this which is pretty easy

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.750 
accident doing this which is pretty easy
if<00:03:49.430> you<00:03:49.760> accidentally<00:03:50.239> get<00:03:50.359> aggro<00:03:50.660> is<00:03:51.519> just<00:03:52.519> to

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
if you accidentally get aggro is just to

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.120 
if you accidentally get aggro is just to
run<00:03:53.090> back<00:03:53.269> in<00:03:53.450> the<00:03:53.540> zone<00:03:53.690> you<00:03:54.470> can<00:03:54.500> come<00:03:55.010> back

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
run back in the zone you can come back

limit the last tip I should mention is

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.550 
limit the last tip I should mention is
that<00:04:03.940> you<00:04:04.940> probably<00:04:05.510> don't<00:04:05.930> want<00:04:06.139> to<00:04:06.200> go<00:04:06.500> to

that you probably don't want to go to

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.599 
that you probably don't want to go to
the<00:04:06.980> back<00:04:07.190> side<00:04:07.489> of<00:04:07.549> this<00:04:07.790> this<00:04:09.370> river<00:04:10.370> area

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
the back side of this this river area

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:12.699 
the back side of this this river area
like<00:04:11.090> we<00:04:11.269> are<00:04:11.389> doing<00:04:11.480> here<00:04:11.600> because<00:04:12.470> soon<00:04:12.590> as

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
like we are doing here because soon as

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.559 
like we are doing here because soon as
you<00:04:12.829> get<00:04:12.950> into<00:04:13.220> a<00:04:13.459> certain<00:04:13.790> distance<00:04:14.269> from

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
you get into a certain distance from

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.199 
you get into a certain distance from
Jindo<00:04:15.170> up<00:04:15.530> on<00:04:15.739> his<00:04:15.829> platform<00:04:16.090> he<00:04:17.090> will

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
Jindo up on his platform he will

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.270 
Jindo up on his platform he will
actually<00:04:17.570> it<00:04:17.930> will<00:04:18.019> actually<00:04:18.200> trigger<00:04:18.590> his

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
actually it will actually trigger his

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.520 
actually it will actually trigger his
normal<00:04:19.970> phase<00:04:20.150> two<00:04:20.450> abilities<00:04:20.750> which<00:04:21.289> means

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
normal phase two abilities which means

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.560 
normal phase two abilities which means
he'll<00:04:21.709> start<00:04:21.950> casting<00:04:22.160> the<00:04:22.550> shadow<00:04:23.330> bolt

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
he'll start casting the shadow bolt

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.830 
he'll start casting the shadow bolt
volley<00:04:24.320> which<00:04:25.100> does<00:04:25.370> the<00:04:25.580> small<00:04:26.120> AE<00:04:26.360> under

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
volley which does the small AE under

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.529 
volley which does the small AE under
random<00:04:27.110> player<00:04:27.320> and<00:04:27.970> that's<00:04:28.970> really<00:04:29.389> really

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539 
random player and that's really really

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:32.140 
random player and that's really really
dangerous<00:04:29.750> and<00:04:30.229> it<00:04:31.160> can<00:04:31.340> hit<00:04:31.490> you<00:04:31.669> pretty<00:04:32.000> much

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
dangerous and it can hit you pretty much

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.150 
dangerous and it can hit you pretty much
anywhere<00:04:32.600> so<00:04:33.080> once<00:04:33.380> you<00:04:33.470> trigger<00:04:33.770> that<00:04:33.950> then

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
anywhere so once you trigger that then

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.500 
anywhere so once you trigger that then
he'll<00:04:34.310> start<00:04:34.460> spamming<00:04:34.820> the<00:04:35.030> group<00:04:35.180> with<00:04:35.330> that

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
he'll start spamming the group with that

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.779 
he'll start spamming the group with that
but<00:04:36.260> it<00:04:36.349> appears<00:04:36.860> I<00:04:37.220> can't<00:04:37.430> say<00:04:37.550> for<00:04:37.610> certain

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789 
but it appears I can't say for certain

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:40.120 
but it appears I can't say for certain
but<00:04:38.060> it<00:04:38.270> seemed<00:04:38.720> to<00:04:38.930> us<00:04:38.960> that<00:04:39.110> if<00:04:39.800> you<00:04:39.979> don't

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
but it seemed to us that if you don't

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.900 
but it seemed to us that if you don't
actually<00:04:40.340> come

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
actually come

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.570 
actually come
this<00:04:41.060> backside<00:04:41.720> of<00:04:41.780> the<00:04:42.020> area<00:04:42.410> he<00:04:43.400> won't

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
this backside of the area he won't

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.670 
this backside of the area he won't
trigger<00:04:43.790> so<00:04:44.300> ideally<00:04:45.200> what<00:04:45.440> we<00:04:45.500> should<00:04:45.650> have

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
trigger so ideally what we should have

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.910 
trigger so ideally what we should have
done<00:04:45.770> is<00:04:46.040> kept<00:04:46.900> cutting<00:04:47.900> around<00:04:48.140> the<00:04:48.410> front<00:04:48.680> of

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
done is kept cutting around the front of

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.460 
done is kept cutting around the front of
the<00:04:49.310> sort<00:04:50.240> of<00:04:50.300> temple<00:04:50.600> area<00:04:50.870> where<00:04:51.350> we

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
the sort of temple area where we

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:52.840 
the sort of temple area where we
originally<00:04:51.740> started<00:04:51.890> by<00:04:52.190> the<00:04:52.250> bridges<00:04:52.520> and

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
originally started by the bridges and

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.720 
originally started by the bridges and
you<00:04:53.690> could<00:04:53.840> just<00:04:53.990> sort<00:04:54.110> of<00:04:54.170> kite<00:04:54.460> down<00:04:55.460> through

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
you could just sort of kite down through

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.030 
you could just sort of kite down through
that<00:04:55.850> water<00:04:56.120> on<00:04:56.420> the<00:04:56.540> west<00:04:56.750> and<00:04:57.080> then<00:04:57.500> go<00:04:57.770> up<00:04:57.890> on

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
that water on the west and then go up on

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.730 
that water on the west and then go up on
the<00:04:58.130> land<00:04:59.020> near<00:05:00.020> the<00:05:00.050> entrance<00:05:00.350> of<00:05:00.470> the<00:05:00.560> temple

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
the land near the entrance of the temple

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.560 
the land near the entrance of the temple
and<00:05:01.070> then<00:05:01.430> back<00:05:01.610> through<00:05:01.640> the<00:05:02.090> water<00:05:02.300> just

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
and then back through the water just

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.620 
and then back through the water just
keep<00:05:02.780> going<00:05:02.960> in<00:05:03.050> a<00:05:03.110> circle<00:05:03.320> like<00:05:03.590> that<00:05:03.830> but<00:05:04.630> you

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
keep going in a circle like that but you

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.380 
keep going in a circle like that but you
know<00:05:05.750> this<00:05:05.930> was<00:05:06.140> pretty<00:05:06.320> much<00:05:06.500> our<00:05:07.090> first<00:05:08.090> try

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
know this was pretty much our first try

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:09.790 
know this was pretty much our first try
and<00:05:08.630> we<00:05:08.750> didn't<00:05:08.930> really<00:05:09.110> feel<00:05:09.260> like<00:05:09.320> resetting

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
and we didn't really feel like resetting

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.820 
and we didn't really feel like resetting
it<00:05:09.980> so<00:05:10.480> this<00:05:11.480> goes<00:05:11.720> on<00:05:11.810> a<00:05:11.870> lot<00:05:12.020> longer<00:05:12.080> than<00:05:12.470> it

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
it so this goes on a lot longer than it

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.350 
it so this goes on a lot longer than it
would<00:05:13.040> need<00:05:13.280> to<00:05:13.310> if<00:05:13.610> you<00:05:13.700> had<00:05:13.820> a<00:05:13.850> better<00:05:14.060> plan

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
would need to if you had a better plan

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.100 
would need to if you had a better plan
and<00:05:16.000> but<00:05:17.000> this<00:05:17.150> is<00:05:17.240> the<00:05:17.360> basic<00:05:17.540> idea<00:05:17.930> we're

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
and but this is the basic idea we're

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.600 
and but this is the basic idea we're
just<00:05:18.260> kind<00:05:18.410> of<00:05:18.470> running<00:05:18.740> around<00:05:18.830> buying<00:05:19.220> time

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
just kind of running around buying time

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.970 
just kind of running around buying time
to<00:05:19.940> get<00:05:20.240> them<00:05:20.420> more<00:05:20.780> bunched<00:05:21.080> up<00:05:21.200> because<00:05:21.830> we

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:21.980 
to get them more bunched up because we

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:27.610 
to get them more bunched up because we
don't<00:05:22.130> want<00:05:22.310> to<00:05:22.840> have<00:05:23.840> to<00:05:24.730> do<00:05:25.730> this<00:05:25.760> over<00:05:26.150> so<00:05:27.020> i

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
don't want to have to do this over so i

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.050 
don't want to have to do this over so i
skipped<00:05:28.010> toward<00:05:28.280> in<00:05:28.370> time<00:05:28.550> here<00:05:28.820> actually

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
skipped toward in time here actually

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.980 
skipped toward in time here actually
died<00:05:29.870> at<00:05:30.080> some<00:05:30.290> point<00:05:30.530> and<00:05:31.630> so<00:05:32.630> i'm<00:05:32.690> coming

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
died at some point and so i'm coming

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.810 
died at some point and so i'm coming
back<00:05:33.110> to<00:05:33.320> the<00:05:33.410> group<00:05:33.560> but<00:05:34.520> you<00:05:34.580> can<00:05:34.670> see

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
back to the group but you can see

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.160 
back to the group but you can see
everyone's<00:05:35.240> pretty<00:05:35.420> much<00:05:35.540> gathered<00:05:35.870> up<00:05:35.990> now

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.170 
everyone's pretty much gathered up now

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:40.120 
everyone's pretty much gathered up now
and<00:05:36.880> we<00:05:37.880> have<00:05:38.120> well<00:05:39.020> over<00:05:39.050> 20<00:05:39.590> that<00:05:39.830> we<00:05:39.920> need

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
and we have well over 20 that we need

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.130 
and we have well over 20 that we need
and<00:05:40.370> they're<00:05:41.060> all<00:05:41.150> pretty<00:05:41.330> bunched<00:05:41.690> up<00:05:41.780> so

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
and they're all pretty bunched up so

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.700 
and they're all pretty bunched up so
we're<00:05:42.500> going<00:05:42.680> to<00:05:42.980> finally<00:05:43.550> call<00:05:43.700> for<00:05:43.970> DPS<00:05:44.300> and

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
we're going to finally call for DPS and

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.420 
we're going to finally call for DPS and
again<00:05:45.710> since<00:05:45.950> they<00:05:46.010> only<00:05:46.130> have<00:05:46.280> thirty

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
again since they only have thirty
