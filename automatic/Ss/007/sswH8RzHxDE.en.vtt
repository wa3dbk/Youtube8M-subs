E<00:02:42.640> string<00:02:43.930> okay<00:02:44.930> so

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.650 

and<00:02:56.440> then<00:02:56.740> last<00:02:57.370> little<00:02:57.640> bit<00:02:57.850> and<00:02:58.570> you're

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
and then last little bit and you're

gonna go cut the nail stuff a little bit

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:10.830 
gonna go cut the nail stuff a little bit
like<00:03:04.120> you're<00:03:04.270> not<00:03:04.360> sort<00:03:04.600> of<00:03:04.630> rhythm<00:03:04.840> so<00:03:09.840> so

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
like you're not sort of rhythm so so

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.570 
like you're not sort of rhythm so so
there<00:03:11.020> you<00:03:11.110> go

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
there you go

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.700 
there you go
so<00:03:12.580> that's<00:03:12.820> so<00:03:13.000> look<00:03:13.270> at<00:03:13.390> last<00:03:14.110> three<00:03:14.320> notes<00:03:14.470> by

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
so that's so look at last three notes by

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:15.780 
so that's so look at last three notes by
the<00:03:14.740> way<00:03:14.920> if<00:03:15.010> I<00:03:15.100> didn't<00:03:15.280> say<00:03:15.400> them<00:03:15.610> there<00:03:15.730> were

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
the way if I didn't say them there were

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.900 
the way if I didn't say them there were
ten<00:03:16.000> ten<00:03:16.410> twice<00:03:17.410> on<00:03:17.770> the<00:03:18.100> a<00:03:18.130> string<00:03:18.610> to<00:03:18.880> a

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
ten ten twice on the a string to a

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.850 
ten ten twice on the a string to a
twelve<00:03:19.240> on<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.510> E<00:03:19.750> and<00:03:22.200> then<00:03:23.200> after<00:03:23.500> that<00:03:23.650> we

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
twelve on the E and then after that we

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.170 
twelve on the E and then after that we
gave<00:03:24.010> that<00:03:24.040> little<00:03:24.340> section<00:03:24.550> which<00:03:24.970> is<00:03:25.150> a

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
gave that little section which is a

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:33.180 
gave that little section which is a
little<00:03:26.170> turnaround<00:03:26.500> wasn't<00:03:31.830> sure<00:03:32.830> that's<00:03:33.040> in

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
little turnaround wasn't sure that's in

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.500 
little turnaround wasn't sure that's in
another<00:03:33.280> video<00:03:33.670> that<00:03:33.820> I<00:03:33.880> did<00:03:33.970> in<00:03:34.240> the<00:03:34.360> past

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
another video that I did in the past

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.030 
another video that I did in the past

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
because that turn around there's

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.880 
because that turn around there's
multiple<00:03:36.520> times<00:03:36.760> in<00:03:36.940> this<00:03:37.060> song<00:03:37.360> but<00:03:38.290> an<00:03:38.470> other
