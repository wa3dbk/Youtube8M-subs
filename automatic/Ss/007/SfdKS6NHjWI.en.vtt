00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
and check if an expression expression is

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:11.199 
and check if an expression expression is
true<00:02:05.119> you're<00:02:06.119> just<00:02:06.330> going<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.569> copy<00:02:07.229> this<00:02:07.440> and

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:17.720 

what<00:02:12.209> this<00:02:12.360> does<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.959> check<00:02:13.470> for<00:02:13.890> if<00:02:16.730> the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
what this does is check for if the

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.320 
what this does is check for if the
player<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.030> in<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.660> air<00:02:19.640> is<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.849> players<00:02:21.090> in

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
player is in the air is the players in

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:28.059 
player is in the air is the players in
the<00:02:21.420> air<00:02:21.590> gonna<00:02:22.590> go<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:23.480> this<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:26.540> actually

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
the air gonna go to this and actually

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.580 
the air gonna go to this and actually
first<00:02:29.420> we're<00:02:30.420> going<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.660> need<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:31.049> create<00:02:31.440> a

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
first we're going to need to create a

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.199 
first we're going to need to create a
variable<00:02:32.190> called<00:02:33.739> vir<00:02:34.849> that's<00:02:35.849> going<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.180> be

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
variable called vir that's going to be

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.300 
variable called vir that's going to be
the<00:02:36.420> direction<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.859> character<00:02:38.280> is

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
the direction that the character is

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.069 
the direction that the character is
facing<00:02:39.680> one<00:02:40.680> is<00:02:41.010> going<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.250> be<00:02:41.400> right<00:02:41.609> and

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.079 
facing one is going to be right and

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:46.449 
facing one is going to be right and
there's<00:02:43.079> going<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.440> be<00:02:43.470> less<00:02:43.940> so<00:02:44.940> in<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:46.019> left

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
there's going to be less so in the left

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:53.990 
there's going to be less so in the left
we're<00:02:47.459> going<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.730> set<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:50.780> here<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:52.819> in<00:02:53.819> the

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
we're going to set it to here and in the

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.840 
we're going to set it to here and in the
right<00:02:54.150> we're<00:02:54.660> going<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:54.930> set<00:02:55.109> it<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:56.480> one

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
right we're going to set it to one

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.220 
right we're going to set it to one
that's<00:02:59.850> just<00:02:59.970> gonna<00:03:00.299> let<00:03:00.540> us<00:03:00.690> handle<00:03:00.870> works

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
that's just gonna let us handle works

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.199 
that's just gonna let us handle works
great<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:01.709> change<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.450> so<00:03:03.450> depending<00:03:04.079> on<00:03:04.260> the

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
great to change it so depending on the

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.720 
great to change it so depending on the
state<00:03:06.209> of<00:03:06.239> that<00:03:06.540> variable<00:03:07.130> that<00:03:08.130> will<00:03:08.280> control

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
state of that variable that will control

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.170 
state of that variable that will control
the<00:03:09.170> sprightly<00:03:10.170> show<00:03:10.350> whether<00:03:10.590> we're<00:03:10.829> going

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
the sprightly show whether we're going

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.800 
the sprightly show whether we're going
left<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.239> right<00:03:12.299> yeah<00:03:13.400> so<00:03:14.400> now<00:03:16.220> we're<00:03:17.220> going<00:03:17.340> to

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
left to right yeah so now we're going to

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.700 
left to right yeah so now we're going to
check<00:03:18.810> it

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
check it

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.250 
check it
yeah<00:03:20.400> equal<00:03:21.360> to<00:03:21.540> 0<00:03:21.840> if<00:03:22.740> it<00:03:22.980> is<00:03:23.130> then<00:03:24.080> change<00:03:25.080> the

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
yeah equal to 0 if it is then change the

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:34.660 
yeah equal to 0 if it is then change the
sprite<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:26.400> our<00:03:27.680> jumping<00:03:28.680> left<00:03:30.020> and

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.990 

is<00:03:35.599> example<00:03:36.140> 21<00:03:37.900> then<00:03:39.700> change<00:03:40.700> it<00:03:40.819> you're

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
is example 21 then change it you're

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.530 
is example 21 then change it you're
nothing<00:03:41.420> right<00:03:43.569> so<00:03:44.569> um<00:03:45.849> knowing<00:03:46.849> that<00:03:47.270> I<00:03:47.360> do

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
nothing right so um knowing that I do

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.830 
nothing right so um knowing that I do
this<00:03:48.099> left<00:03:49.150> and<00:03:51.250> change<00:03:52.250> it<00:03:52.630> you're<00:03:53.630> going<00:03:53.780> to

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
this left and change it you're going to

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.229 
this left and change it you're going to
make<00:03:53.930> the<00:03:54.170> sub<00:03:54.590> image<00:03:55.569> image<00:03:56.680> index<00:03:58.239> that's

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
make the sub image image index that's

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.840 
make the sub image image index that's
going<00:03:59.510> to<00:03:59.569> make<00:03:59.660> it<00:03:59.900> so<00:04:00.140> that<00:04:00.610> it<00:04:01.610> actually

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
going to make it so that it actually

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.759 
going to make it so that it actually
runs<00:04:02.330> through<00:04:02.630> the<00:04:02.750> Flint<00:04:03.019> the<00:04:03.560> screens<00:04:04.420> and

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
runs through the Flint the screens and

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:11.320 
runs through the Flint the screens and
not<00:04:06.769> just<00:04:08.140> stop<00:04:09.140> it<00:04:09.410> one<00:04:09.980> frame<00:04:10.280> and<00:04:10.640> this

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
not just stop it one frame and this

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.199 
not just stop it one frame and this
you're<00:04:11.780> going<00:04:11.930> to<00:04:11.989> lower<00:04:12.170> the<00:04:12.410> speed<00:04:12.650> to<00:04:12.980> 0.5<00:04:13.850> I

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
you're going to lower the speed to 0.5 I

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.330 
you're going to lower the speed to 0.5 I
think<00:04:14.840> it<00:04:14.930> just<00:04:15.049> makes<00:04:15.290> it<00:04:15.530> a<00:04:15.739> nice<00:04:15.950> and<00:04:16.190> look

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
think it just makes it a nice and look

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.259 
think it just makes it a nice and look
and<00:04:16.639> you're<00:04:17.419> going<00:04:17.570> to<00:04:17.630> choose<00:04:17.870> your<00:04:18.109> um

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
and you're going to choose your um

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.960 
and you're going to choose your um
running<00:04:20.269> left<00:04:20.570> right<00:04:22.660> and<00:04:24.550> you're<00:04:25.550> also<00:04:25.639> going

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
running left right and you're also going

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.680 
running left right and you're also going
to<00:04:26.060> check<00:04:26.860> if<00:04:27.860> you're<00:04:28.610> on<00:04:28.729> the<00:04:28.760> ground<00:04:29.060> cuz<00:04:29.450> you

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
to check if you're on the ground cuz you

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.440 
to check if you're on the ground cuz you
can't<00:04:29.930> really<00:04:30.080> run<00:04:30.350> in<00:04:30.530> the<00:04:30.650> air<00:04:31.000> so<00:04:34.450> you're

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
can't really run in the air so you're

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:40.140 
can't really run in the air so you're
going<00:04:35.600> to<00:04:35.690> do<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.410> same<00:04:36.680> thing<00:04:36.979> you<00:04:37.940> did<00:04:38.120> in

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
going to do the same thing you did in

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.219 
going to do the same thing you did in
the<00:04:41.150> other<00:04:41.240> one<00:04:41.510> except<00:04:41.870> you're<00:04:42.020> going<00:04:42.169> to

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
the other one except you're going to

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.190 
the other one except you're going to
click<00:04:42.530> not<00:04:43.330> so<00:04:44.330> that's<00:04:44.539> going<00:04:44.750> to<00:04:44.810> check<00:04:45.050> if

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
click not so that's going to check if

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.820 
click not so that's going to check if
you're<00:04:45.380> on<00:04:45.470> the<00:04:45.590> ground<00:04:47.380> so<00:04:48.380> it's<00:04:48.590> going<00:04:48.740> to

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
you're on the ground so it's going to

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.330 
you're on the ground so it's going to
look<00:04:48.979> something<00:04:49.250> like<00:04:49.700> that<00:04:50.050> then<00:04:51.220> just<00:04:52.220> this

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
look something like that then just this

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.450 
look something like that then just this
plane<00:04:52.550> for<00:04:52.760> a<00:04:52.789> place<00:04:53.120> free<00:04:53.620> that's<00:04:54.620> why<00:04:54.919> I<00:04:54.950> +

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
plane for a place free that's why I +

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.779 
plane for a place free that's why I +
line<00:04:55.729> which<00:04:56.060> you<00:04:56.180> had<00:04:56.390> there<00:04:57.520> how<00:04:58.520> does<00:04:58.580> that

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:58.789 
line which you had there how does that

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:01.930 
line which you had there how does that
test<00:04:59.060> that<00:04:59.960> we're<00:05:00.650> on<00:05:00.740> the<00:05:00.770> ground<00:05:00.979> I'm<00:05:01.880> a

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
test that we're on the ground I'm a

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:08.860 
test that we're on the ground I'm a
trick<00:05:03.460> um<00:05:05.860> the<00:05:06.860> pixel<00:05:07.250> yeah<00:05:08.060> just<00:05:08.539> hit<00:05:08.690> the

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
trick um the pixel yeah just hit the

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.870 
trick um the pixel yeah just hit the
pixel<00:05:09.350> one<00:05:09.740> pixel<00:05:10.310> blow<00:05:10.610> our<00:05:11.060> character<00:05:11.690> I<00:05:12.880> has

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
pixel one pixel blow our character I has

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.290 
pixel one pixel blow our character I has
a<00:05:13.910> collision<00:05:14.600> or<00:05:14.810> not<00:05:16.810> okay<00:05:17.810> what's<00:05:18.140> that<00:05:18.380> yes

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
a collision or not okay what's that yes

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:27.540 
a collision or not okay what's that yes
so<00:05:20.300> you<00:05:20.360> can<00:05:20.870> just<00:05:21.729> copy<00:05:22.729> those<00:05:23.090> and<00:05:24.070> take

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.130 

into<00:05:28.330> there<00:05:28.510> and<00:05:28.750> make<00:05:29.260> sure<00:05:29.290> you<00:05:29.650> do<00:05:31.140> Kings

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
into there and make sure you do Kings

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:40.500 
into there and make sure you do Kings
right<00:05:32.500> to<00:05:32.800> your<00:05:32.950> running<00:05:33.340> right<00:05:34.050> and<00:05:37.530> yeah<00:05:39.510> so

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
right to your running right and yeah so

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:48.450 
right to your running right and yeah so
let's<00:05:40.720> see<00:05:40.900> if<00:05:40.960> that<00:05:41.020> works

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.200 

thank<00:05:49.460> you<00:05:49.520> guys<00:05:49.670> yep<00:05:50.600> but<00:05:50.990> he<00:05:52.000> doesn't<00:05:53.000> stop

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
thank you guys yep but he doesn't stop

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.400 
thank you guys yep but he doesn't stop
running<00:05:53.630> and<00:05:54.700> jumps<00:05:55.700> but<00:05:56.630> it<00:05:56.960> doesn't<00:05:57.260> really

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.410 
running and jumps but it doesn't really

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.720 
running and jumps but it doesn't really
matter<00:05:57.880> so<00:05:59.410> we're<00:06:00.410> going<00:06:00.500> to<00:06:00.590> fix<00:06:00.830> both<00:06:01.310> those

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:01.730 
matter so we're going to fix both those

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.100 
matter so we're going to fix both those
I'm<00:06:02.570> in<00:06:03.440> the<00:06:03.560> quizzing<00:06:04.010> with<00:06:04.160> the<00:06:04.310> floor

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
I'm in the quizzing with the floor

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.170 
I'm in the quizzing with the floor
you're<00:06:06.110> going<00:06:06.410> to<00:06:06.680> put<00:06:08.020> changes<00:06:09.020> right<00:06:09.260> to

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
you're going to put changes right to

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:16.560 
you're going to put changes right to
standing<00:06:11.180> okay<00:06:11.750> and<00:06:14.170> you're<00:06:15.170> going<00:06:15.350> to<00:06:15.410> put

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
standing okay and you're going to put

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:22.140 
standing okay and you're going to put
release<00:06:17.570> left<00:06:19.480> chains<00:06:20.480> right<00:06:20.900> to<00:06:21.260> standing

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
release left chains right to standing

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.730 
release left chains right to standing
and<00:06:23.150> you're<00:06:23.420> going<00:06:23.510> to<00:06:23.600> duplicate<00:06:23.840> that<00:06:24.200> event

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
and you're going to duplicate that event

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:33.820 
and you're going to duplicate that event
and<00:06:25.090> release<00:06:26.090> right<00:06:27.520> so<00:06:29.020> that<00:06:30.020> should<00:06:32.830> not

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
and release right so that should not

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:39.250 
and release right so that should not
panic<00:06:34.280> yeah<00:06:34.820> stop<00:06:35.270> panic<00:06:36.020> okay<00:06:36.560> we<00:06:37.490> land<00:06:38.260> we

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:39.260 
panic yeah stop panic okay we land we

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.010 
panic yeah stop panic okay we land we
get<00:06:39.410> normal<00:06:39.770> video<00:06:40.100> so<00:06:40.520> it<00:06:40.610> looks<00:06:40.790> like<00:06:41.020> we've

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020 
get normal video so it looks like we've

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.850 
get normal video so it looks like we've
got<00:06:42.050> a<00:06:42.260> real<00:06:42.500> character<00:06:42.830> that<00:06:44.860> certainly

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:45.860 
got a real character that certainly

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.460 
got a real character that certainly
energetically<00:06:46.820> running<00:06:47.180> when<00:06:47.930> he<00:06:48.020> jumps<00:06:48.350> with

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:48.470 
energetically running when he jumps with
