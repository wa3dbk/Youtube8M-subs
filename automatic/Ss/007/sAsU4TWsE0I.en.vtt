fabric<00:00:26.849> if<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.240> have<00:00:27.510> fabric<00:00:27.779> instead<00:00:28.580> once

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
fabric if you have fabric instead once

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.420 
fabric if you have fabric instead once
that<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.029> attached<00:00:30.740> that's<00:00:31.740> how<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.099> will<00:00:32.189> look

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
that is attached that's how it will look

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.030 
that is attached that's how it will look
when<00:00:32.579> it's<00:00:32.730> in<00:00:32.880> place<00:00:33.290> take<00:00:34.290> your<00:00:34.320> ribbon<00:00:34.739> and

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
when it's in place take your ribbon and

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.549 
when it's in place take your ribbon and
make<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.760> little<00:00:36.030> design<00:00:36.270> with<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.870> you<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.410> go

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
make a little design with it you can go

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.869 
make a little design with it you can go
straight<00:00:37.860> across<00:00:38.190> up<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:38.940> down<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:40.579> decided<00:00:41.579> to

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
straight across up and down I decided to

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.830 
straight across up and down I decided to
do<00:00:42.800> diagonal<00:00:44.000> but<00:00:45.000> however<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.600> want<00:00:45.780> to

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
do diagonal but however you want to

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.490 
do diagonal but however you want to
design<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.469> fine<00:00:46.710> be<00:00:47.219> creative<00:00:48.050> so<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.079> cut<00:00:49.469> a

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
design it is fine be creative so I cut a

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.560 
design it is fine be creative so I cut a
few<00:00:49.590> strips<00:00:50.129> there<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.730> now<00:00:50.910> I'm<00:00:51.180> just<00:00:51.210> going

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
few strips there and now I'm just going

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.160 
few strips there and now I'm just going
to<00:00:51.600> hot<00:00:51.840> glue<00:00:52.079> them<00:00:52.350> into<00:00:52.620> place<00:00:54.020> so<00:00:55.020> you'll

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
to hot glue them into place so you'll

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.229 
to hot glue them into place so you'll
just<00:00:55.230> want<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.980> make<00:00:56.190> sure<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.030> have

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
just want to make sure that you have

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.760 
just want to make sure that you have
them<00:00:57.390> hanging<00:00:57.750> over<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> edge<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.230> little<00:00:58.620> bit

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
them hanging over the edge a little bit

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.590 
them hanging over the edge a little bit
so<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.039> can<00:00:59.100> dab<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.609> hot<00:00:59.789> glue<00:01:00.000> on<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.510> then

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
so you can dab the hot glue on and then

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.319 
so you can dab the hot glue on and then
wrap<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:00.870> around<00:01:01.489> you<00:01:02.489> don't<00:01:02.760> want<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.030> glue<00:01:03.180> it

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
wrap it around you don't want to glue it

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.119 
wrap it around you don't want to glue it
straight<00:01:03.719> across<00:01:03.870> on<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.500> front<00:01:04.769> because

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
straight across on the front because

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.730 
straight across on the front because
then<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.460> can't<00:01:05.790> stick<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.150> hair<00:01:06.510> bow<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:06.930> so

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
then you can't stick a hair bow on it so

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.300 
then you can't stick a hair bow on it so
just<00:01:08.040> make<00:01:08.250> sure<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.549> glue<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.909> back<00:01:09.119> and

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
just make sure you glue the back and

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.770 
just make sure you glue the back and
you'll<00:01:11.310> do<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.610> same<00:01:11.640> for<00:01:11.909> each<00:01:12.360> piece<00:01:12.750> that

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
you'll do the same for each piece that

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.190 
you'll do the same for each piece that
you've<00:01:13.140> cut<00:01:13.409> out<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.210> can<00:01:15.210> do<00:01:15.390> more<00:01:15.689> than

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
you've cut out and you can do more than

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.020 
you've cut out and you can do more than
three<00:01:16.590> I'm<00:01:16.799> just<00:01:17.040> doing<00:01:17.280> three<00:01:17.430> on<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:17.790> one

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
three I'm just doing three on this one

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.789 
three I'm just doing three on this one
as<00:01:18.270> an<00:01:18.720> example<00:01:20.509> so<00:01:21.509> once<00:01:21.750> again<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.229> can<00:01:22.409> put

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
as an example so once again you can put

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.380 
as an example so once again you can put
a<00:01:22.830> little<00:01:23.070> bit<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.400> glue<00:01:23.580> on<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.759> edge<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.360> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
a little bit of glue on the edge on the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.899 
a little bit of glue on the edge on the
front<00:01:24.479> but<00:01:25.320> don't<00:01:25.680> glue<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.610> entire

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
front but don't glue it on the entire

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.880 
front but don't glue it on the entire
front<00:01:27.390> because<00:01:27.659> then<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:27.960> cannot<00:01:28.470> stick<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
front because then you cannot stick the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.880 
front because then you cannot stick the
hair<00:01:29.070> bow<00:01:29.220> on<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:30.229> how<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.290> make<00:01:31.500> sure<00:01:31.530> it's

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
hair bow on it how you make sure it's

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.039 
hair bow on it how you make sure it's
good<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.159> snug<00:01:32.490> on<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.820> back<00:01:33.290> and<00:01:35.930> repeat<00:01:36.930> the

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
good and snug on the back and repeat the

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.160 
good and snug on the back and repeat the
process<00:01:37.229> for<00:01:37.710> every<00:01:37.950> piece<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.310> ribbon<00:01:39.170> once

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
process for every piece of ribbon once

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.960 
process for every piece of ribbon once
you<00:01:40.320> have<00:01:40.500> your<00:01:40.680> first<00:01:40.890> design<00:01:41.159> done<00:01:41.640> then

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
you have your first design done then

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.999 
you have your first design done then
grab<00:01:42.240> another<00:01:43.399> coordinating<00:01:44.399> ribbon<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:46.009> add

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
grab another coordinating ribbon and add

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.340 
grab another coordinating ribbon and add
it<00:01:47.340> on<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.579> opposite<00:01:48.180> way<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.720> again<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.229> can

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
it on the opposite way so again you can

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.160 
it on the opposite way so again you can
go<00:01:49.470> up<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.860> down<00:01:49.950> or<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:51.360> can<00:01:51.390> go<00:01:51.630> diagonal

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
go up and down or you can go diagonal

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.990 
go up and down or you can go diagonal
like<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:53.310> just<00:01:53.430> kind<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.700> play<00:01:53.880> around

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
like this so just kind of play around

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.249 
like this so just kind of play around
with<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.509> see<00:01:54.600> where<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:54.990> want<00:01:55.110> your

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
with it and see where you want your

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.670 
with it and see where you want your
ribbon<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.740> be<00:01:55.890> just<00:01:56.490> make<00:01:56.729> sure<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.030> it's

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
ribbon to be just make sure that it's

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.350 
ribbon to be just make sure that it's
hanging<00:01:58.680> off<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.009> edge<00:01:59.189> so<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.790> can<00:02:00.030> wrap<00:02:00.180> it

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
hanging off the edge so you can wrap it

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.450 
hanging off the edge so you can wrap it
around<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.659> back

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.190 

and<00:02:04.550> then<00:02:05.240> I'm<00:02:05.330> just<00:02:05.450> going<00:02:05.600> to<00:02:05.690> hot<00:02:05.870> glue<00:02:06.050> it

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
and then I'm just going to hot glue it

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.590 
and then I'm just going to hot glue it

over I can just add the glue on the
extra<00:02:18.620> string<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.160> push<00:02:19.820> it<00:02:19.970> on<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.300> the<00:02:20.390> back

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
piece of scrap paper on the back so you

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.420 
piece of scrap paper on the back so you

back<00:02:35.959> onto<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:37.280> picture<00:02:37.640> frame<00:02:37.850> again<00:02:38.150> so<00:02:38.510> I

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
back onto the picture frame again so I

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.330 
back onto the picture frame again so I
just<00:02:38.870> use<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.110> hot<00:02:39.440> glue<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:40.010> I'm<00:02:40.130> going<00:02:40.310> to

just use the hot glue and I'm going to

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.120 
just use the hot glue and I'm going to
go<00:02:40.550> around<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.970> edge<00:02:41.120> so<00:02:41.480> it<00:02:42.320> complete<00:02:43.100> with

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
go around the edge so it complete with

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.390 
go around the edge so it complete with
the<00:02:43.370> picture<00:02:43.670> frame<00:02:44.410> now<00:02:45.410> if<00:02:45.650> you<00:02:45.890> if<00:02:46.190> you

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
the picture frame now if you if you

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.250 
the picture frame now if you if you
didn't<00:02:46.640> use<00:02:46.760> cardboard<00:02:47.390> like<00:02:47.450> me<00:02:47.780> if<00:02:47.900> you<00:02:48.050> just

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
didn't use cardboard like me if you just

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.199 
didn't use cardboard like me if you just
use<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.709> actual<00:02:49.040> back<00:02:49.370> of<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.730> picture<00:02:50.060> frame

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
use the actual back of the picture frame

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.240 
use the actual back of the picture frame
then<00:02:50.840> it<00:02:50.989> will<00:02:51.110> fit<00:02:51.380> right<00:02:51.680> back<00:02:51.860> into<00:02:52.130> place

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
then it will fit right back into place

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.910 
then it will fit right back into place
and<00:02:52.820> you<00:02:53.660> can<00:02:53.870> push<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.290> little<00:02:54.530> hooks<00:02:54.739> over

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
and you can push the little hooks over

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.699 
and you can push the little hooks over
it<00:02:55.190> so<00:02:55.340> it<00:02:55.459> will<00:02:55.520> hold<00:02:55.700> it<00:02:55.850> on<00:02:56.260> but<00:02:57.260> my<00:02:57.380> picture

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
it so it will hold it on but my picture

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.400 
it so it will hold it on but my picture
frame<00:02:57.920> didn't<00:02:58.190> have<00:02:58.310> a<00:02:58.340> back<00:02:58.670> so<00:02:59.630> I<00:02:59.660> just<00:02:59.930> used

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410
