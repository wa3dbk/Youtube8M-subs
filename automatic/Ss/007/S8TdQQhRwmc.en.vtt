 although some bodies can function correctly with only five hours 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.510
 others may need up to 10 hours 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.800

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.200
 fast food is exquisite 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.049
 but they do not do it 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:54.500
 1- organism 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.930
 You need to develop the habit of consuming raw vegetable proteins or 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:59.940
 cooked 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.520
 fresh fruits and carbohydrates that contain low glycemic index as 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.510
 cereals 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.050
 brownros 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.050
 wheat bread and pasta 

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:15.120
 This does not mean that you should leave out the sweet desserts and snacks 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.120
 but you have to learn to consume them in moderation 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.389
 maintain a normal weight 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:24.959
 is having excess weight causes stress 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.449
 both in the heart 

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:27.919
 as in back 

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:31.879
 in order to ensure that he can stay active and thus do things 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:33.219
 that enjoy life 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.239
 but you are sure that your weight is in the normal range 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.180
 has been made jail discovers that this past weight 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.669
 but still thinks he's healthy 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:46.379
 you need to review the things you can do now compared to 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.379
 what could be in the past 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.209
 Of course we already have more years which causes that there is some difference 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.099
 but the weight really makes a tremendous difference in the level of 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:58.049
 activities 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.919
 in which you can participate 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:03.619
 a program that I always recommend is that of the doctor susan for taking a look 

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:06.149
 secretly dot-com weight 

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:09.589
 make sure you have an adequate supply of essential nutrients 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.459
 no matter how many healthy meals consumption 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.779
 you are probably not having all the nutrients you need 

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:20.419
 this is true especially in the case of omega 3 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:23.439
 that helps us keep our heart healthy 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:26.309
 although the omega 3 is found in fish 

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:30.189
 few people can eat so much fish to compensate 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:34.079
 so you need to make up for this deficiency with oil supplements from 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.809
 fish 

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:40.709
 the same happens with many other nutrients such as calcium iron, acid 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.399
 folic acid and the different vitamins 

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:45.539
 just to mention some 

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:47.439

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:00.859
 remember that you do not need to sacrifice your favorite foods to be healthy 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:05.199
 just make sure you eat foods that are not healthy in moderation 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:08.300
 also make sure you get enough sleep 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.660
 Exercise regularly and supplement your diet with vitamins and 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.139
 minerals that are so important 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:16.009
