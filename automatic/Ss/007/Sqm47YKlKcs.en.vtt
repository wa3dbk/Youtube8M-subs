dermatologists that do this for me

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.490 
dermatologists that do this for me
it's<00:06:36.130> not<00:06:36.310> cheap<00:06:36.640> but<00:06:37.000> I<00:06:37.720> think<00:06:38.170> in<00:06:38.260> the<00:06:38.320> long

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:38.500 
it's not cheap but I think in the long

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.920 
it's not cheap but I think in the long
run<00:06:38.680> it's<00:06:38.860> really<00:06:39.370> really<00:06:39.610> worth<00:06:39.850> it

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:40.930 
run it's really really worth it

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.410 
run it's really really worth it
they<00:06:41.260> did<00:06:41.530> say<00:06:41.830> I<00:06:41.860> had<00:06:42.400> like<00:06:42.880> a<00:06:42.910> little<00:06:43.180> bit<00:06:43.360> of

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:43.420 
they did say I had like a little bit of

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:48.270 
they did say I had like a little bit of
rosacea<00:06:43.810> in<00:06:44.320> the<00:06:44.760> cheek<00:06:45.760> area<00:06:47.130> so<00:06:48.130> I<00:06:48.160> think

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 
rosacea in the cheek area so I think

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.730 
rosacea in the cheek area so I think
that's<00:06:48.790> why<00:06:49.090> it<00:06:49.450> results<00:06:49.930> in<00:06:50.110> redness<00:06:50.320> of<00:06:50.620> my

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740 
that's why it results in redness of my

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.340 
that's why it results in redness of my
cheeks<00:06:51.040> and<00:06:51.340> all<00:06:51.430> of<00:06:51.580> that<00:06:51.900> hence<00:06:52.900> why<00:06:53.140> I<00:06:53.170> think

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:53.350 
cheeks and all of that hence why I think

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:54.990 
cheeks and all of that hence why I think
this<00:06:53.680> works<00:06:53.980> really<00:06:54.190> well<00:06:54.460> for<00:06:54.700> me<00:06:54.820> because

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.000 
this works really well for me because

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.580 
this works really well for me because
it's<00:06:55.150> gentle<00:06:55.570> but<00:06:55.690> it<00:06:55.810> does<00:06:56.020> take<00:06:56.290> away<00:06:56.470> the

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:56.590 
it's gentle but it does take away the

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:00.000 
it's gentle but it does take away the
redness<00:06:56.770> okay<00:06:57.730> so<00:06:58.570> yeah<00:06:58.930> if<00:06:59.170> you<00:06:59.380> want<00:06:59.680> to<00:06:59.770> see
