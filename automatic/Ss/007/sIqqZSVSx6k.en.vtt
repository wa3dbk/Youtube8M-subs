00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:08.230
 hello girls today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.740
 good not to teach them there are many 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:15.190
 videos but in this case I'm going to make a 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:18.340
 mix for the almond filling because 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:22.300
 I saw a video of 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:25.390
 from gabi and you know her from gabi 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.800
 the mtl crashes something like that 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.320
 I agree very well with those letters because 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.840
 I confuse a little good already know 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.350
 the truth look for this filling mix 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:38.920
 of almond I'm going to use this 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:42.400
 acrylic rosita that is very much like 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.140
 see and so that color in live already with the 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.510
 light because it's already taken away a little truth 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.570
 but there acb min 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.980
 but that's the color that looks like that 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.700
 it's pink ok 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.810
 I'm going to use this this glitter that is 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:02.520
 pink 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:04.860
 shine appointment and I will use acrylic 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.360
 transparent as I do not have filler 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:12.090
 almond I made one that I have it dressing 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.409
 here in this one and if you the can 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.530
 watch 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:20.159
 this one shines has a pink background and 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.619
 it shines this is not because of a 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.560
 thriller and reluctant that I cast him for 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.149
 do as you have seen the video 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.810
 but there is this filling here has 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:32.819
 some glitter and that mix I wanted it 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.320
 for my nails because on her nails she 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:39.350
 I saw a final video of 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.690

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.640
 Padded never really loved I 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.860
 made almond filling always 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.400
 used transparent acrylic three 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.619
 half to four spoons because as 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.410
 I do not have the filling four tablespoons of 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.110

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:20.410

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:23.920
 pink half an eighth ok half 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.920

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:33.090

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:36.430

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.050
 chicken 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.610
 it's okay 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:55.130
 quickly move it well fine well fine 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:58.280
 well and I'm going to take a teaspoon of 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:02.600
 white acrylic stocking 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:05.410
 ok white acrylic 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.870
 a spoonful of stocking is white 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:13.370
 ok spoonful of an eighth and a little 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:16.970
 more less than half a note now 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:21.880
 comes the good now with this brightness 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.880
 He mentioned that it is this rosita I am going to 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.670
 an eighth ok 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.150
 gaby I like that filling of yours and in 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.210
 reality that I was giving him mind as 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.080
 I do 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:40.500
 how do I do it because I really liked it 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.840
 much how you look and on your nails 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.810
 it's a shame that 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:49.260
 the hard part is that you already bought it 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.390
 so I've done really good I'm going to throw 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:56.300
 a little more 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:04:00.500
 so little bit more and it's ok 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:02.790
 that is a color that I like 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.650
 find the stuffing 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:08.340
 excuse the girl buoy if it is 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.730
 he listened to good quickly we're going to 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:15.580
 prove it 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.580
 and let's see how it is going 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:23.110
 makes the effect fast 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:27.550
 in mixtures of course so like that 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:30.190
 is and look what is nice is perfect not 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:34.569
 they have a lot of transparency is in their 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:37.700
 point this stuffing I like and was that 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:41.620
 it gave her mind like I do 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.620
 and look here is the result 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.090
 this almond filling with its shine 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.580
 Well, I liked how it looks in your 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.689
 her nails 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.689
 and so it looks 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.860
 so we are seen 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.930
 it looks 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.000
 this is the almond stuffing is 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:12.130
 perfect with the amounts that I have 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.130
 casting has its brightness 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:20.830
 good girls I hope you liked it 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.620
 if you think you are a little 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:27.460
 transparent because they only throw a 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.860
 little white acrylic white 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.680
 and it's perfect but for me it's 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:36.210
 perfect is very nice ok 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.210
