00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
over here driver's side running board I

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.460 
over here driver's side running board I
get<00:00:24.650> my<00:00:24.770> bracelet<00:00:25.040> made<00:00:25.460> welded<00:00:26.180> on<00:00:26.300> you<00:00:27.200> can't

said the sheet metal and I'm pretty sure

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.740 
said the sheet metal and I'm pretty sure
they<00:00:30.860> must<00:00:30.950> have<00:00:31.130> made<00:00:31.220> it<00:00:31.369> off<00:00:31.489> an<00:00:31.669> old<00:00:31.939> you<00:00:32.540> go

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
running board done it's mounted bolted

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.630 
running board done it's mounted bolted
on<00:00:52.839> so<00:00:53.839> that's<00:00:53.960> done<00:00:54.440> thunders<00:00:55.100> pulls<00:00:55.399> it<00:00:55.550> on

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
the wheel on there just like and you

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.180 
the wheel on there just like and you
know<00:01:01.910> a<00:01:02.120> little<00:01:02.359> bit<00:01:02.449> of<00:01:02.510> motivation<00:01:03.129> and<00:01:04.129> I

this is like any like my guard for the

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.609 
this is like any like my guard for the
brake<00:01:43.040> booster<00:01:43.219> in<00:01:44.119> this<00:01:44.360> particular<00:01:44.960> way<00:01:45.259> I

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
brake booster in this particular way I

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.980 
brake booster in this particular way I
did<00:01:45.920> it<00:01:46.100> it<00:01:46.939> kind<00:01:47.210> of<00:01:47.270> sticks<00:01:47.479> down<00:01:47.689> a<00:01:47.750> little

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
did it it kind of sticks down a little

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.230 
did it it kind of sticks down a little
it<00:01:48.950> probably<00:01:49.399> is<00:01:49.520> like<00:01:49.729> that<00:01:49.909> in<00:01:50.000> all<00:01:50.090> these

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
it probably is like that in all these

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.789 
it probably is like that in all these
cars<00:01:50.539> that<00:01:50.810> put<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.079> booster<00:01:51.409> against<00:01:51.740> the

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
cars that put the booster against the

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.660 
cars that put the booster against the
floor<00:01:52.070> I<00:01:52.450> mean<00:01:53.450> it's<00:01:53.689> not<00:01:53.810> bad<00:01:53.869> I<00:01:54.680> mean<00:01:55.549> it's

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
floor I mean it's not bad I mean it's

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.999 
floor I mean it's not bad I mean it's
only<00:01:55.789> probably<00:01:56.329> an<00:01:56.539> inch<00:01:57.079> maybe<00:01:57.619> two<00:01:57.740> inches

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
only probably an inch maybe two inches

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.639 
only probably an inch maybe two inches
below<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.520> frame<00:01:58.789> I<00:01:59.350> really<00:02:00.350> don't<00:02:00.530> need

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
below the frame I really don't need

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.830 
below the frame I really don't need
something<00:02:00.920> to<00:02:01.070> kick<00:02:01.280> up<00:02:01.460> grab<00:02:02.149> that<00:02:02.420> lip<00:02:02.659> but<00:02:02.810> a

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
something to kick up grab that lip but a

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.420 
something to kick up grab that lip but a
booster<00:02:03.229> rip<00:02:03.469> that<00:02:03.710> off<00:02:04.180> so<00:02:05.859> the<00:02:06.859> way<00:02:07.009> I<00:02:07.039> made
