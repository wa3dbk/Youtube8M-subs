about them let's say or the reason why

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.939 
about them let's say or the reason why
I'm<00:00:18.029> forced<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.660> use<00:00:18.930> them<00:00:19.199> with<00:00:19.350> some<00:00:19.529> orchids

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
I'm forced to use them with some orchids

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.460 
I'm forced to use them with some orchids
is<00:00:20.130> because<00:00:20.609> especially<00:00:21.359> Phalaenopsis<00:00:22.260> type

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
is because especially Phalaenopsis type

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.720 
is because especially Phalaenopsis type
orchids<00:00:23.100> tend<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.210> lean<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.750> lot<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.500> if<00:00:26.490> I'm

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
orchids tend to lean a lot and if I'm

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.000 
orchids tend to lean a lot and if I'm
not<00:00:26.849> careful<00:00:27.119> with<00:00:27.539> them<00:00:27.750> they<00:00:28.289> actually<00:00:28.740> fall

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
not careful with them they actually fall

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.070 
not careful with them they actually fall
because<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.460> medium<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.090> very<00:00:30.240> very<00:00:30.779> light

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
because the medium is very very light

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.260 
because the medium is very very light
the<00:00:31.710> bar<00:00:31.920> gets<00:00:32.130> very<00:00:32.369> light<00:00:32.579> especially<00:00:33.120> when

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
the bar gets very light especially when

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.979 
the bar gets very light especially when
it's<00:00:33.420> dry<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.410> avoid<00:00:34.980> killing<00:00:35.969> my<00:00:36.270> plant<00:00:36.600> or

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
it's dry so to avoid killing my plant or

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.220 
it's dry so to avoid killing my plant or
making<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.680> look<00:00:37.920> very<00:00:38.370> very<00:00:38.640> bad<00:00:39.030> I'm<00:00:39.450> forced

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
making it look very very bad I'm forced

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.630 
making it look very very bad I'm forced
to<00:00:40.320> use<00:00:40.620> these<00:00:41.010> decorative<00:00:41.700> pots<00:00:43.280> now<00:00:44.280> I've

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
to use these decorative pots now I've

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.029 
to use these decorative pots now I've
noticed<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.629> difference<00:00:46.050> between<00:00:46.230> orchids

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
noticed a difference between orchids

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.369 
noticed a difference between orchids
that<00:00:47.100> are<00:00:47.670> placed<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.390> decorative<00:00:48.719> pots<00:00:49.140> and

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
that are placed in decorative pots and

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.819 
that are placed in decorative pots and
are<00:00:49.469> kids<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.800> are<00:00:49.980> not<00:00:50.629> as<00:00:51.629> literature<00:00:52.350> goes

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
are kids that are not as literature goes

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.750 
are kids that are not as literature goes
especially<00:00:53.899> Phalaenopsis<00:00:54.899> tend<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.500> produce

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
especially Phalaenopsis tend to produce

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.799 
especially Phalaenopsis tend to produce
photosynthesis<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:57.030> their<00:00:57.300> roots<00:00:57.570> as<00:00:57.780> well

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
photosynthesis in their roots as well

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.430 
photosynthesis in their roots as well
and<00:00:58.579> if<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.760> look<00:01:00.120> at<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.719> roots<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.230> fellow

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
and if you look at the roots of a fellow

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.640 
and if you look at the roots of a fellow
novices<00:01:01.920> who<00:01:01.980> stays<00:01:02.399> in<00:01:02.430> a<00:01:02.760> decorative<00:01:03.300> pot<00:01:03.650> we

show<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.119> proper<00:01:09.450> color<00:01:09.689> here<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.619> roots

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
show you the proper color here the roots

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.190 
show you the proper color here the roots
tend<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.250> have<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.460> very<00:01:11.909> light<00:01:12.210> color<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.990> them

fellow Anne obsessing to have very
strong<00:01:24.540> healthy<00:01:25.159> roots<00:01:26.450> except<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.930> ones<00:01:28.259> who

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
strong healthy roots except the ones who

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.960 
strong healthy roots except the ones who
stay<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:28.920> decorative<00:01:29.520> pots<00:01:31.700> okay

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
stay in decorative pots okay

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.499 
stay in decorative pots okay
now<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.810> compare<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.470> with<00:01:34.740> an<00:01:35.700> orchid<00:01:36.210> that

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
now to compare it with an orchid that

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.310 
now to compare it with an orchid that
doesn't<00:01:37.200> stay<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.380> decorative<00:01:37.979> pot<00:01:38.900> there<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
doesn't stay in decorative pot there the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.819 
doesn't stay in decorative pot there the
difference<00:01:40.710> it's<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.400> pretty<00:01:41.490> huge<00:01:42.829> these

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
difference it's is pretty huge these

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.090 
difference it's is pretty huge these
roots<00:01:44.220> tend<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.759> be<00:01:44.939> very<00:01:45.689> green<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.229> nice<00:01:46.649> and

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
roots tend to be very green and nice and

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.760 
roots tend to be very green and nice and
also<00:01:47.700> thicker<00:01:50.000> so<00:01:51.000> I'm<00:01:51.750> using<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.290> rate<00:01:52.619> of

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
also thicker so I'm using that rate of

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.719 
also thicker so I'm using that rate of
pots<00:01:53.070> for<00:01:54.020> for<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.049> few<00:01:55.350> months<00:01:55.860> now<00:01:56.130> I'm<00:01:56.520> not

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
pots for for a few months now I'm not

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.060 
pots for for a few months now I'm not
sure<00:01:56.759> what<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.420> effect<00:01:57.750> on<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.619> long<00:01:58.799> term

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
sure what the effect on the long term

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.609 
sure what the effect on the long term
effect<00:01:59.460> will<00:01:59.969> be<00:02:00.560> but<00:02:02.750> based<00:02:03.750> on<00:02:03.990> their

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
effect will be but based on their

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.730 
effect will be but based on their
appearance<00:02:05.159> only<00:02:06.170> they<00:02:07.170> really<00:02:07.409> don't<00:02:07.560> look

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
appearance only they really don't look

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.249 
appearance only they really don't look
so<00:02:07.920> good<00:02:08.190> as<00:02:08.310> roots<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.940> do<00:02:09.179> receive<00:02:09.539> Sun<00:02:09.959> and

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
so good as roots that do receive Sun and

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.470 
so good as roots that do receive Sun and
a<00:02:10.649> lot<00:02:10.800> of<00:02:10.830> ventilation

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
a lot of ventilation

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.160 
a lot of ventilation
in<00:02:12.689> my<00:02:12.930> pot<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.590> use<00:02:14.159> hydroton<00:02:14.939> at<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.720> bottom

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
in my pot I use hydroton at the bottom

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.080 
in my pot I use hydroton at the bottom
just<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.799> make<00:02:16.920> sure<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.430> your<00:02:17.730> kit<00:02:17.939> is

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.229 
just to make sure that your kit is
somewhat<00:02:18.930> lifted<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.310> air<00:02:20.640> can<00:02:21.030> go

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
somewhat lifted and that air can go

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.550 
somewhat lifted and that air can go
inside<00:02:21.689> and<00:02:22.879> you<00:02:23.879> know<00:02:24.000> be<00:02:24.780> available<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:25.470> the

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
inside and you know be available to the

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.289 
inside and you know be available to the
roots<00:02:25.769> but<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.310> doesn't<00:02:26.640> really<00:02:26.790> compare<00:02:27.030> to

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
roots but it doesn't really compare to

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.899 
roots but it doesn't really compare to
the<00:02:27.599> air<00:02:27.780> this<00:02:28.049> one<00:02:28.349> receives<00:02:28.859> the<00:02:29.549> orchids

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
the air this one receives the orchids

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.179 
the air this one receives the orchids
look<00:02:30.090> good<00:02:30.299> so<00:02:30.840> far<00:02:31.260> but<00:02:31.319> as<00:02:31.680> we<00:02:31.859> all<00:02:31.980> know

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:32.189 
look good so far but as we all know

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:34.130 
look good so far but as we all know
felon<00:02:32.579> OPS's<00:02:32.909> tend<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.209> be<00:02:33.329> very<00:02:33.569> resilient

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
felon OPS's tend to be very resilient

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.990 
felon OPS's tend to be very resilient
they<00:02:34.709> don't<00:02:34.920> really<00:02:35.159> show<00:02:35.459> they're<00:02:35.700> sick

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
they don't really show they're sick

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.080 
they don't really show they're sick
unless<00:02:36.180> they're<00:02:36.510> very<00:02:36.750> sick<00:02:37.079> so<00:02:37.700> yeah<00:02:38.700> this<00:02:39.030> is

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
unless they're very sick so yeah this is

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.210 
unless they're very sick so yeah this is
what<00:02:39.629> I've<00:02:39.780> noticed<00:02:40.200> so<00:02:40.349> far<00:02:40.379> after<00:02:41.010> two

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
what I've noticed so far after two

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.699 
what I've noticed so far after two
months<00:02:41.609> and<00:02:41.819> to<00:02:42.480> be<00:02:42.720> perfectly<00:02:43.200> honest<00:02:43.590> I

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
months and to be perfectly honest I

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.229 
months and to be perfectly honest I
don't<00:02:43.920> really<00:02:44.069> like<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:44.519> I've<00:02:44.700> never<00:02:44.909> liked

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
don't really like it I've never liked

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.629 
don't really like it I've never liked
decorative<00:02:45.930> pots<00:02:46.200> yes<00:02:46.829> they<00:02:47.010> do<00:02:47.069> look<00:02:47.400> nice

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:47.639 
decorative pots yes they do look nice

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:50.599 
decorative pots yes they do look nice
but<00:02:47.909> I've<00:02:48.000> never<00:02:48.560> thought<00:02:49.560> they<00:02:49.950> do<00:02:50.010> good<00:02:50.400> to

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
but I've never thought they do good to

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.800 
but I've never thought they do good to
the<00:02:50.700> plant<00:02:51.470> and<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.590> think<00:02:52.799> that<00:02:53.060> as<00:02:54.060> much<00:02:54.329> air

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
the plant and to think that as much air

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.920 
the plant and to think that as much air
as<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.290> can<00:02:55.650> provide<00:02:55.980> is<00:02:56.370> is<00:02:56.849> the<00:02:57.090> best<00:02:57.299> but

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
as you can provide is is the best but

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.240 
as you can provide is is the best but
now<00:02:58.139> I<00:02:58.470> am<00:02:58.680> just<00:02:59.010> seeing<00:02:59.549> that<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.950> roots

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
now I am just seeing that the roots

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.270 
now I am just seeing that the roots
don't<00:03:02.790> look<00:03:03.060> happy<00:03:03.329> or<00:03:03.720> maybe<00:03:04.709> it's<00:03:04.950> just<00:03:05.010> my

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
don't look happy or maybe it's just my

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.699 
don't look happy or maybe it's just my
impression<00:03:05.639> maybe<00:03:06.540> they<00:03:06.870> just<00:03:07.079> don't<00:03:07.470> make

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
impression maybe they just don't make

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.379 
impression maybe they just don't make
the<00:03:07.889> photosynthesis<00:03:08.700> like<00:03:08.879> they<00:03:09.060> should

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
the photosynthesis like they should

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.080 
the photosynthesis like they should
which<00:03:10.019> in<00:03:10.319> any<00:03:10.439> case<00:03:10.680> is<00:03:10.889> not<00:03:11.069> a<00:03:11.099> good<00:03:11.430> thing<00:03:11.760> I

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
which in any case is not a good thing I

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.720 
which in any case is not a good thing I
tend<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.810> believe<00:03:12.959> but<00:03:13.859> they<00:03:14.099> really<00:03:14.459> don't

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
tend to believe but they really don't

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.770 
tend to believe but they really don't
look<00:03:14.879> so<00:03:15.120> good<00:03:15.420> Oh<00:03:15.569> pale<00:03:16.169> like<00:03:16.590> this<00:03:16.889> and<00:03:17.780> yeah

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
look so good Oh pale like this and yeah

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.349 
look so good Oh pale like this and yeah
I<00:03:19.109> don't<00:03:19.470> know<00:03:19.530> what<00:03:19.620> to<00:03:19.709> say<00:03:19.739> I<00:03:20.099> will<00:03:20.430> see<00:03:20.730> how

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
I don't know what to say I will see how

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.839 
I don't know what to say I will see how
it<00:03:21.419> goes<00:03:21.540> on<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.079> long<00:03:22.260> run<00:03:22.530> but<00:03:23.160> my<00:03:23.609> first

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
it goes on the long run but my first

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.629 
it goes on the long run but my first
impression<00:03:24.299> is<00:03:24.510> that<00:03:24.930> these<00:03:25.889> guys<00:03:26.160> are<00:03:26.370> not

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
impression is that these guys are not

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.300 
impression is that these guys are not
really<00:03:27.120> good<00:03:27.299> for<00:03:27.359> orchids<00:03:28.139> it<00:03:28.409> might<00:03:28.680> be<00:03:28.889> just

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
really good for orchids it might be just
