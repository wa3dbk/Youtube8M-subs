 we move to such a colorful menu 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.380
 which I also like very much and 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.990
 in one game I have not seen such a menu in 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.810
 general then we start the story about Kay and 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:20.479

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.479

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.380

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.280

 contact before the link will be in the description and 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.780
 actually what else did I want to tell you 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.480
 it seems to me that every time 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.420
 morning again looked cartoon story 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.040
 toys because cartoon just 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:22.030
 wonderful i like it a lot and i 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.970
 He himself looked about 5 times and and then 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.950
 there are all parts and it was a lot of fun 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.830
 interesting that is no matter how much you 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.800
 yo he's just an interesting kind of family 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.440
 I would say a cartoon yes therefore not 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.670
 Remember to go in general, and to watch 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:42.970
 who have not yet seen and as soon as I saw 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.920
 on ikse this game I just went nuts because 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.900
 that on the screenshots it was just 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.510
 great game but how do you know 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.340
 Now, in general, some screenshots are just 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.370
 dorisovyvayte go into the game 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.120
 and there is just awful but everything is wrong 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.520
 that is, there is nice graphics here 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.400
 interesting gameplay and to you that is if 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:06.640
 need to take something time is sure 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.850
 download the game before the emulator download 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:14.380
 And in general, then play a toy just 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:17.230
 zashib and yes in general that I so and only 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:22.209
 I saw did not even think of resting and I 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:24.819
 I downloaded it just oh, more precisely, I did not think and 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:28.269
 and write it down I downloaded it 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:30.219
 to play because i 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:33.969
 even somehow forgot that he did not need 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:36.249
 play for a video like this so 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:39.689
 time will fall but nothing let's 

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:42.909
 re- go through it here in principle all 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:46.180
 simple and good that in this game you 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:49.480
 do not die completely you need to start 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.689
 the body is reborn so here it is 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.879
 pretty convenient and by the way this one 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:57.400
 the game seems to me the most suitable 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:59.859
 I don't know station 2 here 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.200
 the feeling of being really fit 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:05.019
 by the way here there right now was driving 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.500
 Green car and drove in it such 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:10.299
 three umyalsya alien and 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.579
 who watched the cartoon for and that they are very 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:15.129
 cool and those who did not look 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:17.620
 look they're just so funny 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:20.500
 that i was laughing the whole cartoon 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.530
 here so actually let's go 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.530
 more oh damn it was probably not there 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.870
 but planned well what are we here 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.430
 so we will be nearby 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.330
 principle will go through again 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:37.270
 so appear yes and by the way guys here I 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.460
 then I just watched the cartoon 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.570
 was shocked by the fact that the corner of this 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.180
 boy andy 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.759

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.479
 I'm sorry and 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.500

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:57.030
 just 5 am I can not sleep yes and here I am 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.120

 childhood was such a pistol I 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.850

 as a husband, so here it is generally dangerous 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:59.680
