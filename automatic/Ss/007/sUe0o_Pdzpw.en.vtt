frets aren't level the guitar will bus

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.790 
frets aren't level the guitar will bus
so<00:00:44.969> workers<00:00:45.239> color<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.899> top<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.289> each<00:00:46.440> fret

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
so workers color the top of each fret

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.740 
so workers color the top of each fret
with<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.039> marker<00:00:47.489> then<00:00:47.879> write<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.120> sheet<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.510> fine

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
with a marker then write a sheet of fine

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.470 
with a marker then write a sheet of fine
sandpaper<00:00:49.170> down<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.739> fingerboard<00:00:50.329> the<00:00:51.329> ink

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
sandpaper down the fingerboard the ink

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.299 
sandpaper down the fingerboard the ink
rubs<00:00:51.750> off<00:00:51.989> on<00:00:52.199> any<00:00:52.379> frets<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:52.980> are<00:00:53.100> higher

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
rubs off on any frets that are higher

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.450 
rubs off on any frets that are higher
than<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.670> rest<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.180> have<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.449> be<00:00:54.570> filed<00:00:54.840> down

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
than the rest and have to be filed down

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.610 
than the rest and have to be filed down
but<00:00:56.460> filings<00:00:56.940> flatten<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.390> frets<00:00:57.660> edges<00:00:58.079> so

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
but filings flatten the frets edges so

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.619 
but filings flatten the frets edges so
workers<00:00:58.859> round<00:00:59.280> them<00:00:59.489> off<00:00:59.699> using<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.180> special

workers round them off using a special
curved<00:01:00.899> file<00:01:01.969> then<00:01:02.969> with<00:01:03.300> very<00:01:03.570> fine

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
curved file then with very fine
