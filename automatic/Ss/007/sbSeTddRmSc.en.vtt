USB<00:01:52.659> to<00:01:53.229> USB<00:01:54.270> cord<00:01:55.270> and<00:01:55.509> this<00:01:55.600> one<00:01:55.840> has<00:01:56.049> to<00:01:56.259> be

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
USB to USB cord and this one has to be

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.760 
USB to USB cord and this one has to be
better<00:01:57.929> quality<00:01:58.929> because<00:01:59.259> of<00:01:59.380> this<00:01:59.469> thicker

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
better quality because of this thicker

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.120 
better quality because of this thicker
it<00:02:00.579> feels<00:02:01.179> more<00:02:01.390> substantial<00:02:01.600> than<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.259> the

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
it feels more substantial than the the

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.880 
it feels more substantial than the the
one<00:02:03.310> that<00:02:03.429> came<00:02:03.640> with<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:04.170> DSLR<00:02:05.170> itself<00:02:05.619> so

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
one that came with the DSLR itself so

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.669 
one that came with the DSLR itself so
I'll<00:02:06.369> probably<00:02:06.520> be<00:02:06.759> using<00:02:06.939> this<00:02:07.149> one<00:02:07.679> what

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
it's doing this job pretty well so see

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.510 
it's doing this job pretty well so see
if<00:04:53.169> we<00:04:53.259> can<00:04:53.380> get<00:04:53.470> on<00:04:53.590> to<00:04:53.770> that<00:04:53.800> that<00:04:54.220> stuff

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
if we can get on to that that stuff

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.540 
if we can get on to that that stuff
beautiful<00:04:56.400> awesome<00:04:57.400> and<00:04:58.030> the<00:04:58.750> best<00:04:58.930> part<00:04:59.550> you

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
beautiful awesome and the best part you

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.040 
beautiful awesome and the best part you
can<00:05:00.699> do<00:05:00.849> stereo<00:05:02.729> or<00:05:03.729> omnidirectional<00:05:04.449> I

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
can do stereo or omnidirectional I

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
and reveal the screen beautiful gorgeous

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.999 
and reveal the screen beautiful gorgeous
gorgeous<00:05:13.000> so<00:05:13.210> let's<00:05:13.990> install<00:05:14.380> the<00:05:14.440> battery<00:05:14.860> so

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:15.009 
gorgeous so let's install the battery so

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:16.920 
gorgeous so let's install the battery so
all<00:05:15.099> you<00:05:15.280> do<00:05:15.430> is<00:05:15.610> you<00:05:15.849> push<00:05:16.090> down<00:05:16.120> on<00:05:16.599> the

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
all you do is you push down on the

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.700 
all you do is you push down on the
little<00:05:17.919> slider<00:05:18.280> and<00:05:18.580> pop<00:05:18.880> out<00:05:19.120> the<00:05:19.419> case<00:05:19.960> and

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
little slider and pop out the case and

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.890 
little slider and pop out the case and
that's<00:05:20.830> pretty<00:05:21.039> nice<00:05:21.250> that<00:05:21.550> Sony<00:05:21.940> has<00:05:22.630> this

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
that's pretty nice that Sony has this

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.059 
that's pretty nice that Sony has this
little<00:05:23.199> channel<00:05:23.380> so<00:05:23.650> you<00:05:23.740> don't<00:05:23.889> actually

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:24.069 
little channel so you don't actually

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:28.620 
little channel so you don't actually
have<00:05:24.250> to<00:05:24.580> worry<00:05:25.569> about<00:05:25.690> losing<00:05:26.460> the<00:05:27.460> cover

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
have to worry about losing the cover

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.950 
have to worry about losing the cover
anyways<00:05:29.409> let's<00:05:29.650> grab<00:05:30.300> the<00:05:31.300> triple-a

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
anyways let's grab the triple-a

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.450 
anyways let's grab the triple-a
batteries<00:05:32.409> these<00:05:33.400> out<00:05:33.699> and<00:05:34.949> throw<00:05:35.949> them<00:05:36.159> into

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
batteries these out and throw them into

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.520 
batteries these out and throw them into
well<00:05:37.060> not<00:05:37.180> technically<00:05:37.630> throw<00:05:37.930> them<00:05:38.080> but<00:05:38.259> and

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
well not technically throw them but and

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.779 
well not technically throw them but and
that<00:05:39.069> is<00:05:39.250> neat<00:05:39.460> it<00:05:39.759> actually<00:05:40.300> runs<00:05:40.509> off<00:05:41.470> of<00:05:41.789> 1.5

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
that is neat it actually runs off of 1.5

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:44.820 
that is neat it actually runs off of 1.5
volts<00:05:43.180> unless<00:05:43.419> it's<00:05:43.690> you<00:05:44.199> know<00:05:44.320> direction

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
volts unless it's you know direction

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.399 
volts unless it's you know direction
internally<00:05:45.610> but<00:05:45.789> 1.5<00:05:46.449> volts<00:05:46.780> but<00:05:46.900> is<00:05:47.020> doubling

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:47.409 
internally but 1.5 volts but is doubling

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:49.830 
internally but 1.5 volts but is doubling
the<00:05:47.919> capacity<00:05:48.039> so<00:05:48.669> you<00:05:48.699> get<00:05:48.969> long<00:05:49.150> runtimes

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
the capacity so you get long runtimes

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.839 
the capacity so you get long runtimes
so<00:05:50.530> we'll<00:05:50.680> pop<00:05:50.830> that<00:05:51.039> in<00:05:51.250> do<00:05:51.669> that<00:05:51.909> and<00:05:52.300> it<00:05:53.169> is

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:53.849 
so we'll pop that in do that and it is

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:57.209 
so we'll pop that in do that and it is
accessing<00:05:54.849> and<00:05:55.330> is<00:05:55.810> fully<00:05:56.169> booted<00:05:56.440> and<00:05:56.830> I<00:05:57.070> have

00:05:57.209 --> 00:05:57.219 
accessing and is fully booted and I have

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:58.950 
accessing and is fully booted and I have
to<00:05:57.340> set<00:05:57.520> up<00:05:57.610> the<00:05:57.729> time<00:05:57.880> and<00:05:57.909> date<00:05:58.180> so<00:05:58.719> let's<00:05:58.840> do

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
to set up the time and date so let's do

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.959 
to set up the time and date so let's do
that<00:05:59.110> real<00:05:59.289> quick<00:05:59.560> oops<00:06:00.310> sorry<00:06:00.460> for<00:06:00.820> bumping

00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:00.969 
that real quick oops sorry for bumping

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:07.499 
that real quick oops sorry for bumping
that<00:06:01.590> so<00:06:03.870> the<00:06:04.870> date<00:06:05.139> so<00:06:05.500> the<00:06:05.710> year<00:06:06.039> is<00:06:06.509> let's

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:07.509 
that so the date so the year is let's

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:12.990 
that so the date so the year is let's
see<00:06:07.750> 11<00:06:08.650> the<00:06:09.069> month<00:06:09.370> is<00:06:09.690> June<00:06:10.690> and<00:06:11.370> the<00:06:12.370> day<00:06:12.639> is

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:13.000 
see 11 the month is June and the day is

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.089 
see 11 the month is June and the day is
the<00:06:13.500> 7th<00:06:14.500> and<00:06:16.050> right<00:06:17.050> now<00:06:17.289> let<00:06:17.710> me<00:06:17.800> double

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:18.099 
the 7th and right now let me double

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:24.920 
the 7th and right now let me double
check<00:06:18.130> the<00:06:18.430> key<00:06:19.150> time<00:06:19.509> it<00:06:20.080> is<00:06:20.699> 432<00:06:21.699> so<00:06:22.349> let's<00:06:23.349> do

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
check the key time it is 432 so let's do

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:31.249 
check the key time it is 432 so let's do
4<00:06:26.729> let<00:06:27.729> this<00:06:27.880> thing<00:06:28.120> do<00:06:28.270> itself

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:31.259 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:35.879 

doo-doo-doo-doo<00:06:33.569> so<00:06:34.569> I'm<00:06:34.719> super<00:06:35.319> excited<00:06:35.349> to
