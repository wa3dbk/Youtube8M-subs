00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
of Rocky boyish look to begin with then

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.520 
of Rocky boyish look to begin with then
I<00:00:08.970> clean<00:00:09.360> shave<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:09.900> we<00:00:10.139> begin<00:00:10.320> with<00:00:10.380> the

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530

I clean shave and we begin with the
makeup<00:00:11.240> now<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:12.269> always<00:00:12.660> start<00:00:12.990> off<00:00:13.080> with<00:00:13.349> a

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
makeup now I always start off with a

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.990 
makeup now I always start off with a
light<00:00:13.679> coverage<00:00:14.009> foundation<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.610> begin<00:00:14.730> with

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
light coverage foundation to begin with

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.660 
light coverage foundation to begin with
and<00:00:15.360> I<00:00:15.570> really<00:00:15.870> blend<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.230> into<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.470> skin<00:00:16.670> then

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
and I really blend it into the skin then

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.580 
and I really blend it into the skin then
I<00:00:17.940> work<00:00:18.240> on<00:00:18.480> top<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.810> that<00:00:18.900> with<00:00:19.080> some<00:00:19.109> lighter

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
I work on top of that with some lighter

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.470 
I work on top of that with some lighter
concealers<00:00:20.310> just<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.699> really<00:00:20.910> shape<00:00:21.180> and

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
concealers just to really shape and

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.000 
concealers just to really shape and
define<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.960> under-eye<00:00:22.260> area<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.830> nose

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
define the under-eye area and the nose

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.340 
define the under-eye area and the nose
this<00:00:23.730> creates<00:00:24.090> more<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.359> subtle<00:00:24.630> contour

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
this creates more of a subtle contour

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.150 
this creates more of a subtle contour
this<00:00:25.560> number<00:00:25.890> immediately<00:00:26.220> noticeable<00:00:28.160> set

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
this number immediately noticeable set

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.980 
this number immediately noticeable set
the<00:00:29.279> entire<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.880> face<00:00:30.060> through<00:00:30.330> this<00:00:30.630> can

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
the entire to the face through this can

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.810 
the entire to the face through this can
create<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.380> little<00:00:31.529> bit<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.769> flat<00:00:32.040> texture<00:00:32.550> so

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
create a little bit of a flat texture so

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.220 
create a little bit of a flat texture so
what<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.030> like<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.360> do<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.660> give<00:00:33.899> some<00:00:34.050> more

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
what I like to do is give some more

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.479 
what I like to do is give some more
dimension<00:00:34.440> around<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.950> perimeter<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
dimension around the perimeter of the

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.100 
dimension around the perimeter of the
face<00:00:35.700> now<00:00:36.030> this<00:00:36.570> is<00:00:36.660> going<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.840> be<00:00:36.899> covered

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
face now this is going to be covered

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.020 
face now this is going to be covered
with<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.260> wig<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.590> bit<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.160> it's<00:00:38.399> gotta<00:00:38.850> be<00:00:38.910> a

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
with a wig in a bit so it's gotta be a

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.340 
with a wig in a bit so it's gotta be a
little<00:00:39.210> bit<00:00:39.329> blended<00:00:39.660> into<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.870> face<00:00:40.110> but

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
little bit blended into the face but

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.840 
little bit blended into the face but
don't<00:00:40.469> worry<00:00:40.620> about<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.890> edges<00:00:41.129> too<00:00:41.280> much<00:00:41.489> I

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
don't worry about the edges too much I

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.180 
don't worry about the edges too much I
always<00:00:42.780> use<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.200> little<00:00:43.230> bit<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.710> bling<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
always use a little bit of bling to the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.350 
always use a little bit of bling to the
skin<00:00:44.489> just<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.820> give<00:00:44.940> some<00:00:45.090> more<00:00:45.180> dimension

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
skin just to give some more dimension

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.090 
skin just to give some more dimension
back<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:45.899> think<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.320> looks<00:00:46.469> particularly<00:00:46.920> nice

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
back I think it looks particularly nice

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.130 
back I think it looks particularly nice
under<00:00:47.700> different<00:00:47.910> kinds<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.239> lights<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.899> also

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
under different kinds of lights and also

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.200 
under different kinds of lights and also
it<00:00:49.950> makes<00:00:50.129> skin<00:00:50.579> look<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.820> little<00:00:50.969> bit<00:00:51.059> more

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
it makes skin look a little bit more

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.150 
it makes skin look a little bit more
skin<00:00:51.510> like<00:00:53.570> for<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.660> brows<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.140> love<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.770> use<00:00:55.829> or

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
skin like for the brows I love to use or

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.920 
skin like for the brows I love to use or
almost<00:00:56.579> like<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:56.760> dip<00:00:57.000> liner<00:00:57.270> technique<00:00:57.719> but

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
almost like a dip liner technique but

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.080 
almost like a dip liner technique but
I'm<00:00:58.020> using<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.410> concealer<00:00:58.699> when<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.850> kind<00:01:00.000> of

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
I'm using a concealer when you kind of

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.729 
I'm using a concealer when you kind of
sandwich<00:01:00.449> concealer<00:01:00.870> with<00:01:01.020> an<00:01:01.109> eye<00:01:01.289> shadow<00:01:01.320> it

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
sandwich concealer with an eye shadow it

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.349 
sandwich concealer with an eye shadow it
really<00:01:02.010> stays<00:01:02.280> on<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.789> creates<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.120> very

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
really stays on and creates a very

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.270 
really stays on and creates a very
gratefull<00:01:03.840> coverage<00:01:04.260> look<00:01:04.710> which<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.070> great

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
gratefull coverage look which is great

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.580 
gratefull coverage look which is great
when<00:01:05.430> you're<00:01:05.489> filling<00:01:05.729> in<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.939> brows<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.590> the

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
when you're filling in the brows to the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.649 
when you're filling in the brows to the
eyes<00:01:07.799> I'm<00:01:08.189> adding<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.490> base<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.119> we<00:01:09.299> will<00:01:09.420> start

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
eyes I'm adding a base and we will start

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.660 
eyes I'm adding a base and we will start
off<00:01:09.750> with<00:01:10.070> transitional<00:01:11.070> color<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.430> begin

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
off with transitional color to begin

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.550 
off with transitional color to begin
with<00:01:11.850> I'm<00:01:12.299> using<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.810> ivory<00:01:13.110> kind<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.350> bone

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
with I'm using the ivory kind of bone

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.160 
with I'm using the ivory kind of bone
color<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.280> then<00:01:14.700> slowly<00:01:15.240> building<00:01:15.780> up<00:01:15.930> and

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
color and then slowly building up and

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.929 
color and then slowly building up and
shades<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.590> copper<00:01:16.770> my<00:01:17.100> natural<00:01:17.460> eye<00:01:17.549> color

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
shades the copper my natural eye color

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.120 
shades the copper my natural eye color
I<00:01:18.150> think<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.049> enhances<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.590> blue<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
I think this enhances the blue in the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.920 
I think this enhances the blue in the
whole<00:01:20.280> look<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:21.240> really<00:01:21.479> brings<00:01:21.689> out<00:01:21.810> my

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
whole look and it really brings out my

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.120 
whole look and it really brings out my
eyes<00:01:23.659> now<00:01:24.659> for<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:24.990> spin<00:01:25.320> I'm<00:01:25.590> gonna<00:01:25.770> be<00:01:25.890> using

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
eyes now for a spin I'm gonna be using

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.190 
eyes now for a spin I'm gonna be using
this<00:01:26.250> very<00:01:26.729> very<00:01:27.000> strong<00:01:27.299> teal<00:01:27.600> color<00:01:27.990> with<00:01:28.170> a

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
this very very strong teal color with a

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.260 
this very very strong teal color with a
mixing<00:01:28.560> medium<00:01:28.680> just<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.250> kind<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.490> define<00:01:29.880> by

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
mixing medium just to kind of define by

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.880 
mixing medium just to kind of define by
then<00:01:30.930> I'm<00:01:31.020> going<00:01:31.229> back<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.530> with<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.710> black

a big difference in the way you look how

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.150 
a big difference in the way you look how
he<00:02:15.790> could<00:02:16.000> turn<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.420> male<00:02:16.810> face<00:02:17.080> into<00:02:17.590> a<00:02:17.620> female

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.640 
he could turn a male face into a female
face<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.790> I<00:02:19.630> didn't<00:02:20.080> really<00:02:20.290> want<00:02:20.440> to<00:02:20.470> do<00:02:20.620> a

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
face and I didn't really want to do a

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.590 
face and I didn't really want to do a
dramatic<00:02:21.280> look<00:02:21.459> I<00:02:21.700> wasn't<00:02:21.880> even<00:02:22.090> quite<00:02:22.300> subtle

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
dramatic look I wasn't even quite subtle

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.660 
dramatic look I wasn't even quite subtle
and<00:02:23.050> then<00:02:23.739> I<00:02:23.769> thought<00:02:24.130> for<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.400> theme<00:02:24.580> of

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
and then I thought for the theme of

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.150 
and then I thought for the theme of
color<00:02:24.910> clash<00:02:25.180> I<00:02:25.540> would<00:02:25.989> take<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.590> color<00:02:27.040> we

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
color clash I would take the color we

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.800 
color clash I would take the color we
associate<00:02:27.550> with<00:02:27.580> each<00:02:27.730> gender<00:02:28.060> so<00:02:28.480> I've<00:02:28.600> done

associate with each gender so I've done
like<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.110> stereotypical<00:02:29.500> pink<00:02:30.010> girls
