00:00:00.519 --> 00:00:04.680
 with an old turn on the satellite in the sky right next to live 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.570
 WolfenbÃ¼ttel in fact in the neighborhood of since it is worth standing there 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.019
 Christina Hofmeier pretty much in the open field at a free crossroads 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.500
 so to speak, from Braunschweig to the ailing nuclear waste dump as he was at the 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.120
 longer to the Konrad mine at Salzgitter the years already 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.489
 Nuclear disposal camp is determined 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:27.529
 concerned citizens of the region want a kilometer long string of lights on the 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:28.779
 Bring legs 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.460
 Thousands of people are traveling today to be among them paths and 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.770
 want to make a glowing human chain very short to men 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.950
 More than one hundred 20,000 tonnes of radioactive waste are stored there 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.660
 Astor meanwhile threatens what experts for years completely 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.920
 impossible to explain 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.680
 the mine threatened to collapse with incalculable consequences for health 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.040
 from Unwerth and from people Christina how is it lit up with you 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.880
 Schroders 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.960
 It lights up working under aggravated conditions is the storms 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.339
 Rain is a find track in the face I think the weather god is no place 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.310
 Nonetheless, they have come today many people we have 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.979
 a few pictures prepared for some time the resistance Anton and warm 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.620
 The 15,000 torches were in the run-up 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.900
 If we all came today then it is really a whole 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.340
 Crowd the motto is light into the dark bring light with a huge 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.840
 Fairy lights 52 kilometers long 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.340
 we have already seen on the map 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.720
 I'm fortunate to bring it was clear this is the cue they are one 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.330
 similar working goals who should be relieved 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.980
 above all we want to be lit we want to get the information that 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.740
 not all children so how dangerous is the situation 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.439
 And above all, what can you do with the ladies? We still need them 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.930
 for comparison and from 26 000 barrels are down there what he is with them 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:50.650
 happen 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.570
 they have to get somewhere 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.150
 In any case, we should come to Schacht Konrad 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.900
 as dangerous as in the ACE 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.990
 Percent of the sensor problem is not solved worldwide and solved 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.710
 That is why we have been against the use of nuclear power for many years 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.350
 important is that no new nuclear power is the center of Milan 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.500
 Maxingvest aspects right around the corner why are you so far here with yours 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.140
 Friends and siblings parents 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.159
 the shit is what they do differently 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:17.459
 with very little thank you Max 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.280
 from Sickte also came to us today free Capra lumbered they are me 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.420
 For years activist in May it was said in the monkey that is all this says 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.689
 all right so they are angry we said that 20 years ago 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:30.559
 that the ACE 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:33.040
 a conceivably unsuitable location 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.359
 that she disclosed exposing tributaries 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:39.819
 but the 20 years already started at demonstrations 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.739
 organize and annoy us enormously today that he is clear today and also 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.249
 officially 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:50.869
 There was a lot of people looking for a problem today 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:51.979
 come again 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:55.449
 in Kerala just last November, there was a buoyant percentage of the 

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:59.429
 Nuclear Power Movement of the anti-nuclear movement to demand what 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:01.969
 they looked to the future in the end 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:05.519
 what shall happen so i think i am so happy today that here so 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:06.459
 many people 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.819
 because with the torches of both titles like rings have already made 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.280
 that means our locations was ever life Konrad was chosen at that time yes 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.910
 also from the point of view 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.270
 it's her the former ddr border here is a quiet hinterland and me 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.430
 think the people who stood here today have shown there is no calm 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.309
 hinterland 

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:24.509
 and we demand 

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:28.519
 instead of in Hallstatt the nuclear-powered rather than the production of nuclear waste entirely 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.389
 simply because clear opinion thank you Mrs. Year approx 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:33.700
 So here if you have listened you really have 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.330
 it is to be made the theme of who the stock anti-nuclear movement is back 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.330
 just in view of the federal election in autumn 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:42.509
 to explain the act 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:46.459
 because it is completely clear the more audience 52 km chain one wants from 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.489
 see above but patience Christina said the weather is badly irritated 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.229
 the helicopter is on the way and the bathrooms are somewhere between heaven and 

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:58.239
 Earth when they are here we show them the pictures of the fairy lights from above 

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:02.039
 to the field of fairy lights and I can tell you it's open why 

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:05.589
 so to speak, except to bring my light into the dark with torches and 

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:09.059
 Flashlights and many of them have certainly never been on one 

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:14.099
 Demonstrate a hundred 26,000 barrels of nuclear waste from all 13th 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:18.369
 German nuclear power plants in an old salt city that makes many people 

00:04:18.369 --> 00:04:20.169
 Fear the organizers 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.830
 because that's what people stand and close to 52 kilometers long from 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.580
 Braunschweig on the nuclear waste storage ACE at WolfenbÃ¼ttel to the future 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.479
 Nuclear power Iran Blogger Schacht Konrad 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.559
 in Salzgitter 

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:36.669
 yes and that is more current in the weather storm and rain
