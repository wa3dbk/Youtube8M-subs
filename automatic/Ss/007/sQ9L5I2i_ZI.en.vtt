 toshiba medical headquarters 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.910
 systems in japan 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.830
 one occurs in this place 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.779
 of multi computed tomographs 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.070
 cutting-edge cuts that has 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.279
 captured the world's medical interest 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:28.039
 tomograph computed from 0 to 4 seconds of 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.430
 rotation that acquires 160 cuts for 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:35.260
 second of half a millimeter thick 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.260
 using a 64 row detector 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.930
 skull image in three seconds 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.220
 abdominal area in 28 seconds 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.430
 full body image with thickness 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.660
 cuts of half a millimeter in only 20 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.090
 seconds 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.810
 the whole body can be explored in a 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.810
 single exam 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.590
 in order to develop this tomograph 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.420
 computed we had to start from 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.909
 zero and redesign each part 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.700
 from thermal analysis techniques 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.490
 of nuclear reactors and the 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.610
 linear motor technology to the 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.110
 Optical data transmission this 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.030
 system is the result of the 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.470
 integration of various technologies 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.470
 tip of the toshiba group 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.560
 another important aspect of the tomograph 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.960
 multicoated computation is the reduction of 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.150
 the radiation dose 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.490
 excellent shielding that reduces the 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.080
 electromagnetic noise three times more 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.930
 that the international standard 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.610
 Near magnetic field analysis in 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.590
 each electronic board inside the 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.840
 country as a result of measures 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.790
 exhaustive measures taken to reduce 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.040
 noise can now be carried out 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.520
 routine exams with low doses of 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.520
 radiation 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.590
 these data were acquired with less 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.179
 of the third part of the dose 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.179
 conventional x- ray 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.040
 Cerebral perfusion exam using 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.040
 700,000 and radiation gray 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.050
 using our exclusive technology 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.280
 it is possible to do it now with only 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.280
 85,000 and gray 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.069
 joint research with universities 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.780
 medical institutions and other users 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.120
 the global collaboration is generating 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.640
 advanced clinical applications to the 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.950
 vanguard of the world of medicine 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.290
 an integrated system of research and 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.569
 development in both engineering and 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.450
 in medicine they carry benefits 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.010
 mutual in both parts from such 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.959
 collaboration have occurred 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.819
 technological innovations that have 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.190
 placed on the computed tomography of 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.590
 toshiba at the forefront of systems 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.810
 diagnostic imaging 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.629
 our aquarium continues its path of 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.940
 success in 2003 received the award 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:18.989
 the best product by fast and 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.060
 they came out in the USA more than 2000 tomographs 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.890
 multislice computed toshiba 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.340
 currently used in the centers 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.170
 most important doctors worldwide 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.790
 as support of these systems we have 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.099
 assigned service engineers 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.340
 attending in centers within 32 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.340
 countries 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.769
 our technical support center 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.569
 here the computers are connected to 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.330
 the medical systems that we have delivered 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.129
 around the world in case of happening 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.620
 some problem an engineer 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:51.920
 specialized fully trained in 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.030
 the system is sent to the customer 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.500
 together with the sending of the parties 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.500
 necessary for repair 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.830
 in our training center the 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.780
 Service Engineers attend 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.780
 extensive technical training courses 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.130
 and they dedicate themselves fully to their training 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.870
 because the knowledge they acquire 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.830
 here they will safeguard lives in their 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.830
