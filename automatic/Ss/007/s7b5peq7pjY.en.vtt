00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.430
 let's see this juncker thermos we have 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.620
 this 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.880
 butane gas heater and the problem 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.720
 it is that when you ask us to 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.910
 we give here we see that this does more but 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.910
 no sparks fly when it should 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.620
 we have changed the pile that goes here in 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.620
 this compartment 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:50.350
 but neither do we know that we have 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:53.430
 decided to buy the new piece 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.430
 we do not have here 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.100
 Y 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.800
 what we are going to do is try it and see 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.750
 if it works 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.650
 to remove this you have to disconnect the 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:14.300
 cable that 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.300
 that the electrode remove this screw 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:20.930
 and we have it a little loose to be able 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.930
 do what 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.070
 we put the new 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.340
 but 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.060
 and now we will try to see if it works 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:47.420
 but to connect 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.420
 the electrode cable 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.250
 why 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:02:01.340
 we put the battery always with your 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:01.340
 polarity positive stage from below 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.740
 and now we squeeze this a little bit 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:14.560
 we put the wire this so that it touches 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:17.560
 the negative and we test 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.560
 d 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:26.359
 we already have the spark this heater there 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.010
 to leave him here for a while 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:30.980
 keep up 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.950
 this topic is hot so you have and 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.760
 the one that I have that I have for hot already 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.760
 that keeps the sun 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:52.150
 As I can see the result, the 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.150
 call and now we give 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:03.150
 also has another marker position 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:05.549
 and half and most minimum and maximum then here 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.970
 we have to regulate the flow of water 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.970
 tap 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.900
 well this is a fault really that 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:22.210
 we can find ourselves in this model of 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.740
 heater changing the 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.870
 the plate is in the module 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:30.400
 electronic this we have got 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:33.090
 repair the gas heater nothing I hope 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.090
 they serve someone
