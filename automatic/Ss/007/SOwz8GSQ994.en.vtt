00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello you love today there is a whole 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.660
 little a notice video of me and 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.750
 while I'm at veggieworld 2013 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.830
 be here in dÃ¼sseldorf and yes me 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.540
 I wanted to ask you if we could 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.250
 I'm glad to meet you, I've got it 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.859
 I think about a special one 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.930
 Place will be from 13 to 14 o'clock and 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.609
 Although world is happening in the rear field 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.810
 a fair where you different 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.480
 to be able to look at 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.519
 different manufacturers and I will 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.050
 just be there too , I thought why 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.609
 I should not mention that if you 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.740
 I just want to meet you there or something 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.969
 then you can also be there and 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.130
 I'm here for a moment 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.510
 a map is again infobox linked 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.850
 where I will be exactly 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.129
 this is a calm cookies I think 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.719
 So it should be at least because 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.340
 There are no stalls and I thought so 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.469
 you would have a bit of opportunity 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.420
 a few words to change with you though 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.219
 you are there and I also wanted to 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.899
 at the same day in the morning 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.190
 instagram another photo of mine 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.750
 outfit to post 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.120
 so we know then that I really do 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.600
 the one you see is that you are 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.470
 like to meet and then yes that is 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.380
 As I said on Saturday and from 13 to 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.670
 14 o'clock in the foyer of the relatively left because 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.650
 there are no more stands you become 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.229
 then see that he also finds 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.570
 an infobox the exact link of the 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.710
 hallenplan there and yes I would 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.170
 We are looking forward to meeting some of you 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.340
 and perhaps we know whole new 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.689
 know things because there are also 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.820
 various lectures on vegans 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.110
 diet of vegetarian nutrition and 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.900
 just different well-known manufacturers 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.400
 For example, everything becomes vegetarian 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.200
 I have never been there since 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.790

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.630

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.369
