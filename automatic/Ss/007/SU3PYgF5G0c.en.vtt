00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.360
 green and a blue short and this one that has 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.030

 and back they also have two bags 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.850
 false because you can not pour anything 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.220
 because they are about an inch from the bottom 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.250
 but they are very nice I like that they do not 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.860
 everything is stuck but below I have I have 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.220
 a little space and shoes 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.340
 these I bought in English as well as 34 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.369
 years where the american eagle brand and me 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.760
 like the color that is like blue and this 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.549
 let it be like walk 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.739
 on this side the heel and they are super 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:19.290
 comfortable because they are so crowded are 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:23.030
 heels like with nothing more appetite and 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.030
 says look at the boom all full 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.930
 and in this affair I incorporate the colors 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.540
 corals black and white and I was 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.519
 makes this boom well for a day 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.390
 after leaving the beach you want to go to 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:40.939
 dine you put the white buttons this 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.010
 blouse that is quite comfortable and 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:45.019
 little boy and some sandals with heels 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.200
 black and I feel it looks very nice 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:52.099
 this blouse I think I bought it in the 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.560
 branches has giraffes how black are giraffes 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:57.829
 nothing else has enough sleeves 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.709
 wide and it's like I get to the flush of 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:03.260
 pants so if he raised his arms 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.060
 you can see a little stomach but not 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.579
 it matters because of tomo I feel that it is 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.370
 quite conservative has here a 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:11.830
 Monkey also and do not expect anything stuck 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.130
 to the body 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:18.010
 they are the same pants of the affair 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:22.830
 previous and of heels I bring my 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.830
 black sandals of light again 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.540
 and so is all this boom 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.940
 the blouse is already seen in another 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:39.450

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.980
 that pp style although I still do not know if 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.180
 it's still but I like it a lot 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.550
 still the little skirt without sleeves and the 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.090
 I love color is very striking and 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.610
 I think I bought it in the majal zone 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.459

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:00.030

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:02.489
 and one that is like white with gold is 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.930
 see tribal middle but I really like how 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.180
 they look with this outfit 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.700
 I bring the same pants but the 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.160
 The only difference is that I roll them up 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.670
 a little bit down here since as they are 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.310
 flip flops this is a very casual look and 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:21.090
 very comfortable my talks are 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.850
 of the march where the brand reforms me 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.190
 they cost about 14 15 dollars and they 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.470
 they make very pretty and I saw the yellow and 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.300
 down and I said oh it's very good with this 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.300

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:40.619
 this boom is going to be almost all white with 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:43.469

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:49.619
 that in the chest like lace and here the 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:52.199
 buttons and it 's very short but I like it 

00:04:49.619 --> 00:04:55.259

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:58.649

00:04:55.259 --> 00:05:00.839

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.000
 much 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:12.460
 They are quite comfortable 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.830

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.620
 nothing else I bring this white that has 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.940

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.940
 see all this boom 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:29.260

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:02.000
