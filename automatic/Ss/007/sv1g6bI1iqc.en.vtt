the most challenging challenging because

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.410 
the most challenging challenging because

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
want to ride it

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:07.290 
want to ride it
I<00:02:06.220> don't<00:02:06.550> know<00:02:06.610> if<00:02:06.670> you<00:02:06.759> guys<00:02:06.880> have<00:02:07.090> been<00:02:07.179> at

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
I don't know if you guys have been at

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.999 
I don't know if you guys have been at
the<00:02:07.420> top<00:02:07.630> of<00:02:07.660> that<00:02:07.899> thing<00:02:08.140> yet<00:02:08.380> and<00:02:08.590> look<00:02:08.770> down

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
the top of that thing yet and look down

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.010 
the top of that thing yet and look down
but<00:02:09.280> it's<00:02:09.580> pretty<00:02:10.179> scary<00:02:10.959> looking

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.369 

sometimes<00:02:17.300> you<00:02:18.300> calculate<00:02:18.840> as<00:02:18.930> much<00:02:19.110> as<00:02:19.260> you

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
sometimes you calculate as much as you

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.860 
sometimes you calculate as much as you
can<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.610> try<00:02:20.849> to<00:02:20.910> assess<00:02:21.300> everything

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
can and you try to assess everything

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.240 
can and you try to assess everything
that<00:02:21.989> you<00:02:22.050> possibly<00:02:22.200> can<00:02:22.530> but<00:02:22.709> sometimes<00:02:23.129> just

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
that you possibly can but sometimes just
