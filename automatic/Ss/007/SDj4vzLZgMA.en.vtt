00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
a similar way to 80 s kind of like to

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.840 
a similar way to 80 s kind of like to

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
alternate feature I like to think about

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.540 
alternate feature I like to think about
time<00:03:06.220> traveling

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
time traveling

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.410 
time traveling
and<00:03:07.660> making<00:03:08.660> up<00:03:08.990> scenarios<00:03:09.530> of<00:03:10.130> like<00:03:10.460> going

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
and making up scenarios of like going

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.540 
and making up scenarios of like going
into<00:03:12.080> the<00:03:12.350> future<00:03:12.560> to<00:03:12.710> a<00:03:13.100> different<00:03:13.460> galaxy

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
into the future to a different galaxy

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.020 
into the future to a different galaxy
and<00:03:14.360> then<00:03:14.570> discovering<00:03:15.460> magical<00:03:16.460> stones

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
and then discovering magical stones

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.270 
and then discovering magical stones
there<00:03:17.570> and<00:03:17.900> then<00:03:18.050> like<00:03:18.200> I'll<00:03:18.410> take<00:03:18.620> actual

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
there and then like I'll take actual

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.830 
there and then like I'll take actual
stones<00:03:19.550> and<00:03:19.820> paint<00:03:20.000> them<00:03:20.240> how<00:03:20.540> I<00:03:20.570> would

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
stones and paint them how I would

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.860 
stones and paint them how I would
imagine<00:03:21.020> those<00:03:21.380> stones<00:03:21.680> to<00:03:21.890> be<00:03:22.040> and<00:03:22.310> then<00:03:22.430> I

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
imagine those stones to be and then I

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.320 
imagine those stones to be and then I
will<00:03:23.870> bless<00:03:24.320> them<00:03:24.620> to<00:03:25.010> have<00:03:25.190> certain<00:03:25.460> magical

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
will bless them to have certain magical

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.540 
will bless them to have certain magical
powers<00:03:26.750> that<00:03:27.050> were<00:03:27.470> supposedly<00:03:27.920> from<00:03:28.340> that

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
powers that were supposedly from that

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.750 
powers that were supposedly from that
planet<00:03:30.040> so<00:03:31.040> it's<00:03:31.550> all<00:03:31.670> really<00:03:31.820> textbook<00:03:32.240> stuff

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.130 
planet so it's all really textbook stuff
documentation<00:03:34.760> is<00:03:35.120> really<00:03:35.420> important<00:03:35.930> to<00:03:36.110> us

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140

we feel like a lot of people have not

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.680 
we feel like a lot of people have not
been<00:03:39.950> documented<00:03:40.430> throughout<00:03:41.180> history<00:03:41.390> and

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
been documented throughout history and

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.660 
been documented throughout history and
