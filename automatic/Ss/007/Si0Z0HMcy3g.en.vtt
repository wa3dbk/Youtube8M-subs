processor<00:00:16.680> power<00:00:16.859> just<00:00:17.520> kind<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:17.730> wasn't

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
processor power just kind of wasn't

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.080 
processor power just kind of wasn't
enough<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.210> keep<00:00:18.330> up<00:00:18.920> however<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:20.250> pales<00:00:20.880> in

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
enough to keep up however that pales in

hold on tosser the rain this is by
having<00:02:06.640> a<00:02:06.850> cheekbone<00:02:07.060> it's<00:02:07.420> good<00:02:07.600> yeah<00:02:08.140> I

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
having a cheekbone it's good yeah I

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.910 
having a cheekbone it's good yeah I
wonder<00:02:08.440> what<00:02:08.560> it<00:02:08.649> does<00:02:08.800> to<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:09.090> signal<00:02:10.920> water

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
wonder what it does to the signal water

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.400 
wonder what it does to the signal water
is<00:02:12.190> an<00:02:12.790> insulator<00:02:13.120> it<00:02:13.570> still<00:02:13.750> says<00:02:13.900> I<00:02:14.080> have<00:02:14.200> one

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
is an insulator it still says I have one

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.560 
is an insulator it still says I have one
bar<00:02:14.620> of<00:02:14.650> signal<00:02:17.400> tell<00:02:18.400> me<00:02:18.490> what<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.730> get<00:02:19.320> sorry

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
bar of signal tell me what you get sorry

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.280 
bar of signal tell me what you get sorry
n-no<00:02:22.570> no<00:02:22.900> signal<00:02:23.730> water<00:02:24.730> kills<00:02:25.000> a<00:02:25.090> signal<00:02:25.450> it's

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
n-no no signal water kills a signal it's

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.890 
n-no no signal water kills a signal it's
too<00:02:26.470> far<00:02:26.710> down<00:02:26.860> your<00:02:27.040> buck<00:02:27.250> shocking<00:02:27.900> but

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
too far down your buck shocking but

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.150 
too far down your buck shocking but
let's<00:02:29.110> let<00:02:29.260> it<00:02:29.350> keep<00:02:29.470> ringing<00:02:29.740> and<00:02:29.920> see<00:02:30.040> what

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
let's let it keep ringing and see what

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.580 
let's let it keep ringing and see what
you<00:02:30.250> get<00:02:30.570> you<00:02:31.570> know<00:02:31.660> what<00:02:31.750> I<00:02:31.780> should<00:02:31.959> I<00:02:31.990> know

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
you get you know what I should I know

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.110 
you get you know what I should I know
what<00:02:32.740> I<00:02:32.800> should<00:02:32.920> have<00:02:32.950> done<00:02:33.070> we're<00:02:33.940> going<00:02:34.030> to

goddamn win tastic now I have noticed
just<00:03:11.380> now<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:12.010> capacitance<00:03:12.640> of<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.820> screen

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
just now the capacitance of the screen

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.630 
just now the capacitance of the screen
gets<00:03:13.360> a<00:03:13.480> little<00:03:13.720> wonky<00:03:14.170> because<00:03:15.100> you<00:03:15.220> had<00:03:15.459> it

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
gets a little wonky because you had it

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.220 
gets a little wonky because you had it
in<00:03:15.760> water<00:03:16.000> wipe<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:16.420> water<00:03:16.570> often<00:03:16.959> see<00:03:17.110> what

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
in water wipe the water often see what

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.530 
in water wipe the water often see what
happened<00:03:17.530> uh<00:03:17.760> you<00:03:18.760> know<00:03:18.850> I<00:03:18.880> like<00:03:19.239> you<00:03:19.390> know<00:03:19.510> I

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
happened uh you know I like you know I

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.150 
happened uh you know I like you know I
like<00:03:19.750> it<00:03:19.870> with<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.050> water<00:03:20.230> we're<00:03:20.440> trying<00:03:20.709> it

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.130 

yeah<00:03:24.160> so<00:03:24.459> definitely<00:03:24.700> being<00:03:25.300> wet<00:03:25.600> it's<00:03:25.840> not<00:03:25.989> as

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
yeah so definitely being wet it's not as

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.120 
yeah so definitely being wet it's not as
happy<00:03:26.320> with<00:03:26.650> my<00:03:27.040> with<00:03:27.430> my<00:03:27.550> touch<00:03:27.760> sensor<00:03:29.130> take

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
happy with my with my touch sensor take

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.190 
happy with my with my touch sensor take
a<00:03:30.160> look<00:03:30.400> I've<00:03:31.030> workers<00:03:31.420> let<00:03:31.600> you<00:03:31.870> when<00:03:32.080> I've

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
a look I've workers let you when I've

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.040 
a look I've workers let you when I've
used<00:03:32.470> my<00:03:32.709> touch<00:03:32.950> screen<00:03:33.130> in<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.489> rain<00:03:34.050> well

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
used my touch screen in the rain well

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.410 
used my touch screen in the rain well
that's<00:03:35.200> because<00:03:35.380> a<00:03:35.440> rain<00:03:35.950> conducts<00:03:36.550> a<00:03:36.910> water

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
that's because a rain conducts a water

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.590 
that's because a rain conducts a water
conducts<00:03:37.840> a<00:03:38.080> little<00:03:38.350> bit<00:03:38.500> of<00:03:38.680> a<00:03:39.600> electricity

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
conducts a little bit of a electricity

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.270 
conducts a little bit of a electricity
all<00:03:41.049> right<00:03:41.260> we're<00:03:41.410> connected<00:03:41.590> to<00:03:41.920> pirate

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
had test one where we couldn't actually

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.380 
had test one where we couldn't actually
get<00:04:43.050> a<00:04:43.110> signal<00:04:43.560> underwater<00:04:43.980> because<00:04:44.850> you<00:04:45.300> know

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390
