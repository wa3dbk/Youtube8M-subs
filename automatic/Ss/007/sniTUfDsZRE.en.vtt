00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
but all I'm really feeling these days

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.760 
but all I'm really feeling these days
are<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:44.250> tails<00:03:44.610> so<00:03:45.480> which<00:03:45.750> wasn't<00:03:45.989> which

wasn't<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.340> case<00:03:47.370> before<00:03:47.880> so<00:03:48.420> that's<00:03:48.900> been

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
wasn't the case before so that's been

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.190 
wasn't the case before so that's been
good<00:03:49.380> I<00:03:49.709> haven't<00:03:50.040> really<00:03:50.400> seen<00:03:50.610> any<00:03:51.200> increase

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
looking bigger black pink is because my

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.070 
looking bigger black pink is because my
hair<00:03:59.250> is<00:03:59.340> getting<00:03:59.459> longer<00:03:59.610> numb<00:04:00.540> because<00:04:00.840> it's

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
hair is getting longer numb because it's

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.600 
hair is getting longer numb because it's
thickening<00:04:01.530> up<00:04:01.560> it's<00:04:01.980> kind<00:04:02.100> of<00:04:02.190> hard<00:04:02.370> for<00:04:02.519> me

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
thickening up it's kind of hard for me

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.190 
thickening up it's kind of hard for me
to<00:04:02.730> tell<00:04:03.000> but<00:04:03.300> I<00:04:03.480> don't<00:04:03.870> think<00:04:04.019> that's

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
to tell but I don't think that's

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.780 
to tell but I don't think that's
probably<00:04:04.410> necessarily<00:04:05.010> helped<00:04:05.310> my<00:04:05.459> thickness

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
probably necessarily helped my thickness

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.479 
probably necessarily helped my thickness
because<00:04:06.360> my<00:04:06.900> hair<00:04:07.110> can<00:04:07.260> easily<00:04:07.650> look<00:04:07.830> flat<00:04:08.220> but

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
because my hair can easily look flat but

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.699 
because my hair can easily look flat but

hair vitamin I got in like this gift set
that<00:04:27.400> I<00:04:27.580> want<00:04:27.760> to<00:04:27.820> try<00:04:28.000> -<00:04:28.060> then<00:04:28.900> I'm<00:04:28.990> gonna<00:04:29.080> go

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
that I want to try - then I'm gonna go

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.410 
that I want to try - then I'm gonna go
back<00:04:29.500> to<00:04:29.530> my<00:04:29.830> regular<00:04:30.040> vitamin<00:04:30.700> regimen<00:04:30.790> one

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
back to my regular vitamin regimen one

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.120 
back to my regular vitamin regimen one
reason<00:04:31.780> went<00:04:31.960> by<00:04:32.110> it<00:04:32.170> and<00:04:32.470> all<00:04:32.620> that<00:04:32.710> stuff

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
reason went by it and all that stuff

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.610 
reason went by it and all that stuff
because<00:04:33.820> these<00:04:34.300> are<00:04:34.480> expensive<00:04:34.990> and<00:04:35.260> I<00:04:35.350> just

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
because these are expensive and I just

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.590 
because these are expensive and I just
don't<00:04:35.770> think<00:04:36.070> they're<00:04:36.220> that<00:04:36.250> effective<00:04:37.060> in

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
don't think they're that effective in

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.990 
don't think they're that effective in
terms<00:04:37.960> of<00:04:38.140> like<00:04:38.290> crown<00:04:38.650> area<00:04:39.070> and<00:04:39.490> my<00:04:39.640> edges

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
terms of like crown area and my edges

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.210 
terms of like crown area and my edges
and<00:04:40.210> places<00:04:40.630> where<00:04:40.840> I<00:04:41.140> was<00:04:41.500> hoping<00:04:41.680> that<00:04:42.040> means

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
and places where I was hoping that means

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.520 
and places where I was hoping that means
have<00:04:42.430> main<00:04:42.790> tablinum<00:04:43.180> would<00:04:43.510> help<00:04:43.810> to<00:04:44.290> thicken

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
have main tablinum would help to thicken

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.740 
have main tablinum would help to thicken
those<00:04:44.860> areas<00:04:45.400> that<00:04:45.820> just<00:04:45.880> hasn't<00:04:46.330> been<00:04:46.630> the

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
those areas that just hasn't been the

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.920 
those areas that just hasn't been the
case<00:04:46.780> so<00:04:47.260> yeah<00:04:47.800> I<00:04:47.830> haven't<00:04:48.100> gotten<00:04:48.460> any<00:04:48.930> any

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
case so yeah I haven't gotten any any

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.710
