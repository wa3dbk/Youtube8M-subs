 folder my computer properties 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.230
 advanced system parameters and in 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.529
 very bottom 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.109
 we look for variable environments here interest 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.439
 us system variables 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:31.730
 press the create button and enter with 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:36.590
 door keypads 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:42.360
 door frame buffer we r &amp; b 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:46.410
 history variable value set 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:50.780
 one press ok here we see that 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.780

 choose from our main course 14 lesson 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:19.860
 and render rendering immediately fast then 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.640
 there is a quick render render passed 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.729
 successful and as you probably know here 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.259
 This window is called the faith of the framebuffer 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.670
 this is indicated here by the inscription 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.790

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.130
 I already had a render here.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:01.100
 appear when starting faith ephraim buffer 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.620
 automatically i click again 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.420
 Rendering to render a picture here 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.380
 I see a ranger window immediately appears 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:15.080
 history as soon as my render is complete 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:16.549
 Here is a picture, it will appear in this window 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.920
 appeared you can watch here 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.170
 also specified information except her 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.840
 permissions 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:27.950
 also how much time did you render 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:31.940
 given moment 11 seconds now let's 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.730
 close this window Frank buffer change 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.280
 Well, for example, we 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.519
 want to change the texture or put 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.850
 lighting in a different way suppose I 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:49.670
 Now I want to do at our source 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:53.420
 light have a plan arnova some shade 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.880
 another temperature so he shone more 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.620
 so soft home color instead 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.090
 street I will put the value 3000 and 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.860
 now I want to see how it happened 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.640
 Again, I press rendering fast 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.500
 I have a fast render like 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.540
 only the render has passed I see that with me 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.209
 there is another picture and here 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.700
 they will be very much the latest 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.350
 renders appear at the top we can 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.630
 between these pictures switch 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.080
 double click to view 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.700
 the previous result also has a very 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.200
 interesting function we 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.840
 we can ask some specific 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.990
 pictures for example set it as 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.310
 Picture and choose another picture. 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.040
 set as picture b 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.600
 now we see that it is combined with us 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.380
 Here on this side of the left we 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:45.350
 picture a on the right and b and this picture 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.510
 total divided by moving 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.960
 lane we see what's going on too 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:53.210
 very convenient to compare the results 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:57.320
 see what you had what became like 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:00.220
 better as worse i think it is very 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:03.050
 useful feature may come in handy 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.730
 It works as you can see on the fast render. 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.500
 that is, on your fast render and 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.390
 on the usual simplest renderer not 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.050
 what quality is important to set up and which 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:13.850
 render render at the top here is a framebuffer 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.910
 and you also see we have appeared 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.440
 web abe button if you need 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:22.190
 quickly swap 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:24.530
 a and b in my opinion it is very comfortable 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:28.540
 thing so use that thanks for 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.540
 view to new meetings
