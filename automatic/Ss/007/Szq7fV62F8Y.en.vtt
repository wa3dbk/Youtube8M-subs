00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
explodes like a reduced damage of DMT

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.660 
explodes like a reduced damage of DMT
and<00:00:54.149> also<00:00:55.079> should<00:00:55.289> face<00:00:55.469> like<00:00:55.680> tuna<00:00:56.070> drag<00:00:56.280> next

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670

to each other you exploded it's like a

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.979 
to each other you exploded it's like a
chain<00:00:59.280> reaction<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.940> explodes<00:01:00.359> both<00:01:00.660> and

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
chain reaction so it explodes both and

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.930 
chain reaction so it explodes both and
gives<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.649> bigger<00:01:01.920> explosion<00:01:02.100> as<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.820> can

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
see a lot of traps with it you can also

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.310 
see a lot of traps with it you can also
mine<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.250> network<00:01:08.580> down<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.060> placed<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.229> a

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
mine the network down and placed in a

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.469 
mine the network down and placed in a
chain<00:01:10.590> reaction<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.369> make<00:01:11.580> black<00:01:11.970> make<00:01:12.150> big

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
chain reaction so make black make big

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.600 
chain reaction so make black make big
explosion<00:01:13.020> stuff<00:01:13.350> if<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.549> tour<00:01:15.270> down<00:01:15.509> under

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
explosion stuff if you a tour down under

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.330 
explosion stuff if you a tour down under
why<00:01:17.610> 80<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.299> creates<00:01:18.840> just<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.500> tour<00:01:20.040> damage

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
why 80 it creates just a tour damage

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.429 
why 80 it creates just a tour damage
lightning<00:01:20.729> damage<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.119> log<00:01:21.270> back<00:01:21.299> but<00:01:22.080> it

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
lightning damage and log back but it

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.960 
lightning damage and log back but it
creates<00:01:22.710> no<00:01:22.920> metrics<00:01:23.340> on<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.049> why<00:01:25.049> 18<00:01:25.970> so

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
creates no metrics on it and why 18 so

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.490 
creates no metrics on it and why 18 so

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
a little knock back you can also run

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.429 
a little knock back you can also run
away<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.250> third<00:01:53.460> behind<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:54.930> they<00:01:55.049> get<00:01:55.170> bug
