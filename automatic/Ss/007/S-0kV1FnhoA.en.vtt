and it's serving as a bridge into the
Internet<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.789> works<00:00:44.940> well<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.390> if<00:00:45.809> you're

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
Internet and it works well so if you're

traveling<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.649> need<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:47.039> local<00:00:47.550> router

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
traveling and you need a local router

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.439 
traveling and you need a local router
you<00:00:48.690> can<00:00:48.719> use<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.760> can<00:00:50.760> plug<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.149> into<00:00:51.300> a

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
you can use this you can plug it into a

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.830 
you can use this you can plug it into a
power<00:00:51.690> source<00:00:52.340> and<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.730> can<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.329> can<00:00:54.360> keep<00:00:54.660> it

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
power source and you can you can keep it

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.900 
power source and you can you can keep it
kind<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.590> powered<00:00:55.890> indefinitely<00:00:56.489> with<00:00:56.730> that

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
kind of powered indefinitely with that

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.029 
kind of powered indefinitely with that
however<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:57.780> also<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.289> a<00:01:00.620> power<00:01:01.620> bank<00:01:01.859> on

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
however it's also in a power bank on

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.759 
however it's also in a power bank on
itself<00:01:02.399> too<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.059> do<00:01:03.359> have<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:04.379> kind<00:01:04.619> of

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
itself too so you do have that kind of

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.200 
itself too so you do have that kind of
capability<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.489> it's<00:01:05.640> an<00:01:05.790> eighty<00:01:06.030> eight

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
capability so it's an eighty eight

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.390 
capability so it's an eighty eight
hundred<00:01:06.600> million<00:01:06.810> per<00:01:07.110> hour<00:01:07.229> battery<00:01:08.189> pack

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
hundred million per hour battery pack

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
here into directly into the unit why do

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.749 
here into directly into the unit why do
I<00:01:25.290> have<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.650> that's<00:01:25.979> because<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.430> will

and iPad devices for iPhones so even if
it's<00:01:34.200> not<00:01:34.380> connected<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.950> network<00:01:35.189> I'll

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
it's not connected to the network I'll

it's not connected to the network I'll
pull<00:01:36.119> out<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.390> little<00:01:36.479> LAN<00:01:36.869> cable<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.979> what

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
pull out the little LAN cable and what

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.730 
pull out the little LAN cable and what
you<00:01:38.280> find<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.720> still<00:01:40.079> works<00:01:40.320> as<00:01:40.680> a

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
you find is is that it still works as a

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.069 
you find is is that it still works as a
router<00:01:40.950> just<00:01:41.640> not<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:41.970> internet<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.509> you

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
router just not to the internet so you

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.480 
router just not to the internet so you
can<00:01:43.200> actually<00:01:43.500> do<00:01:43.619> file<00:01:43.860> sharing<00:01:43.890> between

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
can actually do file sharing between

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.300 
can actually do file sharing between
this<00:01:45.180> and<00:01:47.540> your<00:01:48.540> iPad<00:01:48.869> now<00:01:49.680> how<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:49.950> works<00:01:50.159> is

you can use up to a 32 gig card or an

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.100 
you can use up to a 32 gig card or an
iPad<00:01:53.700> now<00:01:53.970> I'm<00:01:54.149> not<00:01:54.329> use<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.630> with<00:01:54.720> Android

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.620 
iPad now I'm not use it with Android
devices<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:56.189> I'm<00:01:56.280> not<00:01:56.430> exactly<00:01:56.820> sure<00:01:57.149> how<00:01:57.420> well

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
devices so I'm not exactly sure how well

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.240 
devices so I'm not exactly sure how well
it'll<00:01:57.750> work<00:01:57.930> but<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.229> would<00:01:58.710> assume<00:01:58.799> actually

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
it'll work but I would assume actually

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.429 
it'll work but I would assume actually
probably<00:01:59.490> works<00:01:59.640> better<00:02:00.110> and<00:02:01.110> you<00:02:01.290> can

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
probably works better and you can

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.410 
probably works better and you can
actually<00:02:01.590> do<00:02:01.799> file<00:02:02.040> sharing<00:02:02.070> now<00:02:02.909> more<00:02:03.270> on

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
actually do file sharing now more on

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.130 
actually do file sharing now more on
that<00:02:03.509> in<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.659> second

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
that in a second

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.770 
that in a second
you<00:02:04.380> also<00:02:04.530> have<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.770> USB<00:02:04.979> plug<00:02:05.430> in<00:02:05.670> here<00:02:05.909> for

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
you also have a USB plug in here for

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.249 
you also have a USB plug in here for
external<00:02:07.530> hard<00:02:07.740> drives<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.280> for<00:02:09.020> USB<00:02:10.020> jump

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
external hard drives and for USB jump

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.960 
external hard drives and for USB jump
drives<00:02:10.500> however<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:11.129> wasn't<00:02:11.520> able<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.760> get<00:02:11.879> that

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
drives however I wasn't able to get that

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.380 
drives however I wasn't able to get that
to<00:02:12.150> work<00:02:12.300> with<00:02:12.599> my

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
to work with my

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.910 
to work with my
I<00:02:13.420> think<00:02:14.349> it's<00:02:14.440> probably<00:02:14.590> more<00:02:14.770> of<00:02:14.860> a

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
I think it's probably more of a

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.040 
I think it's probably more of a
restriction<00:02:15.310> of<00:02:15.550> an<00:02:15.880> Apple<00:02:16.480> product<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:16.959> than

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
restriction of an Apple product and than

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.530 
restriction of an Apple product and than
anything<00:02:17.260> that<00:02:17.670> takes<00:02:18.670> place<00:02:18.940> here<00:02:19.270> with<00:02:19.390> the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
anything that takes place here with the

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.580 
anything that takes place here with the
easy<00:02:19.750> ACC<00:02:20.520> adapter<00:02:21.520> so<00:02:22.090> how<00:02:22.959> it<00:02:23.110> works<00:02:23.290> is<00:02:23.530> that

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
easy ACC adapter so how it works is that

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.699 
easy ACC adapter so how it works is that
you<00:02:23.890> simply<00:02:24.989> you<00:02:25.989> download<00:02:26.380> an<00:02:26.500> app<00:02:27.300> onto<00:02:28.300> your

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
you simply you download an app onto your

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.820 
you simply you download an app onto your
iPad<00:02:29.709> iPhone<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:31.810> you<00:02:32.080> follow<00:02:32.319> the<00:02:32.470> set<00:02:32.680> ups

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
iPad iPhone you you follow the set ups

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.830 
iPad iPhone you you follow the set ups
which<00:02:33.069> immediately<00:02:33.610> is<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:33.970> little<00:02:34.420> confusing

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
which immediately is a little confusing

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.900 
which immediately is a little confusing
but<00:02:35.440> you<00:02:35.500> basically<00:02:35.739> set<00:02:36.130> it<00:02:36.250> up<00:02:36.400> into<00:02:36.670> the

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
but you basically set it up into the

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.390 
but you basically set it up into the
router<00:02:37.060> and<00:02:37.380> then<00:02:38.380> you'll<00:02:38.560> get<00:02:38.709> a<00:02:38.769> final<00:02:39.040> drop

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
router and then you'll get a final drop

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.520 
router and then you'll get a final drop
down<00:02:39.640> of<00:02:39.849> all<00:02:39.940> of<00:02:40.420> all<00:02:40.569> the<00:02:40.690> files<00:02:40.900> around<00:02:41.170> here

down of all of all the files around here

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.990 
down of all of all the files around here
now<00:02:42.130> one<00:02:42.310> of<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.459> things<00:02:42.640> that<00:02:42.819> you're<00:02:42.940> gonna

find<00:02:43.239> is<00:02:43.480> that<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.920> it<00:02:45.910> works<00:02:46.390> well<00:02:46.630> with<00:02:46.959> Word

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
find is that it it works well with Word

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.039 
find is that it it works well with Word
