00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.629
 yes a very typical process or man 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.730
 runs through a street and left and 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.980
 on the right hang posters with advertising 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.189
 whether about current movies any 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.500
 solid ideal would be the color of the bearer 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.180
 but you will not only meet on the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.950
 Street also on the internet at 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.520
 research for school or what 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.950
 always 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.869
 Advertising occurs almost everywhere 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.210
 eyes if you want to see them or 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.690
 not and also if they are appropriate it so 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.700
 not yet 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.770
 and we are already the same 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.170
 on the subject kristina already has 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.120
 this is what our youth tv channel tells us 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.780
 was classified as harmful to minors 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.910
 So not adult and somehow has 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.190
 Now there with me in my head when I am at all 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.410
 the blatant lowers things thinks the 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.020
 children are simply to be pre-set for 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.720
 Example by advertising where is it? 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.730
 the youth protection you want a concrete 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.590
 example hear everything clearly 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.690
 last year was from october 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.820
 for a few months in nuremberg one 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.729
 exhibition the body worlds for what 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.439
 advertise everywhere posters hang one 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.719
 exhibition at the dead people 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.819
 been issued and there were 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:17.880
 not even a minimum age around the 

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:19.799
 to attend this exhibition and was yes 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.780
 clearly one has made big advertising for it 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.999
 with posters on which you kill them 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.249
 has seen people and the hang 

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:29.520
 everywhere on the roadside at the gas station 

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:31.109
 at the bus stops and so on and 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.749
 when I saw these pictures 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:35.729
 I honestly wanted to say myself 

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:37.560
 pretty bad and we have 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.090
 somehow every child is sorry for that 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.340
 example on the way to school there 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.340
 came by and these dead people 10 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.299
 I had to wonder why somehow 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.950
 thinks not as child thinks no one 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.599
 somehow remember that a child of 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.299
 such pictures maybe nightmares 

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:56.759
 but could get us threatened 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.889
 protection of minors with big fines because 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.159
 our youth in front of the side so dangerous 

00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:03.450
 So for children and adolescents I am 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.759
 somehow not quite there 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.009
 with somehow I find that a bit 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.060
 twisted just like the story in 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.319
 christina broadcast 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.910
 somehow it was still fit but there 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.230
 for you then better understand 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.060
 Let's make a little one 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.650
 Review of this exhibition I 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.569
 wanted to talk about it already then 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.970
 originally make a broadcast to it 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.480
 and therefore I still have some filming 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.430
 from that 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.319
 but we have this show then 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.489
 not aired because we just pictures 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.610
 did not want to show 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:35.010
 but long before looking like 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.780
 I'll point it out 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.180
 also shown the posters and I stress 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.000
 quite clearly that my opinion 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.150
 These are not for kids these are 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.799
 We therefore only release pictures from the age of 18 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.569
 So if you do not have these pictures 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.400
 is done or you really still too 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.220
 then you should be young now 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.440
 I almost do not tell you anything 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.810
 I do not want to do it that way 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.940
 like the posters hung everywhere 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.700
 and everyone actually did 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.470
 forced to see this second 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.930
 Part is meant for those who over 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.299
 18 are and as adult adolescents 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.040
 want to judge whether that is for 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.340
 children is suitable or not 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:18.769
 have you thought it over well? 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.769
 would otherwise say many now 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.780
 yes, and this is exactly the picture people are 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.370
 to stimulate the exhibition 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.920
 body worlds here in Nuremberg too 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.449
 visit this time is running and 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.729
 There are many dead people there 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:20.289
 exhibited where the muscles 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:22.570
 and can see the organs everything 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:23.979
 what is in a human and so 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.199
 I even heard that there was one 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.820
 Dead pregnant woman was exhibited 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:29.830
 where you can see the embryo 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.099
 So, imagine this is it 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:37.360
 terrible and this exhibition is off 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:38.919
 0 first of all, all people from 0 years onwards 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.710
 may these dead people 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:44.729
 look at corpses without skin 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.139
 plastination has been preserved 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.570
 Secondly , these posters are hanging everywhere 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:51.970
 Rome on every corner on every edge everywhere 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.580
 Advertising and that means everyone 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.889
 can come see these posters 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.919
 so also the children for example if 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:03.669
 you're on your way to school and yes 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:06.340
 third, on 22 october 2014 even became 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.110
 at the main market here nuremberg for one 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.699
 half an hour so issued a corpse 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.620
 free under the sky that is also called 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:14.259
 there again everyone who passed by could 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.050
 these lighter scenes so also the 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:19.330
 smallest children yes and also need 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.880
 Let's think for what this 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.590
 Exhibition is intended to serve markets 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.169
 because not something here with the people 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.630
 those are the values ​​of one 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:30.190
 human if you dead them without skin in 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.590
 an exhibition can see 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.900
 it really pays to think about it 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.150
 what have all been lost? 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.919
 we are and will pick this one again 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.930
 the values ​​just come back to us, for example 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:43.449
 be taken away by such things 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.220
 and do not let yourself be dulled 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:46.450
 stay tuned and 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.730
 about one or the other times 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.730
 think about it until next time
