00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.769
 hello jose with these youtube well fine 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.150
 thank you very much hear what you think if 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.520
 we take advantage so that he talks to us is to 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.650
 gm clients with a bit broker 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.789
 about trading history of this 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.680
 year will be going very well we hope to have 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.629
 resume the growth of the company 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.099
 as you know last year we already solved 

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:33.399
 all the financial problems of the 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.980
 company then this year the idea is 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:38.539
 have an important growth of 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.510
 new units that had been without 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:45.320
 to open of our idea is to open around 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.900
 of 10 11 stores this year this one remodel 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.200
 around another five or six stores 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.730
 a year and began to enter some 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.649
 cities that we have not entered as is the 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.400
 case of guadalajara then enter 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.930
 a more aggressive way in that city 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.430
 regarding the issue of margins that 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.610
 you would expect for this year the margin 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.980
 we are waiting for an improvement this not very 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.990
 big presses important improvement or be 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.270
 let's grow more at the level avoid if 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.900
 We are waiting to grow around a 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.180
 7 8% in EBITDA margin against the year 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:20.290
 past this which is above the 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.630
 sales this this in order to change 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.280
 that we have in the mix of 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.080
 concepts that is the concepts that 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.420
 we are focusing today that are 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.710
 cool and city market that go to classes 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.840
 middle and high 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.880
 they give better margins then out there what 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.860
 we are seeing and in terms of dynamics of 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.180
 What do you expect for your sales? 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.580
 same stores or organic growths 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.280
 and now in same store sales we are 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.040
 waiting around three and a half times 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.780
 cent this however what we see is 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.580
 that will be different from last year's 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.350
 last year in a very first semester 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.140
 strong in consumption after 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.150
 elections under this we see it differently 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.190
 in the first half a little slower in 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.960
 what the government starts spending and the 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.640
 stronger second half in 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.979
 first half we expect growth 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.590
 in some stores between 1 and 2 and the 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.540
 second part of the year between 4 and 5 per 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.720
 percent to give us an annual average 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:15.590
 between 3.5 which is what we are 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.090
 seeing additionally we have this the 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.060
 development of shopping centers 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.940
 we have many units that have 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.750
 ability to create a shopping center 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.410
 all we are doing is 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.940
 developing between 4 and 3 centers 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.700
 commercials a year we are going to open one in 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.319
 villahermosa 1 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.959
 here in the city of mexico we are going to 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.640
 create something in some of the stores and 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.260
 the idea is to be doing this in the 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.200
 following five years what will we 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.709
 give a more important margin and 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.790
 strengthen what income is 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.349
 diversifying the similar real estate 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.730
 I think we have arrived 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.730
 thank you very much monkeys
