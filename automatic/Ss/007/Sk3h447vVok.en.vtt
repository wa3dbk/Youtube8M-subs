also has to do with EPA certificates and
a<00:01:10.350> lot<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.790> manufacturers<00:01:11.790> used<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.150> get

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
a lot of the manufacturers used to get

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.630 
a lot of the manufacturers used to get
away<00:01:12.360> with<00:01:12.659> using<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.470> same<00:01:13.680> EPA<00:01:13.979> certificate

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
away with using the same EPA certificate

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.210 
away with using the same EPA certificate
for<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> lot<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.150> models<00:01:15.770> so<00:01:16.770> little<00:01:17.070> things

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
for a lot of models so little things

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.460 
for a lot of models so little things
would<00:01:17.400> change<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.259> manufacturer<00:01:19.259> went

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
would change and the manufacturer went

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.410 
would change and the manufacturer went
know<00:01:19.619> for<00:01:19.799> example<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.280> model<00:01:20.640> would<00:01:21.210> have<00:01:21.240> a

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
know for example this model would have a

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.859 
know for example this model would have a
larger<00:01:22.380> disc<00:01:22.590> brake<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.509> 2007<00:01:24.509> version

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
larger disc brake in the 2007 version

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.920 
larger disc brake in the 2007 version
the<00:01:25.909> 2009/2010<00:01:26.909> has<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.150> smaller<00:01:27.450> disc<00:01:27.720> brake

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
the 2009/2010 has a smaller disc brake

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.080 
the 2009/2010 has a smaller disc brake
but<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.650> has<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:29.040> same<00:01:29.070> exact<00:01:29.610> part<00:01:29.850> number

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
but it has the same exact part number

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.670 
but it has the same exact part number
inside<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.360> manual<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.200> that's<00:01:31.350> what<00:01:31.500> makes

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
inside the manual so that's what makes

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.670 
inside the manual so that's what makes
Chinese<00:01:32.070> bikes<00:01:32.369> really<00:01:33.110> unreliable<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.560> when

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
Chinese bikes really unreliable and when

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.100 
Chinese bikes really unreliable and when
