we like sony has always played it safe
with<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:09.929> way<00:00:10.050> that<00:00:10.230> their<00:00:10.410> controllers<00:00:10.950> look

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
with the way that their controllers look

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.400 
with the way that their controllers look
and<00:00:11.490> feel<00:00:11.849> it's<00:00:12.120> practically<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.960> same<00:00:13.139> from

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
and feel it's practically the same from

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.589 
and feel it's practically the same from
generation<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.130> generation<00:00:14.330> but<00:00:15.330> with<00:00:15.480> the

section below I brought in my

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.530 
section below I brought in my
playstation<00:00:38.190> 3<00:00:38.579> controller<00:00:38.610> just<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.390> do<00:00:39.510> the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
playstation 3 controller just to do the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.959 
playstation 3 controller just to do the
side-by-side<00:00:40.379> comparison<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.460> can<00:00:41.640> see

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
side-by-side comparison and you can see

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.490 
side-by-side comparison and you can see
the<00:00:42.000> differences<00:00:42.660> right<00:00:42.989> from<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.290> get-go

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
the differences right from the get-go

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.010 
the differences right from the get-go
now<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.129> would<00:00:44.309> like<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.730> point<00:00:45.030> out<00:00:45.270> that<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.719> lot

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
now I would like to point out that a lot

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.500 
now I would like to point out that a lot
of<00:00:46.170> these<00:00:46.289> size<00:00:46.739> differences<00:00:47.430> are<00:00:47.700> caused<00:00:48.030> by

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
of these size differences are caused by

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.479 
of these size differences are caused by
of<00:00:48.750> course<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.350> security<00:00:49.950> device<00:00:50.219> that's

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
of course the security device that's

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.279 
of course the security device that's
attached<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.180> PlayStation<00:00:51.870> 4<00:00:52.140> controller

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
attached to the PlayStation 4 controller

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.680 
attached to the PlayStation 4 controller
it<00:00:52.800> kind<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.309> alters<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.090> perspective

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
it kind of alters the perspective

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.689 
it kind of alters the perspective
slightly<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.379> what<00:00:55.559> you're<00:00:55.739> seeing<00:00:56.010> here<00:00:56.129> but

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
slightly on what you're seeing here but

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.090 
slightly on what you're seeing here but
nonetheless<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.600> key<00:00:57.899> difference<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.770> all

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
nonetheless the key difference is all

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.580 
nonetheless the key difference is all
within<00:00:59.579> the<00:01:00.090> wing<00:01:00.359> on<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.020> DualShock<00:01:01.260> 3

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
within the wing on the DualShock 3

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.500

fingers attached to the wing itself and

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.600 
fingers attached to the wing itself and
that<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.869> basically<00:01:07.080> all<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:08.040> space<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.549> I

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
that is basically all the space that I

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.270 
that is basically all the space that I
have<00:01:08.909> for<00:01:09.119> my<00:01:09.270> fingers<00:01:09.750> on<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.260> DualShock<00:01:10.560> 4

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
have for my fingers on the DualShock 4

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.550 
have for my fingers on the DualShock 4
two<00:01:11.790> fingers<00:01:12.240> can<00:01:12.450> fit<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:12.780> perfectly<00:01:13.260> fine

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
two fingers can fit in perfectly fine

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.050 
two fingers can fit in perfectly fine
but<00:01:13.799> if<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.010> want<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.280> go<00:01:14.369> all<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.580> way<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.850> be

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
but if you want to go all the way and be

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.929 
but if you want to go all the way and be
crazy<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:16.080> can<00:01:16.259> fit<00:01:16.500> three<00:01:17.100> fingers<00:01:17.580> this

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
crazy you can fit three fingers this

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.880 
crazy you can fit three fingers this
just<00:01:18.420> shows<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.840> how<00:01:18.869> much<00:01:19.350> more<00:01:19.619> space

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
just shows you how much more space

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.160 
just shows you how much more space
you're<00:01:20.369> going<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.640> be<00:01:20.729> able<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:21.119> grip<00:01:21.570> onto<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
you're going to be able to grip onto the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.070 
you're going to be able to grip onto the
playstation<00:01:22.890> 4<00:01:23.100> dualshock<00:01:23.790> 4<00:01:24.030> controller<00:01:24.210> and

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
playstation 4 dualshock 4 controller and

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.960 
playstation 4 dualshock 4 controller and
this<00:01:25.350> makes<00:01:25.590> all<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.369> difference<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
this makes all the difference in the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.580 
this makes all the difference in the
world<00:01:27.180> because<00:01:27.479> you're<00:01:27.810> finally<00:01:28.200> able<00:01:28.320> to
