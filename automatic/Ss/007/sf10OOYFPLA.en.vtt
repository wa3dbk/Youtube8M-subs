this game and I think that that's one of
the<00:04:36.930> greatest<00:04:37.930> parts<00:04:38.170> about<00:04:38.290> this<00:04:38.500> and<00:04:38.710> none

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
the greatest parts about this and none

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.800 
the greatest parts about this and none
demonic<00:04:39.580> there's<00:04:39.790> different<00:04:40.090> monsters<00:04:40.720> that

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
that you saw in the clips are probably

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.370 
that you saw in the clips are probably
some<00:06:41.890> of<00:06:41.920> the<00:06:42.010> best<00:06:42.190> on<00:06:42.550> the<00:06:43.300> PSP<00:06:43.720> along<00:06:44.200> with

some of the best on the PSP along with

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.980 
some of the best on the PSP along with
it<00:06:44.740> being<00:06:44.980> so<00:06:45.220> vast

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:45.990 
it being so vast

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.510 
it being so vast
the<00:06:46.990> graphics<00:06:47.350> are<00:06:47.440> probably<00:06:47.680> unmatched<00:06:48.130> I

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:48.520 
the graphics are probably unmatched I

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.460 
the graphics are probably unmatched I
think<00:06:48.850> yeah<00:06:49.150> God<00:06:49.360> of<00:06:49.510> War<00:06:49.630> teens<00:06:49.870> Olympus<00:06:50.260> has

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:50.470 
think yeah God of War teens Olympus has

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.140 
think yeah God of War teens Olympus has
amazing<00:06:51.130> graphics<00:06:51.490> but<00:06:51.670> it's<00:06:51.820> so<00:06:52.000> much

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:52.150 
amazing graphics but it's so much

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.770 
amazing graphics but it's so much
smaller<00:06:52.450> scale<00:06:52.930> compared<00:06:53.410> to<00:06:53.500> this<00:06:53.620> game<00:06:53.860> and

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780 
smaller scale compared to this game and

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.940 
smaller scale compared to this game and
this<00:06:55.780> game<00:06:56.020> probably<00:06:56.169> is<00:06:56.380> that<00:06:56.500> I'm<00:06:56.650> gonna<00:06:56.770> say

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:56.950 
this game probably is that I'm gonna say

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.880 
this game probably is that I'm gonna say
the<00:06:57.070> best<00:06:57.250> graphics<00:06:57.580> on<00:06:57.669> the<00:06:57.730> PSP<00:06:58.800> so<00:06:59.800> the

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:07.930 
full 10 star 10 outside um but the

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.570 
full 10 star 10 outside um but the
overall<00:07:08.169> enjoyability<00:07:08.560> this<00:07:08.950> game<00:07:09.190> it's

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:09.580 
overall enjoyability this game it's

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.330 
overall enjoyability this game it's
definitely<00:07:10.240> not<00:07:10.570> for<00:07:10.870> everybody<00:07:11.110> I<00:07:11.590> have<00:07:12.010> to<00:07:12.130> I

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:12.340 
definitely not for everybody I have to I

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.380 
definitely not for everybody I have to I
can't<00:07:12.580> stress<00:07:12.850> that<00:07:12.880> enough

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:13.390 
can't stress that enough

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.140 
can't stress that enough
but<00:07:14.140> really<00:07:14.710> I<00:07:14.740> would<00:07:15.040> say<00:07:15.190> give<00:07:15.520> us<00:07:15.669> a<00:07:15.850> chance

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:16.150 
but really I would say give us a chance

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.240 
but really I would say give us a chance
it<00:07:16.690> will<00:07:16.990> be<00:07:17.140> kind<00:07:17.380> of<00:07:17.470> hard<00:07:17.680> in<00:07:17.830> the<00:07:17.919> beginning

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:18.250 
it will be kind of hard in the beginning

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.250 
it will be kind of hard in the beginning
to<00:07:18.460> get<00:07:18.700> used<00:07:18.910> to<00:07:19.030> everything<00:07:19.150> but<00:07:19.990> once<00:07:20.140> you

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:20.260 
to get used to everything but once you

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.010 
to get used to everything but once you
start<00:07:20.470> like<00:07:21.400> making<00:07:21.790> new<00:07:21.820> armor<00:07:22.390> and<00:07:22.600> weapons

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:23.020 
start like making new armor and weapons

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.320 
start like making new armor and weapons
and<00:07:23.290> this<00:07:23.710> learning<00:07:24.010> like<00:07:24.430> how<00:07:24.610> monsters<00:07:25.030> work

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:25.330 
and this learning like how monsters work

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:28.680 
and this learning like how monsters work
it<00:07:25.990> really<00:07:26.620> really<00:07:27.430> becomes<00:07:27.880> a<00:07:28.090> great<00:07:28.360> game

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:28.690 
it really really becomes a great game

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.140 
it really really becomes a great game
and<00:07:29.290> it<00:07:29.470> you<00:07:29.740> will<00:07:29.860> just<00:07:29.919> be<00:07:30.280> engrossed<00:07:30.850> in

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:31.150 
and it you will just be engrossed in

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.940 
and it you will just be engrossed in
this<00:07:31.270> world<00:07:31.660> in<00:07:32.020> this<00:07:32.169> universe<00:07:32.680> and<00:07:32.830> you
