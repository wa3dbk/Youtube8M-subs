to try the long wear eye makeup but that

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.470 
to try the long wear eye makeup but that
is<00:02:23.220> what<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.489> look<00:02:23.730> for<00:02:23.760> so<00:02:25.280> this<00:02:26.280> has<00:02:26.459> a<00:02:26.700> CF<00:02:27.090> it

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
is what I look for so this has a CF it

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.259 
is what I look for so this has a CF it
and<00:02:28.130> so<00:02:29.130> that's<00:02:29.310> great<00:02:29.700> that's<00:02:29.880> not<00:02:30.090> that<00:02:30.209> much

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
and so that's great that's not that much

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.880 
and so that's great that's not that much
but<00:02:30.840> also<00:02:31.040> you<00:02:32.040> can<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:32.790> can't<00:02:33.230> it<00:02:34.230> says<00:02:34.650> its
