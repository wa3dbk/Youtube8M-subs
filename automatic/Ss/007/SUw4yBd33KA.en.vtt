YouTube's deal is you know they're

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.359 
YouTube's deal is you know they're

but here on Sean via Damon I feel that

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.109 
but here on Sean via Damon I feel that
this<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.159> pretty<00:01:50.340> good<00:01:50.520> raw<00:01:50.759> rating

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
this is a pretty good raw rating

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.210
