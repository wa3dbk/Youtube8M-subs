00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.240

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.140
 then what we will hear later 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.850
 first about cadel evans 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.769
 of course he was especially overpriced though 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.320
 the organization had another remarkable one 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.579
 reason not to get involved with evans 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.070
 we liked the look of the men 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.229
 turning to the candy criteria 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.360
 somewhat questionable headbutts and people 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.550
 beat the bottle and and and and 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.450
 pushing people away and so were one pulled 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.530
 kind of scared 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.240
 I always say not everyone is suitable 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.130
 to quote to ride and we had 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.170
 never in between i had a bit on it 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.570
 after my doubts about jeroen boelen 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.369
 Drunk on the old mountain biking evans though 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.649
 gladly he treated the 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.430
 reverse way first run away with it now 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:28.920

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.179

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.149
 This year's round is then in full 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.310
 shot back to the plan 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.910
 Andy Schleck of the yellow next 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.349
