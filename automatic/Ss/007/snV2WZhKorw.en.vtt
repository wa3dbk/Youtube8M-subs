made at home their little narrow
rectangles<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.710> couple<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.490> holes<00:00:14.759> so<00:00:15.210> I<00:00:15.240> can

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
rectangles a couple of holes so I can

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.970 
rectangles a couple of holes so I can
actually<00:00:15.870> pin<00:00:16.170> them<00:00:16.379> down

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
actually pin them down

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.450 
actually pin them down
like<00:00:17.640> that<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:18.600> keep<00:00:18.779> them<00:00:18.930> stable<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.740> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
like that to keep them stable and the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.640 
like that to keep them stable and the
elastic<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.000> hold<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.480> group<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.900> bobbins<00:00:22.289> and

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
elastic to hold a group of bobbins and

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.830 
elastic to hold a group of bobbins and
then<00:00:22.920> they<00:00:23.070> can<00:00:23.250> pile<00:00:23.490> up<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.210> you've<00:00:24.630> got

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
then they can pile up and you've got

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.670 
then they can pile up and you've got
lots<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.470> less<00:00:25.680> less<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.519> lot<00:00:27.180> more<00:00:27.390> space<00:00:27.810> okay

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
lots of less less a lot more space okay

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.759 
lots of less less a lot more space okay

actually just wait the bobbins so that
they<00:03:54.910> stay<00:03:55.660> where<00:03:55.930> they<00:03:56.080> should<00:03:56.410> be<00:03:56.650> okay

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
they stay where they should be okay

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.509 
they stay where they should be okay
so<00:03:58.269> and<00:03:58.540> you<00:03:58.750> just<00:03:59.019> stroked<00:03:59.410> like<00:03:59.650> this<00:03:59.890> okay

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
so and you just stroked like this okay

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.330 
so and you just stroked like this okay

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
and then I'm going back and then I'm

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.530 
and then I'm going back and then I'm
going<00:04:03.579> to<00:04:03.640> leave<00:04:03.910> these<00:04:04.630> two<00:04:04.930> out

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.009 

and<00:04:09.019> I'm<00:04:09.230> going<00:04:09.470> to<00:04:09.590> actually<00:04:10.189> take<00:04:10.780> take<00:04:11.780> them

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
and I'm going to actually take take them

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.729 
and I'm going to actually take take them
out<00:04:12.230> I<00:04:13.329> believe<00:04:14.329> is<00:04:14.900> the<00:04:15.049> way<00:04:15.170> I<00:04:15.200> was<00:04:15.379> going<00:04:15.470> to

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
out I believe is the way I was going to

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.729 
out I believe is the way I was going to
do<00:04:15.890> it<00:04:16.299> although<00:04:17.299> I<00:04:17.419> don't<00:04:17.660> know<00:04:17.930> that<00:04:18.079> we'll

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
do it although I don't know that we'll

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.439 
do it although I don't know that we'll
have<00:04:18.829> to<00:04:19.130> see<00:04:19.280> it<00:04:19.699> was<00:04:19.850> quite<00:04:20.090> interesting

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:20.449 
have to see it was quite interesting

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:22.350 
have to see it was quite interesting
because<00:04:20.690> with<00:04:21.049> this<00:04:21.260> sort<00:04:21.560> of<00:04:21.620> place<00:04:21.859> you<00:04:22.160> can

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
because with this sort of place you can

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.510 
because with this sort of place you can
change<00:04:23.360> the<00:04:23.690> way<00:04:23.810> you're<00:04:24.020> doing<00:04:24.050> it<00:04:24.530> you<00:04:25.310> can

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
change the way you're doing it you can

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.790 
change the way you're doing it you can
add<00:04:26.000> extra<00:04:26.570> threads<00:04:26.900> you<00:04:27.110> can<00:04:27.260> take<00:04:27.470> threads

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
add extra threads you can take threads

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.980 
add extra threads you can take threads
out<00:04:27.979> all<00:04:28.520> the<00:04:28.669> way<00:04:28.820> along<00:04:29.090> and<00:04:29.360> basically

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
out all the way along and basically

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:31.870 
out all the way along and basically
you'll<00:04:30.320> do<00:04:30.500> it<00:04:30.620> see<00:04:30.919> what<00:04:31.220> you<00:04:31.370> think<00:04:31.610> of<00:04:31.760> it

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
you'll do it see what you think of it

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.240 
you'll do it see what you think of it
and<00:04:32.180> if<00:04:32.419> you<00:04:32.539> don't<00:04:32.690> like<00:04:32.960> it<00:04:33.199> you<00:04:33.380> go<00:04:33.530> back<00:04:33.560> and

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
and if you don't like it you go back and

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.070 
and if you don't like it you go back and
you<00:04:34.370> redo<00:04:34.729> it<00:04:34.880> and<00:04:35.060> that's<00:04:35.479> why<00:04:35.630> I<00:04:35.660> haven't<00:04:35.960> got

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
you redo it and that's why I haven't got

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.890 
you redo it and that's why I haven't got
much<00:04:36.229> time<00:04:36.470> because<00:04:37.250> I<00:04:37.610> actually<00:04:38.330> had<00:04:38.660> come

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
much time because I actually had come

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.110 
much time because I actually had come
right<00:04:39.080> down<00:04:39.289> and<00:04:39.650> then<00:04:39.830> I<00:04:39.979> took<00:04:40.039> all<00:04:40.639> this<00:04:40.880> out

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
right down and then I took all this out

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.990 
right down and then I took all this out
because<00:04:41.479> it<00:04:42.050> just<00:04:42.110> was<00:04:42.470> not<00:04:42.770> it<00:04:43.400> just<00:04:43.699> wasn't

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
because it just was not it just wasn't

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.230 
because it just was not it just wasn't
dense<00:04:44.210> enough<00:04:44.570> and<00:04:45.289> even<00:04:45.889> now<00:04:46.130> it's<00:04:46.729> hardly

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
dense enough and even now it's hardly

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.050 
dense enough and even now it's hardly
the<00:04:47.360> density<00:04:47.990> I<00:04:48.020> would<00:04:48.350> like<00:04:48.910> because<00:04:49.910> these

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
the density I would like because these

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.930 
the density I would like because these
are<00:04:50.270> always<00:04:50.449> going<00:04:50.930> across<00:04:51.350> these<00:04:51.800> come<00:04:52.160> down

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
are always going across these come down

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.250 
are always going across these come down
here<00:04:53.389> okay

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
here okay

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.740 
here okay
and<00:04:54.410> these<00:04:54.650> will<00:04:54.860> come<00:04:55.070> down<00:04:55.280> here<00:04:55.580> the<00:04:56.360> run<00:04:56.600> of

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
and these will come down here the run of

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.930 
and these will come down here the run of
your<00:04:56.780> threads<00:04:57.289> when<00:04:58.100> you're<00:04:58.220> doing<00:04:58.490> cloth

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
your threads when you're doing cloth

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.790 
your threads when you're doing cloth
work<00:04:59.210> is<00:04:59.419> always<00:04:59.690> right<00:05:00.590> angles<00:05:01.100> to<00:05:01.430> your<00:05:01.639> edge

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
work is always right angles to your edge

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.300 
work is always right angles to your edge
okay<00:05:04.840> so<00:05:05.840> you<00:05:05.900> have<00:05:06.260> your<00:05:06.500> whole<00:05:06.680> pattern<00:05:06.979> is

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
okay so you have your whole pattern is

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:16.510 
okay so you have your whole pattern is
under<00:05:07.789> this<00:05:08.000> yes<00:05:08.570> it<00:05:09.139> is<00:05:12.610> yes<00:05:14.889> no<00:05:15.889> it<00:05:16.370> goes

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
under this yes it is yes no it goes

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.230 
under this yes it is yes no it goes
right<00:05:16.820> this<00:05:17.570> part<00:05:17.810> is<00:05:18.080> repeated<00:05:18.590> down<00:05:19.240> these

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
right this part is repeated down these

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.140 
right this part is repeated down these
two<00:05:20.479> yards<00:05:20.870> it<00:05:21.110> comes<00:05:21.320> down<00:05:21.500> to<00:05:21.710> here<00:05:22.150> it's

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
two yards it comes down to here it's

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.480 
two yards it comes down to here it's
it's<00:05:23.419> actually<00:05:23.960> it's<00:05:24.110> a<00:05:24.199> very<00:05:24.470> old<00:05:24.800> pattern

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
it's actually it's a very old pattern

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.480 
it's actually it's a very old pattern
that's<00:05:25.639> been<00:05:25.789> that<00:05:26.780> was<00:05:27.110> is<00:05:27.380> being<00:05:27.800> used<00:05:28.130> and

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
that's been that was is being used and

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
that's been that was is being used and
it<00:05:28.910> will<00:05:29.120> be<00:05:29.270> tough<00:05:29.900> on<00:05:30.760> clothing<00:05:31.760> remember

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510
