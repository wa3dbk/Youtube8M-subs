00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.549
 Hi there, Palmer and in this issue 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.630
 I want to show you how easy and simple 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:12.929
 you can hijack a plane from a military base 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:16.529
 just many have this problem 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:20.420
 what doesn't work kills us right away 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:23.600
 they all warm up and on the fly hunt 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:27.439
 There are basically two ways 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:31.320
 great company rockstar gave us 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:35.809
 awesome opportunity to somehow do 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.390
 it's all very easy to start calling 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.520
 pipe 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.829
 Our choice is so huge that I even 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:51.739
 I do not know who to choose dark chocolate or 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:51.739
 in trevor oh well chocolate hare fit 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:01:00.030
 make an appointment there you want a date 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.010
 by the way I apologize for taking off 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.180
 the camera just i'm a rogue and i have 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.200
 absolutely no money to buy a card 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.180
 video capture 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.810
 so you have to be content with 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:17.810
 what is but we made an appointment now 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.810
 we are going 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:30.870
 I rewind so as not to torment you 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:37.960
 almost drove up to our friend left . 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:40.740
 yes yes yes everything is cool for me to be a little 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.740
 touched 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:48.670
 so but now we are choosing a military base and 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:51.850
 More precisely, but we note we choose a little 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.890
 tired, you can principle absolutely any 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.300
 Which one do you like closer to me? 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:01.810
 this one but somehow more immediately 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:05.470
 I speak from the clothes of the character in principle 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:14.110
 still not dependent at all let you of his club 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:16.390
 dress at least like that here they will be fishing line 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.770
 rub and cry bla bla bla bla bla 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.770
 we rewind again 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:27.570
 but one almost got that piece of shit and 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.570
 decided to change to a faster car 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.180
 but she herself has 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.100
 we go to the base and shit it all 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.490
 somehow rockstar decided along the way 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.260
 gash when you're dating 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.830
 friend there you go on a date 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:55.420
 for some reason the garbage you is not so strange 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:58.420
 Why is this one thing calm? 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.420
 drive up 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:06.370
 the plane oh I didn't want to wear it came out 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.370
 by chance 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:17.040
 our chocolate friend will have to leave 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:19.440
 here and instead of the club Malibu and everyone there 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.580
 great drinks he will have 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.580
 die on this base 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.730
 but also calmly we fly away unnoticed and 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.730
 all I ask 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.150
 Well, now it remains to break away from 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.780
 chase i rewind again so you won't 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.870
 to torment 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:46.590
 but the easiest way 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.810
 fly away the water and change more often 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.360
 course 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:54.870
 fly right then sweat 1 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.870
 turned off 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.670
 farther 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.050
 but we have 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.050
 the stars are still burning 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:09.630
 just changed again just need to change 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.630
 from helicopter 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.310
 there is a base 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.310
 Well , calmly litin 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.499
 airport form fields 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:37.909
 that chase everything quickly when 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:45.160
 not a single shot was well at least 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:47.760
 least when you got to where did paris go 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.760
 what to dump 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:57.230
 but all the chase is not 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.230
 all perfectly 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.630
 dark base 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.980
 and here we are flying up to our airfield 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:26.460
 congratulations on landing thanks 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:29.700

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:32.540

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:35.760

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:39.780
 Yes, even there is such a mess when I wallpaper 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.910
 fly on his cheek did not have time but these 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.640
 The most common tank is just mine 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.830
 endures 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:50.160
 hijacking you also by the same method 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:52.680
 military aircraft only big but when 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.590
 you roll back some Makar he yes 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:58.200
 horseradish explodes and water or 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:00.180
 wing falls off or something else but with 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.180
 anything happens to it just to you 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:06.690
 from here did not burn until returned home 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:11.670
 walking is cooler but in the end you saw 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:13.740

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:18.650
