00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
used and Larry and I have used together

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.600 
used and Larry and I have used together
for<00:00:12.240> years<00:00:12.450> fishing<00:00:12.719> for<00:00:13.049> surface<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:14.250> one<00:00:14.519> of

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
for years fishing for surface and one of

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.730 
for years fishing for surface and one of
the<00:00:14.700> things<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.150> not<00:00:15.660> only<00:00:15.870> just<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.440> gear

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
the things is not only just the gear

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.080 
the things is not only just the gear
make<00:00:16.949> sure<00:00:17.100> you<00:00:17.190> have<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.400> right<00:00:17.550> rods<00:00:17.880> and

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.880 
make sure you have the right rods and
reels<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.570> like<00:00:18.750> year<00:00:19.109> because<00:00:19.619> that's<00:00:19.770> the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
reels of like year because that's the

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.800 
reels of like year because that's the
biggest<00:00:20.100> thing<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.580> I'm<00:00:20.699> glad<00:00:20.939> when<00:00:21.180> I'm<00:00:21.600> out

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
biggest thing and I'm glad when I'm out

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.150 
biggest thing and I'm glad when I'm out
there<00:00:21.840> I'm<00:00:22.109> seeing<00:00:22.320> more<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.650> more<00:00:22.740> people

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
there I'm seeing more and more people

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.849 
there I'm seeing more and more people
using<00:00:23.340> the<00:00:23.519> like<00:00:23.699> gear<00:00:24.000> but<00:00:24.810> probably<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
using the like gear but probably the

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.470 
using the like gear but probably the
most<00:00:25.890> important<00:00:26.519> thing<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.880> finding<00:00:27.180> the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
most important thing is finding the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.660 
most important thing is finding the
areas<00:00:27.779> where<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.170> fish<00:00:28.410> when<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.890> walk<00:00:29.640> down

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
areas where to fish when you walk down

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.999 
areas where to fish when you walk down
to<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.179> beach<00:00:30.449> take<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.230> little<00:00:31.590> bit<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.800> time

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
to the beach take a little bit of time

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.430 
to the beach take a little bit of time
and<00:00:32.279> look<00:00:32.550> at<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.910> beach<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.899> if<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.140> see<00:00:34.350> an

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
and look at the beach and if you see an

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.410 
and look at the beach and if you see an
area<00:00:34.680> where<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:34.920> think<00:00:34.980> there's<00:00:35.280> pockets<00:00:35.880> see

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
area where you think there's pockets see

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.720 
area where you think there's pockets see
a<00:00:36.450> lot<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.780> water<00:00:36.989> turning<00:00:37.350> around<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:38.460> see<00:00:38.700> a

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
a lot of water turning around you see a

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.760 
a lot of water turning around you see a
riptide<00:00:39.300> area<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:40.350> there's<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.590> lot<00:00:40.739> of

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
riptide area so there's a lot of

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.709 
riptide area so there's a lot of
movement<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.520> water<00:00:41.670> those<00:00:42.420> are<00:00:42.450> the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
movement in the water those are the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.080 
movement in the water those are the
spots<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.230> want<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.590> fish<00:00:43.829> if<00:00:44.040> it's<00:00:44.219> just<00:00:44.430> flat

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
spots you want a fish if it's just flat

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.700 
spots you want a fish if it's just flat
and<00:00:45.510> there's<00:00:45.629> no<00:00:45.809> white<00:00:46.050> water<00:00:46.320> at<00:00:46.559> all

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
and there's no white water at all

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.619 
and there's no white water at all
probably<00:00:47.489> not<00:00:47.670> going<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.850> catch<00:00:48.059> much<00:00:48.390> fish

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
probably not going to catch much fish

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.240 
probably not going to catch much fish
there<00:00:48.870> but<00:00:48.899> where<00:00:49.500> all<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.739> water<00:00:49.980> is

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
there but where all that water is

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.130 
there but where all that water is
turning<00:00:50.610> around<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.239> really<00:00:51.539> turbulent

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
turning around and really turbulent

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.959 
turning around and really turbulent
that's<00:00:52.710> where<00:00:52.920> those<00:00:53.010> surf<00:00:53.309> perch<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.670> can<00:00:53.820> be

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
that's where those surf perch I can be

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.510 
that's where those surf perch I can be
with<00:00:54.120> their<00:00:54.300> head<00:00:54.480> down<00:00:54.980> digging<00:00:55.980> into<00:00:56.190> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
with their head down digging into the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.790 
with their head down digging into the
sand<00:00:56.600> looking<00:00:57.600> for<00:00:57.780> those<00:00:57.870> sand<00:00:58.140> crabs<00:00:58.440> the

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
sand looking for those sand crabs the

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.979 
sand looking for those sand crabs the
worm<00:00:59.039> shrimps<00:00:59.730> anything<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.510> pops<00:01:00.719> loose

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
worm shrimps anything that pops loose

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.810 
worm shrimps anything that pops loose
that<00:01:01.140> they<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.500> eat<00:01:01.649> they<00:01:02.160> don't<00:01:02.340> swim<00:01:02.520> like<00:01:02.760> a

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
that they can eat they don't swim like a

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.939 
that they can eat they don't swim like a
normal<00:01:03.270> fish<00:01:03.449> up<00:01:03.629> on<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.870> surface<00:01:04.110> they<00:01:04.769> got

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
normal fish up on the surface they got

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.620 
normal fish up on the surface they got
their<00:01:05.129> heads<00:01:05.250> down<00:01:05.430> just<00:01:05.909> pounding<00:01:06.330> right<00:01:06.479> up

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
their heads down just pounding right up

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.660 
their heads down just pounding right up
on<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.869> sand<00:01:07.140> looking<00:01:07.920> for<00:01:08.100> things<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.520> eat

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
on the sand looking for things to eat

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.130 
on the sand looking for things to eat
they're<00:01:09.119> always<00:01:09.330> looking<00:01:09.659> for<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.080> next

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140

fish light line fish close to the edge
another<00:01:16.320> shore<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.920> then<00:01:17.549> also<00:01:17.820> when<00:01:18.780> you're
