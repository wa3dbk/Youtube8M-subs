00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
recreate that original shape what we

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.680 
recreate that original shape what we
want<00:03:29.359> instead<00:03:29.870> is<00:03:30.709> just<00:03:31.239> tacking<00:03:32.239> it<00:03:32.359> on<00:03:32.389> like

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:36.919 
sweet potatoes you can probably do sweet

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:40.900 
sweet potatoes you can probably do sweet
potato<00:03:36.950> boats<00:03:37.519> as<00:03:37.790> well<00:03:38.060> ah<00:03:39.370> like<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:40.519> idea<00:03:40.849> of

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
potato boats as well ah like the idea of

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.370 
potato boats as well ah like the idea of
that<00:03:41.120> so<00:03:41.359> you<00:03:41.480> just<00:03:41.510> do<00:03:41.780> it<00:03:41.870> exactly<00:03:42.019> the<00:03:42.349> same

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
that so you just do it exactly the same

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.620 
that so you just do it exactly the same
way<00:03:42.530> exactly<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.400> same<00:03:43.639> there<00:03:43.910> yes<00:03:44.329> that's<00:03:44.540> a

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
way exactly the same there yes that's a

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.599 
way exactly the same there yes that's a
nice<00:03:44.780> idea<00:03:45.049> isn't<00:03:45.440> it<00:03:45.560> sweet<00:03:45.889> potato<00:03:46.280> boats

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609
