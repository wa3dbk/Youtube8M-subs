00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:11.230
 hello to all the time is over 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.400
 what this guitar I think she 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.020
 is posted at 88 euros we had just 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.450
 a big dung who were all 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.460
 good fire and then that's the 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.720
 ceiba this super earlier is rather 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.119
 it is rather in progress anyway in 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.939
 this price range since here is the 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.560
 beautiful world and I have 80 cases a 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.380
 guitar obviously made in asia 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.320
 with woods we can not reach 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.390
 really to determine the global origin 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.430
 spruce lying around here and there of 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.840
 mahogany dresses also no matter how much 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.130
 sheet because the question we have to 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.750
 to pose when we see a guitar like 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.460
 it's so cheap that's what we are 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.550
 does not it sound small trick 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.109
 horizon from an aesthetic point of view 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.300
 with a rosewood easel a 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:57.929
 rosewood fingerboard 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:00.929
 we have a rosette in imitation marquetry 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:02.909
 Rosewood rather aesthetic parade in 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:04.920
 white plastic it's cheap but 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:08.850
 that's its effect we obviously find 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.460
 remember here on the heel everything is 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.979
 painted in matte black so what makes a 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.960
 finish classy enough here we have not 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.080
 really feel like having a guitar 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.120
 too cheap that's pretty well seen and we 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.760
 will listen now how does it sound 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.760
 I forgot to talk to you about mechanics 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.760
 oil bath so here really 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.560
 the standard equipment for a guitar 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.310
 entry-level and which my faith does not 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.310
 are not so bad 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.080
 Yes 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.720
 that's why you had this stand in 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.280
 more so nothing special to say if this 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.069
 is only a good surprise because 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.900
 that 88 euros we still have not a 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.380
 big dung we have a guitar 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.380
 nice
