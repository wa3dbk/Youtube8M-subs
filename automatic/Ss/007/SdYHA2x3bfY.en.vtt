00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
them in a location that's easy to get to

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.560 
them in a location that's easy to get to
so<00:01:47.220> we're<00:01:47.549> going<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.729> go<00:01:47.820> right<00:01:47.970> here<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.360> C

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570

little hot key combination there that

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.250 
little hot key combination there that
makes<00:04:56.890> it<00:04:56.980> even<00:04:57.100> better<00:04:57.220> but<00:04:58.150> this<00:04:58.870> is<00:04:59.050> also

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
makes it even better but this is also

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.140 
makes it even better but this is also
could<00:04:59.620> be<00:04:59.650> kind<00:04:59.920> of<00:04:59.950> a<00:05:00.040> lifesaver<00:05:00.460> sometimes

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150
