00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.030
 sunday 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.219
 the two other forms of billions of years 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:12.999
 contained by spouses meters sometimes these molecules possesses 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:17.079
 it hurts fragile which can participate resulting in an unstable molecule 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:21.599
 devoid of a meter this molecule is known as a free radical 

00:00:22.469 --> 00:00:25.699
 some free radicals naturally occur in our body 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.700
 through our metabolism yet these have many environmental factors that 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.719
 can cause excess free radicals such as pollution to smoke 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.890
 of cigarettes cheers and chemists other cases are stress 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.840
 the lack of sleep in the north and the lack of exercises of the experts believe that the 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.530
 caxinde tea are directly related to cases of diseases such as 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.780
 arthritis information 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.730
 but the site of the cancer entity 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.730
 soon they cement early and even cardiovascular problems I will 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.030
 seek to replace the electron that is absent these free radicals start to 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.230
 attack neighboring cells when attacked cells serve their side 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.080
 they become new places of risk, this can cause a reaction 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.870
 chain 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.090
 which helps a lot at night millions of molecules next game 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.080
 this chain reaction is known as stress as the considered city 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.620
 as the main cause of many diseases that attack our ideal course 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.340
 and how we can protect ourselves free discos well if this process 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.280
 destruction occurs because of oxidation 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.430
 then serious response beyond observation this signals through 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.380
 content consumption of the dispute the antioxidants disrupt this reaction 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.000
 chain when donating one of your projects automatically inscribed views only 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.690
 possible because the constant podium new year symposium of kaolin floating 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.730
 Your grandson is still stable. 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.160
 a group of researchers created a test to measure the ability of the 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.440
 good antioxidant and to pacify the free radicals of our organism this test is 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.610
 known as the testis of oxygen radical absorption capacity o 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.290
 test per action 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.369
 the fruits are thus tested and classified as 

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:19.579
 in the menu which is known as the number of orakzai or the anti-clockwise 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:24.829
 now let's see how fruit the output was found on a basis does not compare with 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:26.039
 the competition 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:30.299
 let's start with the tomato's ability to pacify radicals 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.739
 free in our body 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.269
 received new store aki of 60 the beer has been tested can be an hour shop that 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.479
 it was decent the same received the value also come down 

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:45.039
 the red propolis conquered 210 

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:50.639
 in the beginning we had wild received 260 now let's see how acai 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:55.239
 found lucila mente is a mafia that owns the patented process if 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.169
 compare with others he realized the value play here said thousand in 27 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.400
 based on data from the US Department of Agriculture as expected 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.860
 the fruit of açaí is 500 to thousand percent more powerful in the fight against 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.290
 free radicals than any other fruit or vegetable known as the ship 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.459
 using only a patented process that retains most of the 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:25.459
 açaí nutrients again this process is patented which means 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.080
 that any other açaí-based product does not contain the same value 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.140
 nutritious situation is found in the world affirmed
