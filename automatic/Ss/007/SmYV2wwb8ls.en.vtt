00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.110
 save all of spaces I am doctor 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:12.320
 white we are here today with a new video 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:16.009
 dedicated to nba 2k 15 and we do not launch 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.110
 still in the mai gm mode 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:20.270
 however, it will start this week already 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.990
 recorded a couple of episodes or only 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.039
 load them we focus on the defense 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.689
 because before we saw a little 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.090
 attack bottoms then learn i 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.580
 movements now we resume the defense 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.739
 as we saw some last year 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.330
 base for those approaching the first 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.449
 time this title because why the 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:41.510
 defense is the most complicated thing in nba 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.949
 2k 15 because the cpu especially levels 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.979
 of higher difficulties 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:48.110
 knows what he does so if you miss a 

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:50.420
 defend pipponi rounders and not only there 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.190
 able to defend much trust 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.729
 much to help from long though 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.489
 we begin to see first of all one 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:00.350
 trivial the defense part of the attack 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.619
 because it is a good attack that ends 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.180
 with a basket with a good shot there 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:07.700
 allows you to suffer a counterattack 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.579
 assuming you made a hurried shot 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.259
 with opponents taking rebound 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:14.390
 pardon counterattack immediately likely 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.359
 to take two points while if you do a 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.100
 good dog teach them must 

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:20.899
 put the must attack the defense 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.219
 fielded the surely difficult that 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.289
 don't stick in the field open in 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:26.119
 numerical superiority 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:30.380
 other thing to know the players 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:32.450
 opponents because why not all 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.369
 opponents pull from outside then to 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.630
 example when we mark reggio the rondo 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.020
 that doesn't have a great shot from outside 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.850
 we can take off a few meters 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.429
 so you weren't really attached to 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.729
 take two steps back maybe if instead 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:48.409
 we are marching, I would say that it is not the 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.109
 case of leaving him space for shooting from 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.780
 three is because otherwise it punishes itself 

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:57.380
 what we have a long which if it comes to 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.149
 receive on the Albert shot from three 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.490
 you can safely leave them if 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.310
 a griffin type that does not hit 3 s1 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.000
 dwight howard type 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.130
 bargnani 1b and avoid marked there too 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.739
 when I'm out 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.209
 other thing more generally if you see 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.390
 as in these situations this external 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:19.349
 the topic may not be the area 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.180
 very attacked part if it was the first 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.489
 at the last second and of the paintings of that 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.769
 case of strong depreciation in any case 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:30.069
 I'm always not saying a step though a 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.750
 in a bit more detached from the opponent in 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.730
 way to beat me on the first one 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.530
 step so you see stop slightly 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.140
 back so I try not to get beat 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.970
 if I am beaten exchange and goes by 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.430
 select one of the centers immediately 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.350
 however a great high brace 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.630
 to go and try to stop 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.599
 the opponent so as not to leave him 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.130
 however another easy penetration 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.250
 thing 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.480
 when in fact the ball is this year 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.360
 relatively easier to steal the ball 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.370
 when you have a good type player 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.230
 chris paul ricard ubi and so on 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.299
 and the socket that is making a change of 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.069
 hand maybe it's going to anyway 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.359
 getting into traffic in that case is you 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.880
 tried to steal the ball really is 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:13.840
 simple so you can also use 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:18.040
 that as an offensive and defensive weapon 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.470
 obviously sorry we close with the zones 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.540
 the areas must be all in the not there 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.850
 plus the 131 that are in the area more 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.739
 the community is also strong 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.530
 so rim was too pee in the decided of 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:32.620
 remove it what you want to do with e 23 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.000
 thieves two alternate second maybe 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.859
 of the skill of the creed among the 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.450
 opponents for it the number 23 was not 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.200
 second teams that pull well from 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.380
 distance 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.730
 in that case I prefer to use the 32 in 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.930
 so that I cover in front and then goes by 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.350
 double when the ball ends 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.760
 in the corner and every case you succeed in 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.989
 walter also take here with a 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.790
 rollover has managed to beat the 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.440
 area are very good years not 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.819
 use the whole game because first 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.359
 speaks on more then fits maybe 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:01.150
 change many types of defense during the 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:03.190
 same game and very last thing 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.310
 important that it is trivial you cannot 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.950
 cancel an opponent so if there is 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:12.130
 found in the charge in violent not 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:16.090
 think of being able to make them do 0 points 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:18.550
 phenomenal maybe you let me do 28 points 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.680
 however, he will always do them but maybe you do 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:23.200
 with low percentages so maybe pulls 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.170
 with 30 percent from the field so 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.750
 low percentages with those players there 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:31.690
 I have a tactic that I always repeat to you 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.940
 I try to concentrate on his companions 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.860
 so I try to pull companions 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.530
 maybe leave it and he appears 50 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.780
 counterweights the star makes 50 points on the 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.640
 comrades make it a 30 all together of 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.160
 happy set the school of the total has 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.020
 totaled only with so many points 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.610
 with have always concluded liked ha 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:52.650
 chosen a lay commentary registered at 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.650
 channel we will decide soon hi everyone
