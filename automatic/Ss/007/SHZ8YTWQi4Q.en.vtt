00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
actually was able to find a knife what

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.800 
actually was able to find a knife what
matter<00:03:27.849> I<00:03:27.940> remembered<00:03:28.390> that<00:03:28.450> I<00:03:28.510> had<00:03:28.569> this

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
matter I remembered that I had this

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.630 
matter I remembered that I had this
thing<00:03:29.050> and<00:03:29.260> I<00:03:29.680> haven't<00:03:30.010> used<00:03:30.129> it<00:03:30.340> in<00:03:30.400> forever

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
thing and I haven't used it in forever

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.520 
thing and I haven't used it in forever
because<00:03:31.000> that's<00:03:31.569> not<00:03:31.810> my<00:03:31.900> line<00:03:32.080> of<00:03:32.110> work<00:03:32.230> I

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530

just thought it'd be cool tool to have

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.500 
just thought it'd be cool tool to have
so<00:03:35.340> I'm<00:03:36.340> gonna<00:03:36.580> use<00:03:36.730> some<00:03:36.970> more<00:03:37.120> of<00:03:37.209> these<00:03:37.299> of

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
so I'm gonna use some more of these of

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:47.820 
so I'm gonna use some more of these of
course<00:03:45.599> I'm<00:03:46.599> super<00:03:46.930> super<00:03:47.049> super<00:03:47.410> excited

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
course I'm super super super excited

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.559 
course I'm super super super excited
about<00:03:47.950> this<00:03:48.130> because<00:03:48.700> when<00:03:49.030> you<00:03:49.120> use<00:03:49.299> like<00:03:49.540> a

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
about this because when you use like a

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.050 
about this because when you use like a
USB<00:03:49.930> microphone<00:03:50.230> you've<00:03:51.010> got<00:03:51.190> to<00:03:51.340> like<00:03:51.549> merge

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
USB microphone you've got to like merge

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.089 
USB microphone you've got to like merge
the<00:03:52.299> audio<00:03:52.569> together<00:03:52.959> unlink<00:03:53.590> their<00:03:53.829> main

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
audio from the camera and then like get

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:58.020 
audio from the camera and then like get
the<00:03:56.530> syncing<00:03:56.950> up<00:03:57.099> right<00:03:57.340> that's<00:03:57.549> why<00:03:57.700> like<00:03:57.880> I

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
the syncing up right that's why like I

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.809 
the syncing up right that's why like I
clap<00:03:58.360> sometimes<00:03:58.870> to<00:03:59.290> get<00:03:59.410> the<00:03:59.670> points<00:04:00.670> and

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
clap sometimes to get the points and

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.390 
clap sometimes to get the points and
sync<00:04:01.090> and<00:04:01.269> stuff<00:04:01.510> but<00:04:02.200> with<00:04:02.829> this<00:04:03.010> you<00:04:03.310> don't

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
sync and stuff but with this you don't

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.720 
sync and stuff but with this you don't
have<00:04:03.549> to<00:04:03.640> do<00:04:03.760> that<00:04:04.920> okay<00:04:05.920> so<00:04:05.950> it<00:04:06.280> has<00:04:06.310> little

longer<00:06:04.970> okay<00:06:06.220> so<00:06:07.220> basically<00:06:07.760> what<00:06:08.330> I<00:06:08.360> was

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:08.540 
longer okay so basically what I was

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.090 
longer okay so basically what I was
trying<00:06:08.780> to<00:06:08.810> say<00:06:09.050> in<00:06:09.470> that<00:06:09.650> part<00:06:09.860> of<00:06:09.890> the<00:06:09.980> video

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.100 
trying to say in that part of the video

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.670 
trying to say in that part of the video
is<00:06:10.280> that<00:06:10.760> the<00:06:10.970> decibel<00:06:11.510> gain<00:06:11.540> was<00:06:11.870> at<00:06:12.020> like<00:06:12.170> 32

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 
is that the decibel gain was at like 32

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.860 
is that the decibel gain was at like 32
through<00:06:13.100> magic<00:06:13.370> lantern<00:06:13.730> the<00:06:14.060> settings<00:06:14.780> were

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870 
through magic lantern the settings were

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.750 
through magic lantern the settings were
on<00:06:14.960> automatic<00:06:15.650> for<00:06:15.830> the<00:06:15.860> microphone<00:06:16.340> because

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:16.760 
on automatic for the microphone because

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.150 
on automatic for the microphone because
I<00:06:16.970> can<00:06:17.120> set<00:06:17.360> them<00:06:17.540> manually<00:06:17.900> inside<00:06:18.890> the

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
I can set them manually inside the

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.370 
I can set them manually inside the
cameras<00:06:19.820> default<00:06:20.210> firmware<00:06:20.630> and<00:06:20.810> then<00:06:21.080> I<00:06:21.170> can

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.380 
cameras default firmware and then I can

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.770 
cameras default firmware and then I can
also<00:06:21.620> like<00:06:22.040> do<00:06:22.400> the<00:06:22.580> gain<00:06:22.820> to<00:06:22.850> the<00:06:23.120> camp

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:23.780 
also like do the gain to the camp

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.300 
also like do the gain to the camp
through<00:06:24.080> the<00:06:24.110> microphone<00:06:24.800> so<00:06:25.010> there's<00:06:25.160> like

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.310 
through the microphone so there's like

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.770 
through the microphone so there's like
freaking<00:06:25.790> three<00:06:26.030> different<00:06:26.300> settings<00:06:26.600> I<00:06:26.630> got

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.780 
freaking three different settings I got

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.840 
freaking three different settings I got
to<00:06:26.870> play<00:06:26.990> with<00:06:27.050> and<00:06:27.440> this<00:06:28.190> next<00:06:28.520> part<00:06:28.790> you're

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:28.850 
to play with and this next part you're

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.940 
to play with and this next part you're
gonna<00:06:28.970> listen<00:06:29.330> to<00:06:29.480> sounds<00:06:29.990> so<00:06:30.080> much<00:06:30.380> much<00:06:30.680> much

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:30.950 
gonna listen to sounds so much much much

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.890 
gonna listen to sounds so much much much
better<00:06:31.280> but<00:06:31.760> I<00:06:31.820> still<00:06:32.210> got<00:06:32.390> things<00:06:32.600> to<00:06:32.750> work

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 
better but I still got things to work

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.360 
better but I still got things to work
out<00:06:33.080> I<00:06:33.350> mean<00:06:33.560> this<00:06:33.650> is<00:06:33.770> a<00:06:33.830> learning<00:06:34.190> process

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:34.370 
out I mean this is a learning process

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.030 
out I mean this is a learning process
and<00:06:34.730> I'm<00:06:35.000> gonna<00:06:35.270> get<00:06:35.540> this<00:06:35.720> all<00:06:36.020> right<00:06:36.470> so<00:06:36.800> I've

and I'm gonna get this all right so I've

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.830 
and I'm gonna get this all right so I've
left<00:06:37.280> the<00:06:37.460> microphone<00:06:38.060> alone<00:06:38.300> it's<00:06:38.570> still<00:06:38.750> at

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 
left the microphone alone it's still at

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.560 
left the microphone alone it's still at
20<00:06:39.080> this<00:06:39.200> will<00:06:39.380> gain<00:06:39.530> and<00:06:39.770> I<00:06:40.490> changed<00:06:41.180> magic

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:41.570 
20 this will gain and I changed magic

20 this will gain and I changed magic
lantern<00:06:41.930> to<00:06:42.080> about<00:06:42.230> 17<00:06:42.680> decibel<00:06:43.070> gains<00:06:43.220> so<00:06:43.460> of

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:43.940 
lantern to about 17 decibel gains so of
