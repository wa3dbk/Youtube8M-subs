00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello to all of you here as to 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.390
 street 5.7 in person to show you 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.280
 how today is a little 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.650
 tutorial how we go up and down 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.509
 the mini or the had it depends how we 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.920
 so called it there are two techniques the 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.809
 technique of the milk and the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.190
 180 good technique I'm going to start 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.840
 by the technique of the feignasse that 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:28.859
 it's the easiest and the civa's place 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:31.380
 everyone so as you have seen 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.730
 the last one quite simple beat and 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.790
 professionals in the immediate future but 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.980
 accessible to everyone not by taste 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.680
 the cellars and that are downstairs you take 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.149
 speed in it so you speed up and 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.469
 when you get to the level of the 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.719
 curve so the place where it's like 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.980
 that you simply turn the 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.530
 handlebars to take the speed in 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.960
 coming down from a co so now on 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.750
 goes to the 180 technique slightly 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.489
 faster and more difficult to achieve 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.020
 so it just consists of 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.379
 take a little speed 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.750
 after when we come here to go 180 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.090
 to take the speed after finishing in 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.900
 amount by accelerating and pedaling I 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.900
 will show you right away 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:20.560
 so as you've seen it be 80 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.689
 it's slightly more complicated to do 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.610
 but we manage to take more speed 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:26.439
 of course you have to finish in 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.659
 accelerating much higher levels 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:31.179
 of the end so the 180 who is I the 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.310
 recalls a full half turn with the 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:36.759
 bike which involves taking the 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.319
 December speed in the curve so 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.770
 to improve its performance 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:42.789
 and goes up faster 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.280
 now i will explain to you the 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.590
 more difficult so how to get off the 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.299
 curve the girlfriend and who is still 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.220
 enough to tilt as you can 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.439
 see so she is not so obvious that 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.989
 so to take so what I advise to 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:58.270
 those who start level bmx that's all 

00:01:55.989 --> 00:02:02.439
 to just put the bmx 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.509
 across, m pedaling above and getting 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.280
 so let's just slide the bmx of 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.989
 through why because for those who 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.729
 have a group the atom me I have a little 

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:11.349
 so it's not the same for these on a 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.879
 big plateau the big boat will not pass 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.319
 not the bar so precisely they 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:16.390
 knew about it and you risk yourself 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.769
 break the mouth so you make it simple 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:24.090
 if to really put the pedalos on 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.090
 level and coming of work 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.130
 so this little tutorial go pretty short is 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.960
 now finished so when you have 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.450
 saw I explain to you how to ride and 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.070
 get off the mini blues are not 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.440
 all have the same subject there it's done 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.660
 we will say in kind of metal plastic 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.950
 so it iss a bit so what has it 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.570
 sticks a little bit more it will be a lot more 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.340
 simple 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.720
 so we may find ourselves a 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.970
 next time for a new one at all 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.680
 if I had requested movements or other 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.850
 thing a figures session or whatever 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.850
 hello
