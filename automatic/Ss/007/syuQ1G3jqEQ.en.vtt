00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:11.580
 hi guys i just snic free and some 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.370
 days ago I taught you how 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.550
 clean a glaze and video glass 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.220
 I promised to teach so well what 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.850
 make with this glass the voids and 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.119
 the day has finally come, today is day of 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.320
 learn how to make a mix of 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.599
 glitter 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.840
 You'll need a bottle of 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.800
 Empty enamel a paper cone that 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.649
 will serve as your glitter funnel 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.520
 preference which as you choose 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:48.180
 want stainless steel balls for 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.219
 help in mixing a straw a spatula 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.210
 something to help you get the 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:57.180
 glitter and deposit a base of 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:00.020
 suspension in this case I chose this 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.340
 fashion enamel he is the 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.409
 crystallizer is found in 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.290
 perfumery which is a bit more 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.100
 thicker than a normal base after 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.460
 you blend it does not let the glitter of 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.850
 sing on the bottom of the glass and with 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.580
 a colorless or very bright base 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.820
 if you think the enamel is too 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.680
 so you can use it to 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.860
 make it thinner 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.409
 put the ball inside the glass this 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.200
 ball people she will help mix the 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.700
 iter and it needs to be oxidized to green 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:42.390
 so as not to rust and ruin the enamel 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:46.500
 position the funnel to help 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:50.579
 glitter placement and I 'm going to use this 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.640
 shrimp and blue whiting along with a steak 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:57.420
 yellow that has there in the snake shop in 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.240
 My little shop and also with good 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.570
 thin 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.500
 a gold that is the pass mark 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.630
 nati 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.360
 I'll leave it there on the blog where you can 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.300
 find all these products 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.130
 It's fine if you have nothing to see there. 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.400
 on the blog on the link that will be here 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:19.930
 below the video and with the spatula 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:23.620
 I'll slowly put the glitter 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.239
 inside the glass you will notice there 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.390
 it will start to fall 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:32.260
 I do not make a whole glass of enamel 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.420
 because it's difficult because we do not use 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.299
 whole enamel so ever so 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.030
 When I make mix I do not put 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.230
 the enamel to the mouth of the glass I 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:49.090
 I always do a little bit 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:52.959
 and I'll put a third of the 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.180
 height I want to glaze 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.540
 so if I want to enamel until half 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.480
 small bottle I will calculate three shares 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:06.519
 this half and the first part will be 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:10.720
 only to stop the next step is to put the 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:15.700
 suspension inside the glass then 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:18.810
 will only begin to spill the base until the 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:23.109
 the enamel height you want 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.519
 remembering if you make it to the mouth of the 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.709
 enamel 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:29.470
 be careful to always leave a 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.620
 because there's still going to be a 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.380
 brush inside the glass so if you 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.890
 put the glass up to the mouth 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.620
 explode when you close the 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.680
 This has already happened to me then. 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:48.700
 Beware people, now just close the 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:52.870
 Little glass rock the ball goes 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.700
 help mix and I thought it was 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.389
 a little thick so I put a 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:01.569
 the colorless base and that's it. 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:02.440
 people are very very easy for you to do 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.200
 a mix 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.350
 the glitter you can choose the 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:12.280
 criteria you want to be able to 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:15.520
 mix and a translucent base 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:19.120
 so you can use any color 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.400
 enamel and pass it over 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.700
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.910
 video plus a video still provesi and me 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:31.480

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.550
