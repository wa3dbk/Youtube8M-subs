gonna do it from right here it's just
not<00:02:54.990> gonna<00:02:55.110> happen<00:02:55.190> now<00:02:56.190> we<00:02:56.250> break<00:02:56.460> through

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
not gonna happen now we break through

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.400 
not gonna happen now we break through
this<00:02:56.790> as<00:02:57.090> we<00:02:57.240> see<00:02:57.390> we<00:02:57.540> have<00:02:57.630> some<00:02:57.840> more<00:02:57.990> fruit

this as we see we have some more fruit

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.440 
this as we see we have some more fruit
fuckers<00:02:58.740> fucking<00:02:59.640> off<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.150> then<00:03:00.300> right<00:03:00.420> over

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
fuckers fucking off and then right over

here<00:03:00.720> we<00:03:00.810> have<00:03:00.930> a<00:03:00.960> board<00:03:01.380> now<00:03:01.920> this<00:03:02.160> again<00:03:02.490> this

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
here we have a board now this again this

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.340 
here we have a board now this again this
is<00:03:02.760> another<00:03:03.120> split<00:03:03.690> where<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:03.990> can<00:03:04.200> actually

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
is another split where you can actually

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.080 
is another split where you can actually
take<00:03:04.650> two<00:03:04.800> different<00:03:05.070> routes<00:03:05.250> now<00:03:05.730> all<00:03:05.910> of

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
take two different routes now all of

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.430 
take two different routes now all of
these<00:03:06.210> that<00:03:06.360> i'm<00:03:06.480> doing<00:03:06.810> this<00:03:06.900> is<00:03:07.050> not<00:03:07.200> quite

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
these that i'm doing this is not quite

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.660 
these that i'm doing this is not quite
the<00:03:07.500> way<00:03:07.740> that<00:03:07.770> you<00:03:07.980> would<00:03:08.100> do<00:03:08.220> it<00:03:08.340> i<00:03:08.400> just<00:03:08.550> want

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
the way that you would do it i just want

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.800 
the way that you would do it i just want
to<00:03:08.730> break<00:03:08.880> it<00:03:08.910> so<00:03:09.090> i<00:03:09.120> can<00:03:09.270> show<00:03:09.360> you<00:03:09.390> guys<00:03:09.630> two

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
to break it so i can show you guys two

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.530 
to break it so i can show you guys two
different<00:03:10.110> routes<00:03:10.260> you<00:03:10.710> can<00:03:10.740> hit<00:03:11.010> all<00:03:11.040> these

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
different routes you can hit all these

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.940 
different routes you can hit all these
flawlessly<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:12.870> get<00:03:12.990> a<00:03:13.020> really<00:03:13.440> good<00:03:13.470> time<00:03:13.770> on

this track using either one of the two

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.449 
this track using either one of the two
routes<00:03:16.080> now<00:03:16.530> of<00:03:16.620> course<00:03:16.770> is<00:03:16.920> another<00:03:17.160> easter

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
routes now of course is another easter

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.580 
routes now of course is another easter
egg<00:03:17.580> in<00:03:17.730> here<00:03:17.760> a<00:03:18.000> very<00:03:18.300> easy<00:03:18.600> jump<00:03:19.050> to<00:03:19.170> make<00:03:19.380> so

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
egg in here a very easy jump to make so

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.020 
egg in here a very easy jump to make so
some<00:03:19.830> of<00:03:19.860> that<00:03:20.010> probably<00:03:20.280> everybody's<00:03:20.820> going

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
some of that probably everybody's going

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.340 
some of that probably everybody's going
to<00:03:21.120> miss<00:03:21.270> but<00:03:21.450> here's<00:03:21.600> a<00:03:21.690> great<00:03:21.870> view<00:03:22.050> of<00:03:22.320> the

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
to miss but here's a great view of the

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.710 
to miss but here's a great view of the
shithole<00:03:22.950> that<00:03:23.520> makes<00:03:23.670> it<00:03:23.730> he<00:03:23.820> said<00:03:24.000> then<00:03:24.660> of

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
shithole that makes it he said then of

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.699 
shithole that makes it he said then of
course<00:03:24.870> we<00:03:24.959> have<00:03:25.050> another<00:03:25.260> one<00:03:25.380> we<00:03:25.470> slide

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
course we have another one we slide

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.470 
course we have another one we slide
right<00:03:26.040> in<00:03:26.130> here<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.459> cab<00:03:26.610> catches<00:03:27.000> on<00:03:27.120> fire

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
right in here the cab catches on fire

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.990 
right in here the cab catches on fire
the<00:03:27.900> cab<00:03:28.110> explodes<00:03:28.740> who<00:03:29.220> fucking<00:03:29.520> disappears

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
the cab explodes who fucking disappears

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.690 
the cab explodes who fucking disappears
and<00:03:30.240> then<00:03:30.450> pack<00:03:31.020> sign<00:03:31.290> moving<00:03:32.130> forward<00:03:32.310> we<00:03:32.459> see

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
and then pack sign moving forward we see

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.070 
and then pack sign moving forward we see
that<00:03:32.790> there's<00:03:32.970> another<00:03:33.330> split<00:03:33.720> right<00:03:33.840> here

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
that there's another split right here

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.630 
that there's another split right here
yes<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.440> arrows<00:03:34.680> point<00:03:34.920> down<00:03:35.100> but<00:03:35.280> you<00:03:35.310> can

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
yes the arrows point down but you can

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.910 
yes the arrows point down but you can
break<00:03:35.970> this<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.480> go<00:03:36.570> up<00:03:36.720> there<00:03:37.020> it's<00:03:37.560> a<00:03:37.680> little

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
break this and go up there it's a little

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.620 
break this and go up there it's a little
bit<00:03:38.010> faster<00:03:38.250> if<00:03:38.490> you<00:03:38.580> hit<00:03:38.670> it<00:03:38.700> just<00:03:38.970> right<00:03:39.120> with

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
bit faster if you hit it just right with

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.720 
bit faster if you hit it just right with
of<00:03:39.840> course<00:03:40.020> the<00:03:40.140> Phoenix<00:03:40.620> 250<00:03:40.980> underneath

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
of course the Phoenix 250 underneath

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.280 
of course the Phoenix 250 underneath
there's<00:03:42.000> just<00:03:42.150> a<00:03:42.180> simple<00:03:42.450> ramp<00:03:42.690> go<00:03:42.959> up<00:03:43.080> this

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
there's just a simple ramp go up this

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.600 
there's just a simple ramp go up this
and<00:03:45.230> maybe<00:03:46.230> not<00:03:46.620> quite<00:03:46.890> as<00:03:46.950> simple<00:03:47.220> as<00:03:47.459> I<00:03:47.520> had

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
and maybe not quite as simple as I had

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.210 
and maybe not quite as simple as I had
originally<00:03:47.970> thought<00:03:48.000> there<00:03:48.840> we<00:03:49.350> go<00:03:49.530> ok<00:03:49.980> now

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
originally thought there we go ok now

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.460 
originally thought there we go ok now
let's<00:03:50.250> fall<00:03:50.910> into<00:03:51.239> the<00:03:51.330> pits<00:03:51.600> so<00:03:52.200> we<00:03:52.290> get<00:03:52.440> a

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
let's fall into the pits so we get a

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.470 
let's fall into the pits so we get a
good<00:03:52.680> view<00:03:52.890> of<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.040> pack<00:03:53.280> sign<00:03:53.610> and<00:03:54.030> all<00:03:54.360> the

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
good view of the pack sign and all the

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.000 
good view of the pack sign and all the
nonsense<00:03:54.660> back<00:03:55.020> there<00:03:55.260> jump<00:03:55.830> through<00:03:55.920> the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
nonsense back there jump through the

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.380 
nonsense back there jump through the
window<00:03:56.040> here<00:03:56.640> and<00:03:56.970> we<00:03:57.030> break<00:03:57.180> through<00:03:57.300> the

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
window here and we break through the

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.970 
window here and we break through the
glass<00:03:57.420> this<00:03:57.900> is<00:03:57.989> where<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:58.200> track<00:03:58.410> ends<00:03:58.680> not

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
glass this is where the track ends not

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.410 
glass this is where the track ends not
before<00:03:59.430> we<00:03:59.640> jump<00:03:59.940> in<00:04:00.030> here<00:04:00.239> and<00:04:00.300> get

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
before we jump in here and get

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.210 
before we jump in here and get
electrocuted<00:04:00.870> and<00:04:01.290> of<00:04:01.620> course<00:04:01.650> we<00:04:01.980> catch<00:04:02.160> a

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
electrocuted and of course we catch a

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.290 
electrocuted and of course we catch a
fire<00:04:02.370> which<00:04:02.610> happens<00:04:02.940> when<00:04:03.180> you<00:04:03.239> get

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
fire which happens when you get

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.760 
fire which happens when you get
recruited<00:04:03.690> by<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.900> way<00:04:04.020> break<00:04:04.590> through<00:04:04.709> the

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
recruited by the way break through the

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.800 
recruited by the way break through the
glass<00:04:04.800> one<00:04:05.100> more<00:04:05.220> time<00:04:05.489> gonna<00:04:06.300> jump<00:04:06.510> over<00:04:06.600> this

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
glass one more time gonna jump over this

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.080 
glass one more time gonna jump over this
give<00:04:07.200> a<00:04:07.230> little<00:04:07.380> right<00:04:07.920> there<00:04:08.160> and<00:04:08.489> that<00:04:08.520> is

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
give a little right there and that is

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.630 
give a little right there and that is
the<00:04:09.360> end<00:04:09.540> of<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:09.900> track<00:04:10.230> now<00:04:11.190> I<00:04:11.220> know<00:04:11.370> what<00:04:11.580> you

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
the end of the track now I know what you
