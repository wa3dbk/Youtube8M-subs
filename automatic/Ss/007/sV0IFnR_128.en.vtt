00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
fourth level it's the last hour but it's

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.640 
fourth level it's the last hour but it's
very<00:03:06.120> hard<00:03:06.510> because<00:03:07.370> there<00:03:09.080> as<00:03:10.080> I<00:03:10.440> was<00:03:10.620> saying

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
very hard because there as I was saying

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.470 
very hard because there as I was saying
this<00:03:11.190> was<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:12.890> hardest<00:03:13.890> part<00:03:14.370> of<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:15.239> mall

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
this was the hardest part of the mall

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.259 
this was the hardest part of the mall
because<00:03:15.750> there's<00:03:16.850> level<00:03:17.850> a<00:03:18.290> 75<00:03:19.790> but<00:03:20.790> somewhere

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
because there's level a 75 but somewhere

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.520 
because there's level a 75 but somewhere
there<00:03:21.660> are<00:03:21.989> higher<00:03:22.410> level<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:23.610> cause<00:03:24.530> they're

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
there are higher level and cause they're

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.259 
there are higher level and cause they're
really<00:03:26.010> kind<00:03:26.820> of<00:03:27.000> hard<00:03:27.330> to<00:03:27.660> get<00:03:28.200> because<00:03:29.269> when

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
really kind of hard to get because when

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.530 
really kind of hard to get because when
