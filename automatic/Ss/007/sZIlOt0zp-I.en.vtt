of<00:01:27.630> all<00:01:27.740> it's<00:01:28.740> got<00:01:28.979> six<00:01:29.250> on<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.700> think<00:01:29.909> that's

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
of all it's got six on it I think that's

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.280 
of all it's got six on it I think that's
quite<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.270> parent<00:01:30.720> that's<00:01:30.780> quite<00:01:31.049> clear<00:01:31.259> to

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
quite a parent that's quite clear to

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.960 
quite a parent that's quite clear to
everyone<00:01:31.590> think<00:01:32.250> we<00:01:32.369> can<00:01:32.490> all<00:01:32.579> agree<00:01:32.610> on<00:01:32.880> that

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
everyone think we can all agree on that

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.020 
everyone think we can all agree on that
and<00:01:33.780> also<00:01:34.110> it's<00:01:34.530> kind<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.799> base<00:01:35.340> green<00:01:35.790> which

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
and also it's kind of base green which

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.609 
and also it's kind of base green which
is<00:01:36.180> kind<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.390> grand<00:01:36.750> theft<00:01:36.780> auto's<00:01:37.200> theme<00:01:37.439> I

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
is kind of grand theft auto's theme I

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.620 
is kind of grand theft auto's theme I
suppose<00:01:37.950> they've<00:01:38.130> always<00:01:38.280> had<00:01:39.000> green<00:01:39.329> colors

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
suppose they've always had green colors

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.450 
suppose they've always had green colors
and<00:01:39.780> their<00:01:39.869> titles<00:01:40.290> or<00:01:40.409> whatnot<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:40.740> yeah<00:01:41.430> I

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
and their titles or whatnot so yeah I

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.590 
and their titles or whatnot so yeah I
don't<00:01:41.700> know<00:01:41.759> if<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:41.939> means<00:01:42.030> anything<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.450> you

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
don't know if that means anything to you

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.990 
don't know if that means anything to you
guys<00:01:42.689> but<00:01:42.899> anyway<00:01:43.170> um<00:01:43.670> so<00:01:44.670> it's<00:01:44.759> got<00:01:44.880> the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
guys but anyway um so it's got the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.120 
guys but anyway um so it's got the
number<00:01:45.270> six<00:01:45.570> with<00:01:45.899> kind<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.409> chains<00:01:46.619> across<00:01:46.890> it

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
number six with kind of chains across it

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.429 
number six with kind of chains across it
so<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.310> looks<00:01:47.460> like<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.939> cover<00:01:48.720> design<00:01:49.229> as<00:01:49.409> well

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
so it looks like a cover design as well

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.020 
so it looks like a cover design as well
as<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.829> sink<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.399> that's<00:01:50.579> kind<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.820> interesting

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
as a sink so that's kind of interesting

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.690 
as a sink so that's kind of interesting
the<00:01:51.299> same<00:01:51.450> time<00:01:51.720> now<00:01:51.960> when<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.649> saw<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.040> six<00:01:53.430> I

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
the same time now when I saw the six I

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.609 
the same time now when I saw the six I
didn't<00:01:54.180> actually<00:01:54.299> think<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.930> was<00:01:55.049> an<00:01:55.229> easter

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
didn't actually think it was an easter

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.429 
didn't actually think it was an easter
egg<00:01:55.649> because<00:01:56.159> all<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.329> other<00:01:57.509> gtas<00:01:58.110> have

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
egg because all of the other gtas have

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.700 
egg because all of the other gtas have
always<00:01:58.950> used<00:01:59.390> Roman<00:02:00.390> numerals<00:02:01.020> for<00:02:01.590> the

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
always used Roman numerals for the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.010 
always used Roman numerals for the
numbers<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.250> while<00:02:03.000> they<00:02:03.210> just<00:02:03.420> change<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.899> at

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
numbers and while they just change it at

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.840 
numbers and while they just change it at
this<00:02:04.049> point<00:02:04.380> so<00:02:04.740> doesn't<00:02:05.490> make<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.610> lot<00:02:05.790> of

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
this point so doesn't make a lot of

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.510 
this point so doesn't make a lot of
sense<00:02:05.939> maybe<00:02:06.509> it's<00:02:06.899> it's<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.590> it's<00:02:07.920> referring

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
sense maybe it's it's a it's referring

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.809 
sense maybe it's it's a it's referring
to<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:09.090> new<00:02:09.929> GTA<00:02:10.349> which<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:10.890> obviously<00:02:11.160> GTA<00:02:11.520> 6

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
to a new GTA which is obviously GTA 6

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.370 
to a new GTA which is obviously GTA 6
but

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
but

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.900 
but
we<00:02:13.710> don't<00:02:13.800> actually<00:02:14.010> know<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.460> official<00:02:14.580> name

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
we don't actually know the official name

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.730 
we don't actually know the official name
of<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.180> yet<00:02:15.360> but<00:02:15.600> I<00:02:15.840> thought<00:02:16.410> was<00:02:16.560> kind<00:02:16.650> of

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
of it yet but I thought was kind of

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.770 
of it yet but I thought was kind of
interesting<00:02:16.860> because<00:02:17.310> at<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.330> exact<00:02:18.600> same

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
interesting because at the exact same

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.200 
interesting because at the exact same
time<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.230> kind<00:02:19.470> of<00:02:19.560> looks<00:02:19.710> like<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:19.890> padlock<00:02:20.250> why

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
time it kind of looks like a padlock why

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.000 
time it kind of looks like a padlock why
would<00:02:21.390> you<00:02:21.420> have<00:02:21.570> a<00:02:21.600> padlock<00:02:22.080> in<00:02:22.320> this<00:02:22.710> kind<00:02:22.980> of

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
would you have a padlock in this kind of

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.760 
would you have a padlock in this kind of
container<00:02:23.460> with<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.630> number<00:02:24.900> six<00:02:25.230> on<00:02:25.380> it<00:02:25.590> which

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
container with a number six on it which

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.290 
container with a number six on it which
is<00:02:25.920> green<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.250> doesn't<00:02:26.760> make<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:26.910> lot<00:02:27.120> of<00:02:27.180> sense

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
is green it doesn't make a lot of sense

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.150 
is green it doesn't make a lot of sense
it's<00:02:27.810> also<00:02:27.990> got<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.200> chain<00:02:28.500> going<00:02:28.710> across<00:02:28.860> it

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
it's also got a chain going across it

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.400 
it's also got a chain going across it
I'm<00:02:29.700> trying<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.060> kind<00:02:30.510> of<00:02:30.540> add<00:02:30.780> it<00:02:30.900> up<00:02:31.080> trying

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
I'm trying to kind of add it up trying

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.750 
I'm trying to kind of add it up trying
to<00:02:31.470> figure<00:02:31.710> out<00:02:31.740> what<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.040> puzzle<00:02:32.400> is<00:02:32.490> here

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
to figure out what the puzzle is here

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.640 
to figure out what the puzzle is here
okay<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.630> think<00:02:33.750> it's<00:02:33.990> quite<00:02:34.170> obvious<00:02:34.380> to

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
okay I think it's quite obvious to

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.050 
okay I think it's quite obvious to
everyone<00:02:34.830> it's<00:02:35.040> also<00:02:35.190> an<00:02:35.430> easter<00:02:35.730> egg<00:02:35.760> because

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
everyone it's also an easter egg because

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.640 
everyone it's also an easter egg because
you<00:02:36.210> weren't<00:02:36.330> just<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:36.690> know<00:02:36.810> put<00:02:36.840> that<00:02:37.200> you

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
you weren't just you know put that you

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.990 
you weren't just you know put that you
know<00:02:37.770> in<00:02:38.010> there<00:02:38.160> on<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.370> random<00:02:38.700> mission

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
know in there on that random mission

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.030 
know in there on that random mission
with<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.810> it's<00:02:40.230> actually<00:02:40.410> not<00:02:40.770> in

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
with you and it's actually not in

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.770 
with you and it's actually not in
single-player<00:02:41.580> it's<00:02:41.880> not<00:02:42.000> in<00:02:42.120> free<00:02:42.360> roam<00:02:42.390> or

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
single-player it's not in free roam or

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.840 
single-player it's not in free roam or
multiplayer<00:02:43.140> eva<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:43.830> you<00:02:44.370> actually<00:02:44.520> have<00:02:44.700> to

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
multiplayer eva so you actually have to

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.730 
multiplayer eva so you actually have to
start<00:02:45.060> this<00:02:45.180> mission<00:02:45.570> and<00:02:45.810> then<00:02:46.290> go<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.470> this

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
start this mission and then go to this

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.090 
start this mission and then go to this
specific<00:02:46.920> location<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:48.510> see<00:02:48.690> this<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.830> kind

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
specific location to see this so it kind

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.650 
specific location to see this so it kind
of<00:02:50.130> definitely<00:02:50.550> does<00:02:50.790> mean<00:02:51.030> something<00:02:51.060> maybe

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
of definitely does mean something maybe

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.420 
of definitely does mean something maybe
it's<00:02:51.930> going<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.170> refer<00:02:52.410> back<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.680> Ron<00:02:53.010> because

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
it's going to refer back to Ron because

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.450 
it's going to refer back to Ron because
obviously<00:02:53.640> it's<00:02:54.150> Ron's<00:02:54.450> mission<00:02:55.190> but<00:02:56.190> we're

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
obviously it's Ron's mission but we're

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.220 
obviously it's Ron's mission but we're
doing<00:02:56.640> in<00:02:56.820> this<00:02:56.880> video<00:02:57.180> so<00:02:57.420> you<00:02:57.930> know<00:02:58.050> it's
