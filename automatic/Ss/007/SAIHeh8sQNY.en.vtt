00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.510
 show you the new sphinx sp 58 today 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.680
 the biggest achievement in this new one 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:42.170
 series and so what's up with sounds 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.339
 has and with the service and 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.830
 this is what I explain to you 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:48.379
 now at the detail before a very much 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.620
 successful virtual analog synthie sound 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:50.620
 I think 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.909
 that maybe directly seen it's off 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.590
 plant so for example on these five 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.720
 fields here a few parameters 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.270
 are assigned and that is with everyone 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.530
 preset actually very handy there 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.900
 are then things on it like filter 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.330
 cantauw because i can share my hall 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.040
 Control everything and make sense 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.690
 made those work these five 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.710
 Fields work in three 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.720
 steer different 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.430
 that means in the end I have 15 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.450
 Fields I can shift here completely 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.250
 just by tilting 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.450
 and you get used to it relatively 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.430
 fast if you like his 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.810

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.080
 actually something directly on it 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.030
 Overall, I am very very very 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.550
 there are many sounds to choose from 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.550
