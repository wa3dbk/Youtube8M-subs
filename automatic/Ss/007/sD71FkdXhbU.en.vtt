00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
mods and the reason i'm doing this video

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.189 
mods and the reason i'm doing this video
is<00:00:23.010> because<00:00:23.130> i<00:00:23.279> had<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.609> hell<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.210> time<00:00:24.240> trying

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
is because i had a hell of a time trying

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.019 
is because i had a hell of a time trying
to<00:00:25.380> get<00:00:25.500> these<00:00:25.619> installed<00:00:26.130> turns<00:00:26.699> out<00:00:26.849> it's

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
to get these installed turns out it's

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.429 
to get these installed turns out it's
actually<00:00:27.150> really<00:00:27.480> simple<00:00:27.599> but<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.080> problem

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
actually really simple but the problem

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.290 
actually really simple but the problem
is<00:00:28.500> there<00:00:28.650> were<00:00:28.710> old<00:00:28.920> instructions<00:00:29.550> wrong

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300
