AdvoCare comes in your life it comes
into<00:03:24.980> it<00:03:25.040> at<00:03:25.130> different<00:03:25.460> stages<00:03:25.670> and<00:03:26.060> we<00:03:26.270> were

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
into it at different stages and we were

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.940 
into it at different stages and we were
very<00:03:26.570> lucky<00:03:26.810> I<00:03:27.020> think<00:03:27.320> because<00:03:27.530> our<00:03:27.650> kids<00:03:27.800> were

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
very lucky I think because our kids were

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.830 
very lucky I think because our kids were
young<00:03:28.010> and<00:03:28.340> it<00:03:28.820> allowed<00:03:29.000> us<00:03:29.180> to<00:03:29.210> run<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:29.600> roads

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
young and it allowed us to run the roads

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.660 
young and it allowed us to run the roads
and<00:03:30.140> we<00:03:30.530> didn't<00:03:30.740> miss<00:03:30.830> out<00:03:31.010> on<00:03:31.070> birthdays<00:03:31.550> we
