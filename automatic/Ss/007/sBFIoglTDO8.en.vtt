00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 it may sound a bit strange though 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.950
 just me as the author of 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.790
 instructions for use now this one 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.969
 question but why must women 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.920
 Men understand so extensively all 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.289
 her moods all her feelings all 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.050
 her aspects all her features 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.340
 where does this drive come from? 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.000
 We have to be honest 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.740
 his 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.199
 Men have this drive in this 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.430
 not men want women even 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.830
 not in this form understand how 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.539
 Women after the secrets of the men 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.730
 search 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.579
 It is an imbalance 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.350
 it may even be unfair that 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.780
 women so much energy time and 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.730
 Engage in these questions and 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.059
 we men do not get it often 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.160
 criticizes that there is an imbalance 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.860
 exists but let's see 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.160
 exactly 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.390
 the truth is you as a woman needs the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.559
 Men are not in this form 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.710
 understand 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.420
 it is a mistake that the ex exists 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.030
 and my other need 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.650
 encircled in green at this request 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.420
 men in their complete form too 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.020
 understanding is next to a natural one 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.689
 Interest in this form until today 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:18.150
 exists above all things about your own 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:20.610
 inner uncertainty knitted out of there 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.619
 is the drive ok, I have to do all these 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.600
 understanding things 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.009
 I have to go down to the smallest detail 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.810
 ultimately optimize 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.460
 not necessary in the form because that 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.890
 only thing in the reason around men 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.590
 it has to be understood that they are 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.560
 The mirror image of her are the men 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.360
 reflect your behavior men mirror 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.759
 what you are and you are first 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.970
 line a woman actually you would have to 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.590
 understand the idea of â€‹â€‹men turn around and 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.710
 indicating that women are themselves 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.869
 have to understand better 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:58.200
 Of course that is an aspect every woman 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.090
 I will certainly say I understand myself 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.909
 yes even hardly or I understand myself yes 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.070
 not even and that's where it comes from 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.670
 That's exactly what men demand 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.610
 understand 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.630
 also around this own blind spot 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.000
 about yourself and your own feelings 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.820
 and your own self-assurance or 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.650
 and keep confident about it 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.610
 grow something that makes it safer 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.520
 But it is not in this form 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.300
 necessary that where you can start your 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.450
 behavior 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.410
 his behavior will behave in the man 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.120
 produce 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.190
 that's why my books are for example 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.560
 also quite different from other authors 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.210
 describe this process in this area 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.730
 with me it is always about the 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.640
 interaction around the mirror image the 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.320
 question is by what behavior 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.200
 produces such a male against 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.780
 but behave about what you are and 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.850
 Although as a woman's instructions you to 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.260
 example is actually in the form even 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.320
 not so much a man 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.070
 but actually more 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.120
 instructions for use woman for the 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.950
 homecoming the retrospective what makes 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.450
 Actually you look like a woman and what 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.220
 that actually generates that 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.750
 natural tendency is men's 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.120
 to achieve what you are about that 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.890
 means about your femininity because one 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.350
 female repertoire like this one 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.910
 change books when you make that 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.830
 Can you put an effect on the man 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.140
 here and then you do not have to 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.820
 intellectually conceive like men 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.460
 There is nothing wrong with it 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.260
 to know something about each other 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.020
 to gain knowledge of experience 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.030
 understanding only somewhere has that its 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.580
 boundaries can limit these do not last forever 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.080
 if you like everything about men 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.459
 would understand if you were a 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.440
 Man and men are not synonymous 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:44.350
 different if he understand himself in 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.850
 many do not make so the 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.580
 understanding is not as important as that 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.760
 realize that you have one about yourself 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.680
 interaction and this one 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.590
 interaction over behavior continues 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.500
 that means your behavior generates 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.350
 against behavior in the man 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:05.080
 and that is what you should understand 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:07.420
 what do you do in terms of emotions? 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.280
 achieve consciously and unconsciously 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.850
 these are the patterns of love like me 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.860
 she calls 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.570
 because the patterns of love understand 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.940
 can you learn repertoire too 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.739
 develop what I call repertoire 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.790
 are conscious behaviors then 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.090
 also conscious emotions opposite 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:25.400
 to testify that is a social and 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.860
 psychological skill the other 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.050
 to reach and reach people emotionally 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.900
 If you know yourself then you can 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.670
 achieve something in the other something 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.130
 one in his life and in his 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:42.070
 relationships what you want to know there 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:44.930
 relationships are in this way stop 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.000
 personally emotionally built and that 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.310
 in a positive and conscious way 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.660
 and wise and that's just not 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.970
 the intellectual understanding i have to 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.440
 know everything about the other but 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.750
 I have to know who I am 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:58.550
 if i am i am i am myself 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.660
 I can do that from my innermost 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.720
 establish behavior 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.790
 that is consistent with me and that will 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.590
 people on the plan call those with me 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.530
 want to be consistent 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:12.440
 this wise one produces from the inside out 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.080
 healthy bonds interesting 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.130
 relationships and above all things 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.140
 emotions that correspond and 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.270
 work because they are in harmony 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.490
 in the end , it works in harmony 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.860
 the harmony with itself is generated 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.300
 also the understanding in the other though 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.730
 actually intellectual that one 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.320
 others of a form intellectual 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.540
 you have to go over it all over 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.330
 then he knows from a trust 

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:38.860
 shaping yourself out of behavior 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.860
 that would rather be generated
