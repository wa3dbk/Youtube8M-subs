00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.240
 hello guys manual flowers are doing 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.919
 a video doing about two 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.980
 applications that help you save money 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:15.120
 battery optimize the phone one calls the 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:18.270
 lipstick and doctor and another and marten the pope 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.230
 remembering that it is necessary to have a router 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.510
 of the appliance 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.990
 I'm using the program called super 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.500
 South because I like him 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:33.960
 so let's go to the setup reminding that 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:38.670
 I'm using a day 3 device. 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:43.340
 right on android version 5.0 on with 20 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:48.090
 there are now three trees to the hard of 85 5 p 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:51.449
 so come on first let's go first 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.410
 You were born there, play is without 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.949
 no problem 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:00.809
 Let's open battle doctor so he 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.449
 you're telling me that you have 14 apps 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.840
 consume the battery but let's 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.700
 This one does not end here. 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.659
 the midfielder is with some previews of 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.180
 configuration may not 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.729
 It's changing a lot, okay, so let's go. 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.939
 start first with initial 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.189
 the manager automatically 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:25.439
 in this part there are applications that they 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.080
 automatically start with your phone 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.060
 you call I be save startup 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.390
 more time consuming 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.460
 good is it necessary to have road to power 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.590
 ban here I will leave only 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.530
 essential services that I do not want 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.630
 No one is just playing in forbid when you 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.799
 plays prohibits his torque will ask 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.240
 permission and you will obviously allow 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.850
 will close applications that you do not 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.490
 Do you want to define if I will leave it in case 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.619
 applications that I use and want 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.360
 it joins the appliance but most of it 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.500
 part of the applications that are talking ' 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.500
 will be here 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.409
 Good, I'll turn off the notification of 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.450
 little battery because they do not like 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.160
 the flight here the next step the 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.690
 cpu management 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.490
 what is this the nuclei of the south 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.770
 the device is set to 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:19.660
 working in a maximum proportion or 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:23.350
 The larger the colloquium will be the 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:26.410
 spent on battery power then the 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.450
 People do we call mode 1 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.750
 if you have not already done so 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.750
 automatically 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.070
 first we did 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.130
 so he will ask for rolt permission 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.910
 here you let everything beauty end 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:46.210
 applications automatically 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.400
 initially he comes of leon and he goes 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.900
 request the other party to authorize 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.180
 if you have not done any of the 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.840
 two previous options 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.790
 Let's fill up and ignore what this is 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.980
 alexandre ignored the apps that 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.400
 you add how much you do not want 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:08.590
 that he is sure will have some 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:10.660
 here on the other flap that the 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.020
 system already works so I want to 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.459
 what do you do you arrive here and exclude 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:21.970
 these applications 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:24.670
 Okay then when the people that 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:28.030
 application you want it to be 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.670
 ignored only you come in that marzie and 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.640
 add beauty 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.220
 then this part is configured 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.700
 Let 's optimize that it will close 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.400
 all applications that are open 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.010
 This comrade alone, I'm not 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.769
 I can close, so I'll let it 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.060
 But you can optimize and 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.180
 beauty 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.000
 Let's go back Let's go here now Proclimate 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.769
 it is 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.420
 it is an essentially cleaning asset 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.980
 but also used to optimize the 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.860
 placard or cell phone 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:07.810
 Let's play here in file cleaning. 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.640
 remembering that as the stocking is already 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:14.400
 previously configured it is already 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:19.989
 authorized in the super user module and 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:22.660
 It's when you open it he will ask 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.720
 now to the other of the device, it's just 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.230
 you release 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.660
 it will be able to be used what I was 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.850
 doing a file system here he goes 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.330
 do a search on your cell phone 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.750
 already applies to files that can be 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.290
 off 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.610
 is a great list and the admiration of 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.970
 memory you can select some 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:49.040
 applications you did not do at the time but 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:52.940
 it 's not, it's not memorizing this selection 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:55.460
 here we can clean and it's worth for a 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.610
 mega on my device but okay let's go 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:01.550
 now the main part that you do not want 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.320
 optimize the device at the most 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.980
 device we have applications in 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.600
 here you can select 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:11.390
 leave these applications unchecked 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:15.050
 will be closed when touched 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.610
 Boost but let's go here manager 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.280
 high performance 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:23.870
 We are going to play it, it will include some 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:28.900
 applications and applications 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:31.820
 here are those who start high 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.130
 constantly these applications that 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.780
 are here that are below 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.760
 when taking a call recorder the 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.310
 Whatsapp, I want it to start. 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.680
 automatically because it is required when 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.990
 are apps you do not want 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:48.290
 they are here in english and you only 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:53.390
 will now remove with call recorder 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:56.270
 for example to get down there and 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:59.210
 add to ignore list is just you 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:01.669
 let it be conditioned 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:06.320
 those who have only one you squeeze 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:10.340
 to stay ufu that will not be it will 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:13.580
 will not automatically start beauty 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:15.320
 so here for sure our time you guys 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.350
 will have a greater amount of 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.940
 you leave that related 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:21.860
 only the ones you want to stay 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.290
 open and everything quiet 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.200
 Let's vote and automatic influencer 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:29.240
 we play here in up menu has 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.950
 pre-installed applications, what are the 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.700
 pre-installed applications are the 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:37.480
 applications on the system 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:41.260
 I 've already taken some things off the 

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:43.090
 lg and google own that i do not want 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.100
 let it start automatically 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.380
 I only really left 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:50.200
 system itself 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.790
 Okay, and you can also be configuring 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.800
 remembering that to configure this here 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.800
 you need one of a knowledge 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:59.580
 advanced on android system 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:03.910
 especially 4.0 up 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:06.310
 beauty so people basically this 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:08.290
 it is in these configurations here my 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:10.410
 battery can get around three 

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:14.020
 hours to four hours more 

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:16.240
 remembering that the device that spends 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:19.840
 enough battery plus battery 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:24.390
 unit 3 million perez and has no 

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:27.430
 use so let's say so 

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:28.810
 persistent would not have facebook on 

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:31.720
 facebook started already uses tools 

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:34.330
 or sometimes to sometimes not much to 

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:35.170
 work the connection and never talk 

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.890
 disappoint 

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:41.080
 and some applications that are not many 

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:44.070
 players would hit then if they liked 

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:47.500
 video is of a like there for me to 

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:48.880
 spread the idea and help others 

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.690
 people are not configured 

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:55.380
 gadgets 

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:55.380
 Thanks guys and see you next time.
