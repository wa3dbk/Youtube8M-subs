overall<00:00:58.170> i<00:00:58.320> think<00:00:58.440> everything<00:00:58.949> was<00:00:59.250> was

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
overall i think everything was was

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.270 
overall i think everything was was
working<00:00:59.940> really<00:00:59.969> well<00:01:00.770> just<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.949> couple

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
working really well just that a couple

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.950 
working really well just that a couple
of<00:01:02.340> games<00:01:02.550> in<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.879> second<00:01:03.239> set<00:01:03.420> i<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:04.670> didn't

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
of games in the second set i I didn't

of games in the second set i I didn't
move<00:01:06.960> as<00:01:08.030> efficient<00:01:09.030> as<00:01:09.180> maybe<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.630> did<00:01:09.930> in

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
move as efficient as maybe I did in

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.270 
move as efficient as maybe I did in
first<00:01:11.010> set<00:01:11.250> but<00:01:11.810> aside<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:13.159> everything<00:01:14.159> is

my return is I feel comfortable
returning<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.189> ball<00:01:41.640> especially<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
returning the ball especially in the

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.170 
returning the ball especially in the
clay<00:01:43.500> courts<00:01:43.740> were<00:01:44.689> you<00:01:45.689> know<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.049> serve

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
clay courts were you know the the serve

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.539 
clay courts were you know the the serve
isn't<00:01:48.180> as<00:01:48.710> efficient<00:01:49.710> as<00:01:49.860> maybe<00:01:50.100> on<00:01:50.280> some

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
isn't as efficient as maybe on some

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.289 
isn't as efficient as maybe on some
quicker<00:01:51.210> surfaces<00:01:51.869> but<00:01:52.020> still<00:01:53.149> here<00:01:54.149> it

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
quicker surfaces but still here it

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.760 
quicker surfaces but still here it
bounces<00:01:54.780> quite<00:01:55.020> high<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:56.219> know<00:01:57.649> you<00:01:58.649> have

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
bounces quite high so you know you have

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.069 
bounces quite high so you know you have
to<00:01:58.950> be<00:01:58.979> careful<00:01:59.280> with<00:01:59.640> with<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.450> kick<00:02:00.780> serves

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
to be careful with with the kick serves

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.080 
to be careful with with the kick serves
you<00:02:01.320> know<00:02:01.439> if<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.619> want<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.979> step<00:02:02.219> in<00:02:02.490> or<00:02:02.520> step

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
you know if you want to step in or step

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.289 
you know if you want to step in or step
back<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.630> being<00:02:04.409> in<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.770> kind<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.520> natural

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
back and being in a kind of natural

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.010 
back and being in a kind of natural
position<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.259> not<00:02:07.649> really<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.250> best<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.989> best

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
position is not really the best the best

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.550 
position is not really the best the best
on<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.349> surface<00:02:10.830> here<00:02:11.069> but

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
on the surface here but

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.670 
on the surface here but
I<00:02:12.760> do<00:02:13.760> consider<00:02:14.270> it<00:02:14.510> as<00:02:14.690> probably<00:02:15.230> one<00:02:15.319> of<00:02:15.470> my

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
I do consider it as probably one of my

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.479 
I do consider it as probably one of my
strengths<00:02:16.340> in<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.700> game<00:02:17.830> but<00:02:18.830> i<00:02:18.890> was<00:02:19.130> working

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
strengths in the game but i was working
