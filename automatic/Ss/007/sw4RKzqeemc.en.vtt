00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.060
 kind likes that calls you from duty 

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.459
 you'll see it's totally different in the case 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.900
 of those winds that are rotating and 

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:10.820
 same time they are cutting and go 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.800
 turning the earth you give yourselves 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.690
 account has that angulation which is what 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.690
 that causes it to bury 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:27.300
 really they are like blades nothing more 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.150
 that not fixed are fixed but they meet 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.039
 exactly the same function 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.980
 now I would like more than anything 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.230
 centralize a little more on the tractor 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.360
 those new holland tractors are doing 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.579
 a little bit of history only those 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.190
 tractors that you knew as 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.769
 by 5000 by 6000 in some places 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.070
 they still find in their tractors by 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:50.140
 6.600 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.079
 through the history of this brand 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.450
 was disappearing if it resulted in 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.489
 this one that said 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.860
 basically those who know izmir strength 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.320
 a force 5000 is going to realize that 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.780
 some things about this tractor are very 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.190
 similar yet for example if 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.560
 we remove the structure 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.290
 we declare nam to the 2 fenders the 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.119
 Operator's seat and a simple chest 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.810
 leaves when it's a strong virus 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.190
 by 6,600 now that advances has had 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.550
 this tractor because if you have had them 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.130
 for example in this model and seen 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:28.000
 They come through run through 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.860
 a hydraulic system but independent 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.869
 previously the tractor came with 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.850
 discs investment in oil that 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.340
 they worked through rods this one did not 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.410
 this one is hydraulic if they fix this is 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.869
 the difference has a few lines 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.490
 where is the pressure through a 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.870
 pump that has in front and 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.320
 on the pedals 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.740
 another other innovation that has this 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.760
 model is that already the transmission 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.700
 naturally the transmission was coming 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.320
 more with two levers party brings three 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.350
 that brings one that is for the reverse 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.690
 neutral and march forward apart your 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.700
 changes that you have you have another other 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.320
 lever that is for high the low ones 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.539
 and your normal changes 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.890
 in theory in all the changes if not 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.780
 you have to do it manually 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.510
 something very similar that that has not been 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.569
 lost sn that for example is 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.569
 i 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.519
 because that tractor has not happened now yes 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:31.400
 to history precisely because of that 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:34.440
 because Nicholas pretended to still leave 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.690
 some things that you have made of certain 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.250
 characteristics on that tractor by 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.400
 example you more in here in the part 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.400
 from ahead 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.409
 Mother 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.960
 now not what he did 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.360
 it lost tail as a merger understood by 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.040
 the international crisis what are 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.320
 trying to do is to make a 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.400
 complete nomenclature of all your 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.410
 engines 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.560
 this engine that we are now offering 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.500
 is a tractor and an iveco engine of the 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.100
 family of koons obviously there are 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.360
 this now so 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:22.010
 companies join to create engines 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.890
 specific to the brand this engine does not 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.630
 you will find it on another tractor 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.090
 only in the new holland line and 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:33.530
 on the international casey line by 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:36.140
 example a 580 backhoe brings 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.310
 this same engine this engine of 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:42.160
 innovation has is an engine 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.910
 of low performance that can give you the 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.010
 real horsepower not only at the wheel 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.920
 but also to the PTO is 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.569
 say that the technology that this has 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.129
 engine is enough 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.050
 to develop the horsepower that 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.700
 we offer 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.140
 If you look at some good that 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.870
 know of engines are going to realize 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.730
 which is very similar to a course 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:07.210
 precisely because of that family was 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.330
 taken out ok then that's one of those from 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:13.540
 the improvements you have 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:16.720
 this engine that is much more efficient you 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:19.720
 gives a good horsepower of 110 and in addition to 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:23.280
 that has a low consumption 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:26.400
 in relation to the same model that we had 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.040
 previously it brings an English engine 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.169
 as for the other things good is very 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.410
 similar to other models we offer 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:38.400
 new holland offers a full range of 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:41.100
 horsepower is 75 hp to 120 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:45.960
 in this category in the high range you 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:47.990
 offers from 140 to 340 horses 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.990
 force
