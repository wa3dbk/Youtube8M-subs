00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:08.150
 and welcome to doctor nougat im 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.340
 channel sparks unboxing today 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:16.590
 drink namely alpro soya with cocoa 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:19.830
 taste yes what is alpro soya it is 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.460
 a kind of milk but it will be beans 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.199
 become 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.529
 I do not know if it will be here at some point 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:31.560
 again exactly that is exactly here 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:33.210
 alpro by nature from purely vegetable the 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.239
 delicious fresh and of course the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.710
 enjoyment with a delicious chocolate taste 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:43.110
 with much good from the soybean 100% 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.110
 vegetable with calcium vitamin b2 b12 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.090
 and d 2 enriched free from 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.579
 artificial color sweet and preservation 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.440
 as well as free from animal fats easily 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:01:00.140
 digestible because of its lactose-free nature 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.890
 So also for lactose intolerance people 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.820
 I do not know if I can do that now 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.920
 correctly said 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:11.130
 103 percent vegetable and yes 100 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.140
 percent is suitable for vegetarians 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.330
 nothing to do with me tastes but almost 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.710
 I taste even better 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:23.610
 believe alpro soya cost liter around the 160th 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.729
 up to 170 I always believe 169 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.500
 for a buzz a pack is enough 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.310
 me always for three four days because i 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.420
 only one glass of it each 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.670
 So I think it's very delicious 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.990
 of course, whoever thinks I'm drinking 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.689
 of course, I do not drink any milk 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.960
 me but I drink this alpro soya 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.600
 also because here are beautiful additions 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.670
 like calcium and all those vitamins 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.320
 In addition, tastes are as well 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.860
 There is also chaos as vanilla 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.590
 nature and earth mountain aurich and 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.180
 meanwhile also some 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.600
 this is called the coffee taste 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.980
 Any cash register in there would be good 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.330
 I'll show you how the whole im 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.330
 glass looks like 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.310
 I am now I have just asked 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:20.570
 That's why I always get the pages 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.960
 change and I go now looks like so 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:30.970
 As you can see , the whole thing really looks 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:33.530
 very very chocolaty from absolutely delicious 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.140
 It's natural for me to do that here 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:41.000
 in the picture that's how it looks then 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:42.920
 out in a glass very chocolaty and 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.830
 also tastes very chocolate tasted 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.870
 like cacau if you did not know it 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.180
 I say you taste the difference 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:56.000
 not between alpro soya kakao and 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:03:00.100
 a milk cocoa being the alpro soya 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.100
 tastes better by far than 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.890
 as a cacau one now also in 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.510
 This can buy pack tetra packs 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:15.430
 and I thought so 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:18.350
 Great make a video to city hotan 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.760
 mountain ring unboxing anyway as 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.050
 whatever you can call it now 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:27.140
 so it tastes really delicious and 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:31.580
 It looks very delicious too 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.170
 all the de on cacau are synonymous times 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.020
 something other than me and cocoa powder 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.370
 did not want to drink that optimal 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.810
 only for the athletes of course 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:44.050
 suitable because a lot of nutrients 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:48.050
 are included and with that I would say 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.400
 bristle what the for see you and 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.680
 if you liked it look 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.370
 my other star boksics in this one 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.830
 channel of the doctor luca then and yes 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.280
 I detest myself and see you 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.280
 next time
