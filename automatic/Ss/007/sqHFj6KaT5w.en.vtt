can add the high hat into the mix the

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.259 
can add the high hat into the mix the
last<00:00:18.929> part<00:00:19.929> of<00:00:20.079> the<00:00:20.259> mix<00:00:20.499> is<00:00:20.769> the<00:00:21.640> hi-hat<00:00:21.999> Mike

hi<00:00:36.910> hat<00:00:37.150> Mike<00:00:37.560> now<00:00:38.560> you<00:00:38.620> notice<00:00:38.830> I<00:00:39.040> have<00:00:39.160> a

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
hi hat Mike now you notice I have a

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.850 
hi hat Mike now you notice I have a
pointing<00:00:39.670> directly<00:00:40.000> down<00:00:40.570> towards<00:00:41.200> the<00:00:41.440> top

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
pointing directly down towards the top

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.250 
pointing directly down towards the top
of<00:00:41.890> the<00:00:42.100> symbol<00:00:42.460> this<00:00:42.790> is<00:00:42.940> a<00:00:43.090> great<00:00:43.720> position

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
of the symbol this is a great position

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.430 
of the symbol this is a great position
it<00:00:44.830> really<00:00:45.790> captures<00:00:46.510> a<00:00:46.540> lot<00:00:46.990> of<00:00:47.110> the<00:00:47.170> stick

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
it really captures a lot of the stick

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:59.580 
it really captures a lot of the stick
sound<00:00:47.680> of<00:00:47.920> the<00:00:48.700> hi-hat<00:00:57.870> one<00:00:58.870> of<00:00:59.170> the<00:00:59.380> things

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
sound of the hi-hat one of the things

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.870 
sound of the hi-hat one of the things
that<00:00:59.650> happens<00:00:59.920> with<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:00.400> mic<00:01:00.579> in<00:01:00.730> this

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
that happens with the mic in this

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.120 
that happens with the mic in this
position<00:01:01.390> is<00:01:01.600> because<00:01:02.380> of<00:01:02.410> the<00:01:02.710> cardioid

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
position is because of the cardioid

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.320 
position is because of the cardioid
pattern<00:01:03.520> is<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.930> it<00:01:05.730> gets<00:01:06.730> a<00:01:06.850> lot<00:01:07.030> of<00:01:07.090> bleed

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
pattern is that it gets a lot of bleed

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.240 
pattern is that it gets a lot of bleed
from<00:01:07.540> the<00:01:07.690> snare<00:01:07.930> drum<00:01:08.170> a<00:01:08.380> second<00:01:09.130> Mike

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
from the snare drum a second Mike

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.090 
from the snare drum a second Mike
position<00:01:09.760> I<00:01:09.940> would<00:01:10.000> use<00:01:10.420> would<00:01:10.750> be<00:01:10.930> to<00:01:11.170> do

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
position I would use would be to do

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.790 
position I would use would be to do
something<00:01:12.790> quite<00:01:13.000> similar<00:01:13.240> except<00:01:13.930> point<00:01:14.680> the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
something quite similar except point the

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.330 
something quite similar except point the
mic<00:01:15.010> away<00:01:15.840> from<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:16.960> snare<00:01:17.170> drum<00:01:17.409> towards<00:01:18.250> the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
mic away from the snare drum towards the

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.010 
mic away from the snare drum towards the
outside<00:01:18.490> of<00:01:18.790> the<00:01:18.850> drum<00:01:19.030> set<00:01:19.270> and<00:01:19.420> this<00:01:19.870> will

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
outside of the drum set and this will

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.890 
outside of the drum set and this will
minimize<00:01:20.280> some<00:01:21.280> of<00:01:21.400> the<00:01:21.490> bleed<00:01:21.909> of<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:22.300> snare

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
minimize some of the bleed of the snare

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:30.719 
minimize some of the bleed of the snare
drum<00:01:23.080> into<00:01:23.470> the<00:01:23.590> hi-hat<00:01:23.890> Mike<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:30.340> is<00:01:30.400> a<00:01:30.550> good

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
drum into the hi-hat Mike this is a good

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.310 
drum into the hi-hat Mike this is a good
example<00:01:30.820> about<00:01:31.390> how<00:01:31.450> the<00:01:31.690> hyper-cardioid

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
example about how the hyper-cardioid

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.230 
example about how the hyper-cardioid
nature<00:01:32.890> of<00:01:33.040> the<00:01:33.159> element<00:01:33.580> on<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.670> microphone

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
nature of the element on the microphone

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.450 
nature of the element on the microphone
is<00:01:34.479> really<00:01:34.990> looking<00:01:35.260> at<00:01:35.350> a<00:01:35.409> specific<00:01:35.650> part<00:01:36.190> and

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
is really looking at a specific part and

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.350 
is really looking at a specific part and
so<00:01:36.520> what<00:01:36.640> you've<00:01:36.760> done<00:01:36.909> there<00:01:37.090> is<00:01:37.240> you've

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
so what you've done there is you've

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.420 
so what you've done there is you've
rejected<00:01:37.690> the<00:01:38.590> nearby<00:01:38.770> instruments<00:01:39.310> like<00:01:39.340> the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
rejected the nearby instruments like the

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.180 
rejected the nearby instruments like the
snare<00:01:39.729> drum<00:01:40.000> and<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.270> nearest<00:01:40.900> rack<00:01:41.110> tom<00:01:41.350> yeah

to my advantage here's a quick tip this
is<00:01:49.180> a<00:01:49.210> hi-hat<00:01:49.690> Mike<00:01:49.930> in<00:01:50.110> position<00:01:50.500> you<00:01:50.799> don't

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
is a hi-hat Mike in position you don't

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.770 
is a hi-hat Mike in position you don't
want<00:01:51.400> to<00:01:51.460> use

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
want to use

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.360 
want to use
notice<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:54.320> microphones<00:01:54.770> pointed<00:01:55.100> right<00:01:55.340> at

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.370 
notice the microphones pointed right at

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.270 
notice the microphones pointed right at
the<00:01:55.940> edge<00:01:56.060> of<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.360> hi-hat<00:01:56.750> this<00:01:57.470> is<00:01:57.650> where<00:01:57.920> all

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
the edge of the hi-hat this is where all

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.870 
the edge of the hi-hat this is where all
the<00:01:58.580> air<00:01:59.120> comes<00:01:59.900> out<00:02:00.170> of<00:02:00.470> high<00:02:01.220> hat<00:02:01.400> when<00:02:01.850> I

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
the air comes out of high hat when I

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.050 
the air comes out of high hat when I
play<00:02:02.450> them<00:02:02.800> so<00:02:03.800> what<00:02:03.950> happens<00:02:04.370> is<00:02:04.520> you<00:02:04.880> get<00:02:05.000> a

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.680 
play them so what happens is you get a
really<00:02:05.270> poppy<00:02:05.930> sound<00:02:06.380> and<00:02:07.030> it's<00:02:08.030> it's<00:02:08.360> just

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
really poppy sound and it's it's just
