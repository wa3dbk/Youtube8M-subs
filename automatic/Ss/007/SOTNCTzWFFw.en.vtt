but<00:00:08.370> yeah<00:00:08.550> these<00:00:08.880> tires<00:00:09.720> I<00:00:10.190> can't<00:00:11.190> believe<00:00:11.490> it

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
but yeah these tires I can't believe it

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.480 
but yeah these tires I can't believe it
they're<00:00:11.880> actually<00:00:12.860> better<00:00:13.860> than<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.190> cue

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
they're actually better than the cue

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:23.940 
they're actually better than the cue
twos<00:00:14.730> are<00:00:15.090> easy<00:00:15.330> people<00:00:16.250> incredible

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.950 

90<00:00:24.520> miles<00:00:24.730> an<00:00:24.880> hour<00:00:25.060> and<00:00:25.270> it<00:00:25.360> felt<00:00:25.600> like<00:00:25.720> I<00:00:25.840> was

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
90 miles an hour and it felt like I was

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:41.550 
90 miles an hour and it felt like I was
going<00:00:26.200> slow

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:41.560 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:50.200 

I<00:00:41.620> can't<00:00:42.370> believe<00:00:42.670> they<00:00:42.940> actually<00:00:43.420> improve

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:01:00.080 

all<00:00:51.210> right<00:00:51.770> let's<00:00:52.770> take<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.070> look<00:00:57.350> I<00:00:58.910> mean<00:00:59.910> they

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
all right let's take a look I mean they

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.580 
all right let's take a look I mean they
definitely<00:01:00.390> inspire<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.900> confidence<00:01:01.440> that's

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
definitely inspire a confidence that's

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.299 
definitely inspire a confidence that's
for<00:01:01.770> damn<00:01:01.890> sure

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
for damn sure

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.109 
for damn sure
this<00:01:02.970> is<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.150> first<00:01:04.040> first<00:01:05.040> time<00:01:05.339> of

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
this is the first first time of

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:15.240 
this is the first first time of
got<00:01:07.689> it<00:01:07.810> really<00:01:08.079> leading<00:01:08.350> over

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.160 

still<00:01:16.250> one<00:01:16.940> more<00:01:17.150> time<00:01:17.390> maybe<00:01:17.660> a<00:01:17.780> few<00:01:18.020> more

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
still one more time maybe a few more

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.240 
still one more time maybe a few more
times<00:01:19.210> don't<00:01:20.210> get<00:01:20.390> two<00:01:20.570> balls<00:01:20.990> as<00:01:21.380> hot<00:01:21.680> out

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
times don't get two balls as hot out

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.480 
times don't get two balls as hot out
oh<00:01:24.070> good<00:01:25.070> god

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.840 

alright<00:01:28.490> you're<00:01:28.760> cool

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.870 

it<00:01:34.150> almost<00:01:34.570> feels<00:01:34.930> like<00:01:35.290> the<00:01:35.439> carcass<00:01:35.979> it's

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
it almost feels like the carcass it's

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.420 
it almost feels like the carcass it's
harder

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
harder

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.040 
harder
well<00:01:38.580> it<00:01:38.760> is<00:01:38.850> because<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.180> carbon<00:01:39.420> fibers<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
well it is because the carbon fibers the

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.290 
well it is because the carbon fibers the
sidewall

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
sidewall

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.330 
sidewall
these<00:01:42.720> cute<00:01:42.990> 3-inch<00:01:43.440> I<00:01:43.560> don't<00:01:43.860> know<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.160> feels

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
these cute 3-inch I don't know it feels

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.190 
these cute 3-inch I don't know it feels
like<00:01:44.610> they<00:01:44.730> might<00:01:44.760> be<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.090> little<00:01:45.360> bit<00:01:45.690> harder

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
like they might be a little bit harder

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.470 
like they might be a little bit harder
like<00:01:47.100> when<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.250> hit<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.610> bumps<00:01:47.910> it<00:01:48.060> seems<00:01:48.240> like

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
like when I hit the bumps it seems like

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
like when I hit the bumps it seems like
they

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.960 

I<00:01:52.560> feel

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.730 

it's<00:01:56.180> not<00:01:56.420> a<00:01:56.450> bad<00:01:56.720> thing<00:01:56.930> either<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.320> length

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
it's not a bad thing either the length

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.590 
it's not a bad thing either the length
upset<00:01:58.160> the<00:01:58.280> bike<00:01:58.460> or<00:01:58.640> anything<00:01:58.820> is<00:01:59.120> still<00:01:59.240> just

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
upset the bike or anything is still just

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.100 
upset the bike or anything is still just
more<00:02:00.140> stable<00:02:00.650> than<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:00.860> cue<00:02:01.070> twos<00:02:01.340> it<00:02:02.270> feels

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
more stable than the cue twos it feels

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.790 
more stable than the cue twos it feels
like

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.560 

I'm<00:02:06.430> sure<00:02:06.670> that's<00:02:06.850> just<00:02:07.000> because<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.210> carbon

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
I'm sure that's just because the carbon

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.610 
I'm sure that's just because the carbon
fiber<00:02:07.780> in<00:02:07.930> the<00:02:07.990> sidewalls

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.250 

not<00:02:13.980> really<00:02:14.310> an<00:02:14.400> issue

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.309 

you<00:02:19.769> got

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.320 

like<00:02:25.799> right<00:02:25.980> here<00:02:26.159> is<00:02:26.220> pretty<00:02:26.519> good<00:02:26.640> size

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
like right here is pretty good size

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.930 
like right here is pretty good size
oh<00:02:28.470> yeah<00:02:29.470> it's<00:02:29.980> definitely<00:02:30.160> harsher<00:02:30.790> than

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
oh yeah it's definitely harsher than

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:31.880 
oh yeah it's definitely harsher than
that

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
that

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.059 
that
youtubes

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
youtubes

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.830 
youtubes
but<00:02:34.579> that's<00:02:34.700> just<00:02:34.939> some<00:02:35.060> straight<00:02:35.359> line<00:02:35.569> as

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
but that's just some straight line as

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.290 
but that's just some straight line as
far<00:02:36.019> as<00:02:36.310> cornering<00:02:37.310> bumps<00:02:37.640> it<00:02:37.760> doesn't<00:02:38.060> feel

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.530 

where's<00:02:41.720> our<00:02:42.140> unity

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
where's our unity

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:53.410 
where's our unity
I'm<00:02:45.049> not<00:02:45.349> a<00:02:45.379> professional

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:01.949 

oh<00:02:53.450> yeah<00:02:54.410> and<00:02:54.470> I<00:02:54.920> felt<00:02:55.220> good

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.970 

it<00:03:02.470> does<00:03:02.799> feel<00:03:03.220> like<00:03:04.019> I<00:03:05.019> have<00:03:05.200> to<00:03:05.349> put<00:03:05.560> a<00:03:05.590> little

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
it does feel like I have to put a little

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.339 
it does feel like I have to put a little
bit<00:03:06.189> more<00:03:06.459> effort<00:03:06.640> into<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.689> bars<00:03:07.930> to<00:03:08.230> get

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
bit more effort into the bars to get

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.110 
bit more effort into the bars to get
into

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
into

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.000 
into
just<00:03:10.569> might<00:03:10.750> be<00:03:10.900> because<00:03:11.170> brandi<00:03:11.709> tires

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
just might be because brandi tires

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.940 
just might be because brandi tires
taller

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:34.940
