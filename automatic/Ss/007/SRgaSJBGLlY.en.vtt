00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.150
 very well we continue with our course 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.050
 of music theory here in classes of 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.940
 puntocom dotcom guitar 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.500
 we have been working what are the 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.210
 harmonic functions we have seen the 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.740
 different substitutions we have spoken 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.350
 about the function determinants 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.760
 very important things I told them that 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.470
 this is just the tip of the iceberg 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.050
 because there are more ways to do 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:34.040
 harmonic variations the first rule 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.989
 harmony harmonization suggests that 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.210
 one can make chord exchanges 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.680
 by chords of its same function that 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.170
 we did what we saw as officials in 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.780
 previous elections the second rule 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.660
 says that before any chord it fits 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:50.720
 his fifth grade 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.310
 then let's look at it this way there 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.430
 something that is known as dominant 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.260
 secondary by definition the 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.540
 secondary dominants are the 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.239
 dominant that we can generate for 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.710
 chords of our tonality let's look at a 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.150
 momentary the scale of C major we are 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.680
 always using as a major example 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.940
 projected that that can be applied to 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.040
 any scale of re my sun fa has been 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:16.040
 the dominant sun the fifth degree 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.509
 sorry the fifth degree finger is sol do re 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.300
 my sun sun fa 7 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.000
 is the main dominant but what 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.960
 would happen if I wanted to use during 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.250
 my harmonic progression a dominant with 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.710
 some of the chords that the 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.250
 scale or for minor or for my minor 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.870
 op to rafa or for only for the minor 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.180
 these dominants are known as 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.400
 dominating secondary dominants for 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.020
 the scale degrees then let's look 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.900
 what are those secondary dominants 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.640
 the first one that I find would be what 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.530
 it is known in classical encryption as 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.240
 fifth of a second 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.250
 in this case fifth of the minor re we are 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.920
 talking about a seven o'clock 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.159
 we would have fifth of third that will be 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.409
 fifth of minor would be yes 7 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:04.590
 we would have fifth of 5th of the fourth fifth 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.960
 the fourth grade the fifth that would be 27 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.080
 fifth the fifth plus the best known 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.390
 fifth to fifth would be recent fifth 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.590
 of sun and finally we have the lowest 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.450
 we would have fifth the sixth 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.730
 of point you are question would be 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.430
 my seven are wondering why 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.780
 we do not make fifth of if it is that if 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.980
 you realize these chords are 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.150
 older and younger we have 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.430
 worked so far and that's how it is 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.190
 diminished and the idea is that one when 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.250
 does a secondary dominant is because 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.750
 he does it for two reasons 1 let's do 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.010
 a modulation let's make a change 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.870
 of scale we're just going to talk more 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.000
 forward the course we are going to make a 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.709
 change of scale then we have to 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.739
 assume that chord or if they went to new 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.780
 tonality re minor my minor the minor fa 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.670
 greater sun greater and then we have no scale 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.760
 or tonalities and diminished by 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.040
 say it 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.189
 so for that reason we do not make a 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.510
 dominant for what is the if the 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:59.250
 seventh grade we do not have it we have 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.700
 dominant for the second for third 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.650
 the fourth the fifth and the sixth 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.300
 one also use dominant 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.040
 secondary as we are going to apply them in 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.950
 this massa moment as a function for 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.680
 highlighting a chord is the use of 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.120
 secondary mines the most basic use 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.190
 highlighting what does it mean to say 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.959
 that I have the progression of chords and 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:21.080
 I want to feel a chord more than 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.459
 others the best way to achieve that is 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.459
 do what is known as a tonic 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.660
 tion that we will also explain 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.239
 classically it consists of putting your fifth 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.750
 degree before then have we have this 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:37.099
 harmonic sequence of d minor minor 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.870
 they are and I want them to be the least 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.530
 feel more 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.680
 then how can I do my 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:46.459
 harmonic progression 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.980
 in the same measure d minor my 7 the 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.709
 lower and we continue with the progression would be 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.660
 sun after 'semis' jette our 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.349
 helping me to highlight the chord the 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.599
 smaller as we are on the scale of do 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.040
 greater works as a dominant or is 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.830
 considers a secondary dominant 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.130
 because it is the fifth grade of the minor 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.990
 if the chord does not belong to the scale 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.180
 is another type of dominants that use 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.530
 he is not considered in his fifth grade 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.510
 equal to fifth grade 7 but you are not 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.950
 considers a secondary dominant the 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.350
 secondary dominants remember it 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.450
 they are always the ones inside the 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.880
 scale 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:27.500
 let's continue with this progression then 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.630
 could be two seven and a half 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.300
 here at seven it is working for 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:35.070
 help me tie 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.290
 with the lower re fifth fifth minor is self 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.810
 we still have said then that 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:42.750
 they had 2007 for the minor and we could 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.400
 put between 7 to get to are we are 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.830
 using three secondary dominants 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.770
 fifth of the second fifth of the sixth and 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.389
 fifth of the fifth 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.949
 It is a way to operate such that 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.940
 secondary dominants 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:55.860
 now something that seems to me 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:59.280
 question then ask me many 2010 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:02.009
 as I know what tensions these 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.500
 contributions as I know that does not come for example 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:05.760
 yes in this chord 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.590
 the secondary dominants 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.600
 so 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.009
 the easiest way to understand this is 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.169
 apply the following rule 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:17.559
 the tensions that the dominant ones handle 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:21.279
 secondaries depend directly on the 

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:23.330
 destination chord I explain it let's talk 

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:25.099
 of the fifth of the second 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.840
 I acquired it for D minor 'in this case 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:29.060
 seven o'clock we're going to the lesser king 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.729
 then we can look or think that 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.110
 we go for a smaller scale then 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:36.199
 what are the tensions of the dominant 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.560
 when for smaller scale we see nine the 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:39.450
 thirteen 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.710
 then I will go to a fifth of third 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.529
 because the fifth to the third goes for a 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.379
 minor chord in this case 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:48.269
 now fifth the fourth goes for a chord 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:50.579
 greater what the tensions would be here 

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:52.109
 available ninth and 3 dinner because we're going 

00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:54.839
 for a major chord we 're 

00:05:52.109 --> 00:05:57.209
 making a change for larger scale what 

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:59.729
 same with fifth of 5º 93 in the natural 

00:05:57.209 --> 00:06:02.609
 and with fifth of the sixth we will find 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:04.229
 that ninth flat and three in a we see in the 

00:06:02.609 --> 00:06:06.089
 most effective way to handle this from the 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:08.489
 tensions of secondary dominants 

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:10.979
 always look at the destination chord 

00:06:08.489 --> 00:06:14.039
 If the chords are greater or less 

00:06:10.979 --> 00:06:17.099
 this works exactly the same inside 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:20.099
 of what the minor scale was in the 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:21.869
 smaller scale I'll have fifth of 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:23.519
 third fifth the second I can not have 

00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:26.309
 will have fifth for the third degree 

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:27.839
 which is a major chord will have fifth 

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:30.089
 for the fourth that is a minor chord 

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:31.619
 fifth for the fifth here we are going to 

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:33.229
 take as minor chord here is not taken 

00:06:31.619 --> 00:06:35.339
 as a major chord but as a minor chord 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:37.469
 we do not make the change we have come 

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:39.149
 working not fifth minor because it's the 

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:41.039
 chord of the scale can be that the 

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:43.199
 fifth major we did not bring it from the minor 

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:44.759
 harmonic as is the fifth the 

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:46.349
 fifth the fifth minor 

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:48.449
 we have to think that way they have 

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:49.500
 would have dominant chord tensions of 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:52.590
 minor tonality 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:54.840
 we see 9 and sustained 9 fifth of the sixth 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.250
 we could find here also the 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.570
 fifth the seventh that are chords 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.750
 older whose extension is then 

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:02.150
 it would be nine and thirteen 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:04.040
 remember then in this case in the 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.320
 exercise that we have in the pp we are going to 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.000
 find that some to identify 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:11.030
 if they are secondary dominants and what 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.710
 secondary dominant is important others 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.060
 to place secondary dominants and 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:16.460
 begin to enrich and what our 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.590
 harmonic language in this aspect 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.319
 very well you already know what questions until the 

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:22.520
 forum system please use what 

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:24.710
 we also have the written quiz so that 

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.000
 I work and digital quiz 

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.490
 remember closing this lesson 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.710
 secondary dominants always think 

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:32.630
 remember that they are made on 

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:36.070
 chords of the scale 

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:36.070
 we see it in the next election
