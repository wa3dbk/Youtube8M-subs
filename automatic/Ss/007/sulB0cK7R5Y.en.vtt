 today we dedicate this weekend program to the signing of the apple apo 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.900
 although in fact not talking about a successful product but its first 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.840
 I try to enter the land of the day and the same moment that was quite unsuccessful 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.980
 we refer to pipín 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.080
 this system that more than the game console was defined by providing a 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.119
 low cost multimedia platform focused on that use of Santa Cruz floor 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.359
 systematic roms with multimedia content 

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:36.100
 aesthetically video games as well as navigate in Latin following internet 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.300
 from a television 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.310
 and good though Japan designed this system its goal that was licensed 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.670
 technology accompanied third-party Japanese manufacturer positions 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.920
 bandai toys took care of the production of titín in specific its 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.770
 band division and vital entertainment linking the console and japan in February 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.370
 of 1995 under the name piping ap mark and that also led America that same 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.070
 year in September with the name pipín ap 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.069
 then the console had a processor pahor pc a-66 menaje artes 4 

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:06.750
 Memora ramesh five-megawatt runs expandable to thirteen measures and 

00:01:06.749 --> 00:01:10.689
 128 glorious kilo valls of flash storage your unit will

 broke 4x and has even integrated a 14-point modem 4 kilometers per 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.470
 second to connect to the network but in spite of all these people the pee was not 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:22.929
 well received in the market mainly for two reasons one that 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:26.729
 so apolo considered inexpensive fears a price of 600 dollars pretty 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.420
 high for the time and two the little offer of games available that in America 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.380
 only 28 titles were based 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.350
 they also include programs such as web browsers and thus it was 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.280
 interactive 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.370
 also that it entered to compete in a market dominated by the prestige of 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.740
 sonic &amp; sega saturn and we entered p4 this made them sell less than 50 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.090
 thousand units in the two years he was in the market 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.510
 but after a few years, apparently Japan removed the thorn from 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.130
 this failure and a decade later he affirms that his pact torch is the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.299
 mobile game device 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.840
 most popular in the world with more than 60 million units sold from its 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.429
 launch in 2007 and so we close this little recap of this console
