plus<00:03:23.700> is<00:03:24.510> more<00:03:24.780> if<00:03:24.900> you've<00:03:25.019> got<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.200> bigger

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410

obviously<00:03:26.610> it<00:03:26.700> will<00:03:26.760> be<00:03:26.820> more<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:27.660> out<00:03:27.810> but

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
obviously it will be more it out but

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.250 
obviously it will be more it out but
anyway<00:03:28.350> okay<00:03:29.540> let's<00:03:30.540> move<00:03:30.720> on<00:03:30.870> to<00:03:31.050> the<00:03:31.140> next

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
anyway okay let's move on to the next

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.610 
anyway okay let's move on to the next
bit<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:31.830> for<00:03:32.310> that<00:03:32.400> I<00:03:32.670> need<00:03:33.200> where<00:03:34.200> my<00:03:34.320> to<00:03:34.500> your

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
bit and for that I need where my to your

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.900 
bit and for that I need where my to your
system<00:03:34.920> so<00:03:35.400> getting<00:03:35.700> back<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.120> see<00:03:37.489> why<00:03:38.489> this

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
system so getting back and see why this

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.729 
system so getting back and see why this
is<00:03:39.120> this<00:03:39.600> is<00:03:39.750> daily<00:03:39.989> young<00:03:40.200> dismembered<00:03:40.620> at<00:03:40.709> a
