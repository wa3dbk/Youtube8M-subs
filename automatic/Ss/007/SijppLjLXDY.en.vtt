using this underwater camera all day and
we<00:01:04.559> had<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.710> thought<00:01:04.980> that<00:01:05.190> would<00:01:05.280> be<00:01:05.370> very

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520 
we had a thought that would be very

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.160 
we had a thought that would be very
interesting<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.910> try<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.210> rig<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.990> catch

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
interesting to try to rig it to catch

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.990 
interesting to try to rig it to catch
black<00:01:07.410> fish<00:01:07.710> more<00:01:08.280> importantly<00:01:08.640> we<00:01:08.730> want<00:01:08.910> to

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
black fish more importantly we want to

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.570 
black fish more importantly we want to
see<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.510> debate<00:01:09.840> presentation<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:11.190> we<00:01:11.370> rigged

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
see the debate presentation so we rigged

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.240 
see the debate presentation so we rigged
the<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:12.120> tandem<00:01:12.960> hooks<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.530> camera<00:01:14.070> and

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
the the tandem hooks to the camera and

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.430 
the the tandem hooks to the camera and
we<00:01:15.000> put<00:01:15.150> some<00:01:15.240> bait<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.600> just<00:01:16.110> hoping<00:01:16.320> to

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
we put some bait on it just hoping to

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.350 
we put some bait on it just hoping to
see<00:01:16.590> we<00:01:16.680> maybe<00:01:16.830> get<00:01:17.010> some<00:01:17.190> fish<00:01:17.910> approaching

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
see we maybe get some fish approaching

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.000 
see we maybe get some fish approaching
it<00:01:18.479> would<00:01:18.869> happen<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.440> we<00:01:19.530> can<00:01:19.650> get<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.800> close-up

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
it would happen so we can get a close-up

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.710 
it would happen so we can get a close-up
of<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.400> fish<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.790> say<00:01:20.970> he<00:01:21.150> comes<00:01:21.510> home<00:01:21.660> with

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
of the fish and say he comes home with

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.270 
of the fish and say he comes home with
us<00:01:22.220> not<00:01:23.220> bad<00:01:23.580> not<00:01:24.240> bad
