guys today about loose leaf tea versus

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.880 
guys today about loose leaf tea versus
tea<00:00:04.859> bags<00:00:05.100> so<00:00:05.790> we're<00:00:06.600> often<00:00:06.779> asked<00:00:07.259> like<00:00:07.379> why

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
tea bags so we're often asked like why

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.040 
tea bags so we're often asked like why
loose<00:00:08.160> leaf<00:00:08.370> tea<00:00:08.580> and<00:00:08.910> why<00:00:09.120> tea<00:00:09.179> bags<00:00:09.630> what's

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
loose leaf tea and why tea bags what's

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.669 
loose leaf tea and why tea bags what's
the<00:00:10.260> major<00:00:10.530> difference<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:12.170> you<00:00:13.170> know<00:00:13.200> when

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
the major difference and you know when

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.650 
the major difference and you know when
would<00:00:13.889> one<00:00:14.190> be<00:00:14.370> better<00:00:14.549> than<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.030> other<00:00:15.210> so

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
would one be better than the other so

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.970 
would one be better than the other so
we're<00:00:15.780> going<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.929> explore<00:00:16.260> those<00:00:16.590> different

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
we're going to explore those different

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.250 
we're going to explore those different
options<00:00:17.400> together<00:00:17.670> today<00:00:18.240> so<00:00:19.699> loose<00:00:20.699> leaf<00:00:20.939> tea

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
options together today so loose leaf tea

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.470 
options together today so loose leaf tea
it's<00:00:22.340> actually<00:00:23.340> very<00:00:23.580> convenient<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.300> takes

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
it's actually very convenient it takes

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.240 
it's actually very convenient it takes
the<00:00:24.600> same<00:00:24.840> amount<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:25.230> time<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.740> prepare<00:00:25.920> loose

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
the same amount of time to prepare loose

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.509 
the same amount of time to prepare loose
leaf<00:00:26.460> tea<00:00:26.640> as<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.939> does<00:00:27.119> with<00:00:27.539> tea<00:00:27.750> bags<00:00:27.990> and

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
leaf tea as it does with tea bags and

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.970 
leaf tea as it does with tea bags and
you<00:00:29.519> get<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.880> higher<00:00:30.390> quality<00:00:30.720> tea<00:00:31.349> typically

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
you get a higher quality tea typically

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.310 
you get a higher quality tea typically
with<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.340> loose<00:00:32.610> leaf<00:00:32.910> experience<00:00:33.780> than<00:00:34.290> you

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
with the loose leaf experience than you

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.290 
with the loose leaf experience than you
do<00:00:34.530> with<00:00:34.710> tea<00:00:34.860> bags<00:00:35.070> they're<00:00:35.670> whole<00:00:35.969> leaves

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
do with tea bags they're whole leaves

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.540 
do with tea bags they're whole leaves
they're<00:00:36.660> full<00:00:37.020> there's<00:00:37.260> natural<00:00:37.649> oils<00:00:38.129> found

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
they're full there's natural oils found

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.670 
they're full there's natural oils found
within<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.120> leaves<00:00:39.329> themselves<00:00:39.649> so<00:00:40.649> as

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
within the leaves themselves so as

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.740 
within the leaves themselves so as
you're<00:00:40.890> steeping<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.399> leaves<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.000> oils<00:00:42.480> get

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
you're steeping the leaves the oils get

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.069 
you're steeping the leaves the oils get
released<00:00:43.550> from<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.700> tea<00:00:44.910> actually<00:00:45.180> into<00:00:45.989> the

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
released from the tea actually into the

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.220 
released from the tea actually into the
liqueur<00:00:46.469> into<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.100> hot<00:00:47.309> water<00:00:47.629> so<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:49.020> get<00:00:49.200> a

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
liqueur into the hot water so you get a

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.340 
liqueur into the hot water so you get a
much<00:00:49.500> more<00:00:49.530> rounded<00:00:50.039> full<00:00:50.640> bodied<00:00:51.059> flavor

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
much more rounded full bodied flavor

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.080 
much more rounded full bodied flavor
while<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.379> traditional<00:00:52.770> tea<00:00:53.309> bag<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.789> steeps

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
while a traditional tea bag it steeps

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.600 
while a traditional tea bag it steeps
right<00:00:54.449> away<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:55.140> more<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.469> broken<00:00:56.010> bits

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
right away it's more of a broken bits

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.450 
right away it's more of a broken bits
within<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.239> actual<00:00:57.539> tea<00:00:57.840> bag<00:00:58.219> I'd<00:00:59.219> like<00:00:59.399> you

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
to think about it like buying a bag of

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.149 
to think about it like buying a bag of

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
they're a bit more broken and what's

factory what you'll find is that they're

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.760 
factory what you'll find is that they're
producing<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.549> loose<00:01:20.729> leaf<00:01:20.939> teas<00:01:21.270> and

so<00:01:24.810> on<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.200> forth<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:26.610> dust<00:01:26.939> flies<00:01:27.270> up<00:01:27.479> in

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
so on and so forth the dust flies up in

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.630 
so on and so forth the dust flies up in
the<00:01:27.720> air<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.080> falls<00:01:28.409> on<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.650> ground<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:29.310> sweep

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
the air it falls on the ground you sweep

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.670 
the air it falls on the ground you sweep
it<00:01:29.759> in<00:01:29.880> giant<00:01:30.270> piles<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.900> that's<00:01:31.079> typically

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
it in giant piles and that's typically

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.789 
it in giant piles and that's typically
what's<00:01:31.860> reserved<00:01:32.250> for<00:01:32.520> most<00:01:32.850> tea<00:01:33.600> bags<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:34.140> the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
what's reserved for most tea bags in the

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.950 
what's reserved for most tea bags in the
particular<00:01:35.040> case<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:35.400> noah<00:01:35.880> blends<00:01:36.450> the
