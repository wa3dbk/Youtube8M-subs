here<00:05:02.350> at<00:05:02.470> SCI<00:05:02.680> guys<00:05:02.919> were<00:05:03.310> always<00:05:03.520> curious<00:05:03.850> how

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
here at SCI guys were always curious how

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.999 
here at SCI guys were always curious how
experiments<00:05:04.780> turn<00:05:04.960> out<00:05:05.139> so<00:05:05.560> if<00:05:05.680> you<00:05:05.770> do<00:05:05.889> these

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:06.009 
experiments turn out so if you do these

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:08.279 
experiments turn out so if you do these
experiments<00:05:06.400> at<00:05:06.759> home<00:05:06.900> record<00:05:07.900> them<00:05:08.110> and
