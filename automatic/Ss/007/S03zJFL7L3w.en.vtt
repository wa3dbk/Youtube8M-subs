by itself
and<00:04:06.079> it<00:04:06.260> should<00:04:06.620> start<00:04:08.019> says<00:04:09.019> the

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
and it should start says the

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:15.190 
and it should start says the
started<00:04:12.049> but<00:04:12.459> yeah<00:04:13.630> this<00:04:14.630> isn't<00:04:14.900> really

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
started but yeah this isn't really

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.009 
started but yeah this isn't really
anything<00:04:15.530> doesn't<00:04:15.979> really<00:04:16.160> do<00:04:16.370> nothing<00:04:17.019> just

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
anything doesn't really do nothing just

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.930 
anything doesn't really do nothing just
stays<00:04:18.199> on<00:04:18.350> the<00:04:18.440> CMD<00:04:18.949> coding

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
stays on the CMD coding

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.080 
stays on the CMD coding
doesn't<00:04:20.420> do<00:04:20.480> anything<00:04:21.190> so<00:04:22.190> let's<00:04:22.730> start<00:04:23.000> up

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
doesn't do anything so let's start up

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.640 
doesn't do anything so let's start up
Gears<00:04:23.540> of<00:04:23.630> War<00:04:23.690> and<00:04:23.840> see<00:04:24.170> if<00:04:24.290> it<00:04:24.410> says<00:04:24.620> anything

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
Gears of War and see if it says anything

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:33.360 
Gears of War and see if it says anything
now<00:04:29.230> there<00:04:30.230> we<00:04:30.380> go

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:48.250 

starts<00:04:34.370> up<00:04:34.490> fine<00:04:36.730> haven't<00:04:37.730> got<00:04:37.820> any<00:04:38.000> airs<00:04:38.210> yet

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.490 

well<00:04:48.980> see<00:04:49.490> if<00:04:49.610> the<00:04:49.760> game<00:04:49.970> starts<00:04:50.540> at<00:04:50.720> although

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.020 

maybe<00:04:54.500> just<00:04:54.770> because<00:04:54.860> the<00:04:55.040> capturing<00:04:55.640> thing

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
maybe just because the capturing thing

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:04.080 
maybe just because the capturing thing
doesn't<00:04:56.390> let<00:04:56.510> it<00:04:56.540> load<00:04:56.900> right

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.820 

it<00:05:05.090> says<00:05:05.660> sometimes<00:05:06.230> it<00:05:06.500> tells<00:05:06.710> you<00:05:06.800> that

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
it says sometimes it tells you that

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:18.930 
it says sometimes it tells you that
error<00:05:08.320> but<00:05:09.320> it's<00:05:09.470> not<00:05:09.680> that<00:05:09.920> Wow

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.850
