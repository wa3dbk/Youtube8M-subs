00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.980 

guys<00:00:07.410> what<00:00:07.710> is<00:00:07.890> going<00:00:08.340> on<00:00:08.460> it's<00:00:08.639> $96<00:00:09.450> here<00:00:09.750> and

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
guys what is going on it's $96 here and

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.270 
guys what is going on it's $96 here and
we<00:00:10.590> have<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:11.309> very<00:00:11.670> interesting<00:00:11.900> rumor<00:00:13.130> how<00:00:14.130> can

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
we have a very interesting rumor how can

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.970 
we have a very interesting rumor how can
I<00:00:14.340> put<00:00:14.490> it<00:00:14.610> t<00:00:14.790> so<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.839> rumor<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.289> but<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.650> Xbox

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
I put it t so the rumor is but the Xbox

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.640 
I put it t so the rumor is but the Xbox
one<00:00:17.100> will<00:00:17.190> be<00:00:17.279> getting<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.609> CPU<00:00:18.180> clock<00:00:18.840> boost

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
one will be getting a CPU clock boost

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.060 
one will be getting a CPU clock boost
and<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.189> GPU<00:00:20.760> clock<00:00:21.420> boost<00:00:21.810> it<00:00:22.500> will<00:00:22.650> also<00:00:22.949> be

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
and a GPU clock boost it will also be

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.120 
and a GPU clock boost it will also be
getting<00:00:23.340> four<00:00:23.609> gates<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.240> additional<00:00:24.779> RAM<00:00:25.130> and

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
getting four gates of additional RAM and

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.220 
getting four gates of additional RAM and
I<00:00:26.730> think<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.630> RAM<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:27.990> pretty

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
I think that the RAM is pretty

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.689 
I think that the RAM is pretty
interesting<00:00:28.500> because<00:00:28.740> that's<00:00:29.160> gonna<00:00:29.460> cost

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
interesting because that's gonna cost

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.460 
interesting because that's gonna cost
millions<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.539> mean<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.840> CPU<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.439> GPU

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
millions I mean the CPU and the GPU

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.370 
millions I mean the CPU and the GPU
boosting<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:33.030> clock<00:00:33.270> speeds<00:00:33.570> that's<00:00:33.809> simple

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
boosting the clock speeds that's simple

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.410 
boosting the clock speeds that's simple
it's<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:34.800> software<00:00:35.489> base<00:00:35.700> they<00:00:35.969> don't<00:00:36.149> have<00:00:36.270> to

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
it's so software base they don't have to

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.420 
it's so software base they don't have to
do<00:00:36.600> anything<00:00:36.899> not<00:00:37.290> much<00:00:37.469> it's<00:00:37.710> it's<00:00:38.190> pretty

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
do anything not much it's it's pretty

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.970 
do anything not much it's it's pretty
simple<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:39.030> four<00:00:40.020> gigs<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.379> extra<00:00:40.620> RAM<00:00:40.770> that's

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
simple but four gigs of extra RAM that's

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.060 
simple but four gigs of extra RAM that's
that<00:00:41.460> will<00:00:41.610> cost<00:00:41.820> them<00:00:41.969> millions<00:00:42.600> okay<00:00:43.070> now

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
that will cost them millions okay now

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.299 
that will cost them millions okay now
bear<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.460> mind<00:00:44.610> it's<00:00:45.030> not<00:00:45.120> like<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.450> PC<00:00:45.930> on<00:00:46.309> a

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
bear in mind it's not like a PC on a

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.420 
bear in mind it's not like a PC on a
console<00:00:48.149> it's<00:00:49.020> incredibly<00:00:49.620> hard<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.920> up<00:00:50.100> to

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
console it's incredibly hard to up to

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.510 
console it's incredibly hard to up to
add<00:00:51.000> more<00:00:51.210> RAM<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.340> you<00:00:53.340> know<00:00:53.460> you

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
add more RAM in you have to you know you

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.490 
add more RAM in you have to you know you
take<00:00:53.760> motherboard<00:00:54.420> because<00:00:54.600> on<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.960> PC<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.289> put

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
take motherboard because on a PC I put

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.520 
take motherboard because on a PC I put
it<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.770> this<00:00:55.800> way<00:00:55.949> on<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.969> PC<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.690> take<00:00:58.350> them

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
it to you this way on a PC you take them

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.410 
it to you this way on a PC you take them
you<00:00:58.770> take<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.160> out<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.309> your<00:00:59.520> hand<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.270> put

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
you take it out of your hand and you put

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.869 
you take it out of your hand and you put
a<00:01:00.480> new<00:01:00.690> Ram<00:01:00.899> in<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.469> simple<00:01:01.949> it's<00:01:02.609> not

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
a new Ram in it's simple it's not

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.369 
a new Ram in it's simple it's not
time-consuming<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.660> takes<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.960> about<00:01:04.140> one

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
time-consuming it takes you about one

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.620 
time-consuming it takes you about one
minute<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:05.460> take<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.880> know<00:01:05.970> take<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.299> cover

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
minute to take you know take the cover

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.570 
minute to take you know take the cover
off<00:01:06.750> your<00:01:07.020> PC<00:01:07.409> put<00:01:07.650> them<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:08.010> put<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.369> cover

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
off your PC put them in put the cover

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.330 
off your PC put them in put the cover
back<00:01:08.670> on<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.180> turn<00:01:10.080> your<00:01:10.260> PC<00:01:10.439> on<00:01:10.680> it's<00:01:11.220> about

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
back on and turn your PC on it's about

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.600 
back on and turn your PC on it's about
one<00:01:11.670> minute<00:01:11.880> okay<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:13.380> console<00:01:14.100> however

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
one minute okay on a console however

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.539 
one minute okay on a console however
they<00:01:14.820> have<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.200> take<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.380> RAM<00:01:16.590> take<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.369> RAM

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
they have to take the RAM take the RAM

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.850 
they have to take the RAM take the RAM
chips<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.270> do<00:01:18.330> them<00:01:18.570> onto<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.290> motherboard<00:01:19.470> so

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
chips so do them onto the motherboard so

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.740 
chips so do them onto the motherboard so
you<00:01:20.100> know<00:01:20.400> they<00:01:20.909> obviously<00:01:21.090> don't<00:01:21.450> want<00:01:21.659> you

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
you know they obviously don't want you

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.359 
you know they obviously don't want you
touching<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.290> RAM<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.650> upgrading<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.220> and

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
touching the RAM and upgrading it and

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.130 
touching the RAM and upgrading it and
stuff<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:23.790> they're<00:01:23.939> gonna<00:01:24.030> sort<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.630> on<00:01:24.780> and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
stuff so they're gonna sort of it on and

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.660 
stuff so they're gonna sort of it on and
that<00:01:25.650> takes<00:01:25.890> time<00:01:26.040> plus<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.180> takes<00:01:27.360> money<00:01:27.900> and

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
that takes time plus it takes money and

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.429 
that takes time plus it takes money and
don't<00:01:29.670> forget<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.210> Microsoft<00:01:30.780> are<00:01:30.900> already

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
don't forget that Microsoft are already

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.039 
don't forget that Microsoft are already
in<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.680> bit<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:32.070> trouble<00:01:32.610> with<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.090> price<00:01:33.450> and

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
in a bit of trouble with the price and

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.660 
in a bit of trouble with the price and
with<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.920> sale<00:01:35.159> which<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.460> don't<00:01:35.520> think

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
with the sale which I don't think

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.609 
with the sale which I don't think
Microsoft<00:01:36.119> are<00:01:36.390> selling<00:01:36.720> as<00:01:36.869> well<00:01:37.110> as<00:01:37.170> Sony

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
Microsoft are selling as well as Sony

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.219 
Microsoft are selling as well as Sony
worldwide<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.790> mean<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:39.420> different<00:01:39.840> countries

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
worldwide I mean in different countries

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.440 
worldwide I mean in different countries
yeah<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.680> Xbox<00:01:41.070> one<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.340> outselling<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.119> ps4

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
yeah the Xbox one is outselling the ps4

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.740 
yeah the Xbox one is outselling the ps4
but<00:01:42.979> generally<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.490> Xbox<00:01:44.880> one<00:01:45.060> isn't<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.540> bit

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
but generally the Xbox one isn't a bit

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.210 
but generally the Xbox one isn't a bit
of<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:47.090> financial<00:01:48.259> all<00:01:49.259> Microsoft<00:01:49.829> are<00:01:49.979> really

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
of a financial all Microsoft are really

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.920 
of a financial all Microsoft are really
financially<00:01:50.490> doing<00:01:51.030> bad<00:01:51.270> but<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.630> mean<00:01:51.689> the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
financially doing bad but I mean the

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.740 
financially doing bad but I mean the
Xbox<00:01:52.259> one<00:01:52.409> isn't<00:01:52.740> doing<00:01:53.040> very<00:01:53.070> well<00:01:53.750> yeah

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
Xbox one isn't doing very well yeah

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.090 
Xbox one isn't doing very well yeah
that's<00:01:54.990> what<00:01:55.350> I'm<00:01:55.439> trying<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.710> get<00:01:55.829> at<00:01:55.979> the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
that's what I'm trying to get at the

well now the four gigs of ram is very

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.559 
well now the four gigs of ram is very
minor<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.429> just<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.819> rumor<00:02:09.090> but<00:02:09.209> if<00:02:09.360> they<00:02:09.509> do

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
megabits of RAM because they really
wanted<00:02:46.110> to<00:02:47.360> actually<00:02:48.360> make<00:02:48.630> it<00:02:48.750> will<00:02:49.170> work<00:02:49.410> and

mean obviously for them to increase it
to<00:02:58.340> 526<00:02:59.340> then<00:03:00.120> it<00:03:00.270> must<00:03:00.480> have<00:03:00.540> been<00:03:00.630> like<00:03:00.900> it

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
to 526 then it must have been like it

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.470 
to 526 then it must have been like it
must<00:03:01.320> have<00:03:01.470> looked<00:03:01.590> like<00:03:01.770> shit<00:03:02.160> so<00:03:03.030> I<00:03:03.060> mean

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
must have looked like shit so I mean

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.030 
must have looked like shit so I mean
they've<00:03:04.050> done<00:03:04.260> this<00:03:04.350> in<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.590> past<00:03:04.770> and<00:03:04.950> I

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
they've done this in the past and I

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.260 
they've done this in the past and I
wouldn't<00:03:05.310> be<00:03:05.370> surprised<00:03:05.670> if<00:03:05.760> they<00:03:05.940> do<00:03:06.000> this

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
wouldn't be surprised if they do this

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.170 
wouldn't be surprised if they do this
now<00:03:06.710> if<00:03:07.710> we<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:08.280> love<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:08.670> games<00:03:08.880> weren't

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
now if we I love the games weren't

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.000 
now if we I love the games weren't
actually<00:03:09.570> running<00:03:09.750> on<00:03:09.900> there<00:03:10.050> on<00:03:10.200> an<00:03:10.440> Xbox<00:03:10.650> one

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
actually running on there on an Xbox one

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.290 
actually running on there on an Xbox one
maybe<00:03:11.190> that's<00:03:11.460> because<00:03:11.760> they<00:03:11.850> didn't<00:03:12.120> look

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
maybe that's because they didn't look

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.510 
maybe that's because they didn't look
very<00:03:12.480> good<00:03:12.630> on<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:13.020> Xbox<00:03:13.380> one<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.800> don't<00:03:13.920> know<00:03:14.160> a

lot of background processes because they

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.830 
lot of background processes because they

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
that's exactly what I want but yeah four

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.939 
that's exactly what I want but yeah four
gigabytes<00:04:40.659> of<00:04:40.780> addition<00:04:41.169> around<00:04:41.440> the<00:04:41.650> only

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
gigabytes of addition around the only

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.680 
gigabytes of addition around the only
reason<00:04:42.220> why<00:04:42.340> they<00:04:42.520> would<00:04:42.669> ever<00:04:42.909> need<00:04:43.300> this<00:04:43.479> is

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
reason why they would ever need this is

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.200 
reason why they would ever need this is
because<00:04:44.139> they<00:04:44.379> Dave<00:04:45.340> running<00:04:45.729> too<00:04:45.849> many<00:04:46.030> back

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
because they Dave running too many back

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.730 
because they Dave running too many back
home<00:04:46.419> purchases<00:04:46.900> if<00:04:46.990> they<00:04:47.169> cut<00:04:47.440> down<00:04:47.470> the

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
home purchases if they cut down the

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.890 
home purchases if they cut down the
background<00:04:48.580> processes<00:04:49.300> the<00:04:49.449> games<00:04:49.690> would

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
background processes the games would

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.860 
background processes the games would
look<00:04:50.110> better<00:04:50.319> but<00:04:50.949> no<00:04:51.280> they<00:04:52.150> want<00:04:52.360> to<00:04:52.449> increase

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
look better but no they want to increase

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.540 
look better but no they want to increase
the<00:04:53.050> background<00:04:53.470> processes<00:04:53.979> so<00:04:54.370> they're

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
the background processes so they're

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.820 
the background processes so they're
adding<00:04:54.819> more<00:04:54.849> RAM<00:04:55.330> so<00:04:56.080> that<00:04:56.259> the<00:04:56.379> background

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
adding more RAM so that the background

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.830 
adding more RAM so that the background
process<00:04:57.159> can<00:04:57.430> be<00:04:57.580> handled<00:04:58.210> by<00:04:58.330> more<00:04:58.599> Ram

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
process can be handled by more Ram

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.110 
process can be handled by more Ram
meaning<00:04:59.590> that<00:04:59.710> the<00:04:59.830> games<00:05:00.069> have<00:05:00.310> more<00:05:00.610> RAM<00:05:00.849> to

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
meaning that the games have more RAM to

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.450 
meaning that the games have more RAM to
run<00:05:01.389> on<00:05:01.630> it's<00:05:02.139> a<00:05:02.259> bit<00:05:02.440> confusing<00:05:02.560> but<00:05:03.159> you<00:05:03.280> guys

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
run on it's a bit confusing but you guys

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.580 
run on it's a bit confusing but you guys
understand<00:05:04.060> me<00:05:04.240> because<00:05:04.960> if<00:05:05.110> you<00:05:05.199> guys<00:05:05.319> know

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
understand me because if you guys know

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.620 
understand me because if you guys know
the<00:05:05.770> ps4<00:05:06.039> isn't<00:05:06.430> gonna<00:05:06.580> have<00:05:06.759> many<00:05:07.060> background

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
the ps4 isn't gonna have many background

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.969 
the ps4 isn't gonna have many background
processes<00:05:08.199> don't<00:05:08.319> get<00:05:08.500> me<00:05:08.590> wrong<00:05:08.620> it's<00:05:08.889> gonna

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
processes don't get me wrong it's gonna

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:10.170 
processes don't get me wrong it's gonna
