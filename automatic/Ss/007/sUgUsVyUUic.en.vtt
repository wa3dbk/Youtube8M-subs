00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.440
 I was even very impressed 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.030

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.410

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.570
 what is possible to wait 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.550
 today on the youtube six channel 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.229
 years I like to see 705 really serious 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.640
 pleasure know that I prepare my rat 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.270
 twenty thousand subscribers maybe another 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.429
 parody 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.110
 here I do not say more do not hesitate 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:20.030
 to switch his youtube machine 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.040
 regularly pay taxes in it and in 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.689
 descriptions and then here we hesitated 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.450
 not to spend his games today 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.250
 we are here for these two prices out at 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.960
 we then I just played with my 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.979
 teacher going to the console then 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.869
 you have to tell yourself but no but it's 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.930
 not possible then you have to know if 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.130
 about six seven years ago I want to have 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.530
 finally I am since she has never but 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.030
 that was when I was really fucking 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.649
 young and so here was there a 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.990
 teacher who was a replacement my 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.850
 principal teacher 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.290
 and so that's past the teacher 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.799
 principal and simply on leave from 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.420
 maternity 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.770
 so here we have a replacement who 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.939
 was not necessarily a very good teacher 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.790
 qualified we will say that like that 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.450
 and so here it is simply 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.890
 teach everything you could 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.180
 learn but here he was not 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.890
 necessarily an authority of the most 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.460
 important past it's already a 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.170
 substitute 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.820
 and in addition he is a young substitute and 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.619
 who says young substitute says here it is 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.200
 naturally but you take advantage of this 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.480
 situation to chat to start to 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.700
 discuss finally here you see what I 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.290
 mean you take really enjoyed 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.760
 this opportunity for a little can 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.500
 to be more comfortable in class and a museum 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.670
 one more or just I think 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.440
 we've all done that once 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.569
 life and then here we go 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.190
 and then here comes a day here they come 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.200
 in class they are here 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.060
 sir so badly hello I introduce myself 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.730
 I'm 24 years old my name is sir if 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.560
 badly and it's a vice president you 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.280
 quietly and then to bron the listen 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.959
 home etc. 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.459
 everything goes well and then after they 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.780
 go up after one or two weeks 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.720
 we are in class giving exercises 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.269
 and leicester from his satchel a 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.590
 fuck sock for him to take us out 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.900
 sock it was an old one 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.670
 old well Salchaud SÃ©tois tell him 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.120
 the socks that you really have not 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.010
 touch me 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.590
 So here and it was released more well 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.269
 big we did not understand and here it is 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.070
 take out his floor from his binder he 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.079
 puts on his desk and run his schoolbag 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.430
 quietly and then after they 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.620
 advance to this sock and we 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.060
 we were really in a question 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.810
 in questioning simply said 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.829
 but what is this thing 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.450
 what is this sock 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.900
 what does the teacher do 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.310
 simply 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.630
 so what happened was 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.489
 that here in the sock there was 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.079
 something and in this thing it's 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.400
 cesc then sock by no 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.280
 what was it all 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.079
 just his nintendo ds here he goes out 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.340
 his ten hostesses his sock 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.190
 he puts away his sock 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.769
 he began to animate his ds we 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.329
 was there but what does it do and 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.850
 here he turns on his ds simply 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.319
 and then after he launches the zelda game 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.190
 here I will always remember it 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:38.600
 this game that plays and who with whom paris 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.900
 play all the time with this game there all 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.560
 simply 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.889
 and then and then and that's it he started to 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.690
 to play 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.819
 so how could I play this 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.019
 goddess of the teacher simply 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.850
 abandoned he was stuck at a level 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.590
 in zelda is there then what does he 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.880
 did is he was asking everyone 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.579
 students see if they could help him 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.959
 to cross this level and so here is my 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.550
 friend calls me he tells me is it finally 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.520
 here I know you're playing pretty well 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.170
 the nintendo ds is what you would be noon 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.060
 in this level anja zelda so this is a 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.110
 very complicated level and so ultimately 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.490
 I wondered a little bit about the 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.990
 level I start to pass two three 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.670
 minutes on him he was next to 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.190
 me it looks and how I went 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.900
 I practiced the level and then they are 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.060
 start to follow a small country then 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.510
 finally I cross the level he me 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.120
 thank 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.700
 and then here it is I got up I got 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.340
 make my place as if nothing had happened 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.530
 the other students were here 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.540
 totally dead laughing imagine the thing 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.460
 and then from time to time at the gab and 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.440
 a few days during the year he sees 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.610
 there they were stuck so here that 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.980
 if he was doing his job asking for help 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.150
 to heavenly and not necessarily all 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.680
 time me but in any case it was 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.970
 really super weird to have a 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.530
 teacher who asked you to help him 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.670
 already to sincerely help her that she 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.900
 teacher needs help 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.550
 they have so much pride that 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.690
 never ask dead but in addition if 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.470
 it's a video game that's it 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.990
 totally epic 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.340
 that was really enough 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.180
 impressive and then here I am 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.500
 really invite to comment 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.330
 a story maybe that is similar 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.130
 to this one I will really read all 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.930
 comments it makes me super happy and 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.550

 evening where a very nice afternoon all 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.240
