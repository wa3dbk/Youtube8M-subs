world of the new roubaix sl4 alright so

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.509 
world of the new roubaix sl4 alright so
the<00:00:13.230> key<00:00:13.349> thing<00:00:13.410> on<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.740> bay<00:00:13.950> is<00:00:14.070> so<00:00:14.190> for<00:00:14.400> this

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
the key thing on the bay is so for this

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.460 
the key thing on the bay is so for this
year<00:00:14.759> with<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.450> make<00:00:15.599> it<00:00:15.690> faster<00:00:16.109> literally

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
year with the make it faster literally

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.099 
year with the make it faster literally
and<00:00:16.680> failing<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.430> be<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.670> fastest<00:00:18.240> bike<00:00:18.840> out

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
and failing to be the fastest bike out

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.080 
and failing to be the fastest bike out
there<00:00:19.140> in<00:00:19.350> its<00:00:19.470> class<00:00:19.680> some<00:00:20.369> key<00:00:20.550> things<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.880> do

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
there in its class some key things to do

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.880 
there in its class some key things to do
that<00:00:21.330> first<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.050> foremost<00:00:22.140> increased

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
that first and foremost increased

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.189 
that first and foremost increased
overall<00:00:23.189> torsional<00:00:23.760> stiffness<00:00:23.939> so<00:00:24.660> we

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
overall torsional stiffness so we

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.630 
overall torsional stiffness so we
continued<00:00:25.619> with<00:00:25.740> our<00:00:25.859> cobra<00:00:26.160> theme<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.550> we

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
continued with our cobra theme that we

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.339 
continued with our cobra theme that we
started<00:00:26.910> with<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.090> roubaix<00:00:27.300> sl3<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.050> time<00:00:28.199> it

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
started with the roubaix sl3 and time it

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.109 
started with the roubaix sl3 and time it
gets<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.560> afford<00:00:28.859> we<00:00:29.310> evolved<00:00:29.580> that<00:00:29.789> further

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
gets to afford we evolved that further

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.740 
gets to afford we evolved that further
and<00:00:30.720> what<00:00:30.840> were<00:00:30.960> able<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.230> do<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:32.040> actually

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
and what were able to do is actually

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.500 
and what were able to do is actually
have<00:00:33.750> size<00:00:34.290> specific<00:00:34.950> works<00:00:35.670> head<00:00:36.149> tube<00:00:36.360> and
