00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.679
 project sponsor sapphire 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:12.929
 sapphire our best recommendations to everyone 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.599
 Hi, I am Arina and these are the ones who are the kitchen 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.100
 questions of the matter that torments you if 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.570
 to aim at with alla is it worth 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.900
 seek to buy a motherboard with 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.269
 Formula 16 x 16 to 88 x cards or 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.720
 enough to start a little bit of excursion for 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.970
 newbies 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.840
 you buy motherboard inserts 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.539
 video card slot 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.219
 and it works for you at 16x speed 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.469
 concerns even the seediest easy 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.590
 motherboard is a standard we take two 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.809
 fees from gigabytes 1,116 thousand rubles 2 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.850
 seven to one if you insert the card into 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.300
 the top two orange slots will work 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.770
 according to the formula 1616 it is another 88 that is 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.620
 if there were only one dress for 2 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.090
 graphics card she processed as 16 and if 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.760
 we insert the second that both cards work 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.280
 already at 8 and here is a reasonable question and what 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.079
 It will eventually result in a powerful judgment. 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.280
 detailed test conducted by the portal of those 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.260
 power apb.com 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.449
 let's start from the conclusions as they give 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.250
 clear picture is not being tested Siamese 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.260
 carp a map separately which 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.450
 operate at speeds of 16 or 8 or 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.369
 four and installed in pisya express 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.380
 first second and third generations 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.689
 so take gtx680 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.549
 and full hd resolution card for one hundred 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.310
 percent is revealed by 16 times 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.409
 express 2 and 3 write speeds but if 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.210
 first generation then only 96 percent 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.650
 so motherboards with the first 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.630
 generation immediately discarded 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.820
 and what will happen if eight times the speed 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.619
 if you pisya express 3 worry 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.720
 not worth it you get almost the same 100 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.869
 percent guys almost everything 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.880
 modern boards under socket 1151 in 55 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.710
 charged by signing or crossfire 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.320
 have exactly pisya express you were shaking 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.420
 so the question closes immediately not 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.159
 worry your for video card level 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.560
 770 280x 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.710
 will work as if the formula is not 88 but 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.259
 16 16 minus 12 percent that is chase 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.810
 surely for 1616 is not worth you only 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.420
 need to follow to support the mother 88 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.060
 they are 4:04 another fourfold speed 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.280
 when writing, express 3 will reveal a map on 96 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.899
 percent of that is you will loss 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.580
 lose the same 4 percent 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.830
 performance if you have 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.129
 formula 8 8 but on the mother list express 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.069
 2 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.230
 cards will be revealed only on 70 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.450
 percent if 88 is on the mother list 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.389
 express 1 to be painted with army mothers 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.489
 there is no sense to the same formula 1616 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:24.650
 you will not be saved for losses will amount to 4 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.480
 percent so dangerous fourfold 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.150
 speeds on writing express 2 and write 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.639
 express 1 card will be revealed only on 87 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.500
 and 73 percent overall if you are thinking 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:35.329
 two video cards to be used then the mother should 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.879
 support write to ps3 ports and 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.799
 the formula should be 88 or better then 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.810
 rub will not be any if you take 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.040
 video card from m somewhere there requirements for 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.409
 the formula is not so tough 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.730
 but again write express 3 and 8 8 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.680
 provide cards for almost a hundred 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.480
 percent we don't know what will happen over 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.840
 powerful maps it will be a separate topic 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.419
 articles 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.980
 and if the resolution is higher than full hd then 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:57.019
 here oddly enough requirements for 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.519
 speeds do not grow and all decrease 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.469
 because the load on the card is growing 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.629
 the card counts further and only 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:04.010
 then dumps the data and then like this 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.419
 strange you can use the system 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.340
 boards with write express 2 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:10.310
 a two percent loss is negligible 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.780
 The main thing that the formula was 88 let's 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.400
 Now let's see how it looks in 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.519
 real game battlefield 3 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.009
 if food express 3 who does not matter 16 or 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.229
 eightfold I speed you get 71 

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:23.540
 fps yes even if four times 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:25.699
 get the same if the food express 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.919
 2 then almost seventy one fps here 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:29.269
 will be at a speed of eight, but at 4 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:31.159
 already decreasing by 1 fps 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.659
 the higher the resolution the smaller 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.759
 requirements for speed formula in 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:36.019
 principle, it turns out that the formula 16 4 

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:37.609
 also have the right to life 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.239
 the first card is revealed at 100 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:42.979
 percent 2 to 96 98 important to ports 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.959
 Were write express 3 so let's 

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:46.159
 draw conclusions and they will be unexpected 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.169
 for heavy games 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:50.810
 Full hd and higher resolution like this 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:51.530
 strange charge with speeds of 1616 not 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.120
 needed at all 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.189
 only if you do not collect put 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.750
 world records for a new computer 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:57.349
 need to be guided by express express 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.389
 3 part ii 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.489
 although it is not fatal and owner piss 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:03.979
 express 2 should not be discouraged especially if 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.199
 one video card formula 88 too 

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:08.449
 the excess you get the difference where 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:10.459
 she doesn't need fps and so high 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:13.669
 but for the future itâ€™s better to choose 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.060
 exactly 88 formula 16 4 has the right to 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:16.039
 a life 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.709
 Especially if the money back to back and in the store 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:20.659
 tangible difference between boards 8 8 and 16 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.389
 4 but it goes without saying 

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:24.409
 pysya express 1 is obsolete morally 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.770
 almost all modern video cards 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:27.780
 last two lines 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.879
 support pisya express 3 here with 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.900
 choice bother not and with you 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:32.900
 was arina see you
