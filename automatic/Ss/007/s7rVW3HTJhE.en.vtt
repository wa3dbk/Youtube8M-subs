00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.150
 hello everyone with you emily and today we have 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.560
 there will be a somewhat unusual release i 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.389
 thought it would be nice to do 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.110
 video review on anything related to 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.360
 parrots 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.400
 and then my eyes fell on the cells with 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.410
 birds I think people who want 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.020
 further expand living space with your 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.689
 buddies this review will be useful but 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.400
 first check your homework in 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.320
 In the last issue I asked to determine 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.630
 gender and age of budgerigars 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.539
 some guys voiced their answer in 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.910
 comments and you are friends right at first 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.770
 photo female up to 3 months 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.480
 and on the second a male from five to eight 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.340
 months Well now I imagine 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.969
 your attention video review cells firms 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.780
 ferplast 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.910
 I'm 4 start with unpacking unfortunately 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.670
 show how going cell I can not 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.590
 since mine is already a year and a half in the box 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.460
 with a cell there is an instruction so I think 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.789
 you figure out what is included in the kit 2 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.320
 Bravo 23 type plastic feeders 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.870
 sliding perches with rubber 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.530
 coated incredibly uncomfortable stuff want 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.750
 tell you 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.570
 I had to use them and left 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.520
 after and not an unpleasant impression 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.920
 does not hold the set length 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.320
 after jumping the bird perch just 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.390
 stacks and falls maybe it's 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.640
 Only I still evolving itself 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.770
 perch but in any case enjoy 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.509
 they do not advise as permanent 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.340
 seating on plastic or rubber on 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:31.440
 the soles of the feet formed new 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.960
 nested fruit holder comfortable thing 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.740
 besides fruits and vegetables can be fixed 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.780
 and mineral stone or sepia also in 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.360
 There is a drinking bowl for horizontal 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.210
 against hooks on four hooks 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.820
 I have no hooks left but no 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.190
 does not affect yuki stability so 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.160
 if the hooks break nothing 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.140
 do not be discouraged and the last item 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.620
 from the set of this is a mirror with 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.440
 bell now talk about the most 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.080
 cells and parameters 59 centimeters 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.470
 length 33 cm width 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.000
 and 60 centimeters high there is a high 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.760
 pallet which reduces the amount 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.890
 feathers and debris around the cage pallet 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.620
 retractable cage which is also very convenient 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.420
 for the owners of the birds below her soups 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.459
 which block the gap formed 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.160
 in a casing that does not allow the bird to 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.660
 no master get out of the cage 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.090
 the pallet is attached to the cage body 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.709
 thanks to this clamping mechanism 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.040
 incredibly simple so with these 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.150
 There should be no cage problems 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.280
 horizontal powder painted 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.730
 powder coating method 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.690
 coloring 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.640
 this technology is getting 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.560
 high quality decorative protective 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.360
 coatings are formed from 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.610
 polymer powders that are applied to 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.140
 painted surface and body one of 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.820
 advantages is strength and 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.519
 durability i.e. the paint is stable 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.530
 damage and really after the test 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.239
 when we ask you to scrape the paint with a knife 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.220
 stayed on the bars they are on leasing and 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.840
 the only place on the grid where 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.720
 no paint is a joint between 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.010
 rods and door but this defect is 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.650
 all ferplast cells 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.040
 Doors by the way folding that in my opinion 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.690
 much more convenient than the guillotine door 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.150
 feeders offered to manufacturers personally 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.769
 incredibly convenient for me at the feeders 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.459
 Bravo two types have swivel 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.070
 mechanism 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.299
 although why am I telling you this better 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.299
 to see once than hear a hundred times 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:34.220
 results cell ferplast for 4 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.620
 Great for content in it 1 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.330
 scare check or a couple of wavy she 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.520
 has a stylish and concise design 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.930
 high pallet resistant to 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.390
 paint damage opposite 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.209
 did she really have no cons 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.180
 ask you there are three in my opinion 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.459
 the first cells are not collapsible during assembly 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.860
 parts are fastened almost tightly 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.450
 and so when trying to disassemble a cell 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.000
 there is a big risk to break it out 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.760
 plastic body parts second minus 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.290
 this is what feeders require upgrading 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.330
 since the manufacturer did too 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.060
 small cut and bird easily 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.190
 can get stuck and 3 after a few 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.620
 months of use the cell seems to you 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.690
 incredibly small and I want to increase 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.040
 living space its pernatu well and 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.260
 finally, a comparison of dimensions 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:23.720
 standard cell caster hall store 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:29.540
 and cells when she is 4 also here is a photo example 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:31.370
 arranging this cell hope this 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.910
 video review you liked and turned out 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.640
 is useful 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.870
 with you was envy health to you and yours 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.870
 bird all bye
