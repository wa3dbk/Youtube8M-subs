 hi i'm sad free just with titti welcome alicemail sl what where 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.389
 learn to play to be part of the evening 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.629
 home of the cinema lesson that I would like to show that works in Italy integrals 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:15.749
 piano 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:17.900
 then 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.199
 like you thought 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.449
 every there is at least almost all piano pedal notes there are some who have a 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.619
 ox 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:26.749
 who have only 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:28.489
 the one on the right 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:31.489
 central ecole 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.140
 the receptors begin by saying that there is a difference between pianos 

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:40.700
 vertical and horizontal ones 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.400
 in fact, even their pedals have different text functions we analyze 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.640
 those of a vertical 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.310
 italyneedsdl enteral of the portico of resonance and precisely the function of 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.960
 nipping sounds for example are not without penalty 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.770
 without pressing the pedal and so 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.579
 he won't give up

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.630
 the high school students 3 - the pedal 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.710
 in this way pushing the foot reached 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.680
 the rice keys I have 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.680
 lore 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.830
 it is not an evil to the full naked breast 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.870
 firm if it crashes 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.870
 for what happens inside the piano we see 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.570
 apriamolo 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.570
 let's find out together what happens 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.770
 these are the hammers 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.470
 let's see these here are without penalty 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.200
 he stops by pressing the right pedal what happens 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.730
 minions here are the dampers 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.040
 that is 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.330
 these heads here criminal section 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.320
 these move 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.320
 in fact they prolong the sound 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.559
 towards federal pg these move 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:16.559
 spider

 Milan 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:25.769
 in these the strings are to be affirmed that free and therefore to block her like this 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.169
 I loosen them and therefore I am gino

 to be a registered exorcist 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.669
 la7d is history the middle pedal this here which is the pedal of the 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:45.079
 sardine 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.749
 which function soon 

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:52.359
 it has the function of considerably reducing the volume of the sound without pedals 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.219
 long null value 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:58.749
 instead with the sardine we are totally different 

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:05.609
 awwwwwwww don carlo the Roman walls are just a lot 

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:17.999

 a natural world returns to normal from the sunny days 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:33.939
 this is the text of the evening away 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:35.249
 see also here 

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:40.019
 what happens by pressing this pedal then pedals out of the way 

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:44.429
 what happens 

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:47.049
 this strip here 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:53.069
 r a. the sabina strip is made of an absorbent material 

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:58.459
 which is when we press the bike pedal and then the damping is absorbed 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.679
 we die egua to muffle we say the blow 

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:06.409
 on the ropes then absorb most of the soil 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.509
 in this case 

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:12.459
 we press the pedal is approaching 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:18.629
 lady have changed considerably bum bum bum bum facebook logo I love dad. 

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:21.840
 I'm back to normal 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.520
 photo 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.710
 criminal 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.440
 on the left that we say it appears - the function of the sardine is why 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.150
 many piano have only two pedals 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.169
 elena more features that almost nobody uses 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:39.949
 in fact they have changed very little from that without essence pedaling 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:42.949
 pedale uu romanorum the Roman 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:45.629
 so instead for pedal 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:47.469
 u ... 

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:48.840
 I'm 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.379
 it's not true value record 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:59.310
 I recovered from the race to recognize the difference even here we see what 

00:04:59.309 --> 00:05:01.490
 happens inside the instrument 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.539
 we see that the hammers 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:07.669
 they move slightly 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.300
 so without pedal 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.689
 and so with the pedal without penalty with the pedal 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:15.249
 they move slightly 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:18.249
 here there is not a month satisfaction low 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:23.099
 and therefore 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:31.029
 Mature moms then hit her boom boom name in ancient times. a pon 

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:34.339
 Cheerleaders. - part because and they move 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.629
 bon ton 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:40.739
 instead of what mothers do not say text with only a part of 

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:44.680
 map of the marauder and therefore I am 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.620
 negrita 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.599
 folding 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:51.460
 so now it's a lid 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.749
 the big difference between the grand pianos 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:01.300
 and these vertical then always have 3 pedals the right one always the pedal 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.199
 of the fort 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:05.189
 the center one 

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:08.490
 it is no longer the mute 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.699
 eh a pedal for other functions practically at function d 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.689
 just stretch a sound for example 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:19.689
 if I want to prolong only r 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:25.149
 I don't want that when I remove the finger r it keeps on playing but I want it to 

00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:26.240
 other notes 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.500
 normal bologna will practically take the center petals 

00:06:32.869 --> 00:06:36.519
 for now the button to alter the center will raise 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.900
 crime murder race pedal consider his mother 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.559
 this night login aressana limit reverse will remain normal 

00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:48.740
 and this function is very useful in the works in which to 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.970
 on the contrary, it asks if you want to have greater precision instead of using the 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:54.380
 delay resonance 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.460
 sisal with the plants to collapse. once 

00:06:57.999 --> 00:07:04.239
 while the mute is on the left is gay amanda patient function not only 

00:07:04.239 --> 00:07:05.449
 lower the volume 

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:10.020
 that is, and therefore slow to visit the instrument of the are the instrument but 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.620
 changes just the year 

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:16.340
 the timbre of the instrument is in fact an audio package 

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:20.039
 and a lack of performance 

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:23.290
 truly indescribable then the tool that 

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:25.860
 are the piano desco Go pianos
