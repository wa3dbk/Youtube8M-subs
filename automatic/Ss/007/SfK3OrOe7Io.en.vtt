give<00:00:00.510> flash<00:00:00.870> that<00:00:01.140> generator<00:00:01.560> excuse<00:00:02.250> me<00:00:02.399> I'll

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
give flash that generator excuse me I'll

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.400 
give flash that generator excuse me I'll
use<00:00:03.000> my<00:00:03.179> ring<00:00:03.419> to<00:00:03.540> give<00:00:03.689> you<00:00:03.780> a<00:00:03.810> running<00:00:04.170> stuff

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
use my ring to give you a running stuff

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.530 
use my ring to give you a running stuff
our<00:00:04.980> combined<00:00:05.430> speeds<00:00:05.790> might<00:00:06.120> be<00:00:06.299> enough<00:00:06.509> to

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
our combined speeds might be enough to

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.200 
our combined speeds might be enough to
get<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.839> generator<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.350> open<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:07.680> wormhole

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.210 
get the generator to open the wormhole

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.100 
get the generator to open the wormhole
that's<00:00:09.210> crazy

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
that's crazy

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.510 
that's crazy
you've<00:00:10.380> got<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.590> better<00:00:10.860> idea

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.980 

according<00:00:18.520> to<00:00:18.550> Shawn's<00:00:18.849> calculations<00:00:19.539> the

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
according to Shawn's calculations the

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.050 
according to Shawn's calculations the
wormhole<00:00:20.529> has<00:00:20.740> to<00:00:20.860> open<00:00:21.009> exactly<00:00:21.520> seven<00:00:21.910> and<00:00:22.029> a

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
wormhole has to open exactly seven and a

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.120 
wormhole has to open exactly seven and a
half<00:00:22.210> minutes<00:00:22.570> into<00:00:22.720> the<00:00:22.869> run<00:00:23.080> any<00:00:23.619> earlier

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
half minutes into the run any earlier

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.740 
half minutes into the run any earlier
it'll<00:00:24.490> be<00:00:24.610> too<00:00:24.789> far<00:00:25.029> from<00:00:25.119> the<00:00:25.300> Sun<00:00:25.450> to<00:00:25.539> have<00:00:25.630> an

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
it'll be too far from the Sun to have an

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.839 
it'll be too far from the Sun to have an
effect<00:00:26.079> any<00:00:26.619> later<00:00:26.890> and<00:00:27.070> you<00:00:27.400> risk<00:00:27.610> tearing

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:27.849 
effect any later and you risk tearing

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.429 
effect any later and you risk tearing
the<00:00:28.060> Sun<00:00:28.239> apart<00:00:28.570> through<00:00:28.720> the<00:00:28.779> wormhole

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 
the Sun apart through the wormhole

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.369 
the Sun apart through the wormhole
got<00:00:29.860> it<00:00:30.039> no<00:00:30.520> pressure<00:00:30.880> huh<00:00:31.210> let's<00:00:32.050> get<00:00:32.230> this

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
got it no pressure huh let's get this

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.890 
got it no pressure huh let's get this
