00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.170
 Welcome to a new one 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:24.169
 follow epics today with one 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.380
 unboxing and back out of the house 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:30.470
 Rocket yes we already had one 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.380
 mouse and a keyboard and yes something is missing 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.230
 of course a headset and yes 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:45.230
 this is the cave xddd 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:48.440
 mio this is how it looks like with a typical rocket look 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.290
 very cool here is that 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.530
 You can also use 360 Â° microphone 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:57.020
 turn around and lose weight and yes here 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.770
 also the typical coloration though 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.300
 Besides 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.860
 can make quieter minutes 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.820
 what else to say it was from 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.070
 Looking back the headset has him 250 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.369
 millimeter speaker in it what you 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.840
 really rich sound allows such 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.700
 already said you can the microphone 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.040
 lose weight 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.590
 it is very easy so not so much 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.549
 as upside down as possible 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.110
 accordingly also longer gaming and 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:30.049
 Now, of course, somehow always a 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.440
 very high quality because 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:37.520
 should also hold a bit 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:42.200
 and yes, of course, as always 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.720
 jack plug and is there to tackle that 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.770
 good things just out now 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.200
 and then we'll have a look again 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.979
 now a bit more precise 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.979
 have fun 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.690
 I pack 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.930
 as always packed very well 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:39.220
 what comes first the fore a blue 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.010
 cable and of course the typical ones 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:03:02.980
 jack connection once for the microphone 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:03:04.510
 and once for the sound of now 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:16.230
 a little installation guide 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:24.030
 with the controller 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:26.140
 we see a louder on off that 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:32.280
 microphone accordingly so you guys 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:32.280

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.910
 is so that we can hear everything 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.980
 degree, of course, very much in eu states 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.880
