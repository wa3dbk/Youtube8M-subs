00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
don't play this defense and all of a

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.200 
don't play this defense and all of a
sudden<00:00:22.529> we<00:00:23.130> see<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.460> people<00:00:23.699> are<00:00:23.880> putting<00:00:24.060> in

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
sudden we see it people are putting in

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.700 
sudden we see it people are putting in
different<00:00:24.480> defenses<00:00:24.960> because<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.350> number<00:00:25.560> 9

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
different defenses because the number 9

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.740 
different defenses because the number 9
and<00:00:25.859> number<00:00:25.920> two<00:00:26.189> well<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.390> problem<00:00:27.539> is

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
and number two well and the problem is

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.540 
and number two well and the problem is
that<00:00:27.810> tends<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.710> limit<00:00:28.859> their<00:00:29.070> numbers<00:00:29.369> and

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
that tends to limit their numbers and

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.550 
that tends to limit their numbers and
their<00:00:29.640> touches<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.260> you<00:00:31.260> know<00:00:31.320> they<00:00:31.439> get

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
their touches and you know they get

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.870 
their touches and you know they get
taken<00:00:31.740> out<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.040> game<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.369> time<00:00:32.550> but<00:00:32.790> it

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
taken out of the game the time but it

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.459 
taken out of the game the time but it
also<00:00:33.030> opens<00:00:33.180> up<00:00:33.510> other<00:00:33.719> things<00:00:33.960> like<00:00:34.320> the

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
also opens up other things like the

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.500 
also opens up other things like the
running<00:00:34.710> game<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:35.550> did<00:00:35.760> have<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:35.969> couple<00:00:36.180> shots

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
running game you did have a couple shots

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.330 
running game you did have a couple shots
of<00:00:36.690> vertical<00:00:37.079> passes<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> couple<00:00:37.890> drops<00:00:38.070> from

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
of vertical passes a couple drops from

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.119 
of vertical passes a couple drops from
unlikely<00:00:39.149> sources<00:00:39.360> in<00:00:39.989> Robert<00:00:40.500> Marquis<00:00:40.920> but

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
unlikely sources in Robert Marquis but

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.310 
unlikely sources in Robert Marquis but
does<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.690> harden<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> little<00:00:43.050> bit<00:00:43.170> that

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
does that harden you a little bit that

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.529 
does that harden you a little bit that
there<00:00:43.469> are<00:00:43.620> chances<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.280> take<00:00:44.460> shots<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.030> open

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
there are chances to take shots and open

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.299 
there are chances to take shots and open
up<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.660> game<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.899> little<00:00:46.079> bit<00:00:46.200> yeah<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.860> think<00:00:47.039> if

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
up the game a little bit yeah I think if

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.740 
up the game a little bit yeah I think if
you're<00:00:47.670> going<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.820> play<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.210> style<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.629> we

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
you're going to play in a style that we

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.770 
you're going to play in a style that we
played<00:00:48.989> Saturday<00:00:49.500> which<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.219> run<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.460> ball

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
his I don't know that I thought

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.000 
his I don't know that I thought
Marquis's<00:01:06.659> was<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> drop<00:01:07.080> at<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.320> time<00:01:07.530> when

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
Marquis's was a drop at the time when

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.469 
Marquis's was a drop at the time when
you<00:01:08.189> really<00:01:08.430> look<00:01:08.610> at<00:01:08.729> it's<00:01:08.880> an<00:01:09.000> awkward<00:01:09.240> angle

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
you really look at it's an awkward angle

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.740 
you really look at it's an awkward angle
that<00:01:09.750> he<00:01:09.810> comes<00:01:10.080> out<00:01:10.260> at<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:11.420> kind<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.479> made<00:01:12.630> it

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
that he comes out at and kind of made it

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.990 
that he comes out at and kind of made it
real<00:01:13.020> difficult<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.650> catch<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.100> ball<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.700> so

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
real difficult to catch that ball and so

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.370 
real difficult to catch that ball and so
it<00:01:15.390> was<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.509> really<00:01:15.659> good<00:01:15.869> throw<00:01:16.049> by<00:01:16.200> Matt

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
it was a really good throw by Matt

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.380 
it was a really good throw by Matt
Marquis's<00:01:16.920> angle<00:01:17.250> was<00:01:17.340> off<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> little<00:01:17.700> bit<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
Marquis's angle was off a little bit the
