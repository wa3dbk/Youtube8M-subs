00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 hello guys welcome to the second back 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.599
 to fail of the day for fun 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.240
 this time you would take me lose 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:17.000
 then the zen tuesday dax always 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.380
 of the tgx axis just see these 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.750
 without Berzaghi but only three in the game 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.619
 depends on the occasion or sometimes game 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.960
 those white little linear non seer 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.550
 cult as seen from the hill warning 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.349
 also specified in the last video the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.000
 four fun at least some of my friends don't 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.610
 we play these powerful that 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.350
 goal but we prefer to have some fun 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.870
 more 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:44.460
 turn agreed 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:51.360
 then we begin to point then we find 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:53.160
 a 36 dragons jeans 36 one of which 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.579
 the appearance for more than four months from 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:02.160
 hendry 997 a swindler not traded 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:11.479
 with 23 to toto a bari and dal dragon server 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:14.700
 team and 3 naga a phoenix 2 armored 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:20.360
 really powerful crews 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.470
 protect ten crews with two lights 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.960
 I don't know what to say this captures the most 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.470
 immense in the guard deck monsters ti 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.240
 It allows materials to act as a monster 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.869
 extra fusion avoids you 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.180
 polymerization so I will be powerful 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.369
 bond of being very famous I love you for 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.159
 then moved by the double attack 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.610
 pollution becomes a 5600 that attacks 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.640
 twice to chat and the end though you 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.530
 inflicts end of turn 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.930
 the digital attack of the monster therefore if 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.380
 let's vote for an ever-growing twin 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.630
 only inflicts his attack in 2008 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.409
 maemo estimate of 5000 francs attack de 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.479
 Mountain 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.299
 so if we do it with peppe drago 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.729
 final however we have an 8000 ma 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.620
 the attack we live the final attack and not 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.740
 we lose nothing 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:14.330
 the most beautiful magic card of March is 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:17.490
 really the evolutionary spouse 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.540
 3 polymerization this time those 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.340
 common 2 disappointment 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.790
 we all know their effect serves us in the 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.280
 ass doing disappointment or 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:33.090
 we attack disappointment I think we can 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.740
 also to attack or if we want 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.130
 do some other fusion we do 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.670
 disappointment later we have some other then 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.590
 without a load and limit removals 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.290
 this card 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.720
 fortunately limited to stable that 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.760
 they are two revealing swords 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:58.920
 Beijing let me try poker activated 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:02.490
 two typhoons reborn v.le meal trap 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:06.780
 very small compost from a merged mirror 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:10.080
 it's a vital push attack not the ship 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:19.380
 after a lot of book a little space and 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:22.050
 of lexan dead and precisely composed of a 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.959
 dragon, who will be played too 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:33.560
 lots and lots of decks so you know the 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:36.180
 its effect 2 supreme dragon who deserves 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.430
 attacks as many times as yours 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:45.150
 we use to melt it then 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:47.930
 simply of 800 for each show that 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:52.170
 use how to be precise 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:55.650
 so I will have power on twins a 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:58.709
 2008 which touches twice evoked with 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.810
 power bond sometimes does not seem to me 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.900
 really worth paying 2008 for a 5,000 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.770
 you know they really attack once and 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.980
 half 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:13.390
 more powerful more beautiful than the mister deck 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:19.690
 beautiful final dragon very similar to the 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:21.790
 final dragon of kariba a 4.000 inflicts 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.390
 giving also shows off in defense 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:27.250
 therefore it will become very strong evoked 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.660
 with the constraint of being able to have 8,000 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:33.730
 that even if you have a river o in defense 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.350
 anyway he throws you down he kept seven thousand 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.830
 so unless I took you off 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.240
 not even a year ago what even more 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.560
 because I don't know if I do one of a thousand 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:47.200
 direct nothing this lens to fail of 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.360
 tom cruise race for dragon for fun al 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.530
 therefore one hundred percent cannot 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.360
 comments play this card played with 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.510
 because in any case you are power 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.680
 specified not the young I hope there is 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.720
 liked 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.080
 see you next video with some 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.510
 de de pink the big or some other 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.930
 farfan for udas would change everything 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.930
 Hello
