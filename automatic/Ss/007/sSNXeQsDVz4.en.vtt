00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.430 
planning for the clear dream matches
there's<00:00:14.759> an<00:00:14.849> all<00:00:14.940> year<00:00:15.210> round<00:00:15.269> thing<00:00:15.750> it's

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
there's an all year round thing it's

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.510 
there's an all year round thing it's
never<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.740> point<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:17.130> when<00:00:17.250> we're<00:00:17.400> not

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
never a point that when we're not

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.070 
never a point that when we're not
thinking<00:00:17.730> about<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.150> game<00:00:18.180> next<00:00:18.570> year<00:00:18.720> or<00:00:18.960> the

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
thinking about the game next year or the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.050 
thinking about the game next year or the
year<00:00:19.109> after<00:00:19.260> we<00:00:20.130> had<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.340> make<00:00:20.490> sure<00:00:20.520> trainings

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
year after we had to make sure trainings

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.420 
year after we had to make sure trainings
good<00:00:21.300> it's<00:00:21.779> about<00:00:21.900> maximizing<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.859> on<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.250> day

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
good it's about maximizing it on the day

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.150 
good it's about maximizing it on the day
and<00:00:23.670> making<00:00:24.180> sure<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.570> we<00:00:25.019> use<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.800> get

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
and making sure that we use that to get

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.040 
and making sure that we use that to get
the<00:00:26.220> result<00:00:26.580> I<00:00:26.849> think<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.449> have<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.869> lose

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
the result I think you have to lose

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.620 
the result I think you have to lose
though<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.650> learn<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.949> win<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.340> think<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.300> thing

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
though to learn to win I think I thing

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.450 
though to learn to win I think I thing
else<00:00:30.779> was<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.380> my<00:00:31.500> advantage<00:00:31.529> last<00:00:32.219> year<00:00:32.430> I

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
else was to my advantage last year I

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.979 
else was to my advantage last year I
lost<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.880> first<00:00:33.090> year<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.570> learned<00:00:33.780> from<00:00:33.840> my

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
lost the first year so I learned from my

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.840 
lost the first year so I learned from my
mistakes<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:34.680> last<00:00:34.950> year's<00:00:35.190> preparation<00:00:35.700> was

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
mistakes and last year's preparation was

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.549 
mistakes and last year's preparation was
so<00:00:36.000> much<00:00:36.149> better<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.780> think<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.230> result

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
so much better and I think the result

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:45.170 
so much better and I think the result
proof<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:42.530> he<00:00:43.530> scored<00:00:43.860> two<00:00:44.250> goals<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
proof that he scored two goals in the
