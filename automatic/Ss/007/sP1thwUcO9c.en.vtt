you<00:00:18.750> see<00:00:19.080> how<00:00:19.350> it<00:00:19.500> works<00:00:20.900> from<00:00:21.900> behind<00:00:23.300> let's

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
you see how it works from behind let's

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.880 
you see how it works from behind let's
start<00:00:24.660> over<00:00:24.810> here<00:00:24.930> at<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.130> MacBook<00:00:26.519> Pro<00:00:27.890> where

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
start over here at the MacBook Pro where

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.530 
start over here at the MacBook Pro where
we<00:00:29.070> have<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.779> Thunderbolt<00:00:30.779> cable<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:32.540> power

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
we have a Thunderbolt cable and power

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.690 
we have a Thunderbolt cable and power
cable<00:00:35.120> both<00:00:36.120> running<00:00:36.480> into<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.780> first

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
cable both running into the first

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.530 
cable both running into the first
display<00:00:39.680> one<00:00:40.680> cord<00:00:40.980> powers<00:00:41.489> display<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
display one cord powers display and the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.869 
display one cord powers display and the
monitor<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.050> second<00:00:43.379> chord<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.190> cord

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
monitor the second chord is the cord

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.549 
monitor the second chord is the cord
running<00:00:45.800> to<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.280> MacBook<00:00:47.840> that<00:00:48.840> charges<00:00:49.410> it

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
running to the MacBook that charges it

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.720 
running to the MacBook that charges it
and<00:00:49.760> powers<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.879> display<00:00:51.410> from<00:00:52.410> there

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
and powers the display from there

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.889 
and powers the display from there
there's<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.850> single<00:00:54.149> Thunderbolt<00:00:54.570> cable

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
there's a single Thunderbolt cable

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.490 
there's a single Thunderbolt cable
plugged<00:00:55.829> in<00:00:56.420> that<00:00:57.420> tix<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.989> display<00:00:58.289> number

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
plugged in that tix is to display number

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.330 
plugged in that tix is to display number
two<00:00:59.239> so<00:01:00.239> as<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.510> can<00:01:00.629> see<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.890> here's<00:01:02.129> the

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
two so as you can see and here's the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.109 
two so as you can see and here's the
useless<00:01:03.589> second<00:01:04.589> power<00:01:05.040> adapter<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.670> wish<00:01:05.909> this

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
useless second power adapter I wish this

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.310 
useless second power adapter I wish this
came<00:01:06.570> off<00:01:06.720> somehow

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
came off somehow

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.820 
came off somehow
so<00:01:08.220> just<00:01:08.430> hanging<00:01:08.729> there<00:01:09.380> maybe<00:01:10.380> I'll<00:01:10.560> find<00:01:10.770> a

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
so just hanging there maybe I'll find a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.789 
so just hanging there maybe I'll find a
better<00:01:10.979> solution<00:01:11.189> for<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:12.439> once<00:01:13.439> we're

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
better solution for that once we're

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.390 
better solution for that once we're
going<00:01:14.700> but<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> meantime<00:01:16.250> tuck<00:01:17.250> that

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
going but in the meantime tuck that

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.620 
going but in the meantime tuck that
under<00:01:17.729> where<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.270> can't<00:01:18.570> be<00:01:18.630> seen<00:01:20.479> there<00:01:21.479> we

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
under where it can't be seen there we

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.450 
under where it can't be seen there we
have<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.869> second<00:01:23.180> pull<00:01:24.180> back<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.420> little<00:01:24.570> bit

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
have the second pull back a little bit

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.399 
have the second pull back a little bit
and<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:26.820> see<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.090> back

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:38.520 

of<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.590> setup

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.260 

I<00:01:38.560> probably<00:01:39.220> need<00:01:39.430> to<00:01:39.490> clean<00:01:39.670> up<00:01:39.700> the<00:01:39.880> wires<00:01:40.090> a

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
I probably need to clean up the wires a

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.050 
I probably need to clean up the wires a
bit<00:01:40.540> but<00:01:40.900> I<00:01:41.370> was<00:01:42.370> a<00:01:42.400> little<00:01:42.580> too<00:01:42.670> anxious<00:01:42.850> to

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
bit but I was a little too anxious to

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:51.350 
bit but I was a little too anxious to
get<00:01:43.240> it<00:01:43.360> going<00:01:43.510> I<00:01:45.780> can<00:01:48.000> wake<00:01:49.000> up<00:01:49.030> from<00:01:49.330> sleep

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
get it going I can wake up from sleep

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.210 
get it going I can wake up from sleep
you<00:01:52.360> can<00:01:52.510> see<00:01:52.720> here<00:01:52.990> I<00:01:53.020> have<00:01:53.230> a<00:01:53.260> male<00:01:53.890> running

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
you can see here I have a male running

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.210 
you can see here I have a male running
full<00:01:54.580> screen<00:01:55.890> my<00:01:56.890> receipt<00:01:57.310> and<00:01:59.130> here<00:02:00.130> I'm

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
full screen my receipt and here I'm

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.020 
full screen my receipt and here I'm
working<00:02:00.340> with<00:02:00.810> Photoshop<00:02:01.810> I<00:02:02.760> can<00:02:03.760> find<00:02:03.940> my

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
working with Photoshop I can find my

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:12.480 
working with Photoshop I can find my
mouse<00:02:04.210> I<00:02:04.630> will<00:02:05.050> do<00:02:05.770> something<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:11.920> I<00:02:12.250> can

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
mouse I will do something so I can

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.590 
mouse I will do something so I can
actually<00:02:12.640> open<00:02:14.520> up<00:02:15.520> on<00:02:15.670> my<00:02:15.790> layer<00:02:16.000> palettes

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
actually open up on my layer palettes

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:23.010 
actually open up on my layer palettes
and<00:02:18.480> well<00:02:20.880> it's<00:02:21.880> a<00:02:21.910> bit<00:02:22.090> more<00:02:22.270> difficult<00:02:22.450> at

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
and well it's a bit more difficult at

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:31.890 
and well it's a bit more difficult at
the<00:02:23.140> moment

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.900 

there<00:02:32.500> we<00:02:32.650> go

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.940 

so<00:02:38.510> there<00:02:38.690> we<00:02:38.810> go<00:02:39.850> 15-inch<00:02:40.850> MacBook<00:02:41.830> Pro
