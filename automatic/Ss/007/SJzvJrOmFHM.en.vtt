disaster to me music is paddle sound and

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.590 
disaster to me music is paddle sound and
a<00:01:48.680> lot<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.710> people<00:01:49.860> think<00:01:50.310> music<00:01:50.820> music<00:01:51.390> is

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
a lot of people think music music is

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.670 
a lot of people think music music is
like<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.590> create<00:01:52.800> a<00:01:52.890> mood<00:01:53.190> or<00:01:53.520> creator<00:01:54.680> as

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
like to create a mood or creator as

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.950

always<00:01:56.550> like<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.759> background<00:01:57.300> and<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.690> think

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
always like a background and I think

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.670 
always like a background and I think
sometimes<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.710> music<00:01:58.860> can<00:01:59.990> can<00:02:00.990> be<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.380> front

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
sometimes the music can can be the front

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.940 
sometimes the music can can be the front
and<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:02.310> image<00:02:02.970> can<00:02:03.570> be<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.840> back<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.530> can

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
and the image can be the back it can

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:14.940 
and the image can be the back it can
play<00:02:05.250> like<00:02:05.970> that

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.240 

the<00:02:15.950> music<00:02:16.310> should<00:02:16.430> dance<00:02:16.700> with<00:02:16.879> the<00:02:17.180> image

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
the music should dance with the image

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.520 
the music should dance with the image
if<00:02:19.790> you<00:02:19.940> lose<00:02:20.210> them<00:02:21.250> just<00:02:22.250> keep<00:02:22.490> moving<00:02:23.530> hope

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
if you lose them just keep moving hope

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:32.890 
if you lose them just keep moving hope
for<00:02:24.710> the<00:02:24.770> best<00:02:25.040> I<00:02:30.430> think<00:02:31.430> just<00:02:32.330> running<00:02:32.720> back

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
for the best I think just running back

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.340 
for the best I think just running back
its<00:02:33.110> gonna<00:02:33.230> dull<00:02:33.560> you<00:02:34.070> can<00:02:34.280> get<00:02:34.430> round<00:02:34.670> bagging

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
its gonna dull you can get round bagging

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.780 
its gonna dull you can get round bagging
speed<00:02:36.580> that's<00:02:37.580> a<00:02:37.730> better<00:02:37.940> shot<00:02:39.160> after<00:02:40.160> doing

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
speed that's a better shot after doing

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.110 
speed that's a better shot after doing
Crouching<00:02:41.330> Tiger<00:02:41.360> I<00:02:41.690> just<00:02:41.930> fall<00:02:42.140> in<00:02:42.290> love<00:02:42.470> with

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
Crouching Tiger I just fall in love with

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.840 
Crouching Tiger I just fall in love with
the<00:02:44.120> choreography<00:02:44.920> each<00:02:45.920> every<00:02:46.400> car<00:02:46.670> is

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
the choreography each every car is

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.370 
the choreography each every car is
trying<00:02:47.330> their<00:02:48.230> best<00:02:48.260> to<00:02:48.890> do<00:02:49.130> their<00:02:49.310> jobs<00:02:49.640> and

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
trying their best to do their jobs and

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.890 
trying their best to do their jobs and
when<00:02:51.380> you<00:02:51.470> try<00:02:51.500> to<00:02:51.770> figure<00:02:52.070> out<00:02:52.570> what<00:02:53.570> must<00:02:53.810> be

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
when you try to figure out what must be

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.960 
when you try to figure out what must be
in<00:02:54.110> their<00:02:54.260> mind<00:02:54.560> what's<00:02:54.950> the<00:02:55.100> reaction<00:02:55.459> to

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
in their mind what's the reaction to

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.000 
in their mind what's the reaction to
what<00:02:56.239> then<00:02:56.630> choreographed<00:02:57.380> a<00:02:57.500> number<00:02:57.830> from

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
what then choreographed a number from

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.550 
what then choreographed a number from
there<00:02:58.370> and<00:02:58.610> i<00:02:59.300> think<00:02:59.630> the<00:02:59.930> number<00:02:59.959> could<00:03:00.440> look

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
there and i think the number could look

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:10.229 
there and i think the number could look
very<00:03:00.770> interesting<00:03:01.370> very<00:03:01.520> intriguing

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.699 

three<00:03:11.239> two<00:03:12.200> one<00:03:12.879> back<00:03:14.170> one<00:03:15.170> thing<00:03:15.409> I<00:03:15.530> learned

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
three two one back one thing I learned

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.949 
three two one back one thing I learned
from<00:03:15.890> the<00:03:16.250> previous<00:03:16.400> movies<00:03:17.060> is<00:03:17.359> that<00:03:17.599> it<00:03:17.810> you

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
from the previous movies is that it you

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.380 
from the previous movies is that it you
don't<00:03:18.109> want<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:18.319> leave<00:03:18.500> out<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:19.670> actors<00:03:20.150> face

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
don't want to leave out the actors face

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.690 
don't want to leave out the actors face
for<00:03:20.689> too<00:03:20.900> long<00:03:21.140> in<00:03:21.349> their<00:03:21.469> action<00:03:21.859> sequence<00:03:22.370> I

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
for too long in their action sequence I

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.970 
for too long in their action sequence I
think<00:03:23.540> it's<00:03:23.629> a<00:03:23.689> great<00:03:23.719> thing<00:03:24.200> we<00:03:24.469> bring<00:03:24.859> the

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
think it's a great thing we bring the

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.580 
think it's a great thing we bring the
audience<00:03:25.129> along<00:03:25.870> with<00:03:26.870> their<00:03:27.019> characters

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
audience along with their characters

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.380
