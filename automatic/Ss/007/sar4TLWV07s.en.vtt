but<00:01:59.990> now<00:02:00.229> we<00:02:00.830> have<00:02:00.860> run<00:02:01.310> into<00:02:01.340> the<00:02:01.820> limitations

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
but now we have run into the limitations

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.090 
but now we have run into the limitations
of<00:02:02.810> that<00:02:03.020> model<00:02:04.569> what<00:02:05.569> is<00:02:05.720> needed<00:02:05.990> now<00:02:06.410> is<00:02:06.440> the

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
of that model what is needed now is the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.070 
of that model what is needed now is the
recognition<00:02:07.700> that<00:02:08.090> life<00:02:08.330> on<00:02:08.569> earth<00:02:08.780> is<00:02:09.050> a

courses in this university who come to

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.410 
courses in this university who come to
understand<00:03:54.450> how<00:03:55.440> is<00:03:55.800> it<00:03:56.070> that<00:03:56.280> we<00:03:56.790> were<00:03:57.090> born

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
understand how is it that we were born

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.290 
understand how is it that we were born
into<00:03:57.960> this<00:03:58.110> cosmos<00:03:58.650> how<00:03:59.490> is<00:03:59.760> our<00:04:00.000> word

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
into this cosmos how is our word

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.590 
into this cosmos how is our word
developed<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.440> way<00:04:01.620> it<00:04:01.800> has<00:04:02.070> developed<00:04:02.700> this

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
developed the way it has developed this

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.750 
developed the way it has developed this
is<00:04:03.840> important<00:04:04.350> to<00:04:04.440> understand<00:04:04.890> because<00:04:05.100> then

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
is important to understand because then

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.810 
is important to understand because then
you<00:04:05.910> will<00:04:05.970> go<00:04:06.150> on<00:04:06.300> and<00:04:06.540> try<00:04:07.200> to<00:04:07.320> find<00:04:07.770> out<00:04:07.950> what

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
you will go on and try to find out what

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.330 
you will go on and try to find out what
is<00:04:09.090> wrong<00:04:09.330> about<00:04:09.780> this<00:04:09.960> world<00:04:10.230> what<00:04:10.890> is<00:04:11.100> right

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
is wrong about this world what is right

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.670 
is wrong about this world what is right
about<00:04:11.760> this<00:04:11.970> world<00:04:12.270> and<00:04:12.540> how<00:04:13.200> we<00:04:13.260> could<00:04:13.530> build

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
about this world and how we could build

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.550 
about this world and how we could build
a<00:04:13.860> better<00:04:14.040> world<00:04:14.720> so<00:04:15.720> join<00:04:15.960> us<00:04:16.200> on<00:04:16.440> this

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
a better world so join us on this

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.600 
a better world so join us on this
University<00:04:17.280> you<00:04:18.060> will<00:04:18.090> never<00:04:18.390> regret
