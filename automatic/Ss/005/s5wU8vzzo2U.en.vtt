00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.130
 welcome to niklas 11 12 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.050
 Today I'm doing a whole 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.820
 special review and that'll be 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.000
 I have short reviews of three 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.010
 make products in a single video 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.960
 and no does not turn the video far 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.550
 you will vote one of a funny one 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.529
 get to hear in this video 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.689
 Speyer gave me these three products for 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:29.439
 providing that gives you bm 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:32.349
 800 condensed microphone an infrared 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.120
 Thermometer and a white LED strip 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.220
 Thanks a lot for allowing me to do that 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.390
 this test reports i start with the 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.370
 infrared thermometer 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.350
 this one feels very light 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.990
 Somehow weird and is priced 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.240
 pretty cheap this device needed 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.340
 a single 9 volt battery and this one 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.170
 is under this roof are 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.240
 do not worry it will be a battery 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.010
 Supplied with the temperature too 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.260
 Most you just press here and 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.510
 so to see the laser beam 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.860
 but does not look in the laser and 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.810
 Also, do not target other people 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.880
 so that it can thermometer 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.040
 Temperatures in Celsius and also in 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.280
 fahrenheit show the temperature 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.140
 scope goes from -50 up to plus 3 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.750
 180 degrees celsius 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.270
 but I also tested something and 4 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.670
 180 degrees can be reached easily 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.500
 An infrared thermometer can really work 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.150
 be useful and that particular 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.220
 models has no opinion in my opinion 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.659
 do it alone and thus I would 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.970
 definitely recommend 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.920
 Next, strip the LED one 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.440
 gets this on his role here 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.460
 I have the stripes are white 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.290
 well processed 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.720
 That is the control for the 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.729
 various led modes around the led 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.310
 to start operating a strip becomes a d 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.510
 12 volt power supply needed in my case 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.909
 I just use one for that 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.909
 computer power supply to connect this 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.070
 As you can see the LEDs are very nice 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.500
 bright and you get really great here 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.730
 even a couple of really fast ones 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.330
 I also measured the power consumption 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.920
 and that is between 25 and 27 watts 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.170
 for the whole role there would actually be 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.420
 nothing where I could complain thus 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.170
 i would definitely strip this led 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.520
 recommend 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.160
 you can use it for your computer 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.270
 use for his car or for too 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.580
 the house decoration 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.450
 but now you come to the last products 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.020
 microphone 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.910
 That's the jubilee of 800 convents 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.740
 Microphone this micro can for 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.110
 studio recordings are used 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.880
 It is available in different colors 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.360
 I obviously have the blue fusion 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.520
 to get 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.620
 The microphone housing is completely made 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.260
 made of metal and there is no one here 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.090
 preamp as on other bm 800 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.280
 models with a preamplifier 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.500
 are equipped in the form of one 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.980
 double battery this is not the one 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.840
 case 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.790
 Of course you also get this one 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.950
 professional micro holder of 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.200
 is really good and there is also the 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.390
 foam the windy pronunciation 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.190
 should reduce the micro power from 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.880
 window power connection use but 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.650
 ends with a 35mm connection on the 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.540
 Unfortunately, I do not have the other side 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.820
 before amplified version of this micro 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.709
 received because I have no amplifier 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.830
 So I just have the micro 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.750
 my carmen 600d dslr connected and 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.090
 had it there but they came 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.459
 600 d really produces a lot 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.900
 so just ignore it rushing 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.390
 is the camera that this noise 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.370
 does not produce the micro with one 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.050
 Ordinary amplifier should do it all 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.360
 have and thank you you want now 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.190
 a test of the micro of hers or me 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.110
 I tried to sing something because that 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.120
 like a radio slash the sans 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.310
 microphone looks like I can but unfortunately 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.840
 Do not sing at all, but still for you 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.820
 therefore, it becomes even funnier 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.130
 you will certainly laugh me out 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.380
 but what's the first piece of 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.660
 manowar is king of kings and then left 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.620
 the MÃ¼nster family ghost where I am very 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.690
 Abel for sage 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.520
 usually I 'm a little better 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.640
 my voice was not in good shape 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.450
 form and it is, so to speak, gracefully without 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.050
 heat up 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.050
 have fun 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:12.909
 Bring august to the cinema 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:20.180
 the childrens run 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:41.409
 detmold 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.409
 apple is 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.140
 Euro 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:32.630
 So yes the singing was disgusting 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.750
 but the micro sounds really clear 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.520
 I can made the cheers 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.290
 definitely recommend condensation if 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.840
 a decent amplifier for it 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.730
 has again then I can at for that 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.680
 provide these products and thus 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.450
 This is what these test reports allow 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.170
 thanks for watching do not forget 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:52.670
 subscribe and visited from sex.com and 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.760
 There are videos of wood on youtube too 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.760
 see
