00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:16.400
 This is the first in the world and 1 mole in Ukraine 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:19.160
 oled-tv ukraine really 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.340
 the second country in the world where he came to 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.520
 it would not be in Ukraine 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.200
 goals yes and so churning he was crimson 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.980
 here specifically so that we can 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.900
 present to our customers in advance 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:50.230
 even before the night of the official 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:52.890
 selling for 1 thickness of its hull what 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.540
 same many maiden one only 4 millimeters 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.220
 that is, such a thin device, I do not 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.140
 I speak now even at TVs not 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.480
 talking about mobile phones tablets 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.750
 secretaries and such thin devices 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.790
 just doesn't exist 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.310
 besides this incarnation on this TV 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.770
 concept design and blue screen this 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.170
 means the tv has no external 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.619
 the framework is absolutely why he and so here 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.210
 full monolith over his very 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.690
 interesting and non-standard form 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.640
 stand this stand is made of 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.740
 transparent material so when 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.170
 the TV is in blackout 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.819
 indoors as now for example yes that 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.310
 it seems that he seems to be 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:35.200
 hovers a lot of air let coasters not 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.560
 visible and it creates an extra 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.360
 Effect 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:43.179
 matrix response time has been reduced to 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.910
 0.02 seconds that basically 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:47.560
 same matrix response time have 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.929
 only plasma tvs in effect 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.929
 features of this technology by engineers 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:56.170
 the company has already added 4 white 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:02:00.310
 pixel why it was done deal 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.679
 that technology go away despite everything 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.170
 very big advantages was 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.840
 also having like some disadvantages 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.729
 technological and to avoid it 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.480
 make the contrast better 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:16.150
 and brightness is better than bright pictures and 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.280
 actually increase it as its quality 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.510
 4 white pixel was added which 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.620
 it slightly increase the contrast 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.319
 technology about jeff weiner 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.170
 allows you to turn off each backlight 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.180
 each individual pixel so even 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.590
 that's when the lights are on and the TV is not 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.600
 It works, it is clear that 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.670
 more precisely, it works show dark 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.250
 the picture is the picture on the screen even 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.290
 darker than its frame that indicates that 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.450
 it's really real black 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.050
 this tv of course 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.620
 maximum viewing angles which is 178 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.489
 degrees 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.810
 this is due to the peculiarities of production 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.720
 panel production technology 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.910
 the fact is that here are absolutely all layers 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.709
 this tv they are made 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.250
 at the same time that is not present any 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:06.050
 separate sections of the whole TV throughout 2 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.290
 component is made on exactly 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.630
 therefore it is only 4 meters thick 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.940
 and notice this thickness is 1 i 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.670
 throughout the body 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.800
 if you look at the TV from behind, then he 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.950
 also looks quite moaned candidates 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:25.850
 other models and universities cover the sun 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:28.579
 on the floor seamless technology and when 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.260
 production and cover using the same 

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:32.840
 materials are ax and are used when 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.390
 aircraft manufacturing and supercar 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.000
 there is it super durable and super light 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.590
 materials 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.340
 the weight of this TV is only 10 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.150
 kilogram 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.690
 in view of the fact that they have seen the full one 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.110
 thin 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.790
 either of certain features we 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.760
 we will offer the market a few 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.410
 mounting options unfortunately from 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.480
 or on and for the fact that the TV is 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.150
 thin and maybe initially 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.160
 look at all the rows of fixings that is and 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.220
 wall and floor and table 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.780
 so we will offer 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.180
 slightly different models then his model 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.370
 TV it will remain the same but in 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.019
 the kit may include its standard 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.660
 table stand as you can 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.579
 see here either stand up or 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.739
 floor stand that can 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.000
 adjust the height of the panel either 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.460
 wall mount 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.889
 due to the thickness of the screen and on 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.630
 attack body thickness TV except 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:29.150
 Matrix son nothing can ours 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.930
 put therefore the whole will tell how 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.970
 why the brain in the stand 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.250
 so the model that will be 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.539
 sold with ultrathin true 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.150
 now you really will be very 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:44.210
 Thin she did me still complete with 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.370
 special that will be needed 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.500
 to plug 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:51.000
 there is a TV and everything and really 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.000
 hanging very close to the wall
