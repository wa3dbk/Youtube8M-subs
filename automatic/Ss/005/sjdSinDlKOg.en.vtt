00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.130
 good day from my 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:15.930
 sky acura weight today tell more about 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.350
 one way to make the final layer 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.350
 ground 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.490
 there is another final option 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:27.600
 acrylic canvas primer 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:32.960
 that is , we have the exact same three 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:34.140
 times taped gelatin and 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.950
 final 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:43.040
 two layers of soil conditional soil we 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:46.830
 We will not do a mixture of glue and water course 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:52.650
 regular acrylic acrylic 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:59.250
 we will give rubbed the mixture with water then 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:01:06.660
 There are such milk in a thin layer of acrylic 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:11.220
 quite firmly gives such a layer and that 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:12.979
 most need for us he does not pull and pulls 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.020
 moisture in itself 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.020
 can we dilute it with a little water 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:30.110
 It turned out this kind of shops and 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.110
 sour cream liquid consistency 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.240
 and two times the same one will go 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.770
 thin layer 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.770
 our canvas taped 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.810
 by and large this layer will protect on 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:18.240
 gelatin from some kind of mechanical 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:21.180
 impacts and in general tint on 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.860
 the canvas so that it can be 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.140
 make some kind of translucent 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:31.170
 under the roof 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:33.440
 some effects and to them also has 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.770
 large covering power ie 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:41.540
 Like quite a bit of paint so straight 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:46.560
 very much it does not stay with it and 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:50.780
 Get enough sleep it is also lighter than it perhaps 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.780
 one of the fastest ways such 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.660
 the canvases are primed so simple 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:03.239
 in a way 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:06.450
 I have left with the students and nothing 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:10.620
 no fungus happened to them 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:13.549
 overpowered the colors darkened nothing especially 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.549
 happened 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:33.680
 immediately got enough white layer 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:36.790
 so when it dries with us 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.790
 such a thing will turn out 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.019
 such a nice uniform white color 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.690
 well stretched and most importantly he doesn't 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:58.930
 takes a color he does not pull from the paint 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.930
 binders that is why paint dries 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:06.739
 fall off yes that is on them 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:10.329
 cracks they just come along with 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.329
 primed oboe falls off 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:19.519
 so it looks final here 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:23.260
 actually this way is enough 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.260
 fast we get 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:34.590
 canvas painting hope this video 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:36.680
 it was helpful to someone thanks for watching up 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.680
