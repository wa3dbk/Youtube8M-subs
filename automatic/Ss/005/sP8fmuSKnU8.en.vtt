00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.270
 blog readers yoga we have spring in 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.599
 in full swing 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.990
 my wife and I began to ride bicycles 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.400
 it takes a lot of training at sea 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.910
 very energy 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:22.369
 need protein so I will cook today 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:26.310
 no ordinary lunch it would be such a protein 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:28.529
 vitamin lunch for syroeda which 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.570
 leads an active lifestyle and so 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.450
 let's start cooking dinner 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.510
 the main course in my dinner will be 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.950
 buckwheat porridge but not ordinary buckwheat 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:44.340
 buckwheat porridge with green buckwheat then 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.890
 eat raw buckwheat was tortured green 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.780
 buckwheat was tortured for a day 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.510
 there is such a look 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.620
 gluten but it does not need to be washed off 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.020
 in any case because it is gluten 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.770
 contains very useful substances 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:06.479
 and so this buckwheat I pour out in my 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:09.510
 grind add 1 clove of garlic and 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.600
 spoon of extra virgin olive oil 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.650

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.619

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:25.020

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.759
 taste of turmeric is a very useful spice this 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.799

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:37.710

 green buckwheat just soaked for the night 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.890

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.899
 the buckwheat you soak just 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.640
 usually there are practically no green h 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.340
 perhaps it is tasteless and 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.079
 It turns out tasteless and this paste is very 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.720
 it turned out tasty to me now 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:21.939

 vegetable oil usual i will add 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:51.519
 coconut oil, cold pressed it does not 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.980
 liquid but it turns liquid when 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.659

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.879
 when you touch your hands on at this 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:59.920

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:11.019
 tasty and healthy 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.829
