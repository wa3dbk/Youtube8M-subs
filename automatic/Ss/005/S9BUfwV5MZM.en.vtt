hey<00:00:01.869> everybody<00:00:02.260> it's<00:00:02.439> me<00:00:02.620> again<00:00:02.949> Pepe<00:00:03.639> with

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:03.850 
hey everybody it's me again Pepe with

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.530 
hey everybody it's me again Pepe with
Pepe's<00:00:04.480> plants<00:00:04.950> as<00:00:05.950> usual<00:00:06.939> I'm<00:00:07.060> using<00:00:07.270> a

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:07.540 
Pepe's plants as usual I'm using a

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.450 
Pepe's plants as usual I'm using a
camera<00:00:07.990> cell<00:00:08.230> phone<00:00:08.469> so<00:00:08.710> the<00:00:08.830> quality<00:00:09.040> of<00:00:09.309> the

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:09.460 
camera cell phone so the quality of the

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.450 
camera cell phone so the quality of the
video<00:00:09.820> may<00:00:10.059> not<00:00:10.090> be<00:00:10.240> all<00:00:10.509> that<00:00:10.540> but<00:00:11.019> I<00:00:11.460> think

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:12.460 
video may not be all that but I think

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.850 
video may not be all that but I think
it'll<00:00:12.580> get<00:00:12.790> the<00:00:12.880> message<00:00:13.179> across<00:00:13.769> what<00:00:14.769> I'm

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860 
it'll get the message across what I'm

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.160 
it'll get the message across what I'm
showing<00:00:15.040> you<00:00:15.219> here<00:00:15.460> is<00:00:15.639> a<00:00:15.960> miracle<00:00:16.960> fruit

fruit<00:00:25.630> plant<00:00:25.900> is<00:00:26.220> not<00:00:27.220> an<00:00:27.370> easy<00:00:27.550> thing<00:00:27.700> to

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:28.530 
fruit plant is not an easy thing to

fruit plant is not an easy thing to
propagate<00:00:31.500> propagating<00:00:32.500> plants<00:00:32.670> have

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
propagate propagating plants have

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.820 
propagate propagating plants have
different<00:00:34.180> levels<00:00:34.510> some<00:00:35.080> are<00:00:35.230> very<00:00:35.380> easy<00:00:35.620> to

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:35.830 
different levels some are very easy to

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.620 
different levels some are very easy to
propagate<00:00:36.010> you<00:00:36.820> just<00:00:37.060> literally<00:00:37.300> take<00:00:37.570> a

about<00:00:48.250> plants<00:00:48.880> and<00:00:49.060> plant<00:00:49.390> propagation<00:00:49.600> is

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
about plants and plant propagation is

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.450 
about plants and plant propagation is
understanding<00:00:50.710> what<00:00:50.829> they<00:00:51.010> need<00:00:51.040> and

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.450 
you're seeing right here are brand new
leaves<00:01:45.939> and<00:01:46.439> if<00:01:47.439> you<00:01:47.560> look<00:01:47.770> really<00:01:48.100> close

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
leaves and if you look really close

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.710 
leaves and if you look really close
you're<00:01:48.670> probably<00:01:48.850> not<00:01:49.030> going<00:01:49.150> to<00:01:49.210> be<00:01:49.330> able<00:01:49.479> to

you're probably not going to be able to
on<00:01:49.869> this<00:01:50.049> camera<00:01:50.799> but<00:01:51.130> there<00:01:51.790> are<00:01:51.880> some<00:01:52.030> very

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
on this camera but there are some very

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.670 
on this camera but there are some very
very<00:01:52.330> tiny<00:01:52.810> leaves<00:01:53.619> also<00:01:54.479> emerging<00:01:55.619> on<00:01:56.619> the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
very tiny leaves also emerging on the

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.870 
very tiny leaves also emerging on the
plant<00:01:57.570> you'll<00:01:58.570> notice<00:01:58.960> it's<00:01:59.680> very<00:01:59.710> small<00:02:00.340> leaf

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
plant you'll notice it's very small leaf

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.370 
plant you'll notice it's very small leaf
right<00:02:01.180> down<00:02:01.420> here<00:02:01.689> in<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:01.900> lower<00:02:02.080> right<00:02:02.350> hand

right down here in the lower right hand

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.070 
right down here in the lower right hand
corner<00:02:03.030> you'll<00:02:04.030> also<00:02:04.240> notice<00:02:04.600> some<00:02:04.869> leaves

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
corner you'll also notice some leaves

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.909 
corner you'll also notice some leaves
that<00:02:05.259> were<00:02:05.380> cut<00:02:05.680> and<00:02:06.930> that<00:02:07.930> is<00:02:08.109> part<00:02:08.349> of<00:02:08.529> the

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:08.919 
that were cut and that is part of the

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.190 
that were cut and that is part of the
process<00:02:09.340> of<00:02:09.759> propagating<00:02:10.450> these<00:02:10.569> plants<00:02:11.049> and

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
process of propagating these plants and

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.380 
process of propagating these plants and
other<00:02:11.799> plants<00:02:12.219> as<00:02:12.340> well

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
other plants as well

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.850 
other plants as well
and<00:02:13.480> there<00:02:13.780> is<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:13.950> certain<00:02:14.950> mix<00:02:15.160> that<00:02:15.430> we<00:02:15.550> use

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
and there is a certain mix that we use

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.320 
and there is a certain mix that we use
which<00:02:17.860> for<00:02:18.100> now<00:02:18.130> will<00:02:18.490> keep<00:02:18.940> that<00:02:19.150> to

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
which for now will keep that to

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.820 
which for now will keep that to
ourselves<00:02:19.360> but<00:02:19.990> eventually<00:02:20.500> we'll<00:02:20.650> share

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
ourselves but eventually we'll share

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.070 
ourselves but eventually we'll share
that<00:02:20.890> with<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:21.430> but<00:02:22.180> at<00:02:22.300> this<00:02:22.450> point<00:02:22.810> there

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
that with you but at this point there

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.290 
that with you but at this point there
are<00:02:23.230> three<00:02:23.830> other<00:02:24.040> important<00:02:24.670> things<00:02:25.090> that

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
are three other important things that

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.500 
are three other important things that
are<00:02:25.570> required<00:02:26.700> some<00:02:27.700> of<00:02:27.850> that<00:02:27.970> has<00:02:28.180> to<00:02:28.210> do<00:02:28.480> with

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
are required some of that has to do with

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.620 
are required some of that has to do with
when<00:02:29.500> to<00:02:29.710> take<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:30.040> cutting<00:02:30.280> what<00:02:31.090> type<00:02:31.390> of

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
when to take the cutting what type of

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.080 
when to take the cutting what type of
cutting<00:02:31.900> what<00:02:32.620> position<00:02:33.190> from<00:02:33.490> the<00:02:33.670> plant<00:02:33.940> you

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
cutting what position from the plant you

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.840 
cutting what position from the plant you
take<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.420> cutting<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.830> some<00:02:36.220> other<00:02:36.370> factors

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
take the cutting and some other factors

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.500 
take the cutting and some other factors
so<00:02:37.660> our<00:02:37.840> goal<00:02:38.080> is<00:02:38.350> to<00:02:38.580> develop<00:02:39.580> a<00:02:39.700> series<00:02:40.480> of

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
so our goal is to develop a series of

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.590 
so our goal is to develop a series of
videos<00:02:41.310> which<00:02:42.310> we<00:02:42.490> will<00:02:42.640> have<00:02:42.790> available<00:02:43.120> and

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
videos which we will have available and

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.800 
videos which we will have available and
these<00:02:44.410> videos<00:02:44.650> will<00:02:45.100> give<00:02:45.610> you<00:02:45.820> some

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
these videos will give you some

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.930 
these videos will give you some
highlights<00:02:47.020> and<00:02:47.530> some<00:02:47.830> really<00:02:48.250> really<00:02:48.640> good

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
highlights and some really really good

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.630 
highlights and some really really good
information<00:02:49.120> so<00:02:49.780> that<00:02:50.590> if<00:02:51.010> you<00:02:51.190> choose<00:02:51.459> to

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
information so that if you choose to

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.699 
information so that if you choose to
grow<00:02:51.850> your<00:02:52.750> own<00:02:54.930> miracle<00:02:55.930> fruit<00:02:56.110> plant<00:02:56.440> and

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
grow your own miracle fruit plant and

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.090 
grow your own miracle fruit plant and
you<00:02:57.220> tired<00:02:57.790> of<00:02:57.970> doing<00:02:58.239> it<00:02:58.330> from<00:02:58.480> seeds<00:02:58.780> and

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
you tired of doing it from seeds and

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.650 
you tired of doing it from seeds and
you'd<00:03:00.100> like<00:03:00.280> to<00:03:00.430> get<00:03:00.550> something<00:03:01.030> bigger<00:03:01.300> than

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
you'd like to get something bigger than

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.710 
you'd like to get something bigger than
a<00:03:02.010> little<00:03:03.010> seedling<00:03:03.580> that<00:03:03.610> takes<00:03:04.090> almost<00:03:04.390> a

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
a little seedling that takes almost a

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.390 
a little seedling that takes almost a
year<00:03:04.989> to<00:03:05.200> get<00:03:05.350> to<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.680> size<00:03:05.920> that<00:03:06.160> I'm<00:03:06.250> going

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
year to get to the size that I'm going

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.699 
year to get to the size that I'm going
to<00:03:06.430> walk<00:03:06.580> you<00:03:06.640> over<00:03:06.790> to<00:03:07.060> now<00:03:07.390> okay<00:03:08.350> again<00:03:08.560> this

is on May 10th and today's September 5th
of<00:03:12.070> 2012<00:03:13.030> so<00:03:13.750> we<00:03:14.380> know<00:03:14.500> we're<00:03:14.680> talking<00:03:15.510> we're

of 2012 so we know we're talking we're
talking<00:03:16.780> about<00:03:17.440> four<00:03:17.920> months<00:03:18.190> it<00:03:18.310> took<00:03:18.459> for

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
talking about four months it took for

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.690 
talking about four months it took for
this<00:03:18.790> to<00:03:19.000> to<00:03:19.720> actually<00:03:19.900> start<00:03:20.470> to<00:03:20.709> produce<00:03:20.920> now

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
this to to actually start to produce now

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.330 
this to to actually start to produce now
here's<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.600> fear<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:23.140> fear<00:03:23.170> is<00:03:23.650> that<00:03:23.980> it<00:03:24.160> may

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
here's the fear the fear is that it may

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.520 
here's the fear the fear is that it may
not<00:03:24.549> have<00:03:24.820> and<00:03:25.209> it<00:03:25.480> looks<00:03:25.690> like<00:03:25.780> it<00:03:26.019> still<00:03:26.290> may

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
not have and it looks like it still may

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.490 
not have and it looks like it still may
not<00:03:26.739> have<00:03:26.980> sufficient<00:03:27.670> roots<00:03:28.209> so<00:03:29.140> I'm<00:03:29.290> going

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
not have sufficient roots so I'm going

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.680 
not have sufficient roots so I'm going
to<00:03:29.530> not<00:03:29.709> mess<00:03:29.920> with<00:03:29.950> it<00:03:30.190> okay<00:03:30.670> I<00:03:30.850> am<00:03:31.120> NOT<00:03:31.360> going

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
to not mess with it okay I am NOT going

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.930 
to not mess with it okay I am NOT going
to<00:03:31.750> take<00:03:31.959> this<00:03:32.140> plant<00:03:32.500> and<00:03:32.739> try<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.430> tug<00:03:33.700> on<00:03:33.880> it

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
to take this plant and try to tug on it

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.699 
to take this plant and try to tug on it
I'm<00:03:34.209> going<00:03:34.330> to<00:03:34.390> leave<00:03:34.570> this<00:03:34.750> plant<00:03:35.019> alone<00:03:35.320> and

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
I'm going to leave this plant alone and

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.410 
I'm going to leave this plant alone and
it's<00:03:36.130> going<00:03:36.250> to<00:03:36.310> stay<00:03:36.549> there<00:03:36.730> maybe<00:03:36.970> I'm

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
it's going to stay there maybe I'm

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.780 
it's going to stay there maybe I'm
estimating<00:03:37.810> another<00:03:38.320> month<00:03:38.620> and<00:03:38.830> at<00:03:39.610> that

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
estimating another month and at that

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.150 
estimating another month and at that
point<00:03:40.090> I<00:03:40.360> will<00:03:40.660> check<00:03:40.900> it<00:03:41.049> and<00:03:41.170> see<00:03:41.230> if<00:03:41.680> in<00:03:41.980> fact

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
point I will check it and see if in fact

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.270 
point I will check it and see if in fact
it<00:03:42.400> has<00:03:42.580> a<00:03:43.200> nice<00:03:44.200> root<00:03:44.500> development<00:03:45.160> I<00:03:45.250> think

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
it has a nice root development I think

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.539 
it has a nice root development I think
it<00:03:45.640> will<00:03:45.840> develop<00:03:46.840> some<00:03:47.049> roots<00:03:47.230> because<00:03:47.620> once

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
it will develop some roots because once

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.670 
it will develop some roots because once
you<00:03:48.700> see<00:03:48.880> this<00:03:49.030> many<00:03:49.269> leaves<00:03:49.540> you<00:03:50.080> definitely

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
you see this many leaves you definitely

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.920 
you see this many leaves you definitely
have<00:03:50.830> some<00:03:51.070> support<00:03:51.430> structure<00:03:51.940> there<00:03:52.209> for

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
have some support structure there for

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.289 
have some support structure there for
the<00:03:53.110> plant<00:03:53.380> again<00:03:54.220> there's<00:03:54.459> a<00:03:54.519> special<00:03:55.000> trick

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
the plant again there's a special trick

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:56.789 
the plant again there's a special trick
to<00:03:55.450> this<00:03:55.600> this<00:03:55.810> is<00:03:56.049> not<00:03:56.260> easy

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
to this this is not easy

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.940 
to this this is not easy
okay<00:03:57.640> kids<00:03:57.910> so<00:03:58.150> just<00:03:59.019> kidding<00:03:59.290> guys<00:03:59.410> and<00:03:59.769> gals

okay kids so just kidding guys and gals

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.110 
okay kids so just kidding guys and gals
don't<00:04:00.640> try<00:04:00.820> this<00:04:00.880> at<00:04:01.060> home<00:04:01.209> until<00:04:02.110> I<00:04:03.060> try<00:04:04.060> it

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
don't try this at home until I try it

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.180 
don't try this at home until I try it
just<00:04:04.840> try<00:04:05.049> it<00:04:05.170> you<00:04:05.380> know<00:04:05.470> everything<00:04:05.709> is<00:04:05.950> try

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
just try it you know everything is try

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.580 
just try it you know everything is try
it<00:04:06.250> and<00:04:06.459> learn<00:04:06.700> from<00:04:06.970> your<00:04:07.120> experiences<00:04:07.870> you

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
it and learn from your experiences you

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.370 
it and learn from your experiences you
you<00:04:09.070> should<00:04:09.250> be<00:04:09.400> able<00:04:09.549> to<00:04:09.700> to<00:04:10.390> do<00:04:10.570> it

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
you should be able to to do it

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.560 
you should be able to to do it
but<00:04:11.709> again<00:04:11.980> it<00:04:12.190> requires<00:04:12.610> a<00:04:12.940> little<00:04:13.090> bit<00:04:13.269> more

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
but again it requires a little bit more

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.199 
but again it requires a little bit more
knowledge<00:04:13.989> than<00:04:14.170> the<00:04:14.290> average<00:04:14.590> person<00:04:15.010> has

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
knowledge than the average person has

sooner than this guy over here because

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:19.709 
sooner than this guy over here because
this<00:05:17.590> guy's<00:05:17.740> a<00:05:17.770> seedling<00:05:18.370> and<00:05:18.629> generally<00:05:19.629> they

00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:19.719 
this guy's a seedling and generally they

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:22.469 
this guy's a seedling and generally they
have<00:05:19.840> to<00:05:19.960> be<00:05:20.080> about<00:05:20.169> 18<00:05:20.650> maybe<00:05:21.310> 20<00:05:21.699> inches<00:05:22.000> tall

have to be about 18 maybe 20 inches tall

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:25.529 
have to be about 18 maybe 20 inches tall
before<00:05:22.750> they<00:05:23.050> produce<00:05:23.259> from<00:05:23.560> seedlings<00:05:24.539> which

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
before they produce from seedlings which

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:27.929 
before they produce from seedlings which
again<00:05:25.810> in<00:05:26.080> the<00:05:26.139> case<00:05:26.889> of<00:05:27.129> these<00:05:27.279> plants<00:05:27.759> could

00:05:27.929 --> 00:05:27.939 
again in the case of these plants could

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:29.999 
again in the case of these plants could
be<00:05:28.120> a<00:05:28.150> year<00:05:28.539> year<00:05:28.930> and<00:05:29.020> a<00:05:29.110> half<00:05:29.289> maybe<00:05:29.740> two

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:30.009 
be a year year and a half maybe two

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:34.619 
be a year year and a half maybe two
years<00:05:31.259> this<00:05:32.259> guy<00:05:32.500> will<00:05:32.979> be<00:05:33.099> producing<00:05:33.629> fruit

00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:34.629 
years this guy will be producing fruit

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:38.519 
years this guy will be producing fruit
probably<00:05:35.379> I<00:05:35.669> would<00:05:36.669> say<00:05:36.699> within<00:05:37.690> the<00:05:37.870> within

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:38.529 
probably I would say within the within

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:40.079 
probably I would say within the within
the<00:05:38.650> year<00:05:38.979> so<00:05:39.129> I<00:05:39.159> would<00:05:39.370> give<00:05:39.490> it<00:05:39.610> another<00:05:39.789> five

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:40.089 
the year so I would give it another five

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:42.019 
the year so I would give it another five
or<00:05:40.120> six<00:05:40.270> months<00:05:40.569> and<00:05:40.810> the<00:05:41.289> plant<00:05:41.529> will<00:05:41.710> produce

00:05:42.019 --> 00:05:42.029 
or six months and the plant will produce

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:44.610 
or six months and the plant will produce
