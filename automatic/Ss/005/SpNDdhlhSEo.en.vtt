00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:20.039
 There will not be anyone, for example, in 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:26.180
 accidentally move and this is the 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:26.180
 main option is very important to 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.840
 sometimes 15 people are very young 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:38.970
 Interactive for example this one right here 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:42.810
 it is an audience the amp and the break pass from 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:47.639
 music everything here has a graphic graphic 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:51.860

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:02.720
 disk space to place direct cd 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.720
 and so on and so forth 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.720
 I 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:15.900
 too good that I can speak 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:17.850
 the generally who will ride 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.440
 he prefers to start with these quique 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.139
 this big one in the middle 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.080
 people usually start with it 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:30.630
 So what happens and will open here by 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:35.940
 example he is the one here 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:38.280
 katia opens it he has it in another folder 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.220
 that, for example, these are 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.710
 clicking here one usually they the 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.270
 example guarantees this part that in 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.830
 all white band 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.510

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.150
 Are you going to see some pictures? 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.370
 with the white band we did not execute all 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.310
 to find out what it does not have not 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:06:04.160
 know how to install by one and up 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:07.880
 find out who else passes 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.320
 good folks about my theme 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.810

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:15.320
 I'm going to make a videotape and I'm going 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:19.370
 talk about it and other programs 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:22.690
 which uses for example the fugu lÃ©s show 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:25.930
 for you that leaves the invisible folder 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.930
 open here 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.009
 You see the folder that is invisible is 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.050
 so cool 

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:41.300

 a tip try could not opel too much with 

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:35.870
 very detail because it ends up taking the focus 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:38.090
 That's it. 

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:41.150
