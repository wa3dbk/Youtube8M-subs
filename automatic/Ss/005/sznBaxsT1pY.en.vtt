00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
chopper in here and just like the

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.950 
chopper in here and just like the
regular<00:03:23.060> siren<00:03:23.780> on<00:03:23.930> there<00:03:24.830> 12<00:03:25.070> volt<00:03:25.250> models

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
regular siren on there 12 volt models

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.760 
regular siren on there 12 volt models
the<00:03:26.960> chopper<00:03:27.380> is<00:03:27.680> plastic<00:03:28.340> just<00:03:28.580> like<00:03:29.770> that

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
the chopper is plastic just like that

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:38.140 
the chopper is plastic just like that
one<00:03:30.980> in<00:03:31.100> there<00:03:31.250> fit<00:03:32.150> focus<00:03:35.560> that's<00:03:36.560> partly<00:03:37.150> why

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
one in there fit focus that's partly why

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.800 
one in there fit focus that's partly why
it<00:03:39.160> does<00:03:40.160> not<00:03:40.340> have<00:03:40.640> much<00:03:40.670> of<00:03:40.970> a<00:03:41.180> wine<00:03:41.420> down<00:03:41.660> at

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
it does not have much of a wine down at

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.450 
it does not have much of a wine down at
all<00:03:41.930> it<00:03:42.260> has<00:03:42.860> no<00:03:43.160> momentum<00:03:43.370> to<00:03:43.910> it<00:03:45.280> then<00:03:46.280> we'll

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
all it has no momentum to it then we'll

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.890 
all it has no momentum to it then we'll
take<00:03:46.700> off<00:03:46.910> a<00:03:47.090> little<00:03:47.180> stand<00:03:47.600> here<00:03:48.610> all<00:03:49.610> right

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
take off a little stand here all right

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.150 
take off a little stand here all right
now<00:03:50.900> our<00:03:51.110> get<00:03:51.290> take<00:03:51.470> off<00:03:51.650> the<00:03:51.770> motor<00:03:51.980> cover<00:03:54.160> now

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
now our get take off the motor cover now

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:01.809 
now our get take off the motor cover now
I<00:03:55.220> can<00:03:55.460> open<00:03:55.550> it<00:03:55.910> and<00:03:56.120> open<00:03:56.780> the<00:03:56.960> motor<00:03:57.230> casing

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.800 

and<00:04:02.390> let's<00:04:02.900> see<00:04:04.180> there's<00:04:05.180> the<00:04:05.329> inside<00:04:05.629> of<00:04:05.750> the

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
and let's see there's the inside of the

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.740 
and let's see there's the inside of the
motor<00:04:05.959> it's<00:04:06.469> just<00:04:06.680> like<00:04:06.859> a<00:04:06.890> vacuum<00:04:07.129> motor<00:04:07.750> it's

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
motor it's just like a vacuum motor it's

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.410 
motor it's just like a vacuum motor it's
a<00:04:08.840> brush<00:04:09.079> mode<00:04:09.319> or<00:04:09.500> not<00:04:09.620> an<00:04:09.739> induction<00:04:10.069> um

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
a brush mode or not an induction um

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.319 
a brush mode or not an induction um
I<00:04:11.629> think<00:04:12.109> partly<00:04:12.349> why<00:04:12.500> is<00:04:12.560> it<00:04:13.010> winds<00:04:13.939> down<00:04:13.969> so

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
I think partly why is it winds down so

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:17.110 
I think partly why is it winds down so
fast<00:04:14.629> is<00:04:14.930> a<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:16.280> brushes<00:04:16.669> are<00:04:16.820> on<00:04:16.940> there

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
fast is a the brushes are on there

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.900 
fast is a the brushes are on there
really<00:04:17.299> really<00:04:17.479> tight<00:04:17.840> and<00:04:18.049> there's<00:04:18.169> a<00:04:18.229> little

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
really really tight and there's a little

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.370 
really really tight and there's a little
saying<00:04:19.910> right<00:04:20.269> in<00:04:20.449> there<00:04:20.690> which<00:04:21.019> is<00:04:21.049> kind<00:04:21.289> of

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
saying right in there which is kind of

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.900 
saying right in there which is kind of
like<00:04:21.470> a<00:04:21.560> little<00:04:21.859> spring<00:04:22.160> that's<00:04:22.310> pushing<00:04:22.729> down

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
like a little spring that's pushing down

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:23.430 
like a little spring that's pushing down
on<00:04:22.940> it

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
on it

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.620 
on it
and<00:04:24.440> it<00:04:24.949> makes<00:04:25.160> it<00:04:25.340> really<00:04:25.550> really<00:04:25.699> hard<00:04:26.180> to<00:04:26.479> UM

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
and it makes it really really hard to UM

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.020 
and it makes it really really hard to UM
spin<00:04:27.350> for<00:04:27.710> very<00:04:27.919> long<00:04:28.070> so<00:04:28.430> I<00:04:28.880> put<00:04:29.090> some<00:04:29.270> oil

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
spin for very long so I put some oil

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.960 
spin for very long so I put some oil
right<00:04:32.030> there<00:04:32.300> and<00:04:32.600> on<00:04:33.410> the<00:04:33.560> commutator<00:04:34.099> and

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
right there and on the commutator and

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.600 
right there and on the commutator and
then<00:04:35.539> I<00:04:35.630> put<00:04:35.840> some<00:04:35.870> I<00:04:36.229> try<00:04:36.500> to<00:04:36.560> get<00:04:36.740> some<00:04:36.949> on<00:04:37.160> the

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
then I put some I try to get some on the

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.850 
then I put some I try to get some on the
little<00:04:37.880> bearing<00:04:38.570> where<00:04:39.080> the<00:04:39.199> motor<00:04:39.349> shaft<00:04:39.590> is

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
little bearing where the motor shaft is

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.610 
little bearing where the motor shaft is
like<00:04:40.130> right<00:04:40.340> there<00:04:40.610> I<00:04:41.110> didn't<00:04:42.110> make<00:04:42.199> much<00:04:42.410> of<00:04:42.440> a

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
like right there I didn't make much of a

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.860 
like right there I didn't make much of a
difference<00:04:42.789> then<00:04:43.789> it<00:04:43.910> gets<00:04:44.090> very<00:04:44.330> very<00:04:44.419> hot

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
difference then it gets very very hot

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.439 
difference then it gets very very hot
just<00:04:45.199> just<00:04:45.590> ruing<00:04:45.919> that<00:04:46.130> it's<00:04:46.940> the<00:04:47.210> motor

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
just just ruing that it's the motor

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.290 
just just ruing that it's the motor
casing<00:04:47.870> is<00:04:47.990> really<00:04:48.169> warm<00:04:48.849> and<00:04:49.849> I<00:04:50.060> don't<00:04:50.120> know

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
casing is really warm and I don't know

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.089 
casing is really warm and I don't know
I'll<00:04:50.539> be<00:04:50.690> able<00:04:50.750> to<00:04:50.870> replace<00:04:51.139> that<00:04:51.199> just

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:52.099 
I'll be able to replace that just

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:53.920 
I'll be able to replace that just
probably<00:04:52.849> gonna<00:04:52.970> be<00:04:53.090> pretty<00:04:53.270> hard<00:04:53.389> to<00:04:53.509> find<00:04:53.720> a

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
probably gonna be pretty hard to find a

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.469 
probably gonna be pretty hard to find a
motor<00:04:54.199> casing<00:04:54.500> like<00:04:54.860> that<00:04:55.099> I<00:04:55.400> think<00:04:56.210> that's<00:04:56.300> I

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
motor casing like that I think that's I

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.070 
motor casing like that I think that's I
got<00:04:56.690> about<00:04:56.900> to<00:04:57.050> say<00:04:57.199> that<00:04:57.500> it's<00:04:57.770> it's<00:04:57.949> cute

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
got about to say that it's it's cute

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.830 
got about to say that it's it's cute
oops<00:05:00.080> I<00:05:00.460> have<00:05:01.460> to<00:05:01.610> cut<00:05:01.759> off<00:05:01.880> the<00:05:02.210> finger<00:05:02.479> guards

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
oops I have to cut off the finger guards

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.839 
oops I have to cut off the finger guards
in<00:05:02.990> the<00:05:03.310> intake<00:05:04.310> guard<00:05:05.530> so<00:05:06.530> yeah<00:05:06.919> thanks<00:05:07.820> for

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:07.849 
in the intake guard so yeah thanks for

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.279 
in the intake guard so yeah thanks for
