50 battery and it says that it's a 980
milliampere<00:02:56.860> battery<00:02:57.960> let's<00:02:58.960> look<00:02:59.200> at<00:02:59.350> the

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
milliampere battery let's look at the

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.430 
milliampere battery let's look at the
camcorder<00:02:59.860> now<00:03:00.480> actually<00:03:01.480> it's<00:03:01.600> very<00:03:02.080> light<00:03:02.410> I

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
camcorder now actually it's very light I

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.250 
camcorder now actually it's very light I
would<00:03:02.650> say<00:03:02.920> without<00:03:03.070> the<00:03:03.220> battery<00:03:03.660> so<00:03:04.660> this<00:03:05.110> is

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
would say without the battery so this is

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.560 
would say without the battery so this is
the<00:03:05.380> camcorder<00:03:05.830> it's<00:03:06.160> pretty<00:03:06.430> tiny<00:03:06.940> I<00:03:07.120> have<00:03:07.360> to

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
optical steadyshot on the top actually

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.560 
optical steadyshot on the top actually
we<00:04:16.810> just<00:04:16.840> have<00:04:17.310> so<00:04:18.310> it<00:04:18.580> says<00:04:18.790> that<00:04:19.000> it<00:04:19.150> supports

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
we just have so it says that it supports

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.140 
we just have so it says that it supports
55<00:04:19.989> X<00:04:20.200> zoom<00:04:20.380> out<00:04:20.590> of<00:04:20.830> that<00:04:20.979> I<00:04:21.010> think<00:04:21.160> so<00:04:21.400> just<00:04:21.580> 38

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
55 X zoom out of that I think so just 38

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.020 
55 X zoom out of that I think so just 38
this<00:04:22.270> optical<00:04:23.139> zoom<00:04:23.290> and<00:04:23.620> we<00:04:24.340> have<00:04:24.580> the<00:04:24.759> option

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
this optical zoom and we have the option

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.510 
this optical zoom and we have the option
to<00:04:25.150> go<00:04:25.270> too<00:04:25.330> wide<00:04:25.660> or<00:04:25.690> telephoto<00:04:26.350> and<00:04:26.740> we<00:04:27.400> have

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
to go too wide or telephoto and we have

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.700 
to go too wide or telephoto and we have
a<00:04:27.550> button<00:04:28.090> here<00:04:28.419> if<00:04:28.810> you<00:04:28.930> click<00:04:29.050> this<00:04:29.259> it<00:04:29.320> takes

a button here if you click this it takes

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.260 
a button here if you click this it takes
a<00:04:29.889> photograph<00:04:30.100> on<00:04:31.289> this<00:04:32.289> and<00:04:32.590> we<00:04:33.520> this<00:04:33.970> flap

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
a photograph on this and we this flap

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.450 
here and we also have a multi adapter
that<00:04:40.750> goes<00:04:40.810> in<00:04:41.169> here<00:04:41.410> moving<00:04:42.039> towards<00:04:42.340> the

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
that goes in here moving towards the

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.909 
that goes in here moving towards the
bottom<00:04:42.699> we<00:04:43.539> have<00:04:43.570> the<00:04:43.840> mount<00:04:44.110> for<00:04:44.470> the<00:04:44.650> tripod

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
bottom we have the mount for the tripod

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.340 
bottom we have the mount for the tripod
and<00:04:45.460> it's<00:04:45.940> great<00:04:46.330> that<00:04:46.360> we<00:04:46.570> have<00:04:46.870> a<00:04:46.990> metal

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
and it's great that we have a metal

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.689 
and it's great that we have a metal
tripod<00:04:47.830> mount<00:04:48.340> and<00:04:48.520> this<00:04:49.479> is<00:04:49.690> the<00:04:50.699> lens

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
tripod mount and this is the lens

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.080 
tripod mount and this is the lens
actually<00:04:52.090> and<00:04:52.630> we<00:04:53.289> also<00:04:53.650> have<00:04:53.979> dual<00:04:54.550> mics<00:04:54.880> over

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
actually and we also have dual mics over

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.040 
actually and we also have dual mics over
here<00:04:55.449> so<00:04:55.750> it<00:04:55.990> should<00:04:56.199> take<00:04:56.229> studio<00:04:56.910> audio

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
here so it should take studio audio

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.390 
here so it should take studio audio
hopefully<00:04:59.050> this<00:04:59.229> camcorder<00:04:59.470> should<00:05:00.100> improve

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
hopefully this camcorder should improve

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.159 
hopefully this camcorder should improve
the<00:05:00.520> video<00:05:00.639> quality<00:05:00.789> that<00:05:01.150> I<00:05:01.570> shoot<00:05:01.870> for<00:05:02.080> you
