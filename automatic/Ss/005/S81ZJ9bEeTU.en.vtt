games and their Naruto games where it

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.270 
games and their Naruto games where it
looks<00:01:06.180> like<00:01:06.270> an<00:01:06.510> anime<00:01:06.930> type<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.770> stuff<00:01:07.920> they

looks like an anime type of stuff they

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.920 
looks like an anime type of stuff they
could<00:01:08.460> have<00:01:08.580> done<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.790> great<00:01:09.479> music<00:01:09.630> they

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
could have done that great music they

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.510 
could have done that great music they
could<00:01:10.110> have<00:01:10.200> done<00:01:10.439> something<00:01:10.799> much<00:01:11.220> better

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
could have done something much better

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.210 
could have done something much better
but<00:01:12.210> no<00:01:12.450> he<00:01:12.689> decided<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.229> make<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.860> very

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
but no he decided to make this very

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.179 
but no he decided to make this very
low-budget<00:01:14.729> game<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.479> it<00:01:16.380> seems<00:01:16.710> like<00:01:16.950> that's

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
low-budget game and it seems like that's

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.499 
low-budget game and it seems like that's
something<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.790> kept<00:01:18.240> calm<00:01:19.310> and<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.729> would<00:01:21.360> say

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
something that kept calm and I would say

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.390 
something that kept calm and I would say
most<00:01:21.960> Japanese<00:01:22.500> companies<00:01:22.920> are<00:01:23.040> doing<00:01:23.070> now

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
most Japanese companies are doing now

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.140 
most Japanese companies are doing now
but<00:01:24.150> especially<00:01:24.689> Capcom<00:01:25.549> if<00:01:26.549> they<00:01:26.759> don't<00:01:26.939> see

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
but especially Capcom if they don't see

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.359 
but especially Capcom if they don't see
something<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.659> they<00:01:27.780> can<00:01:27.960> milk<00:01:28.200> dry<00:01:28.560> if<00:01:28.950> they

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
something that they can milk dry if they

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.830 
something that they can milk dry if they
don't<00:01:29.579> see<00:01:29.759> something<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.299> they<00:01:30.390> can<00:01:30.540> add<00:01:30.630> in

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
don't see something that they can add in

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.609 
don't see something that they can add in
just<00:01:31.320> DLC<00:01:32.009> after<00:01:32.400> DLC<00:01:33.000> on<00:01:33.210> top<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.229> they

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
just DLC after DLC on top of it they

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.929 
just DLC after DLC on top of it they
just<00:01:34.829> don't<00:01:34.920> want<00:01:35.100> nothing<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.520> do<00:01:35.640> with<00:01:35.790> it

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
just don't want nothing to do with it

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.690 
just don't want nothing to do with it
and<00:01:36.590> it<00:01:37.590> might<00:01:37.920> work<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.280> little<00:01:38.430> bit<00:01:38.549> for

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
and it might work a little bit for

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.789 
and it might work a little bit for
fighting<00:01:39.060> games<00:01:39.270> like<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.900> don't<00:01:40.079> mind<00:01:40.350> the

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
fighting games like I don't mind the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.139 
fighting games like I don't mind the
updates<00:01:41.549> like<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.799> arcade<00:01:43.799> edition<00:01:43.950> 2012<00:01:44.850> but

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
updates like the arcade edition 2012 but

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.749 
updates like the arcade edition 2012 but
now<00:01:45.240> they<00:01:45.390> can<00:01:45.509> have<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.899> ultra<00:01:46.829> super<00:01:47.549> street

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
now they can have the ultra super street

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.060 
now they can have the ultra super street
fighter<00:01:47.790> 4<00:01:48.329> edition<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.290> honestly<00:01:49.590> don't<00:01:49.950> mind

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
fighter 4 edition I honestly don't mind

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.580 
fighter 4 edition I honestly don't mind
that<00:01:50.490> too<00:01:50.700> much<00:01:50.729> this<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.720> adding<00:01:52.140> more<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.560> the

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
that too much this is adding more to the

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.460 
that too much this is adding more to the
game<00:01:53.570> rebalancing<00:01:54.570> it's<00:01:55.049> not<00:01:55.170> just<00:01:55.229> new

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
game rebalancing it's not just new

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.990 
game rebalancing it's not just new
characters<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.100> rebalancing<00:01:56.700> which<00:01:56.850> is

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
characters is rebalancing which is

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.190 
characters is rebalancing which is
probably<00:01:57.210> one<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.630> biggest<00:01:57.869> things

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
probably one of the biggest things

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.130

know obviously has ton but it seems like

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.949 
know obviously has ton but it seems like
they're<00:02:41.879> just<00:02:42.030> throwing<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:42.389> away<00:02:42.510> if<00:02:42.780> it's

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
they're just throwing it away if it's

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.780 
they're just throwing it away if it's
not<00:02:43.109> something<00:02:43.560> that's<00:02:43.590> gonna<00:02:43.829> make<00:02:43.950> them<00:02:44.310> you

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
not something that's gonna make them you

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.349 
not something that's gonna make them you
know<00:02:45.200> become<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.790> ten-million-dollar<00:02:47.790> seller

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
know become a ten-million-dollar seller

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.410 
know become a ten-million-dollar seller
it<00:02:49.319> they<00:02:50.010> just<00:02:50.040> don't<00:02:50.370> do<00:02:50.519> it<00:02:50.549> and<00:02:50.879> I<00:02:51.359> think

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
it they just don't do it and I think

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.899 
it they just don't do it and I think
it's<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.750> shame<00:02:51.920> Capcom<00:02:52.920> really<00:02:53.310> needs<00:02:53.579> to

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
it's a shame Capcom really needs to

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.569 
it's a shame Capcom really needs to
reevaluate<00:02:54.359> what<00:02:55.079> if<00:02:55.769> it's<00:02:55.920> bringing<00:02:56.189> to<00:02:56.489> the

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
reevaluate what if it's bringing to the

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.210 
reevaluate what if it's bringing to the
fans<00:02:56.849> and<00:02:57.209> I<00:02:57.959> think<00:02:58.319> we<00:02:58.530> just<00:02:58.709> need<00:02:58.889> to<00:02:59.010> speak

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
fans and I think we just need to speak

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.280 
fans and I think we just need to speak
with<00:02:59.280> our<00:02:59.519> dollars<00:02:59.939> and<00:03:00.150> let<00:03:00.299> them<00:03:00.389> know<00:03:00.420> that

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
with our dollars and let them know that

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.110 
with our dollars and let them know that
the<00:03:01.439> referee<00:03:02.189> er<00:03:02.370> deserves<00:03:02.849> a<00:03:02.970> lot<00:03:03.060> better

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
the referee er deserves a lot better

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.689 
the referee er deserves a lot better
than<00:03:03.540> this
