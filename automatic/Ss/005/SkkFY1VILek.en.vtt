00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:17.689 
have using our UV direct printer but the

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.599 
have using our UV direct printer but the
three<00:00:17.930> standard<00:00:18.439> packages<00:00:18.920> that<00:00:19.070> we<00:00:19.220> have<00:00:19.400> is

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:19.609 
three standard packages that we have is

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.060 
three standard packages that we have is
our<00:00:19.730> standard<00:00:20.180> package<00:00:20.779> on<00:00:20.990> half-inch<00:00:21.800> birch

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
our standard package on half-inch birch

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.159 
our standard package on half-inch birch
we<00:00:22.759> have<00:00:22.910> the<00:00:23.029> artisan<00:00:23.419> package<00:00:23.810> where<00:00:24.019> we're

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:24.169 
we have the artisan package where we're

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:26.109 
we have the artisan package where we're
printing<00:00:24.380> on<00:00:24.650> two<00:00:24.829> quarter<00:00:25.339> inch<00:00:25.400> bamboo<00:00:25.910> and

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
printing on two quarter inch bamboo and

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.089 
printing on two quarter inch bamboo and
then<00:00:26.630> we<00:00:26.720> have<00:00:26.839> the<00:00:26.960> designer<00:00:27.349> package<00:00:27.890> which

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
then we have the designer package which

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.029 
then we have the designer package which
is<00:00:28.249> using<00:00:28.550> the<00:00:28.669> three-quarter<00:00:29.390> inch<00:00:29.539> bamboo

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
is using the three-quarter inch bamboo

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.790 
is using the three-quarter inch bamboo
so<00:00:31.039> with<00:00:31.310> the<00:00:31.699> half-inch<00:00:32.150> birch<00:00:32.390> is<00:00:32.800> real

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
so with the half-inch birch is real

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.770 
so with the half-inch birch is real
simple<00:00:34.010> on<00:00:34.250> a<00:00:34.280> standard<00:00:34.760> package<00:00:35.210> we're

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
simple on a standard package we're

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.560 
simple on a standard package we're
printing<00:00:36.020> directly<00:00:36.850> onto<00:00:37.850> half-inch

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
printing directly onto half-inch

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.189 
printing directly onto half-inch
birchwood<00:00:39.609> we<00:00:40.609> have<00:00:41.030> a<00:00:41.059> simple<00:00:41.629> cleat<00:00:41.989> that

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
birchwood we have a simple cleat that

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:43.540 
birchwood we have a simple cleat that
we're<00:00:42.350> putting<00:00:42.530> on<00:00:42.769> the<00:00:42.890> back<00:00:43.070> of<00:00:43.100> the<00:00:43.340> box

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
we're putting on the back of the box

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.279 
we're putting on the back of the box
actually<00:00:44.000> not<00:00:44.090> simple<00:00:44.449> people<00:00:44.570> to<00:00:44.780> box<00:00:45.019> click

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
actually not simple people to box click

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.229 
actually not simple people to box click
that<00:00:45.440> we're<00:00:45.590> putting<00:00:45.710> on<00:00:45.920> the<00:00:46.010> back<00:00:46.219> and<00:00:46.969> so<00:00:47.180> it

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
that we're putting on the back and so it

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.119 
that we're putting on the back and so it
will<00:00:47.329> actually<00:00:47.510> have<00:00:47.809> that<00:00:47.930> floating<00:00:48.559> effect

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
will actually have that floating effect

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.110 
will actually have that floating effect
we<00:00:49.640> got<00:00:49.820> the<00:00:50.739> the<00:00:51.739> female<00:00:52.160> cleat<00:00:52.730> that<00:00:52.969> is

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
we got the the female cleat that is

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.689 
we got the the female cleat that is
attached<00:00:53.480> to<00:00:53.600> the<00:00:53.690> wall<00:00:53.960> with<00:00:54.140> two<00:00:54.199> screws<00:00:54.699> and

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
attached to the wall with two screws and

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.660 
attached to the wall with two screws and
then<00:00:56.420> that<00:00:56.539> just<00:00:56.719> simply<00:00:56.899> hangs<00:00:57.339> onto<00:00:58.339> the

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
then that just simply hangs onto the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.160 
then that just simply hangs onto the
wall<00:00:59.379> for<00:01:00.379> our<00:01:00.679> artisan<00:01:01.429> package<00:01:01.910> we<00:01:02.629> have<00:01:02.870> a

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
wall for our artisan package we have a

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.930 
wall for our artisan package we have a
quarter-inch<00:01:03.800> bamboo<00:01:04.309> that<00:01:04.519> we're<00:01:04.670> printing

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
quarter-inch bamboo that we're printing

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.969 
quarter-inch bamboo that we're printing
on<00:01:05.239> to<00:01:05.480> we<00:01:06.140> have<00:01:06.440> the<00:01:07.370> half-inch<00:01:07.940> flush<00:01:08.330> frame

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
on to we have the half-inch flush frame

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.109 
on to we have the half-inch flush frame
on<00:01:09.979> the<00:01:10.189> edge<00:01:10.310> that<00:01:10.549> we're<00:01:10.670> doing<00:01:10.759> it's<00:01:10.970> got<00:01:11.090> a

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
on the edge that we're doing it's got a

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.210 
on the edge that we're doing it's got a
nice<00:01:11.270> bevel<00:01:11.840> on<00:01:11.990> it<00:01:12.200> and<00:01:12.829> then<00:01:14.200> this<00:01:15.200> is<00:01:15.409> bamboo

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
nice bevel on it and then this is bamboo

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.969 
nice bevel on it and then this is bamboo
on<00:01:16.400> the<00:01:16.520> front<00:01:16.820> this<00:01:17.360> is<00:01:17.570> also<00:01:17.780> gloss<00:01:18.170> infusion

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
on the front this is also gloss infusion

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.270 
on the front this is also gloss infusion
laminated<00:01:19.729> and<00:01:20.240> so<00:01:20.509> it's<00:01:20.689> real<00:01:20.869> durable<00:01:21.280> this

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
laminated and so it's real durable this

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.910 
laminated and so it's real durable this
is<00:01:22.430> actually<00:01:22.759> a<00:01:22.790> applied<00:01:23.570> using<00:01:24.020> a<00:01:24.350> 50-ton

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
is actually a applied using a 50-ton

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.270 
is actually a applied using a 50-ton
heat<00:01:25.310> press<00:01:25.610> under<00:01:26.360> like<00:01:26.509> 300<00:01:27.049> degrees<00:01:27.380> and<00:01:27.770> so

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
heat press under like 300 degrees and so

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.280 
heat press under like 300 degrees and so
we're<00:01:28.430> talking<00:01:28.549> very<00:01:28.909> durable<00:01:29.270> it's<00:01:30.049> got<00:01:30.259> a

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
we're talking very durable it's got a

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.560 
we're talking very durable it's got a
great<00:01:30.619> look<00:01:30.829> the<00:01:31.040> actual<00:01:31.430> laminate<00:01:31.909> infuses

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
great look the actual laminate infuses

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.020 
great look the actual laminate infuses
into<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:33.920> bamboo<00:01:35.890> simple<00:01:36.890> installation<00:01:37.189> onto

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
into the bamboo simple installation onto
