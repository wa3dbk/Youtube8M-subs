00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
metal looks good this is a scanner which

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.800 
metal looks good this is a scanner which
actually<00:03:39.700> comes<00:03:39.849> separate<00:03:40.239> not<00:03:40.480> separate

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
actually comes separate not separate

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.240 
actually comes separate not separate
like<00:03:40.930> I've<00:03:41.049> got<00:03:41.230> to<00:03:41.349> buy<00:03:41.470> it<00:03:41.500> separately<00:03:41.829> put

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
like I've got to buy it separately put

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.059 
like I've got to buy it separately put
it<00:03:42.370> on<00:03:42.489> here's<00:03:43.480> the<00:03:43.630> legs<00:03:43.870> he's<00:03:44.769> got<00:03:44.950> these

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
it on here's the legs he's got these

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:47.280 
it on here's the legs he's got these
like<00:03:45.280> skirt<00:03:45.730> flat<00:03:45.970> pieces<00:03:46.359> which<00:03:46.989> actually

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
like skirt flat pieces which actually

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.020 
like skirt flat pieces which actually
move<00:03:47.560> up<00:03:47.769> and<00:03:47.919> down<00:03:48.069> and<00:03:48.340> they<00:03:48.400> actually<00:03:48.549> are

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
move up and down and they actually are

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.750 
move up and down and they actually are
used<00:03:49.269> fairly<00:03:49.630> well<00:03:49.859> the<00:03:50.859> white<00:03:51.069> color<00:03:51.549> here

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
used fairly well the white color here

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.220 
used fairly well the white color here
contrasted<00:03:52.329> with<00:03:52.389> the<00:03:52.450> purple<00:03:52.840> I<00:03:52.900> think<00:03:52.930> looks

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
contrasted with the purple I think looks

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.879 
contrasted with the purple I think looks
really<00:03:53.290> good

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
really good

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:55.789 
really good

and then you got the feet down here

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.900 
and then you got the feet down here
which<00:03:56.799> are<00:03:56.919> actually<00:03:57.160> diecast<00:03:57.579> which<00:03:57.790> is

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
which are actually diecast which is

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
fall off so articulation wise he's got

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.920 
fall off so articulation wise he's got
360<00:04:16.280> ball<00:04:16.430> joint<00:04:16.700> right<00:04:16.790> here<00:04:16.850> it's<00:04:17.660> not<00:04:17.780> too

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
360 ball joint right here it's not too

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.449 
360 ball joint right here it's not too
terribly<00:04:18.110> hindered<00:04:18.560> by<00:04:18.709> his<00:04:18.860> giant<00:04:19.190> shoulder

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
terribly hindered by his giant shoulder

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
have a double elbow joint but it is

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.450 
have a double elbow joint but it is
really<00:04:23.780> hindered<00:04:24.050> by<00:04:24.170> his<00:04:24.290> gauntlet<00:04:24.740> and<00:04:25.100> it

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
really hindered by his gauntlet and it

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.070 
really hindered by his gauntlet and it
really<00:04:26.470> handicaps<00:04:27.470> to<00:04:27.590> motion<00:04:27.940> 360<00:04:28.940> here<00:04:29.270> he's

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
really handicaps to motion 360 here he's

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.560 
really handicaps to motion 360 here he's
got<00:04:30.230> those<00:04:30.410> joints<00:04:30.950> here<00:04:31.430> for<00:04:31.760> his<00:04:31.910> hips<00:04:32.240> and

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
got those joints here for his hips and

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.370 
got those joints here for his hips and
his<00:04:33.140> chest<00:04:33.620> but<00:04:34.010> it's<00:04:34.220> again<00:04:35.150> hindered<00:04:35.600> here

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
his chest but it's again hindered here

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.590 
his chest but it's again hindered here
by<00:04:36.500> this<00:04:36.710> chess<00:04:36.950> piece<00:04:37.060> because<00:04:38.060> it<00:04:38.180> clashes

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
by this chess piece because it clashes

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.180 
by this chess piece because it clashes
with<00:04:38.750> the<00:04:38.780> driver<00:04:39.110> so<00:04:39.560> you<00:04:39.620> can't<00:04:39.890> get<00:04:40.010> some

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
with the driver so you can't get some

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.850 
with the driver so you can't get some
motion<00:04:40.340> here<00:04:40.610> which<00:04:40.730> is<00:04:40.880> disappointing<00:04:41.860> 360

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
motion here which is disappointing 360

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.350 
motion here which is disappointing 360
all<00:04:42.980> around<00:04:43.220> had<00:04:43.430> articulation<00:04:44.000> on<00:04:44.120> a<00:04:44.150> ball

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
all around had articulation on a ball

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.750 
all around had articulation on a ball
joint<00:04:44.390> good<00:04:44.840> job<00:04:45.020> there<00:04:45.310> 360<00:04:46.310> leg<00:04:46.460> joint

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
joint good job there 360 leg joint

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.150 
joint good job there 360 leg joint

swiveling double knee joint swiveling

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.970 
swiveling double knee joint swiveling
and<00:04:49.340> then<00:04:50.090> we<00:04:50.540> do<00:04:50.660> have<00:04:50.780> two<00:04:50.900> action<00:04:51.260> so

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
and then we do have two action so

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.710 
and then we do have two action so
standard<00:04:52.340> articulation<00:04:53.000> he's<00:04:53.210> actually<00:04:53.390> more

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
standard articulation he's actually more

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.050 
standard articulation he's actually more
hindered<00:04:54.140> than<00:04:54.710> a<00:04:54.740> lot<00:04:54.980> of<00:04:55.130> figures<00:04:55.460> because

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
hindered than a lot of figures because

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.330 
hindered than a lot of figures because
of<00:04:56.180> his<00:04:56.300> armor<00:04:56.690> but<00:04:57.530> I<00:04:57.560> can't<00:04:57.980> really<00:04:58.070> fault

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
of his armor but I can't really fault

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.430 
of his armor but I can't really fault
them<00:04:58.400> for<00:04:58.520> that<00:04:59.020> but<00:05:00.020> still<00:05:00.290> good

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
them for that but still good

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.110 
them for that but still good
articulation<00:05:01.100> and<00:05:01.400> like<00:05:01.610> when<00:05:01.760> you<00:05:01.820> extend

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
articulation and like when you extend

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.990 
articulation and like when you extend
these<00:05:02.300> pieces<00:05:02.540> out<00:05:02.810> these<00:05:03.740> like<00:05:04.220> suction<00:05:04.850> cup

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
these pieces out these like suction cup

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.190 
these pieces out these like suction cup
on<00:05:05.090> do<00:05:05.300> really<00:05:05.480> well<00:05:05.690> which<00:05:05.810> make<00:05:05.990> it<00:05:06.080> look

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
on do really well which make it look

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.280 
on do really well which make it look
really<00:05:06.380> natural<00:05:06.500> which<00:05:07.370> is<00:05:07.400> nice<00:05:07.669> and<00:05:08.290> I'm

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
really natural which is nice and I'm

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.200 
really natural which is nice and I'm
proud<00:05:09.560> to<00:05:09.620> report<00:05:09.830> yet<00:05:10.310> another<00:05:10.550> OHS<00:05:10.790> figure

proud to report yet another OHS figure
release<00:05:11.510> with<00:05:12.230> very<00:05:12.530> tight<00:05:12.770> joins<00:05:13.070> in<00:05:13.340> fact<00:05:13.550> I

release with very tight joins in fact I
believe<00:05:13.760> he<00:05:14.270> is<00:05:14.360> the<00:05:14.390> tightest<00:05:14.840> joint<00:05:15.080> I<00:05:15.200> have

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
believe he is the tightest joint I have

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.070 
believe he is the tightest joint I have
had<00:05:15.820> all<00:05:16.820> his<00:05:16.910> joints<00:05:17.180> feel<00:05:17.330> very<00:05:17.540> solid<00:05:17.960> and
