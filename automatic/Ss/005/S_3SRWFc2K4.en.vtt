the<00:01:13.460> flowchart<00:01:13.700> is<00:01:14.090> so<00:01:14.210> important<00:01:14.780> now<00:01:15.380> all

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
the flowchart is so important now all

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.020 
the flowchart is so important now all
you<00:01:15.620> need<00:01:15.650> to<00:01:15.830> do<00:01:16.010> is<00:01:16.160> take<00:01:16.310> another<00:01:16.610> jumper

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
you need to do is take another jumper

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.280 
you need to do is take another jumper
wire<00:01:17.210> off<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:17.450> negative<00:01:17.900> side<00:01:18.140> of<00:01:18.170> the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.440 

so<00:01:27.080> we've<00:01:27.680> bypassed<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.430> starter<00:01:28.880> switch<00:01:29.120> the

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
so we've bypassed the starter switch the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.930 
so we've bypassed the starter switch the
starter<00:01:29.870> relay<00:01:30.020> all<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:30.770> wiring<00:01:30.980> down<00:01:31.460> here

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940

all<00:01:32.330> we're<00:01:32.630> doing<00:01:32.660> at<00:01:32.930> this<00:01:33.050> point<00:01:33.350> is<00:01:33.530> just

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
all we're doing at this point is just

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.650 
all we're doing at this point is just
driving<00:01:34.250> the<00:01:34.280> cranking<00:01:34.730> motor<00:01:34.940> manually<00:01:35.480> with

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
driving the cranking motor manually with

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.230 
driving the cranking motor manually with
current<00:01:36.020> now<00:01:36.710> if<00:01:37.010> you<00:01:37.220> want<00:01:37.550> you<00:01:37.850> can<00:01:37.970> see<00:01:38.150> if

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
current now if you want you can see if

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.640 
current now if you want you can see if
it'll<00:01:38.360> even<00:01:38.480> start<00:01:38.930> all<00:01:39.230> you<00:01:39.320> got<00:01:39.440> to<00:01:39.560> do<00:01:39.620> is

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
it'll even start all you got to do is

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.650 
it'll even start all you got to do is
turn<00:01:39.860> on<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.130> ignition<00:01:40.280> let<00:01:41.150> the<00:01:41.270> fuel<00:01:41.480> pump

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
turn on the ignition let the fuel pump

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.050 
turn on the ignition let the fuel pump
prime<00:01:42.080> and<00:01:42.400> see<00:01:43.400> if<00:01:43.520> cranking<00:01:43.940> the<00:01:44.030> engine

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
prime and see if cranking the engine

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.850 
prime and see if cranking the engine
over<00:01:44.390> we'll<00:01:44.570> get<00:01:44.690> it<00:01:44.780> to<00:01:44.930> fire<00:01:45.110> up<00:01:45.350> so<00:01:45.560> let's<00:01:45.710> go

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
over we'll get it to fire up so let's go

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:53.530 
over we'll get it to fire up so let's go
ahead<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:46.100> do<00:01:46.310> that

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.730 

probably<00:01:54.540> heard<00:01:54.660> the<00:01:54.780> fuel<00:01:54.960> pump<00:01:55.140> prime<00:01:55.470> there

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
probably heard the fuel pump prime there

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.440 
probably heard the fuel pump prime there
now<00:01:56.310> we're<00:01:56.460> going<00:01:56.550> to<00:01:56.610> go<00:01:56.670> ahead<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.060> manually

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
now we're going to go ahead and manually

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:07.330 
now we're going to go ahead and manually
jumper<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.050> cranking<00:01:58.410> motor<00:01:58.620> again

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.790 

and<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.580> fires<00:02:08.850> right<00:02:08.970> up<00:02:09.240> so<00:02:10.140> if<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.560> want<00:02:10.740> to

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
and it fires right up so if you want to

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.740 
and it fires right up so if you want to
work<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.070> flowchart<00:02:11.550> backwards<00:02:12.090> this<00:02:12.540> is

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
work the flowchart backwards this is

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.680 
work the flowchart backwards this is
going<00:02:12.960> to<00:02:13.020> be<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.530> last<00:02:13.740> step<00:02:14.040> of<00:02:14.220> the

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
going to be the last step of the

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.110 
going to be the last step of the
diagnostic<00:02:15.690> chart<00:02:15.990> step<00:02:16.320> 7<00:02:16.800> this<00:02:17.520> is<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.700> really

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
diagnostic chart step 7 this is a really

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.400 
diagnostic chart step 7 this is a really
good<00:02:18.240> way<00:02:18.390> of<00:02:18.420> at<00:02:18.840> least<00:02:18.960> checking<00:02:19.230> the

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
good way of at least checking the

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.380 
good way of at least checking the
cranking<00:02:19.770> motor<00:02:19.980> first<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.910> get<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.180> check

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
cranking motor first you get to check

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.480 
cranking motor first you get to check
the<00:02:21.510> starter<00:02:21.870> drive<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.440> engagement<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:23.340> get

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
the starter drive the engagement you get

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.330 
the starter drive the engagement you get
to<00:02:23.610> check<00:02:23.820> for<00:02:24.000> noises<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.750> at<00:02:25.620> this<00:02:25.860> point<00:02:26.100> if

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
to check for noises and at this point if

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.010 
to check for noises and at this point if
your<00:02:26.640> ignition<00:02:26.910> comes<00:02:27.270> on<00:02:27.450> in<00:02:27.630> your<00:02:27.720> battery

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
your ignition comes on in your battery

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.390 
your ignition comes on in your battery
is<00:02:28.110> up<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:28.410> can<00:02:28.530> even<00:02:28.620> get<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:28.920> started<00:02:28.950> this

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
is up you can even get it started this

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.640 
is up you can even get it started this
way
