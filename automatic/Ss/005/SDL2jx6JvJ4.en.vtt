thing<00:02:04.630> to<00:02:04.750> do<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:06.700> has<00:02:07.030> thumb<00:02:07.390> screws<00:02:07.690> that<00:02:07.900> go

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
thing to do it has thumb screws that go

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.140 
thing to do it has thumb screws that go
right<00:02:08.140> there<00:02:08.350> I<00:02:08.380> just<00:02:08.470> took<00:02:08.710> them<00:02:08.830> off<00:02:09.150> and

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.150 
right there I just took them off and

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.060 
right there I just took them off and
first<00:02:11.140> things<00:02:11.320> first<00:02:11.530> definitely<00:02:11.890> you<00:02:12.040> should

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
first things first definitely you should

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.700 
first things first definitely you should
not<00:02:12.340> be<00:02:12.460> taking<00:02:12.840> cable<00:02:13.840> management<00:02:14.050> lessons

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
not be taking cable management lessons

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.530 
not be taking cable management lessons
for<00:02:14.920> me<00:02:15.070> but<00:02:17.130> yeah<00:02:18.130> that's<00:02:18.430> that's<00:02:19.210> pretty

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
for me but yeah that's that's pretty

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.660 
for me but yeah that's that's pretty
much<00:02:19.630> it<00:02:19.690> this<00:02:20.020> is<00:02:20.200> right<00:02:21.130> here<00:02:21.310> this<00:02:21.460> is<00:02:21.520> a

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
much it this is right here this is a

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.180 
much it this is right here this is a
closed<00:02:22.060> corsair<00:02:23.050> h70<00:02:23.760> cpu<00:02:24.760> cooling<00:02:25.030> unit<00:02:25.480> and

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
closed corsair h70 cpu cooling unit and

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.380 
closed corsair h70 cpu cooling unit and
instead<00:02:27.190> of<00:02:27.280> using<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.520> stock<00:02:27.790> fan<00:02:27.970> i<00:02:28.150> order

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
instead of using the stock fan i order

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.000 
instead of using the stock fan i order
one<00:02:28.450> of<00:02:28.570> these<00:02:28.720> things<00:02:29.020> it's<00:02:29.320> really<00:02:29.800> really

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
one of these things it's really really

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.380 
one of these things it's really really
nice<00:02:30.160> it<00:02:30.430> has<00:02:30.460> been<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:30.880> giving<00:02:31.120> me<00:02:31.150> some

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
nice it has been and giving me some

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.710 
nice it has been and giving me some
great<00:02:32.790> it's<00:02:33.790> been<00:02:33.910> cooling<00:02:34.330> it<00:02:34.420> really<00:02:34.600> well

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
great it's been cooling it really well

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.280 
great it's been cooling it really well
so<00:02:35.260> under<00:02:35.590> this<00:02:35.740> thing<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:37.450> water<00:02:37.630> flows<00:02:37.990> and

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
so under this thing the water flows and

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.970 
so under this thing the water flows and
are<00:02:39.250> not<00:02:39.580> water<00:02:39.850> obviously<00:02:40.060> but<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:41.590> liquid

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
are not water obviously but the liquid

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.100 
are not water obviously but the liquid
flows<00:02:42.550> through<00:02:42.940> here<00:02:43.270> it<00:02:43.690> goes<00:02:43.870> into<00:02:44.080> their

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
flows through here it goes into their

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.670 
flows through here it goes into their
black<00:02:47.220> corsair<00:02:48.220> thing<00:02:49.020> over<00:02:50.020> here<00:02:50.050> we<00:02:50.470> have

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
black corsair thing over here we have

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.600 
black corsair thing over here we have
four<00:02:51.550> gigabytes<00:02:51.970> of<00:02:52.120> ddr2<00:02:52.960> ram<00:02:53.890> and<00:02:54.520> i'm

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
four gigabytes of ddr2 ram and i'm

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:55.890 
four gigabytes of ddr2 ram and i'm
probably<00:02:54.760> going<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:55.030> upgrade<00:02:55.150> but<00:02:55.570> that's<00:02:55.780> all

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
probably going to upgrade but that's all

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.290 
probably going to upgrade but that's all
i<00:02:55.930> have<00:02:56.110> for<00:02:56.170> now<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:56.730> then<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:59.560> motherboard

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
i have for now and then the motherboard

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:07.500 
i have for now and then the motherboard
is<00:03:01.300> a<00:03:01.480> gigabyte<00:03:02.940> am-3<00:03:03.940> it<00:03:04.720> sports<00:03:06.510> six

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
is a gigabyte am-3 it sports six

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.590 
is a gigabyte am-3 it sports six
gigabytes<00:03:07.900> per<00:03:08.410> second<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:10.110> sports<00:03:11.110> hdmi

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
gigabytes per second and sports hdmi

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.750 
gigabytes per second and sports hdmi
that's<00:03:13.600> all<00:03:13.900> I<00:03:13.989> know<00:03:14.050> about<00:03:14.140> it<00:03:14.440> um<00:03:14.620> off<00:03:15.520> the

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
that's all I know about it um off the

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.330 
that's all I know about it um off the
top<00:03:15.880> of<00:03:15.940> my<00:03:16.060> head<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:17.590> this<00:03:17.860> by<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.070> way<00:03:18.160> is<00:03:18.250> a

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
top of my head and this by the way is a

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.520 
top of my head and this by the way is a
sealed<00:03:18.640> cooling<00:03:19.120> unit<00:03:19.390> right<00:03:19.510> here<00:03:19.570> so<00:03:20.110> you

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
sealed cooling unit right here so you

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.990 
sealed cooling unit right here so you
never<00:03:20.620> have<00:03:20.860> to<00:03:20.890> open<00:03:21.220> or<00:03:21.340> close<00:03:21.550> it<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:21.880> it

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
never have to open or close it and it

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.979 
never have to open or close it and it
just<00:03:22.180> goes<00:03:23.020> here<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:23.590> cools<00:03:24.459> off<00:03:24.610> the<00:03:24.970> cpu<00:03:25.420> so

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
just goes here and cools off the cpu so

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.530 
just goes here and cools off the cpu so
you<00:03:26.080> never<00:03:26.170> have<00:03:26.410> to<00:03:26.530> have<00:03:26.709> maintenance<00:03:27.040> on

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
you never have to have maintenance on

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:35.070 
you never have to have maintenance on
there's<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:28.840> h<00:03:29.260> 9<00:03:29.590> 50<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:33.510> kind<00:03:34.510> of<00:03:34.600> graphics

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
there's the h 9 50 the kind of graphics

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.840 
there's the h 9 50 the kind of graphics
of<00:03:35.260> it<00:03:35.380> and<00:03:35.590> the<00:03:35.650> fan<00:03:35.890> on<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:36.250> bottom<00:03:36.580> i'm<00:03:36.760> not

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
of it and the fan on the bottom i'm not

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.400 
of it and the fan on the bottom i'm not
sure<00:03:36.940> if<00:03:37.060> I'm<00:03:37.180> getting<00:03:37.420> it<00:03:37.510> again<00:03:37.780> good<00:03:38.080> angle

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
sure if I'm getting it again good angle

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.690 
sure if I'm getting it again good angle
or<00:03:38.500> not<00:03:38.650> but<00:03:38.950> you<00:03:39.040> can<00:03:39.190> kind<00:03:39.340> of<00:03:39.400> see<00:03:39.459> that

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
or not but you can kind of see that

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.949 
or not but you can kind of see that
right<00:03:39.820> there<00:03:40.410> so<00:03:41.410> that's<00:03:41.590> just<00:03:41.650> that<00:03:41.920> um<00:03:42.959> then

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
right there so that's just that um then

one half terabytes which was nice

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.129 
one half terabytes which was nice
because<00:04:20.510> it<00:04:20.930> was<00:04:21.049> only<00:04:21.139> like<00:04:21.380> 70<00:04:22.220> bucks<00:04:22.430> and
