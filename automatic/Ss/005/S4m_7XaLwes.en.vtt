00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
first place that's why so many people

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.350 
first place that's why so many people
around<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.920> world<00:01:26.100> have<00:01:26.610> trouble<00:01:27.030> accepting

around the world have trouble accepting
how<00:01:27.720> dangerous<00:01:28.290> they<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.740> be<00:01:29.509> many<00:01:30.509> germs<00:01:30.930> and

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
how dangerous they can be many germs and

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.990 
how dangerous they can be many germs and
parasites<00:01:31.350> enter<00:01:32.009> our<00:01:32.159> bodies<00:01:32.579> through<00:01:32.880> the

parasites enter our bodies through the
water<00:01:33.270> we<00:01:33.540> drink<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.740> by<00:01:34.950> understanding<00:01:35.100> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
water we drink so by understanding the

science of disease we've designed
filters<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.369> are<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:38.759> fine<00:01:39.119> they<00:01:39.930> block<00:01:40.380> out

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
filters that are so fine they block out

we've been able to preserve the lives of

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.130 
we've been able to preserve the lives of
millions<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.890> people<00:01:46.950> around<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.820> world
