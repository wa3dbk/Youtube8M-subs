the one with so let's take a closer look
at<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.350> controller<00:01:22.710> here<00:01:23.670> all<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.970> buttons

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
at the controller here all the buttons

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.690 
at the controller here all the buttons
are<00:01:24.390> clearly<00:01:24.630> marked<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:26.130> d-pad<00:01:26.490> here

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.499 
this is a custom d-pad made by x yeah
it's<00:01:28.979> really<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.340> lot<00:01:29.520> better<00:01:29.759> than<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.060> one

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
it's really a lot better than the one

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.050 
it's really a lot better than the one
that<00:01:30.600> comes<00:01:30.780> into<00:01:30.960> regular<00:01:31.200> controller<00:01:32.060> this

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
that comes into regular controller this

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.140 
that comes into regular controller this
one<00:01:33.270> does<00:01:33.689> have<00:01:34.400> LEDs<00:01:35.400> in<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.670> all<00:01:35.880> have<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.090> do

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
one does have LEDs in it all have to do

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.850 
one does have LEDs in it all have to do
is<00:01:36.240> push<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.570> button<00:01:36.780> right<00:01:36.930> there<00:01:37.110> you

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
is push this button right there you

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.399 
is push this button right there you
should<00:01:38.130> get<00:01:38.220> your<00:01:38.340> LEDs<00:01:38.790> now<00:01:39.479> some<00:01:40.380> people

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
should get your LEDs now some people

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.710 
should get your LEDs now some people
worry<00:01:40.770> about<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.040> triggers<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:42.240> find<00:01:42.600> it

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
worry about the triggers and I find it

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.450 
worry about the triggers and I find it
that<00:01:42.869> it's<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.290> little<00:01:43.320> bit<00:01:43.560> harder<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.189> push<00:01:44.340> it

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
that it's a little bit harder to push it

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.069 
that it's a little bit harder to push it
down<00:01:44.579> where<00:01:44.880> personally<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.390> like<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.869> bit

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
down where personally I like that a bit

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.560 
down where personally I like that a bit
more<00:01:46.290> does<00:01:47.130> have<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> black<00:01:47.729> bottom<00:01:48.240> here<00:01:48.420> which

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
more does have a black bottom here which

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.450 
more does have a black bottom here which
is<00:01:48.659> pretty<00:01:48.780> cool<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.320> for<00:01:49.890> some<00:01:50.070> reason<00:01:50.100> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
is pretty cool and for some reason the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.539 
is pretty cool and for some reason the
battery<00:01:50.880> pack<00:01:51.829> the<00:01:52.829> battery<00:01:53.130> pack<00:01:53.159> is<00:01:53.369> a

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
battery pack the battery pack is a

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.859 
battery pack the battery pack is a
different<00:01:53.909> color<00:01:54.090> than<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.420> rest<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.810> the

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
different color than the rest of the

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.469 
different color than the rest of the

attention looking thing like this now it

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.709 
attention looking thing like this now it
does<00:02:40.790> it<00:02:41.060> does<00:02:41.269> include<00:02:41.569> a<00:02:41.920> Torx<00:02:42.920> nine<00:02:43.719> this

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:44.719 
does it does include a Torx nine this

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:48.220 
does it does include a Torx nine this
towards<00:02:45.170> nine<00:02:45.379> tamper<00:02:45.950> proof<00:02:46.239> that<00:02:47.239> you<00:02:48.019> use

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
towards nine tamper proof that you use

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.309 
towards nine tamper proof that you use
to<00:02:48.260> open<00:02:48.439> up<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.739> controller<00:02:49.299> and<00:02:50.299> right<00:02:51.109> here

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
to open up the controller and right here

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.009 
to open up the controller and right here
I<00:02:51.409> believe<00:02:51.739> is<00:02:51.919> a<00:02:51.950> Torx<00:02:52.400> 10<00:02:52.760> which<00:02:53.599> you<00:02:53.750> use<00:02:53.989> to

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
I believe is a Torx 10 which you use to

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.449 
I believe is a Torx 10 which you use to
open<00:02:54.530> up<00:02:54.650> each<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.639> hard<00:02:55.849> drive<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:56.900> if<00:02:57.459> I

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
open up each the hard drive and if I

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.280 
open up each the hard drive and if I
think<00:02:59.180> it<00:02:59.299> also<00:02:59.419> works<00:02:59.659> on<00:02:59.840> the<00:02:59.959> inside<00:03:00.260> of

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
think it also works on the inside of

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.759 
think it also works on the inside of
that<00:03:00.409> xbox<00:03:00.919> too<00:03:01.450> so<00:03:02.450> this<00:03:03.079> is<00:03:03.109> a<00:03:03.230> bang<00:03:03.409> chaotic

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
that xbox too so this is a bang chaotic

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.979 
that xbox too so this is a bang chaotic
modern<00:03:04.069> and<00:03:04.219> this<00:03:04.790> is<00:03:04.969> definitely<00:03:05.299> improved

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
modern and this is definitely improved

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.020 
modern and this is definitely improved
by<00:03:06.139> him<00:03:06.319> i<00:03:06.349> use<00:03:06.620> this<00:03:06.739> every<00:03:07.069> day<00:03:07.099> it's<00:03:07.909> also

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
by him i use this every day it's also

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.679 
by him i use this every day it's also
really<00:03:08.389> really<00:03:08.480> pretty<00:03:08.989> so<00:03:10.000> in<00:03:11.000> spin<00:03:11.329> chaotic

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:11.689 
really really pretty so in spin chaotic

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:14.500 
really really pretty so in spin chaotic
modern<00:03:11.989> and<00:03:12.139> i'm<00:03:12.319> out
