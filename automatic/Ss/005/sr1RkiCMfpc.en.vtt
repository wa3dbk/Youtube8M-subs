00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.410
 we start doing 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.630
 ah 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.440
 we are very happy because we finished 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.360
 our training period were 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.350
 very hard gym ended today at the 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.350
 clue to this girl 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.750
 and the truth that we are very happy 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.360
 We really want to believe that it is a 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.210
 very good tournament against three teams very 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.160
 strong and good also measure a little 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.629
 of how he is doing one of the things 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.629
 against top-level teams 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.130
 Good thing happened after char and 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.619
 good trip that and what I think 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.300
 have to rest a bit more 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.820
 there are many modifications but the good 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.040
 is that the team is always united and 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.400
 I think that in these situations a lot 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.470
 plus 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.330
 As I told you at the beginning, it seems to me that 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.550
 the team like it gets much stronger 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.520
 more with these things that happened to us 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.920
 we are more with the girls than others 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.380
 personally I even get closer 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.540
 to the girls what happened to them 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.830
 it happened that it is a slump but they came out 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:38.530
 forward they come to infect the energy that 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.420
 they would bring the 20 days that they are running 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.009
 do not come today we were doing some 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.770
 passes that made me happy because the 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:47.039
 weird bunch so nothing I think we 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.960
 it's much stronger as a team and 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:52.630
 let's think we're going to get very well 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.240
 all good both in the group and in the 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.369
 I play the desire above all of all 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.750
 that I think is the most important thing 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.270
 for the technical things are getting better 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.010
 but attitude is missing and that's what 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.150
 cutest and most important 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:10.149
 how is it not to have roses 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:13.000
 and I think we 're used to 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.280
 act with her but good and some that 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.820
 another row has not gone either and we act in 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.930
 team with other variants so we are 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:25.240
 better and it's weird I think that for captains 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.640
 and referring the equipment what is outside 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.380
 inside the court declared but good 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.630
 I think we also know that it's a 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.860
 previous tournament that does not have the 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.080
 importance of what will come more 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.760
 go ahead so it's good to stay 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.370
 to rest and to train in a 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.520
 different way that everyone wants to see 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.520
 plus
