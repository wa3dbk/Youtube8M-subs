00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:17.490
 the professor his point super engineer 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:19.000
 hello guys girls students I'm the 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.930
 teacher 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.140
 with double s the teacher point engineer 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.660
 it's worth one more time here to explain 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.349
 new science concepts 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.410
 engineering we have today today we are going to 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.660
 go with differential equations 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:44.630
 homogeneous type 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:46.910
 print is equal to efe of y / x that is 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.940
 the equation that you give us has to be 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.530
 always function of and divided by x if 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.440
 we have any differential equation 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.480
 in which we appear and divided between 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.670
 x 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:03.210
 we can solve it by this 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.250
 method we call of x 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.100
 this is the theory video is worth then 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.049
 I will make an exercise video where 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.810
 I will explain a couple of exercises but 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.140
 it is very very important to understand the theory 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.670
 so then in these types of equations 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.509
 Differentials already know that little by little 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:25.710
 I'm explaining all types 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:30.290
 we will call vx a marc and enter x then 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:34.570
 and it will be xx 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:40.479
 and my cousin will be 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:43.479
 and more x for your premium because it will be the 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.530
 drift x poruqe drift x is 1 well 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.810
 put more 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.610
 x in bilbao without derivative by a derivative 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:54.990
 What is your bonus? 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.990
 then nothing, we will have to 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:02.159
 more x for a bonus that I am and bonus if 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.460
 you set 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.390
 this is print 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.390
 it will be the same 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:18.950
 efe d see why and is and starting x 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.950
 then x for a bonus 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.830
 it will be efe 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.410
 - u 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.830
 and why have we done all this because 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:34.070
 we have done to convert this equation 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.540
 a priori quite complicated for 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.730
 turn it into one of variables 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.200
 separable the type of equations that already 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.690
 has explained in other videos to take a 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.620
 look at my channel that I'll put who 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.780
 in the comments to my playlist of 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.700
 differential equations there you will see the 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.300
 of separable variables is now worth 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:58.340
 simply put together the bone their 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:00.890
 efe match his cousin - a front 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:05.300
 past dividing will be equal to 1 match 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:07.970
 of x since your premium is the derivative 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.860
 of the USA with respect to here already 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.680
 could integrate and could do the 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:16.780
 integral of 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.209
 differential of v / efe - 1 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.970
 it has to be equal to the 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.980
 integral of x / x differential and this 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.250
 we integrate it and solve the equation 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.350
 differential is worth then I'm going to 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.540
 do an exercise you can see it 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.140
 hook and here it's worth in this video 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.640
 theory come on guys girls many 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.940
 Greetings and I hope you have served 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:46.470
 remember do not leave the theory aside 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:46.470
 it is always very important bye bye
