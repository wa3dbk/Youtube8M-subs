00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.030
 with clean and moistened hands 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.190
 we grab a ball of rice the size 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.530
 of our hands and we will go 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.710
 scattering in the arga little by little until 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.320
 cover it completely be careful not to 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.170
 crush the rice and always moisten your 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.360
 hands remember to leave approximately 1 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.900
 centimeter without rice that is where 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.360
 we will seal the roll 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.540
 do not forget to moisten your hands when 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.490
 you have finished handling the rice 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.520
 now we place the bottom 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.440
 mayonnaise the amount is to taste also 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.260
 you can experiment with another kind of 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.390
 sauce or dressing then add the 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.970
 shrimp trying that at the time of 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.180
 cut the rolls have each one a 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.650
 serving a few strips of avocado always 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.650
 across the seaweed 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.650
 to roll help yourself with the sheet and 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.370
 pressing with your fingers bends towards 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.580
 inside of roll forming a cylinder 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.660
 pushing the edge of the alga into the interior 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.270
 remember that you have to press 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.150
 slightly verifies that none of the 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.940
 ingredients have left you go back to 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.730
 push in and roll towards 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.520
 you moisten your hands if you feel that it is 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:54.190
 so sticky when you've rolled everything 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.440
 the sushi checks if the ingredients are not 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.600
 they have gone out the ends to me 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.030
 like to give it another pass to be 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.160
 sure that everything is well sealed if 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.080
 you press very hard when you roll the 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.030
 ingredients will come out the ends 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.240
 so you just have to push it 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.070
 slightly inward now it cuts 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.650
 in half your roll with the knife 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.380
 without forcing it hard that's why you have to 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.960
 be sharp when you have two 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.690
 halves put them together and with the 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.480
 clean knife you cut through the 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.150
 half this is for all your 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.830
 joke remain the same size repeats 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.910
 this step with the other 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.910
 every time you have left 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.580
 we continue with the second roll repeats the 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.550
 same steps as with the previous lava 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.310
 well your hands and moisten them makes them 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:18.190
 rice ball and spread wide and 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.890
 long algae do it as many times as possible 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.720
 necessary by moistening your hands to 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.540
 prevent the rice from sticking and 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.820
 remember to leave one centimeter at the end 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.820
 that will serve to seal roll 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.950
 when you're done with a trickle 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.320
 of mayonnaise across the seaweed place 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:02.840
 2 sticks and a half of meat of 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.840
 crab and some avocado strips 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.660
 wash your hands and roll up holding the 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:19.630
 edge of the leaf with the algae pushing 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.480
 inwards and rolling up applying the 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.790
 same strength for the whole roll and spinning 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.400
 or bending so that it seals well 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.770
 check that the edge is well attached if 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.590
 you can not roll it back with the 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.900
 sheet or the mat or else do as I 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.530
 and moisten it a little so that it 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.530
 stick well 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.690
 and now to cut always cleaning the 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.420
 knife with water so that the rice does not 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:53.690
 stick and do not break the sushi 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:57.260
 you know first in half the joints 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:00.200
 and makes half and short and repeats 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:03.610
 again you should have 8 rolls of 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.610
 surfing and the same size 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:13.540

 salmon sushis because they eat raw 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.160

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:23.750
 ingredients that you like most do not have 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.930
 fear in experiencing 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.330
