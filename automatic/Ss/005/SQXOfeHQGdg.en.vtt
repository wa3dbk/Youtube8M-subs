00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
bolt through basically it kind of went

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.600 
bolt through basically it kind of went
through<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.659> bottom<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.259> ate<00:01:56.070> up<00:01:56.399> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
through the bottom so it ate up the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.340 
through the bottom so it ate up the
bottom<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.090> PVC<00:01:57.540> pipe<00:01:57.750> meaning<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.229> I

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
bottom of the PVC pipe meaning that I

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.109 
bottom of the PVC pipe meaning that I
can't<00:01:58.590> move<00:01:58.799> this<00:01:59.009> but<00:01:59.250> so<00:01:59.460> much<00:01:59.640> top<00:01:59.969> to

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
can't move this but so much top to

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.959 
can't move this but so much top to
bottom<00:02:00.979> now<00:02:01.979> as<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.219> can<00:02:02.399> tell<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.729> hook<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:02.939> to

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
bottom now as you can tell to hook it to

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.690 
bottom now as you can tell to hook it to
the<00:02:03.149> helmet<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.659> used<00:02:04.049> rivets<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:05.340> reason

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
the helmet I used rivets and the reason

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.490 
the helmet I used rivets and the reason
is<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.180> was<00:02:06.360> quick<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.719> easy<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.140> had<00:02:07.320> them<00:02:07.439> in

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
is it was quick and easy I had them in

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.360 
is it was quick and easy I had them in
the<00:02:07.560> garage<00:02:08.330> very<00:02:09.330> short<00:02:09.720> rivets<00:02:10.050> that

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:10.370 
the garage very short rivets that

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.770 
the garage very short rivets that
basically<00:02:11.370> didn't<00:02:11.790> really<00:02:12.180> penetrate<00:02:12.599> too

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
basically didn't really penetrate too

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.580 
basically didn't really penetrate too
bad<00:02:12.959> so<00:02:13.170> I'm<00:02:13.230> not<00:02:13.319> going<00:02:13.440> to

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
bad so I'm not going to

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.740 
bad so I'm not going to
a<00:02:13.620> hole<00:02:13.950> in<00:02:14.099> my<00:02:14.220> noggin<00:02:14.730> if<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.090> take<00:02:15.300> a<00:02:15.330> wreck<00:02:15.599> on

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
a hole in my noggin if I take a wreck on

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.199 
a hole in my noggin if I take a wreck on
this<00:02:15.900> thing<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.230> evil<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:16.910> stab<00:02:17.910> me<00:02:17.940> in<00:02:18.150> the

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
this thing and evil and stab me in the

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.910 
this thing and evil and stab me in the
head<00:02:18.480> so<00:02:19.250> pretty<00:02:20.250> fat<00:02:20.519> rivet<00:02:21.680> relative<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.830> the

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
head so pretty fat rivet relative to the

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.080 
head so pretty fat rivet relative to the
GoPro<00:02:23.400> there<00:02:23.849> it<00:02:24.000> is<00:02:25.220> rivet<00:02:26.220> on<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.879> back<00:02:27.060> of

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
GoPro there it is rivet on the back of

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.360 
GoPro there it is rivet on the back of
it<00:02:27.360> I<00:02:27.420> did<00:02:27.660> use<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:27.900> little<00:02:28.230> rivet<00:02:28.620> holder

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
it I did use the little rivet holder

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.759 
it I did use the little rivet holder
there<00:02:29.610> that<00:02:30.739> basically<00:02:31.739> uh<00:02:33.470> that's<00:02:34.470> on<00:02:34.650> the

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
there that basically uh that's on the

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.199 
there that basically uh that's on the
end<00:02:34.890> of<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.040> rivet<00:02:35.250> like<00:02:35.519> that<00:02:35.790> like<00:02:36.060> you

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
end of the rivet like that like you

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.820 
end of the rivet like that like you
stick<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.510> through<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.780> helmet<00:02:37.200> actually

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
stick it through the helmet actually

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.050 
stick it through the helmet actually
stick<00:02:38.099> it<00:02:38.190> through<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.370> helmet<00:02:38.610> from<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.849> top

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
stick it through the helmet from the top

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.490 
stick it through the helmet from the top
down<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.569> you<00:02:39.629> put<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.870> little<00:02:40.019> rivet<00:02:40.349> thing

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
down and you put the little rivet thing

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.770 
down and you put the little rivet thing
on<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.709> back<00:02:40.860> so<00:02:41.160> that<00:02:41.190> then<00:02:41.640> when<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:42.599> use

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
on the back so that then when you use

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.930 
on the back so that then when you use
your<00:02:42.900> rivet<00:02:43.290> gun<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:44.010> squeeze<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.640> it

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
your rivet gun and squeeze it it

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.559 
your rivet gun and squeeze it it
basically<00:02:45.540> crushes<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:46.410> in<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.590> plastic<00:02:47.569> good

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
basically crushes it in the plastic good

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:49.819 
basically crushes it in the plastic good
thing<00:02:48.720> about<00:02:48.810> rivets<00:02:49.290> is<00:02:49.440> you<00:02:49.560> can<00:02:49.680> always

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
thing about rivets is you can always

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.990 
thing about rivets is you can always
unscrew<00:02:50.610> them<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:51.230> pull<00:02:52.230> them<00:02:52.260> back<00:02:53.130> off<00:02:53.430> me

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
unscrew them and pull them back off me

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.720 
unscrew them and pull them back off me
too<00:02:54.260> on<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.769> other<00:02:55.890> end<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.250> i<00:02:56.310> have<00:02:56.459> no<00:02:56.610> idea

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
too on the other end and i have no idea

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.160 
too on the other end and i have no idea
haven't<00:02:57.000> figured<00:02:57.269> out<00:02:57.360> this<00:02:57.569> part<00:02:57.810> yet<00:02:57.989> but

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
haven't figured out this part yet but

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.930 
haven't figured out this part yet but
basically<00:02:58.530> i'm<00:02:59.010> using<00:02:59.370> this<00:02:59.489> counterbalance

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
basically i'm using this counterbalance

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.509 
basically i'm using this counterbalance
i<00:03:00.390> can<00:03:00.569> slide<00:03:00.840> forward<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.440> backward<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:02.400> the

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
i can slide forward and backward and the

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.199 
i can slide forward and backward and the
reason<00:03:02.849> for<00:03:02.879> that<00:03:03.060> is<00:03:03.860> so<00:03:04.860> as<00:03:05.160> you<00:03:05.489> lean<00:03:05.760> it<00:03:06.000> in

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
reason for that is so as you lean it in

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.309 
reason for that is so as you lean it in
theory<00:03:08.180> which<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.209> not<00:03:09.510> working<00:03:09.840> as<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:09.959> GoPro

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
theory which is not working as a GoPro

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.839 
theory which is not working as a GoPro
is<00:03:10.379> not<00:03:10.590> in<00:03:10.799> you<00:03:10.980> could<00:03:11.129> lean<00:03:11.370> it<00:03:11.579> and<00:03:11.760> you

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
is not in you could lean it and you

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.180 
is not in you could lean it and you
could<00:03:12.060> wiggle<00:03:12.480> around<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:13.200> let<00:03:13.349> the<00:03:13.500> GoPro<00:03:13.950> go

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
could wiggle around and let the GoPro go

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.369 
could wiggle around and let the GoPro go
where<00:03:14.370> you<00:03:14.489> want<00:03:14.700> it<00:03:14.730> to<00:03:14.910> go<00:03:15.090> on<00:03:15.360> top<00:03:16.110> of<00:03:16.260> your

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:16.379 
where you want it to go on top of your

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.819 
where you want it to go on top of your
head<00:03:16.410> so<00:03:17.099> you<00:03:17.630> set<00:03:18.630> this<00:03:18.780> down<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.410> helmet<00:03:19.680> on

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
head so you set this down the helmet on

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:25.849 
head so you set this down the helmet on
probably<00:03:20.670> gonna<00:03:20.760> whack<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.600> ceiling<00:03:24.440> so<00:03:25.440> in

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
probably gonna whack the ceiling so in

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.940 
probably gonna whack the ceiling so in
theory<00:03:26.370> as<00:03:27.049> you<00:03:28.049> lean<00:03:28.260> your<00:03:28.290> head<00:03:28.440> this<00:03:28.680> way

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
theory as you lean your head this way

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.699 
theory as you lean your head this way
the<00:03:29.160> GoPro<00:03:29.519> goes<00:03:29.700> this<00:03:29.849> way<00:03:30.090> as<00:03:30.500> you<00:03:31.500> lean<00:03:31.680> your

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
the GoPro goes this way as you lean your

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.520 
the GoPro goes this way as you lean your
head<00:03:31.859> this<00:03:32.099> way<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.519> GoPro<00:03:32.880> go<00:03:33.060> this<00:03:33.239> way<00:03:33.530> so

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
head this way the GoPro go this way so

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.199 
head this way the GoPro go this way so
then<00:03:34.709> you<00:03:34.829> can<00:03:34.980> kind<00:03:35.220> of<00:03:35.250> control<00:03:35.430> it<00:03:35.970> by<00:03:36.150> the

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
then you can kind of control it by the

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.319 
then you can kind of control it by the
way<00:03:36.420> swing<00:03:36.780> your<00:03:36.930> head<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:38.760> other<00:03:38.940> nice<00:03:39.090> thing

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
way swing your head the other nice thing

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.839 
way swing your head the other nice thing
is<00:03:39.540> is<00:03:39.690> you<00:03:39.870> should<00:03:40.049> angle<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:41.190> camera<00:03:41.220> down

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
is is you should angle the camera down

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.400 
is is you should angle the camera down
far<00:03:42.329> enough<00:03:42.359> so<00:03:42.810> you<00:03:42.870> can<00:03:42.989> see<00:03:43.169> your<00:03:43.290> own

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
far enough so you can see your own

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.990 
far enough so you can see your own
reflection<00:03:43.440> but<00:03:44.130> you<00:03:44.280> really<00:03:44.459> don't<00:03:44.700> want<00:03:44.940> to

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
reflection but you really don't want to

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.330 
reflection but you really don't want to
pick<00:03:45.180> up<00:03:45.359> the<00:03:45.569> mount<00:03:45.840> in<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.139> in<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:47.069> photo

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
pick up the mount in the in the photo

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.759 
pick up the mount in the in the photo
but<00:03:47.970> still<00:03:48.239> as<00:03:48.510> it<00:03:48.720> swings<00:03:48.989> around<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.620> other

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
but still as it swings around the other

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.530 
but still as it swings around the other
nice<00:03:49.980> thing<00:03:50.010> is<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.669> camera<00:03:51.000> can't<00:03:51.239> see<00:03:51.329> the

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
nice thing is the camera can't see the

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.240 
nice thing is the camera can't see the
counterbalance<00:03:52.260> because<00:03:52.590> it's<00:03:52.799> behind<00:03:53.040> your

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
counterbalance because it's behind your

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.430 
counterbalance because it's behind your
head<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.609> that<00:03:54.389> makes<00:03:54.599> it<00:03:54.750> kind<00:03:54.989> of<00:03:55.019> cool<00:03:55.230> too

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
head and that makes it kind of cool too

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.979 
head and that makes it kind of cool too
so<00:03:56.430> now<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:56.819> nice<00:03:57.030> thing<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.540> rivets<00:03:57.840> are

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
so now the nice thing the rivets are

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.330 
so now the nice thing the rivets are
basically<00:03:58.440> permanent<00:03:58.980> so<00:03:59.069> the<00:03:59.190> nice<00:03:59.310> thing

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
basically permanent so the nice thing

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.759 
basically permanent so the nice thing
about<00:03:59.519> this<00:03:59.849> is<00:04:00.139> I'm<00:04:01.139> gonna<00:04:01.290> be<00:04:01.440> able<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:01.650> take

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
about this is I'm gonna be able to take

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.409 
about this is I'm gonna be able to take
the<00:04:01.919> wing<00:04:02.099> nuts<00:04:02.310> as<00:04:02.519> pull<00:04:02.700> that<00:04:02.880> off<00:04:02.910> and<00:04:03.329> then

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:04.819 
the wing nuts as pull that off and then
I'm<00:04:03.510> just<00:04:03.540> gonna<00:04:03.750> look<00:04:03.870> like<00:04:03.930> a<00:04:04.049> complete<00:04:04.410> dork

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829

I'm just gonna look like a complete dork
with<00:04:04.980> a<00:04:05.040> swivel<00:04:05.459> on<00:04:05.579> my<00:04:05.760> head<00:04:06.000> but<00:04:06.959> uh<00:04:07.019> at<00:04:07.799> least

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.150 
helmet of course is to go ride with the
