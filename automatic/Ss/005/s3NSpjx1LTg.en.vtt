00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.879
 the most important thing a human being asks for 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.110
 to pray his life is that he 

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:12.760
 accept jesus as a lord and savior 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.280
 Do you know God is human? 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.070
 a seperation 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.230
 what do we call sin and the only way? 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:24.159
 to overcome this separation is the 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.380
 that the sacrifice was jesus for us 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:27.789
 has accomplished on the cross for himself 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.489
 personally claims 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.749

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:39.399
 what we have to take to have it 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:40.510
 that does not happen automatically 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.489
 does not happen by any 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.500
 rituals but that is one 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:48.309
 volitional decision and you have to do it in the 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.519
