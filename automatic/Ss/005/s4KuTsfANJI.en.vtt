in order for it to like fit into the peg

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.600 
in order for it to like fit into the peg
so<00:01:09.980> I<00:01:10.040> had<00:01:10.250> to<00:01:10.280> do<00:01:10.520> like<00:01:10.820> cut<00:01:11.180> off<00:01:11.390> Dolph<00:01:12.610> eat

pig<00:01:20.030> area<00:01:20.420> and<00:01:20.920> sculpting<00:01:21.920> out<00:01:22.010> of<00:01:22.070> clay<00:01:22.220> so<00:01:22.610> I

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
pig area and sculpting out of clay so I

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.050 
pig area and sculpting out of clay so I
won't<00:01:22.970> show<00:01:23.120> any<00:01:23.330> themes<00:01:23.630> or<00:01:23.810> whatever<00:01:24.110> so

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
you're wondering how in the world i did

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.860 
you're wondering how in the world i did
the<00:01:31.160> tendon<00:01:31.550> engine<00:01:31.970> in<00:01:32.120> the<00:01:32.270> middle<00:01:32.570> of<00:01:32.690> his

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
the tendon engine in the middle of his

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.560 
the tendon engine in the middle of his
body<00:01:33.970> well<00:01:34.970> this<00:01:35.180> is<00:01:35.270> how<00:01:35.420> i<00:01:35.450> did<00:01:35.690> it<00:01:36.040> had<00:01:37.040> to<00:01:37.220> be

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
body well this is how i did it had to be

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.290 
body well this is how i did it had to be
articulate<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:39.200> waist<00:01:39.440> area<00:01:40.090> that's<00:01:41.090> right

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
articulate the waist area that's right

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.840 
articulate the waist area that's right
had<00:01:41.570> to<00:01:41.780> be<00:01:42.050> articulate<00:01:42.710> which<00:01:43.010> means<00:01:43.340> i<00:01:43.580> had

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
had to be articulate which means i had

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.630 
had to be articulate which means i had
to<00:01:44.090> go<00:01:44.900> down<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.500> waist<00:01:45.710> area<00:01:45.979> so<00:01:46.310> it<00:01:46.369> would

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
to go down the waist area so it would

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.359 
to go down the waist area so it would
not<00:01:46.910> move<00:01:47.119> so<00:01:47.960> there<00:01:48.170> is<00:01:48.260> no<00:01:48.470> articulation<00:01:49.130> in

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
not move so there is no articulation in

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.969 
not move so there is no articulation in
the<00:01:49.490> waist<00:01:49.729> area<00:01:49.970> and<00:01:50.410> what<00:01:51.410> I<00:01:51.440> did<00:01:51.740> was<00:01:51.770> a

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
the waist area and what I did was a

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.060 
the waist area and what I did was a
scope<00:01:53.080> the<00:01:54.080> tendon<00:01:54.470> engine<00:01:55.330> to<00:01:56.330> his<00:01:56.510> body<00:01:56.720> and

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
scope the tendon engine to his body and

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.370 
scope the tendon engine to his body and
voila<00:01:58.070> there<00:01:58.430> he<00:01:58.550> goes<00:01:58.729> and<00:01:59.030> i'ma<00:01:59.750> tell<00:02:00.110> you

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
voila there he goes and i'ma tell you

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.870 
voila there he goes and i'ma tell you
that<00:02:01.250> was<00:02:01.820> a<00:02:02.090> pain<00:02:02.390> and<00:02:02.900> add<00:02:03.050> to<00:02:03.320> my<00:02:03.470> through

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
that was a pain and add to my through

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.880 
that was a pain and add to my through
the<00:02:04.880> tendon<00:02:05.240> engine<00:02:05.539> was<00:02:05.660> seriously<00:02:06.110> painting

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
the tendon engine was seriously painting

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.770 
the tendon engine was seriously painting
the<00:02:06.979> anthemic<00:02:07.399> really<00:02:08.830> very<00:02:09.830> crazy<00:02:10.160> but<00:02:10.780> it's

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
the anthemic really very crazy but it's

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.860 
the anthemic really very crazy but it's
possible<00:02:12.320> that<00:02:12.440> i<00:02:12.590> made<00:02:12.890> that<00:02:13.450> but<00:02:14.450> this<00:02:14.660> one

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
possible that i made that but this one

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.610 
possible that i made that but this one
this<00:02:15.020> is<00:02:15.080> just<00:02:15.380> like<00:02:15.560> a<00:02:16.540> test<00:02:17.540> subject<00:02:17.870> this<00:02:18.470> is

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
this is just like a test subject this is

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.900 
this is just like a test subject this is
like<00:02:18.800> a<00:02:19.010> test<00:02:19.510> test<00:02:20.510> customer<00:02:21.640> because<00:02:22.640> i

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
like a test test customer because i

wanted to like do more detail into the

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.460 
wanted to like do more detail into the
pain<00:02:24.920> and<00:02:25.910> probably<00:02:26.720> do<00:02:26.930> a<00:02:26.960> little<00:02:27.140> bit<00:02:27.290> more

work<00:02:27.530> on<00:02:28.040> that<00:02:28.340> hand<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.760> engine<00:02:29.650> as<00:02:30.650> you<00:02:30.890> can

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
work on that hand and engine as you can

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.750 
work on that hand and engine as you can
see<00:02:31.280> so<00:02:31.840> here<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:33.020> is<00:02:33.140> it's<00:02:33.530> just<00:02:33.860> I<00:02:34.220> might<00:02:34.580> make

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
see so here it is it's just I might make
