00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.850
 [Music] 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.380
 hi all guys i've just been 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.139
 to the appointment with sony in which it is me 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:15.039
 the last guardian of was shown 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.630
 guardian who was obviously taken in 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.280
 consideration as one of the titles not 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.040
 announced but we all know it is 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.920
 arrived after years of silence 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.470
 there was smoked ueda in the room that has ha 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.520
 played by the guard's boredom then 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.730
 it was a hands off 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.280
 we could not prove it by hand but 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.840
 nevertheless, I can already do it 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.800
 ensure that it is one of those 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:41.320
 really exciting and impactful titles 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.590
 they showed us especially 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:48.190
 the part that was shown during the 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:51.579
 sony conference is more than a few extras 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.310
 which I will now tell you first 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:57.550
 it was a section taken from the side 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:00.070
 central to the game so we were towards 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.770
 the goal has been more or less told to us 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.490
 meanwhile very little regarding 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.799
 the history the only useful information that 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.470
 we have been given is that the boy is the 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.909
 protagonism of the two protagonists 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.010
 of the adventure because the other one 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.210
 protagonist and knit the huge beast 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:21.210
 that you saw during the conference 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.250
 let's say the child was kidnapped into 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.869
 mysterious circumstances so no one knows 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.210
 nothing is known why it is 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.190
 actually arrived in what 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.710
 seems a very similar scenario to 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.420
 the one seen in ico as already mentioned 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.630
 it seemed almost to me during the conference 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.369
 that it was the outside of the fortress 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.770
 that we have seen just one though 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.990
 the scaffolding was missing, obviously not me 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:48.100
 imbalance regarding the story 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:51.549
 line between the coaches knows where 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.080
 colossus is this new chapter but vi 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.439
 I can tell right away that the 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.790
 similarity of the setting also of 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:03.520
 everything around and the game 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.840
 really remembers a lot of ico and i 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.310
 developers have kept us at 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.170
 emphasize that 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.869
 it is a commission of the elements 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.840
 best seen in ico and shadow of the 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.450
 colossus was still there is a very strong 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.410
 emphasis on mutual collaboration of 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.410
 two characters 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:25.540
 you are unique was the main character 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.769
 to have we say an advantage 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.989
 compared to york it had to be 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.250
 continuously helped here is more or less 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.769
 the opposite 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.410
 you can control the baby but 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.810
 obviously the creature being much more 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.680
 big and stronger 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.140
 can help you a lot during the 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.769
 stages of exploration how the 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.209
 gameplay 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:52.060
 the gameplay works in such a way that the 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:55.660
 mutual collaboration is always put 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.880
 in the center of attention in substance 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.470
 in the part that was shown to us and 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.260
 the little man enters into a kind 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.120
 I don't know if a castle but a secret one 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.519
 however he enters a room where he is 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.329
 find this this beast a beast 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.769
 who is injured by some arrows and 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:14.859
 they are probably ancient wounds 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.329
 we approach and come close 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:19.600
 of the beast that behaves exactly 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:22.000
 like how a puppy you will almost have 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.250
 train extracts of arrows from his 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.370
 body and he like a sudden sense 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.890
 of gratitude makes you get on your back 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.810
 so you can climb on it 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.799
 what for all intents and purposes a kind 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.000
 however, we are saying colossus friend 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:40.269
 quite similar to shadow of the 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.790
 colossus this climbing mechanic 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:46.000
 and over the colossus and you will have to do it 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.660
 very very often when you go up three 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.670
 co 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.970
 you will be able to reach places that 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.640
 otherwise you can't reach in 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.670
 any way we have seen 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.470
 above all that it is to this role both 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.170
 A smoking question was also asked 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.730
 see how intelligence behaves 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:10.270
 artificial of tricolor well 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:13.150
 artificial intelligence will be in 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:16.030
 will develop as the course progresses 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:20.260
 play because the child and will suggest i 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:22.060
 movements to do and the beast will learn 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.690
 then gradually at the beginning of the game 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:28.360
 you will have a relationship that is not exactly 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.820
 of extreme confidence but gradually over the course 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.540
 of the game when you acquire more 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.700
 confidence inevitably the beast there 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.650
 will follow is become born you will become very 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.770
 friends and then the report if you will reinforce 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:44.650
 and this is probably one of the 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.620
 more emotional aspects of the title 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:51.040
 other interesting thing the child has to 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.650
 also solve puzzles to help 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.990
 the beast so it's not just about 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.570
 one of a relationship in which the child is 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.910
 weaker must lean on tricot 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.760
 also trigo will need you 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:08.320
 other very important things we have seen 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.730
 that there are some objects on the sui 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.390
 scenarios that look a little like that 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:15.970
 those Indian dream catchers in the moment 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:18.010
 in which tricot sees his eyes 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.140
 they suddenly turn red and freeze 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.930
 you can't go on, it's up to you 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:27.820
 and particular to the child to free the 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:31.210
 road and to continue all in all is a 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:34.360
 title that really impressed me too 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.490
 technically and was also explained to us 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.220
 because it was delayed so much 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:42.970
 development and had to arrive initially 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:45.130
 on more on ps3 then various technical problems e 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.860
 management have forced the team to 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.610
 development to arrive directly on ps 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.220
 4 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.200
 their goal is to release 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.360
 the team to release the title in the 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.620
 during 2016, however, they did not seem to me 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.470
 very safe 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.870
 I mean we certainly won't have to 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.460
 wait another six years for that 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.190
 certainly not because the bild that there is 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:10.600
 was shown was already mature enough 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:13.180
 in short, if we want to say this really 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.990
 and very impressive so far of the asd 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:20.290
 guardian and is one of those titles on which 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:23.800
 definitely sony must aim and 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:25.780
 probably the users after this 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.330
 this preview I'm doing to you vi 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.340
 I can assure you that it is a title that 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.250
 you will have to follow in particular 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.150
 Well for the moment I have concluded there 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.660
 see you next time 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.660
 Hello
