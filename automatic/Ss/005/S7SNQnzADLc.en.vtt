00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
so this is the partner 4x4 fountain one

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.740 
so this is the partner 4x4 fountain one
two<00:00:10.080> three<00:00:10.559> four<00:00:10.920> one<00:00:11.370> two<00:00:11.730> three<00:00:11.759> four<00:00:12.300> it's

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
two three four one two three four it's

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.140 
two three four one two three four it's
four<00:00:12.809> beats<00:00:13.230> on<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.380> other<00:00:13.500> side<00:00:14.150> depending

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
four beats on the other side depending

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.840 
four beats on the other side depending
on<00:00:15.210> how<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:15.360> count<00:00:15.540> beats<00:00:16.460> it's<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.609> fun

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
on how you count beats it's a fun

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.849 
on how you count beats it's a fun
pattern<00:00:18.060> because<00:00:18.539> it<00:00:18.869> gives<00:00:19.260> you<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.500> lot<00:00:19.830> of

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
pattern because it gives you a lot of

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.470 
pattern because it gives you a lot of
freedom<00:00:20.250> in<00:00:20.279> terms<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.699> being<00:00:20.880> able<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.150> change

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
freedom in terms of being able to change

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.550 
freedom in terms of being able to change
positions<00:00:22.640> so<00:00:23.640> G<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.090> can<00:00:24.449> step<00:00:25.109> all<00:00:25.289> around

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
positions so G and I can step all around

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.359 
positions so G and I can step all around
each<00:00:25.710> other<00:00:26.359> which<00:00:27.560> has<00:00:28.560> huge<00:00:28.740> potential<00:00:29.189> for

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
each other which has huge potential for

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.919 
each other which has huge potential for
performing<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.090> all<00:00:30.150> kinds<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.539> fun<00:00:30.779> stuff

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
performing and all kinds of fun stuff

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.549 
performing and all kinds of fun stuff
with<00:00:31.230> multiple<00:00:31.890> partners<00:00:33.230> multiple<00:00:34.230> partners

with multiple partners multiple partners

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.799 
with multiple partners multiple partners
in<00:00:35.210> place<00:00:37.910> it's<00:00:38.910> also<00:00:39.149> an<00:00:39.360> interesting

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
in place it's also an interesting

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.709 
in place it's also an interesting
pattern<00:00:39.989> because<00:00:40.730> you<00:00:41.730> can't<00:00:42.000> do<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.420> on

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
pattern because you can't do this on

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.410 
pattern because you can't do this on
your<00:00:42.930> own<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.500> is<00:00:43.649> only<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:44.160> pattern<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.149> can

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
your own this is only a pattern you can

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.520 
your own this is only a pattern you can
you<00:00:46.200> can<00:00:46.410> do<00:00:46.559> with<00:00:46.890> with<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> partner<00:00:48.289> but<00:00:49.289> it's

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
you can do with with a partner but it's

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.590 
you can do with with a partner but it's
not<00:00:49.739> actually<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.430> hard<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.940> learn<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.390> to

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
not actually so hard to learn and to

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.689 
not actually so hard to learn and to
prove<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:51.960> I'm<00:00:52.770> going<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.160> get<00:00:53.250> Karen<00:00:53.610> to

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
prove that I'm going to get Karen to

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.860 
prove that I'm going to get Karen to
come<00:00:53.730> in

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.920 

and<00:00:56.990> first<00:00:57.920> I'll<00:00:58.550> show<00:00:58.580> you<00:00:58.880> a<00:00:59.060> really<00:00:59.510> kind<00:00:59.840> of

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
and first I'll show you a really kind of

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.200 
and first I'll show you a really kind of
a<00:01:00.220> shortcut<00:01:01.220> to<00:01:01.490> showing<00:01:01.670> it<00:01:01.820> somebody<00:01:02.150> who

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
a shortcut to showing it somebody who

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.510 
a shortcut to showing it somebody who
doesn't<00:01:02.360> know<00:01:02.660> yet<00:01:02.870> so<00:01:03.800> you<00:01:03.860> can<00:01:04.130> only<00:01:04.250> do<00:01:04.430> this

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:04.520 
doesn't know yet so you can only do this

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.980 
doesn't know yet so you can only do this
if<00:01:04.580> you<00:01:04.760> know<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.150> pattern<00:01:05.480> well<00:01:05.630> and<00:01:05.870> then

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
if you know the pattern well and then

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.480 
if you know the pattern well and then
we'll<00:01:06.140> show<00:01:06.320> you<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:06.470> slow<00:01:06.830> way<00:01:07.070> if<00:01:07.340> you're

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
we'll show you the slow way if you're

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.880 
we'll show you the slow way if you're
learning<00:01:07.760> it<00:01:07.850> on<00:01:08.090> your<00:01:08.450> own<00:01:08.570> but<00:01:08.750> you<00:01:09.380> look<00:01:09.770> at

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
learning it on your own but you look at

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.800 
learning it on your own but you look at
your<00:01:10.100> your<00:01:10.490> wonderful<00:01:10.850> you<00:01:11.420> know<00:01:11.450> friend

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
your your wonderful you know friend

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.060 
your your wonderful you know friend
you're<00:01:11.990> going<00:01:12.110> to<00:01:12.170> show<00:01:12.350> this<00:01:12.500> to<00:01:12.650> and<00:01:12.830> you<00:01:12.890> say

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
you're going to show this to and you say

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.580 
you're going to show this to and you say
I<00:01:13.310> put<00:01:13.460> your<00:01:13.550> right<00:01:13.670> foot<00:01:13.700> forwards<00:01:14.410> but<00:01:15.410> the

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
I put your right foot forwards but the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.380 
I put your right foot forwards but the
step<00:01:15.800> got<00:01:16.040> a<00:01:16.070> little<00:01:16.220> back<00:01:16.340> to<00:01:16.370> the<00:01:16.550> back<00:01:16.730> so

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
step got a little back to the back so

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.460 
step got a little back to the back so
there's<00:01:17.600> a<00:01:17.690> little<00:01:17.960> bit<00:01:18.050> of<00:01:18.080> space<00:01:18.410> between

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
there's a little bit of space between

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.100 
there's a little bit of space between
your<00:01:19.190> feet<00:01:19.370> because<00:01:19.610> you<00:01:19.730> need<00:01:19.910> room<00:01:20.210> for<00:01:21.020> the

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
your feet because you need room for the

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.380 
your feet because you need room for the
poi<00:01:21.290> to<00:01:21.470> pass<00:01:21.650> through<00:01:21.980> here<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:23.120> then<00:01:23.330> you

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
poi to pass through here and then you

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.070 
poi to pass through here and then you
tell<00:01:23.600> them<00:01:23.780> I<00:01:23.930> spin<00:01:24.350> your<00:01:24.470> point<00:01:24.650> forwards

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
tell them I spin your point forwards

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.450 
tell them I spin your point forwards
cross<00:01:27.080> between<00:01:27.350> us<00:01:27.680> cross<00:01:28.040> through<00:01:28.370> the

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
cross between us cross through the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.670 
cross between us cross through the
bottom<00:01:28.730> button<00:01:29.479> through<00:01:29.660> the<00:01:29.750> bottom<00:01:30.020> cross

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
bottom button through the bottom cross

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.800 
bottom button through the bottom cross
point<00:01:30.920> it<00:01:30.979> down<00:01:31.100> or<00:01:31.220> if<00:01:31.280> you<00:01:31.400> yep<00:01:31.570> so<00:01:32.570> you<00:01:32.600> can

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
point it down or if you yep so you can

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.650 
point it down or if you yep so you can
cross<00:01:32.990> to<00:01:33.050> this<00:01:33.320> so<00:01:33.680> you<00:01:33.740> can<00:01:33.860> say<00:01:34.010> over<00:01:34.190> here

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
cross to this so you can say over here

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.530 
cross to this so you can say over here
and<00:01:35.660> cross<00:01:35.840> back<00:01:36.080> over<00:01:37.060> there<00:01:38.060> cross<00:01:38.330> over

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
and cross back over there cross over

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.460 
and cross back over there cross over
here<00:01:39.430> cross<00:01:40.430> back<00:01:41.140> so<00:01:42.140> it's<00:01:42.229> like<00:01:42.320> this<00:01:42.410> a

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
here cross back so it's like this a

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.719 
here cross back so it's like this a
cross<00:01:42.770> point<00:01:43.040> down<00:01:43.160> at<00:01:43.250> the<00:01:43.310> ground<00:01:43.520> you<00:01:43.670> can

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
cross point down at the ground you can

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.630 
cross point down at the ground you can
cross<00:01:43.970> back<00:01:44.150> and<00:01:44.330> forth<00:01:44.479> and<00:01:45.170> then<00:01:46.070> even<00:01:46.369> I<00:01:46.430> put

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
cross back and forth and then even I put

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.609 
cross back and forth and then even I put
my<00:01:46.760> arm<00:01:47.030> here<00:01:47.570> you<00:01:47.720> can<00:01:47.840> cross<00:01:47.990> under<00:01:48.259> my<00:01:48.380> arm

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
my arm here you can cross under my arm

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.210 
my arm here you can cross under my arm
to<00:01:49.430> get<00:01:49.580> to<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:49.790> other<00:01:49.910> side<00:01:50.119> and<00:01:50.390> back<00:01:51.220> right

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
to get to the other side and back right

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.200 
to get to the other side and back right
again<00:01:53.060> right<00:01:54.050> so<00:01:54.640> first<00:01:55.640> all<00:01:55.820> you<00:01:55.850> need<00:01:56.060> to<00:01:56.119> do

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
again right so first all you need to do

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.590 
again right so first all you need to do
is<00:01:56.300> tell<00:01:56.869> your<00:01:56.960> partner<00:01:57.259> cross<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:57.800> hold<00:01:57.950> and

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
then you lift the arm up no

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.040 
then you lift the arm up no
and<00:02:03.340> you<00:02:03.490> tell<00:02:03.700> them<00:02:03.790> on<00:02:04.060> to<00:02:04.360> go<00:02:04.510> over<00:02:04.690> the<00:02:04.810> top

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
and you tell them on to go over the top

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.650 
and you tell them on to go over the top
you<00:02:05.470> lead<00:02:05.770> them<00:02:06.040> back<00:02:07.000> here

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
you lead them back here

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.510 
you lead them back here
so<00:02:08.590> Karen<00:02:09.220> crosses<00:02:09.640> through<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:09.940> bottom<00:02:10.210> and

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
so Karen crosses through the bottom and

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.430 
so Karen crosses through the bottom and
Karen<00:02:12.520> waits<00:02:12.760> for<00:02:13.090> me<00:02:13.270> to<00:02:13.630> go<00:02:13.900> over<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.230> top

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
Karen waits for me to go over the top

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.210 
Karen waits for me to go over the top
she<00:02:15.370> goes<00:02:15.520> through<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.820> bottom<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:17.220> she

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
she goes through the bottom and she

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.800 
she goes through the bottom and she
waits<00:02:18.400> for<00:02:18.700> me<00:02:18.820> to<00:02:19.090> take<00:02:19.390> her<00:02:19.510> over<00:02:19.600> the<00:02:19.750> top

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
waits for me to take her over the top

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.370 
waits for me to take her over the top
through<00:02:20.610> yeah<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:21.820> now<00:02:22.300> what<00:02:22.510> you<00:02:22.900> tell<00:02:23.260> her

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
through yeah and now what you tell her

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.380 
through yeah and now what you tell her
that<00:02:23.410> cross<00:02:23.920> right<00:02:24.130> away<00:02:24.370> then<00:02:24.910> right<00:02:25.270> away

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
that cross right away then right away

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.260 
that cross right away then right away
cross<00:02:25.720> and<00:02:26.260> then<00:02:26.680> I<00:02:26.800> take<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:27.520> and<00:02:27.730> right<00:02:28.030> away

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
cross and then I take you and right away

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.990 
cross and then I take you and right away
cross<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.250> I<00:02:30.250> take<00:02:30.640> you<00:02:30.820> right<00:02:30.850> away<00:02:31.540> cross

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
cross and I take you right away cross

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.640 
cross and I take you right away cross
wait<00:02:34.000> for<00:02:34.180> me<00:02:34.270> and<00:02:34.450> then<00:02:34.630> right<00:02:34.930> away<00:02:35.110> cross

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
wait for me and then right away cross

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.410 
wait for me and then right away cross
and<00:02:35.980> I<00:02:36.700> go<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:37.390> right<00:02:37.930> away<00:02:38.140> cross<00:02:38.710> and<00:02:39.070> I<00:02:39.910> go

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
and I go and right away cross and I go

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.160 
and I go and right away cross and I go
and<00:02:40.630> right<00:02:41.200> away<00:02:41.440> cross<00:02:42.010> and<00:02:42.420> mean<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:43.690> right

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
and right away cross and mean and right

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.220 
and right away cross and mean and right
away<00:02:44.380> cross<00:02:44.860> and<00:02:45.240> meet<00:02:46.240> and<00:02:47.140> cross<00:02:47.500> and<00:02:48.430> and

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
away cross and meet and cross and and

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.680 
away cross and meet and cross and and
that<00:02:50.230> is<00:02:50.590> a<00:02:51.250> really<00:02:51.640> nice<00:02:51.790> shortcut<00:02:52.450> way<00:02:52.630> to

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
that is a really nice shortcut way to

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:59.900 
that is a really nice shortcut way to
get<00:02:52.930> somebody<00:02:53.350> into<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.100> pattern

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.670 

the<00:03:00.420> next<00:03:00.870> step<00:03:01.050> is<00:03:01.200> learning<00:03:01.380> how<00:03:01.650> to

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
the next step is learning how to

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.860 
the next step is learning how to
initiate<00:03:02.160> it<00:03:02.190> with<00:03:02.460> boy<00:03:02.820> and<00:03:03.180> for<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:03.630> you'd

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
initiate it with boy and for that you'd

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.710 
initiate it with boy and for that you'd
come<00:03:04.080> back<00:03:04.290> so<00:03:04.730> stay<00:03:05.730> there<00:03:06.030> stay<00:03:06.480> back<00:03:06.630> and

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
come back so stay there stay back and

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.760 
come back so stay there stay back and
outside<00:03:07.020> awesome

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
outside awesome

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.890 
outside awesome
and<00:03:08.400> then<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:08.850> explain<00:03:09.270> initiation

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
and then you explain initiation

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.530 
and then you explain initiation
initiation<00:03:10.770> means<00:03:10.980> I'm<00:03:11.610> going<00:03:11.970> to<00:03:12.030> cross<00:03:12.300> in

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
initiation means I'm going to cross in

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.630 
initiation means I'm going to cross in
the<00:03:12.630> heat<00:03:12.840> this<00:03:12.960> space<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.620> that's<00:03:13.890> her<00:03:14.370> cue

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
the heat this space and that's her cue

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.150 
the heat this space and that's her cue
to<00:03:14.820> cross<00:03:15.000> under<00:03:15.270> my<00:03:15.480> arm<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:15.990> this<00:03:16.860> is<00:03:17.010> where

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
to cross under my arm and this is where

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.380 
to cross under my arm and this is where
we<00:03:17.280> need<00:03:17.310> some<00:03:17.550> communication<00:03:17.700> I'm<00:03:18.180> going<00:03:18.330> to

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
we need some communication I'm going to

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.120 
we need some communication I'm going to
go<00:03:18.480> five<00:03:19.020> six<00:03:19.770> seven<00:03:20.700> eight<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:21.360> go<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.230> then

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
go five six seven eight and go and then

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.589 
go five six seven eight and go and then
we're<00:03:23.700> in<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.000> pattern

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.599 

and<00:03:29.109> then<00:03:29.230> once<00:03:29.409> you<00:03:29.530> got<00:03:29.680> that<00:03:29.920> working<00:03:30.340> on

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
and then once you got that working on

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.750 
and then once you got that working on
the<00:03:30.730> next<00:03:30.909> one<00:03:31.030> stay<00:03:31.540> back<00:03:31.780> in<00:03:31.930> your<00:03:32.079> side<00:03:32.760> once

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
the next one stay back in your side once

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.830 
the next one stay back in your side once
that's<00:03:34.060> working<00:03:34.420> you<00:03:34.480> can<00:03:34.569> eventually

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
that's working you can eventually

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.839 
that's working you can eventually
explain<00:03:35.230> that<00:03:35.530> she<00:03:36.069> could<00:03:36.280> initiate<00:03:36.670> by

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
explain that she could initiate by

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:38.729 
explain that she could initiate by
crossing<00:03:37.329> at<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.510> top<00:03:37.749> over<00:03:38.049> to<00:03:38.230> me<00:03:38.379> and<00:03:38.620> then

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
crossing at the top over to me and then

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.030 
crossing at the top over to me and then
I<00:03:38.920> take<00:03:39.189> her<00:03:39.370> in<00:03:39.489> that<00:03:39.670> direction<00:03:40.260> five<00:03:41.260> six

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
I take her in that direction five six

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.539 
I take her in that direction five six
seven<00:03:42.999> eight<00:03:43.379> and<00:03:44.379> then<00:03:44.650> and<00:03:44.859> then<00:03:45.250> again

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
seven eight and then and then again

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.720 
seven eight and then and then again
we're<00:03:45.819> in<00:03:45.939> the<00:03:45.969> same<00:03:46.299> pattern

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.300 

so<00:03:51.300> this<00:03:51.540> requires<00:03:51.810> you<00:03:52.620> know<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.920> person

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
so this requires you know the person

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.920 
so this requires you know the person
leading<00:03:53.550> the<00:03:53.760> to<00:03:54.150> be<00:03:54.270> familiar<00:03:54.480> with<00:03:54.810> the

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
leading the to be familiar with the

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.809 
leading the to be familiar with the
pattern<00:03:55.290> and<00:03:55.890> then<00:03:56.190> it's<00:03:56.370> just<00:03:56.430> a<00:03:56.550> great<00:03:56.700> way

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
pattern and then it's just a great way

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.009 
pattern and then it's just a great way
to<00:03:56.849> spread<00:03:57.209> it<00:03:57.330> you<00:03:57.420> can<00:03:57.569> just<00:03:57.750> attack

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
to spread it you can just attack

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.540 
to spread it you can just attack
somebody<00:03:58.410> and<00:03:58.709> in<00:03:58.830> five<00:03:59.069> minutes<00:03:59.250> you've<00:03:59.519> got

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
somebody and in five minutes you've got

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.580 
somebody and in five minutes you've got
them<00:03:59.819> doing<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.090> basic<00:04:00.450> pattern<00:04:00.720> if<00:04:00.840> they

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
them doing the basic pattern if they

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.140 
them doing the basic pattern if they
know<00:04:01.739> POI<00:04:01.980> if<00:04:02.250> they<00:04:02.400> know<00:04:02.550> you<00:04:02.879> know<00:04:02.970> the

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
know POI if they know you know the

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.520 
know POI if they know you know the
weaves<00:04:03.330> and<00:04:03.599> all<00:04:03.690> that<00:04:03.840> all<00:04:03.959> the<00:04:04.200> basics

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
weaves and all that all the basics

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.940 
weaves and all that all the basics
already<00:04:04.910> go<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.900> next<00:04:07.170> step<00:04:07.440> after<00:04:07.590> that<00:04:07.769> is

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
already go the next step after that is

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.440 
already go the next step after that is
to<00:04:08.220> learn<00:04:08.519> everything<00:04:08.849> once<00:04:09.150> you<00:04:09.209> got<00:04:09.330> them

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
to learn everything once you got them

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.850 
to learn everything once you got them
going<00:04:09.569> that<00:04:09.840> way<00:04:10.050> you<00:04:10.110> can<00:04:10.470> initiate<00:04:10.650> the

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
going that way you can initiate the

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.920 
going that way you can initiate the
process<00:04:11.040> of<00:04:11.340> learning<00:04:11.489> everything<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:12.720> other

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
process of learning everything the other

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.849 
process of learning everything the other
way<00:04:13.140> so<00:04:13.200> if<00:04:13.410> she<00:04:13.590> was<00:04:13.709> spinning<00:04:13.920> backwards<00:04:15.859> now

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
way so if she was spinning backwards now

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.400 
way so if she was spinning backwards now
she<00:04:16.919> can<00:04:17.459> cross<00:04:17.700> at<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:17.970> top<00:04:18.269> to<00:04:19.200> the<00:04:19.290> other

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
she can cross at the top to the other

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.330 
she can cross at the top to the other
side<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:20.239> back<00:04:21.290> yeah<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:22.560> even<00:04:22.860> if<00:04:22.919> my<00:04:23.010> arm<00:04:23.220> is

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
side and back yeah and even if my arm is

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.550 
side and back yeah and even if my arm is
here<00:04:23.520> she<00:04:23.639> can<00:04:23.760> cross<00:04:24.000> like<00:04:24.660> this<00:04:24.930> over<00:04:25.229> my<00:04:25.350> arm

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
here she can cross like this over my arm

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.000 
here she can cross like this over my arm
and<00:04:25.710> back<00:04:26.240> yep<00:04:27.240> and<00:04:27.750> then<00:04:28.229> same<00:04:28.560> thing<00:04:28.590> she

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
and back yep and then same thing she

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.930 
and back yep and then same thing she
crosses<00:04:29.220> over<00:04:29.900> and<00:04:30.900> in<00:04:31.050> this<00:04:31.200> one<00:04:31.500> I<00:04:31.800> lead<00:04:32.790> her

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
crosses over and in this one I lead her

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.820 
crosses over and in this one I lead her
through<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.419> bottom<00:04:33.840> and<00:04:34.080> then<00:04:34.500> she<00:04:34.620> crosses

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
through the bottom and then she crosses

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.540 
through the bottom and then she crosses
over<00:04:35.190> the<00:04:35.280> top<00:04:36.020> you<00:04:37.020> cross<00:04:37.350> and<00:04:37.680> then<00:04:37.950> I<00:04:38.220> lead

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
over the top you cross and then I lead

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.120 
over the top you cross and then I lead
her<00:04:38.790> through<00:04:39.060> the<00:04:39.570> bottom<00:04:39.840> so<00:04:40.650> then<00:04:40.800> it<00:04:41.010> goes

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
her through the bottom so then it goes

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.320 
her through the bottom so then it goes
over<00:04:41.820> and<00:04:42.979> I'll<00:04:43.979> it<00:04:44.250> in<00:04:44.400> and<00:04:44.550> right<00:04:44.700> away<00:04:44.820> over

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
over and I'll it in and right away over

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.790 
over and I'll it in and right away over
I<00:04:45.979> lead<00:04:46.979> right<00:04:47.310> away<00:04:47.550> over<00:04:48.060> I<00:04:48.500> leave<00:04:49.500> right

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
I lead right away over I leave right

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.510 
I lead right away over I leave right
away<00:04:50.160> over<00:04:50.760> I<00:04:51.229> lead<00:04:52.229> right<00:04:52.560> away<00:04:52.740> over

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
away over I lead right away over

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.400 
away over I lead right away over
I<00:04:53.960> lead<00:04:54.960> and<00:04:55.229> you<00:04:55.830> leave<00:04:56.160> and<00:04:56.400> I<00:04:56.970> lead<00:04:57.450> and<00:04:57.720> you

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
I lead and you leave and I lead and you

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:06.740 
I lead and you leave and I lead and you
meet<00:04:58.770> and<00:04:59.430> I<00:04:59.669> leave<00:05:01.400> I<00:05:02.400> leave<00:05:03.770> so<00:05:04.880> it's<00:05:05.880> a<00:05:06.090> it's

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
meet and I leave I leave so it's a it's

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.200 
meet and I leave I leave so it's a it's
really<00:05:07.080> great<00:05:07.229> to<00:05:07.260> share<00:05:07.500> this<00:05:07.740> right<00:05:08.210> once

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
really great to share this right once

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.940 
really great to share this right once
you've<00:05:09.450> started<00:05:09.750> finding<00:05:10.229> a<00:05:10.320> pattern<00:05:10.560> let's

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
you've started finding a pattern let's

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.129 
you've started finding a pattern let's
come<00:05:11.190> back<00:05:11.300> to<00:05:12.300> the<00:05:12.389> first<00:05:12.690> one<00:05:12.870> where<00:05:13.050> you're

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
come back to the first one where you're

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.520 
come back to the first one where you're
spinning<00:05:13.320> forwards<00:05:14.750> once<00:05:15.750> you<00:05:15.900> basically<00:05:16.350> got

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
spinning forwards once you basically got

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.529 
spinning forwards once you basically got
the<00:05:16.590> pattern<00:05:17.100> and<00:05:17.250> all<00:05:17.880> in<00:05:18.000> the<00:05:18.090> shed

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:18.539 
the pattern and all in the shed

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:22.370 
the pattern and all in the shed
five<00:05:19.020> six<00:05:19.710> seven<00:05:20.430> eight

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
five six seven eight

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.710 
five six seven eight
the<00:05:22.920> next<00:05:23.280> step<00:05:23.490> to<00:05:23.520> make<00:05:23.790> it<00:05:23.910> smooth<00:05:24.240> is<00:05:24.600> on

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 
the next step to make it smooth is on

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.210 
the next step to make it smooth is on
each<00:05:24.990> side<00:05:25.320> there's<00:05:25.560> more<00:05:25.710> where<00:05:25.770> the<00:05:25.890> arms

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
each side there's more where the arms

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.580 
each side there's more where the arms
unwind<00:05:26.790> you<00:05:27.300> start<00:05:27.540> exaggerating<00:05:28.230> that<00:05:28.350> into

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
unwind you start exaggerating that into

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:34.250 
unwind you start exaggerating that into
an<00:05:28.680> extension<00:05:29.070> big<00:05:30.060> arm<00:05:30.650> big<00:05:31.650> arm<00:05:32.240> big<00:05:33.240> arm<00:05:33.600> and

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
an extension big arm big arm big arm and

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.300 
an extension big arm big arm big arm and
once<00:05:35.220> you've<00:05:35.370> got<00:05:35.550> this<00:05:35.820> it<00:05:36.030> opens<00:05:36.330> and<00:05:36.900> hooks

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
once you've got this it opens and hooks

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.810 
once you've got this it opens and hooks
opens<00:05:38.310> and<00:05:38.610> hooks<00:05:39.050> opens<00:05:40.050> goes<00:05:40.320> over<00:05:40.920> opens

opens and hooks opens goes over opens

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.040 
opens and hooks opens goes over opens
goes<00:05:42.150> under<00:05:42.720> open<00:05:43.500> go<00:05:43.770> over<00:05:44.370> open<00:05:45.270> go<00:05:45.480> under

open<00:05:46.890> go<00:05:47.130> over<00:05:47.640> that's<00:05:48.390> when<00:05:48.810> the<00:05:48.990> rhythm<00:05:49.440> will

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
open go over that's when the rhythm will

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.010 
open go over that's when the rhythm will
really<00:05:50.010> come<00:05:50.220> into<00:05:50.370> your<00:05:50.550> body<00:05:50.810> the<00:05:51.810> whole

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
really come into your body the whole

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.110 
really come into your body the whole
pattern<00:05:52.410> will<00:05:52.680> make<00:05:52.860> sense<00:05:53.310> once<00:05:53.790> you<00:05:53.970> can

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
pattern will make sense once you can

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.330 
pattern will make sense once you can
find<00:05:54.360> this<00:05:54.570> then<00:05:55.290> when<00:05:55.440> you<00:05:55.500> go<00:05:55.590> back<00:05:55.620> to<00:05:55.800> small

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
find this then when you go back to small

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.480 
find this then when you go back to small
and<00:05:56.990> you'll<00:05:57.990> find<00:05:58.230> it<00:05:58.380> much<00:05:58.560> easier<00:05:58.800> to<00:05:59.250> stay

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
and you'll find it much easier to stay

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.010 
and you'll find it much easier to stay
in<00:05:59.640> a<00:05:59.730> really<00:06:00.030> nice<00:06:00.150> split<00:06:00.570> time<00:06:00.750> with<00:06:00.780> your

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
in a really nice split time with your

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.320 
in a really nice split time with your
partner
