00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.820
 find the chevrolet brand know most of the model sastre matties 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.859
 nevertheless they still have other segments 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.680
 A few years ago the race was introduced as a competitor 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.910
 for example from the volkswagen golf after there it is not that great with it 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.230
 we are here today with the new one 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.710
 to drive to avenio 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.010
 which comes in two versions the Netherlands work 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.270
 and if they are then they are not expected so much from the logical because 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.330
 The Netherlands is now even the sheet pile 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.020
 We drive especially for everyone who thinks that Wijnaldum Dekker is a luxury car 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.420
 now taken from the basic engine and that as the implementation 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.610
 with wild walking 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.210
 black door handles and then a point you know under the hood but we are 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.210
 curious 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.700
 or 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.860
 Hey 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.070
 I have a bit of a problem with you 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.170
 the fivefold 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.869
 on the road there are the plates of the best original design 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.290
 sjef rolet speaks of this being inspired by knock of one 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.090
 motorcycle nadal it also has something big digital tachometer 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.880
 speedometer 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.450
 yes little luxury 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.150
 present the mirrors and later by hand 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.970
 papendrecht mirror it is a bit tricky 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.159
 the boat does fit and that costs extra discount for the basic model 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.520
 So brussels float to the top where they have the only two engines 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.760
 that is enough to drive a new vennep and badhoeved village every day 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.670
 but here in switzerland where it is a bit more 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.470
 to go higher down that you notice that you are short with this 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.770
 engine but once again in the Netherlands the south settle for its 86 hp 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.710
 well 

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:12.939
 the controls 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:14.459
 actually 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.549
 they can't really criticize it very much, it's not a super thing 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.030
 sharp but he responds to a nice steering movement it is not very bossy 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.279
 shown 

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:24.749
 switch is going to investigate 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:26.769
 the suspension and damping 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.949
 that is wonderfully smoothly tuned and sees most cars that you 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:33.310
 nowadays you have sprung quite a hard but these cars still one 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:36.299
 nice you can not find anything between comfort and sportiness 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.299
 actually it is best formed 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.080
 in addition to this and second, it is another point four engines that they combine that 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.859
 also with my gearbox 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.989
 pk stood here 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.549
 and France two more diesels come a motor it is a point 3 times 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:11.029
 in two variants then one comes with 75 hp and one with 95 hp good Friday 

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:14.029
 familiar sound that is indeed the same engine as in 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.069
 fiat de pont team corsa 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.879
 famous block nice and economical 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:19.949
 lots of torque 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:23.789
 that looks like now comes full venom 14 percent or a whole 

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:28.149
 economical tax-free all types are included in the 20 percent addition 

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:31.529
 blame but for it is so important for the car like this I do not know because 

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:34.529
 I don't think it will be a lot of business 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.279
 a piece the key question how reiki 

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:52.769
 the commodities law curious about the afternoon sent with this car 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.309
 yes it seems then you can all put in the butter than the 

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:59.339
 its not to speak so it lacks an ordinary pull 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:02.389
 the appearance of the car 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:06.009
 so you look nice from the back a little cheaper plastic it 

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:08.859
 dashboard also looks a bit cheap but the plastic 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:11.749
 so although there is much further future 

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:12.399
 I do not know
