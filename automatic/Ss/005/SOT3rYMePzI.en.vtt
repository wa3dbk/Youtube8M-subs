okay<00:00:01.050> talking<00:00:01.319> about<00:00:01.589> the<00:00:01.680> NPC<00:00:02.310> sync<00:00:02.879> function

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
okay talking about the NPC sync function

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.340 
okay talking about the NPC sync function
so<00:00:04.110> if<00:00:04.440> you<00:00:04.560> want<00:00:04.740> to<00:00:04.830> sync<00:00:05.100> your<00:00:05.160> MPC<00:00:05.730> to

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:06.350 
so if you want to sync your MPC to

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.640 
so if you want to sync your MPC to
anything<00:00:07.350> like<00:00:07.710> a<00:00:08.040> Pro<00:00:08.970> Tools<00:00:09.000> or<00:00:09.780> logic<00:00:10.440> or

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
anything like a Pro Tools or logic or

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.860 
anything like a Pro Tools or logic or
another<00:00:10.950> drum<00:00:11.219> machine<00:00:11.550> there<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.509> sync

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
another drum machine there is a sync

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.749 
another drum machine there is a sync
function<00:00:13.080> today<00:00:14.009> we're<00:00:14.340> going<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.519> show<00:00:14.670> you

function today we're going to show you

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.510 
function today we're going to show you
how<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:14.910> use<00:00:15.179> it<00:00:15.420> with<00:00:16.010> another<00:00:17.010> drum<00:00:17.279> machine

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
how to use it with another drum machine

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.810 
how to use it with another drum machine
the<00:00:18.420> chord<00:00:18.720> elect<00:00:19.109> ride<00:00:19.439> so<00:00:20.340> first<00:00:20.640> we're

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
the chord elect ride so first we're

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.320 
the chord elect ride so first we're
going<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.000> go<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.230> mode<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.710> then<00:00:23.189> hit<00:00:23.460> pretty

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
going to go to mode and then hit pretty

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.009 
going to go to mode and then hit pretty
sync

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
sync

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.589 
sync
it's<00:00:25.199> just<00:00:25.529> pad<00:00:25.800> 9<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:27.119> then<00:00:27.240> we're<00:00:27.390> going<00:00:27.510> to

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
it's just pad 9 and then we're going to

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.439 
it's just pad 9 and then we're going to
go<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:28.010> sync

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
go to sync

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.550 
go to sync
we're<00:00:30.449> already<00:00:30.630> on<00:00:30.720> sync<00:00:31.109> there's<00:00:31.289> all<00:00:31.410> those

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
we're already on sync there's all those

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.160 
we're already on sync there's all those
other<00:00:31.859> functions<00:00:32.430> as<00:00:32.640> well<00:00:32.669> like<00:00:33.239> MIDI<00:00:33.630> note

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
other functions as well like MIDI note

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.799 
other functions as well like MIDI note
so<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.280> actually<00:00:35.610> some<00:00:36.270> different<00:00:36.630> little

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
so that actually some different little

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.569 
so that actually some different little
bit<00:00:36.899> we're<00:00:37.079> gonna<00:00:37.140> go<00:00:37.320> sink<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:37.920> we're<00:00:38.489> gonna

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
bit we're gonna go sink so we're gonna

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.200 
bit we're gonna go sink so we're gonna
sink<00:00:38.879> out<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.780> we<00:00:39.840> run<00:00:40.110> me<00:00:40.260> out<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.800> MIDI<00:00:41.640> cable<00:00:42.059> a

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
sink out so we run me out a MIDI cable a

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.810 
sink out so we run me out a MIDI cable a
out<00:00:42.690> see<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.829> MIDI<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.899> your<00:00:46.140> lecture<00:00:46.260> I've

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
out see the MIDI in on your lecture I've

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.770 
out see the MIDI in on your lecture I've
maybe<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:48.079> and<00:00:49.079> then<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:51.000> we've<00:00:51.180> got<00:00:51.360> sending

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
maybe in and then so we've got sending

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.049 
maybe in and then so we've got sending
MIDI<00:00:52.020> clock<00:00:52.289> or<00:00:52.649> cévennes<00:00:53.039> response<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.879> MIDI

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
MIDI clock or cévennes response to MIDI

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.850 
MIDI clock or cévennes response to MIDI
clock<00:00:54.329> in<00:00:54.570> other<00:00:54.719> cases<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.379> might<00:00:55.530> send

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
clock in other cases you might send

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.099 
clock in other cases you might send
something<00:00:56.129> different<00:00:56.550> like<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.059> blue<00:00:57.390> pulsons

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
something different like a blue pulsons

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.770 
something different like a blue pulsons
MTC<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.100> if<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.250> want<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.520> do<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.850> you<00:01:00.510> go<00:01:00.750> to

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
MTC so if you want to do that you go to

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.770 
MTC so if you want to do that you go to
sink<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.219> go<00:01:02.370> sink<00:01:02.670> in<00:01:02.910> instead<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.570> to

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
sink in and you go sink in instead of to

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.850 
sink in and you go sink in instead of to
receive<00:01:04.350> MTC<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.549> then<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.780> would<00:01:07.110> allow

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
receive MTC and then that would allow

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.460 
receive MTC and then that would allow
you<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.100> sync<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.490> MPC<00:01:09.090> do<00:01:09.330> Pro<00:01:09.840> Tools<00:01:10.080> or

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
you to sync the MPC do Pro Tools or

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.530 
you to sync the MPC do Pro Tools or
something<00:01:10.740> like<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.850> we<00:01:11.970> got<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.330> setup

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
something like that so we got that setup

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.530 
something like that so we got that setup
now<00:01:12.780> we're<00:01:12.869> going<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.049> go<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.979> electro

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
now we're going to go to the electro

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.609 
now we're going to go to the electro
electro<00:01:15.540> if<00:01:15.600> it's<00:01:15.720> pretty<00:01:15.960> simple<00:01:16.259> just<00:01:16.500> set

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
electro if it's pretty simple just set

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.020 
electro if it's pretty simple just set
this<00:01:16.710> up<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.040> think<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.430> other<00:01:17.520> things<00:01:17.820> what<00:01:18.000> I

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
this up to think to other things what I

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.039 
this up to think to other things what I
going<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.210> do<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.420> go<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.950> global<00:01:19.950> button<00:01:20.490> and

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
going to do is go to global button and

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.260 
going to do is go to global button and
make<00:01:22.049> sure<00:01:22.110> you're<00:01:22.439> got<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.280> LED<00:01:23.610> set<00:01:24.030> to

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
make sure you're got the LED set to

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.679 
make sure you're got the LED set to
clock<00:01:25.430> so<00:01:26.430> now<00:01:26.580> when<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.790> go<00:01:26.850> back<00:01:27.090> up<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.330> here

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
clock so now when I go back up to here

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.440 
clock so now when I go back up to here
I'm<00:01:28.110> gonna<00:01:28.229> get<00:01:28.320> them<00:01:28.790> zoom<00:01:29.790> out<00:01:29.939> here<00:01:30.000> real

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
I'm gonna get them zoom out here real

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.499 
I'm gonna get them zoom out here real
quick<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.960> then<00:01:31.229> back<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.799> main<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.450> if<00:01:33.450> I

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
quick and then back to main and if I

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.620 
quick and then back to main and if I
start<00:01:34.079> on<00:01:34.290> here<00:01:34.680> I've<00:01:35.579> got<00:01:35.909> my<00:01:36.180> two<00:01:36.240> drum

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
start on here I've got my two drum

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.020 
start on here I've got my two drum
machines<00:01:36.930> sync<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.860> got<00:01:38.280> in<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.670> mixer

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
machines sync so I got in the mixer

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.789 
machines sync so I got in the mixer
right<00:01:39.180> here<00:01:41.540> that's<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:43.110> electron<00:01:43.560> right

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
right here that's the electron right

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.219 
right here that's the electron right
there<00:01:45.200> and<00:01:46.200> I've<00:01:47.040> also<00:01:47.220> got<00:01:47.810> MPC<00:01:48.810> on<00:01:48.990> side

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
there and I've also got MPC on side

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:56.520 
there and I've also got MPC on side
channel

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.210 

that's<00:01:57.220> the<00:01:57.340> MPC<00:01:58.740> sample<00:01:59.740> the<00:01:59.890> electrode<00:02:00.540> now

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
that's the MPC sample the electrode now

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.580 
that's the MPC sample the electrode now
actually<00:02:03.220> looks<00:02:03.460> at<00:02:04.050> all<00:02:05.050> right<00:02:05.200> so<00:02:05.500> that's

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
actually looks at all right so that's

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.920 
actually looks at all right so that's
the<00:02:05.770> sinking<00:02:06.729> function<00:02:07.120> so<00:02:07.270> once<00:02:07.450> again<00:02:07.570> I<00:02:07.720> can

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
the sinking function so once again I can

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.700 
the sinking function so once again I can
stop<00:02:08.200> it<00:02:08.729> start<00:02:09.729> again

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
stop it start again

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.380 
stop it start again
starting<00:02:11.710> the<00:02:11.920> electrode<00:02:12.340> over<00:02:12.430> here<00:02:12.820> with

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
starting the electrode over here with

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.930 
starting the electrode over here with
that<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:14.080> that<00:02:14.890> can<00:02:15.040> be<00:02:15.130> used<00:02:15.459> in<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.760> variety
