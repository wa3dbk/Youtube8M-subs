 Hello dear friends, I decided 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.180

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.470
 which i will ask questions 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.349

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.310
 then maybe they are interesting tasks 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.920
 maybe it makes no difference and schoolchildren 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.109
 will answer her questions 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.650
 Naturally this is the first release and therefore 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.719
 there was no comment 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.950
