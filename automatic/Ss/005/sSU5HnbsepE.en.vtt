 and we are going to 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.470
 mix to dilute the salt because 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.350
 once you throw the olive oil the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.380
 salt is no longer diluted and stays as in 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.409
 granites not only diluted in these 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.729
