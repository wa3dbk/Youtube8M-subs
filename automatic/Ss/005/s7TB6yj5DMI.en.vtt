and<00:02:27.050> we<00:02:28.050> know<00:02:28.170> Goku<00:02:28.440> got<00:02:28.620> infinitely<00:02:28.920> stronger

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
and we know Goku got infinitely stronger

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.410 
and we know Goku got infinitely stronger
since<00:02:29.760> then<00:02:29.970> also<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:31.560> strength<00:02:32.430> they

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
since then also the strength they

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.300 
since then also the strength they
measured<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:33.900> by<00:02:34.110> a<00:02:34.350> filler<00:02:35.130> part<00:02:35.550> that<00:02:36.210> was

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
measured it by a filler part that was

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.120 
measured it by a filler part that was
that<00:02:38.310> already<00:02:38.700> seemed<00:02:39.000> wrong<00:02:39.470> it<00:02:40.470> showed<00:02:40.740> Goku

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
that already seemed wrong it showed Goku

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.950 
that already seemed wrong it showed Goku
in<00:02:41.250> his<00:02:41.400> normal<00:02:41.700> form<00:02:41.970> could<00:02:42.210> only<00:02:42.330> lift<00:02:42.600> 40

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
in his normal form could only lift 40

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.910 
in his normal form could only lift 40
tons<00:02:43.290> I<00:02:44.300> think<00:02:45.300> that<00:02:45.360> is<00:02:45.920> completely

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
tons I think that is completely

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.130 
tons I think that is completely
impossible<00:02:47.040> even<00:02:47.670> as<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:47.910> kid<00:02:48.000> he<00:02:48.780> pushed<00:02:49.020> a

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
impossible even as a kid he pushed a

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.860 
impossible even as a kid he pushed a
boulder<00:02:49.440> that<00:02:49.680> probably<00:02:50.490> had<00:02:50.730> around<00:02:51.000> 20<00:02:51.660> 30

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
boulder that probably had around 20 30

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.970 
boulder that probably had around 20 30
tons<00:02:52.200> for<00:02:53.130> master<00:02:53.580> roshi<00:02:53.760> so<00:02:54.570> I<00:02:55.170> think<00:02:55.620> Goku

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
tons for master roshi so I think Goku

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.699 
tons for master roshi so I think Goku
got<00:02:56.130> a<00:02:56.160> lot<00:02:56.400> stronger<00:02:56.640> since<00:02:56.970> then<00:02:57.500> you<00:02:58.500> can

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
got a lot stronger since then you can

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.090 
got a lot stronger since then you can
scale<00:02:59.400> like<00:02:59.640> that<00:03:00.140> and<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.440> other<00:03:01.470> error<00:03:01.860> they

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
scale like that and the other error they

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.160 
scale like that and the other error they
made<00:03:02.280> is<00:03:02.520> they<00:03:02.940> took<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.239> most<00:03:03.390> overpowered

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
made is they took the most overpowered

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.530 
made is they took the most overpowered
version<00:03:04.709> of<00:03:04.830> superman<00:03:05.130> they<00:03:05.430> could<00:03:05.550> find<00:03:05.820> the

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
version of superman they could find the

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.530 
version of superman they could find the
ultimate<00:03:06.989> God<00:03:07.530> form<00:03:07.830> Superman<00:03:08.340> but<00:03:08.850> they

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
ultimate God form Superman but they

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.050 
ultimate God form Superman but they
didn't<00:03:09.840> take<00:03:10.220> dragonball<00:03:11.220> af<00:03:11.370> into

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
didn't take dragonball af into

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.660 
didn't take dragonball af into
consideration<00:03:12.780> even<00:03:13.410> though<00:03:13.560> AF<00:03:14.280> doesn't

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
consideration even though AF doesn't

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.990 
consideration even though AF doesn't
officially<00:03:14.940> exist<00:03:16.160> neither<00:03:17.160> does<00:03:17.430> God<00:03:17.700> formed

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
officially exist neither does God formed

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.140 
officially exist neither does God formed
Superman<00:03:19.130> they<00:03:20.130> should<00:03:20.370> take<00:03:20.580> both<00:03:20.880> into

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
Superman they should take both into

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.780 
Superman they should take both into
consideration<00:03:21.870> not<00:03:22.020> just<00:03:22.080> one<00:03:22.500> I<00:03:22.709> mean<00:03:23.160> goku

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
consideration not just one I mean goku

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.600 
consideration not just one I mean goku
super<00:03:23.940> saiyan<00:03:24.300> 5<00:03:24.540> could<00:03:24.870> basically<00:03:25.470> fart<00:03:26.430> and

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
super saiyan 5 could basically fart and

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.729 
super saiyan 5 could basically fart and
blow<00:03:26.790> up<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:26.940> universe<00:03:27.600> so<00:03:28.020> if<00:03:28.140> you<00:03:28.260> ask<00:03:28.410> me

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
blow up the universe so if you ask me

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.500 
blow up the universe so if you ask me
i'm<00:03:29.370> not<00:03:29.489> taking<00:03:29.820> screw<00:03:30.090> sack<00:03:30.330> into

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
i'm not taking screw sack into

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.170 
i'm not taking screw sack into
consideration<00:03:31.290> really<00:03:31.590> i'd<00:03:32.400> say<00:03:32.640> goku<00:03:33.000> would

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
consideration really i'd say goku would

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.470 
consideration really i'd say goku would
win<00:03:33.330> not<00:03:33.750> because<00:03:33.930> I'm<00:03:34.200> a<00:03:34.290> dragon<00:03:34.500> ball<00:03:34.709> z<00:03:34.950> fan

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
win not because I'm a dragon ball z fan

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.320 
win not because I'm a dragon ball z fan
but<00:03:36.480> because<00:03:37.640> there's<00:03:38.640> a<00:03:38.700> difference<00:03:39.090> in<00:03:39.209> the

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
but because there's a difference in the

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.070 
but because there's a difference in the
universe's<00:03:40.280> see<00:03:41.280> Superman<00:03:41.910> takes<00:03:42.720> his<00:03:42.870> power

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
universe's see Superman takes his power

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.490 
universe's see Superman takes his power
from<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:43.500> Sun<00:03:43.709> so<00:03:44.060> if<00:03:45.060> there<00:03:45.660> is<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:46.170> mass<00:03:46.470> of

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
from the Sun so if there is a mass of

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.220 
from the Sun so if there is a mass of
energy<00:03:46.770> and<00:03:47.160> you<00:03:47.580> keep<00:03:48.030> taking<00:03:48.300> that<00:03:48.660> energy

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
energy and you keep taking that energy

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.160 
energy and you keep taking that energy
away<00:03:49.530> you<00:03:50.130> cannot<00:03:50.430> take<00:03:50.700> more<00:03:51.269> energy<00:03:51.480> than

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
away you cannot take more energy than

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.160 
away you cannot take more energy than
there<00:03:52.380> is<00:03:52.459> so<00:03:53.459> basically<00:03:54.299> Superman

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
there is so basically Superman

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.410 
there is so basically Superman
only<00:03:55.590> absorb<00:03:56.010> as<00:03:56.220> much<00:03:56.250> energy<00:03:56.640> as<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:57.390> Sun

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
only absorb as much energy as the Sun

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.460 
only absorb as much energy as the Sun
has<00:03:57.900> if<00:03:58.740> he<00:03:59.340> absorbs<00:04:00.000> home<00:04:00.569> the<00:04:00.840> Sun<00:04:01.080> that's

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
has if he absorbs home the Sun that's

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.250 
has if he absorbs home the Sun that's
his<00:04:02.160> maximum<00:04:02.610> potential<00:04:03.060> nothing<00:04:04.050> more

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
his maximum potential nothing more

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.030 
his maximum potential nothing more
nothing<00:04:04.440> less<00:04:05.660> so<00:04:06.660> if<00:04:07.110> go<00:04:07.410> who<00:04:07.560> can<00:04:07.709> destroy

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
nothing less so if go who can destroy

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.770 
nothing less so if go who can destroy
the<00:04:08.220> Sun<00:04:08.459> he<00:04:09.000> can<00:04:09.150> basically<00:04:09.330> the<00:04:09.630> first

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
the Sun he can basically the first

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.020 
the Sun he can basically the first
