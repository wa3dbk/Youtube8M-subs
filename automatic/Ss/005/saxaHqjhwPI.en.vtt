00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.100 
close to death them you want proof that
this<00:02:29.190> actually<00:02:29.459> works<00:02:29.940> just<00:02:30.300> wait<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.540> second<00:02:31.020> I

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
this actually works just wait a second I

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:39.650 
this actually works just wait a second I
will<00:02:31.470> level<00:02:32.100> up<00:02:35.360> will<00:02:36.360> I<00:02:36.450> level<00:02:36.720> up<00:02:37.250> okay<00:02:38.660> see

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
will level up will I level up okay see

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.870 
will level up will I level up okay see
how<00:02:39.750> far<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.170> restoration<00:02:41.100> thing<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.490> not

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
how far the restoration thing is not

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:52.070 
how far the restoration thing is not
quite<00:02:42.240> level<00:02:42.660> 26<00:02:43.410> but<00:02:43.890> almost<00:02:44.220> there<00:02:44.490> watch

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.280 

and<00:02:52.550> there<00:02:53.550> you<00:02:53.640> go<00:02:53.790> level<00:02:54.270> 26<00:02:54.570> so<00:02:54.990> that<00:02:55.140> is

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
and there you go level 26 so that is

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.910 
and there you go level 26 so that is
proof<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.950> that<00:02:56.100> works<00:02:56.840> then<00:02:57.840> again<00:02:58.470> this<00:02:58.710> is

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
proof that that works then again this is

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.350 
proof that that works then again this is
the<00:02:58.950> end<00:02:59.340> of<00:02:59.670> the<00:03:00.060> halted<00:03:00.450> stream<00:03:00.630> camp<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:02.360> it

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
the end of the halted stream camp and it

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.600 
the end of the halted stream camp and it
is<00:03:03.510> right<00:03:03.810> here<00:03:04.230> on<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.620> map<00:03:04.830> if<00:03:05.100> you'd<00:03:05.370> like

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
is right here on the map if you'd like

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.370 
is right here on the map if you'd like
to<00:03:06.060> get<00:03:06.240> an<00:03:06.390> idea<00:03:06.750> of<00:03:06.810> where<00:03:07.050> you're<00:03:07.200> going<00:03:07.320> to

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
to get an idea of where you're going to

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.160 
to get an idea of where you're going to
be<00:03:07.560> so<00:03:08.460> I<00:03:08.790> will<00:03:09.090> see<00:03:09.330> you<00:03:09.360> guys<00:03:09.450> later<00:03:09.840> maybe
