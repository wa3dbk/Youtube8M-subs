bearing<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:27.269> mind<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.750> we<00:00:28.289> are<00:00:28.410> all<00:00:28.590> getting

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
bearing in mind that we are all getting

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.640 
bearing in mind that we are all getting
older<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.400> living<00:00:30.060> longer<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.720> actually

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
older and living longer and actually

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.670 
older and living longer and actually
being<00:00:31.920> more<00:00:32.460> active<00:00:32.780> for<00:00:33.780> example<00:00:34.410> it's

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
being more active for example it's

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.280 
being more active for example it's
estimated<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.489> by<00:00:35.820> 2030<00:00:36.510> there<00:00:37.110> will<00:00:37.200> be

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
estimated that by 2030 there will be

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.920 
estimated that by 2030 there will be
five<00:00:37.559> times<00:00:37.950> more<00:00:38.340> knee<00:00:38.610> replacements<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.510> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
five times more knee replacements in the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.350 
five times more knee replacements in the
world<00:00:40.170> than<00:00:40.469> there<00:00:40.590> are<00:00:40.649> currently<00:00:41.219> so<00:00:42.090> what

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
world than there are currently so what

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.510 
world than there are currently so what
we've<00:00:42.540> got<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.930> do<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.230> produce<00:00:43.520> interventions

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
we've got to do is produce interventions

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.170 
we've got to do is produce interventions
that<00:00:44.700> will<00:00:45.210> last<00:00:45.450> for<00:00:46.440> 50<00:00:46.860> years<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.850> could

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
that will last for 50 years that could

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.790 
that will last for 50 years that could
mean<00:00:48.420> for<00:00:48.600> example<00:00:48.690> for<00:00:49.170> an<00:00:49.230> artificial<00:00:49.649> knee

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
mean for example for an artificial knee

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.340 
mean for example for an artificial knee
joint<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.219> joint<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.850> undergoes<00:00:51.420> over<00:00:52.320> a

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
joint a joint that undergoes over a

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.279 
joint a joint that undergoes over a
hundred<00:00:52.920> million<00:00:53.250> steps<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.840> single

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
hundred million steps in a single

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.840 
hundred million steps in a single
patient<00:00:55.500> during<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.190> patient's<00:00:56.640> lifetime

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
patient during that patient's lifetime

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.910 
patient during that patient's lifetime
then<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.870> guess<00:00:58.109> we're<00:00:58.289> moving<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.800> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
then I guess we're moving to the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.099 
then I guess we're moving to the
spacewalk<00:00:59.430> which<00:00:59.820> we<00:01:00.059> call<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.899> more

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.020 
emerging technologies some of those
relate<00:01:03.989> around<00:01:04.610> artificial<00:01:05.610> joints<00:01:05.970> that

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
relate around artificial joints that

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.450 
relate around artificial joints that
last<00:01:06.330> longer<00:01:06.810> some<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.560> them<00:01:07.650> relate<00:01:08.040> around

some<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.820> it's<00:01:21.090> about<00:01:21.270> introducing<00:01:21.960> new

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
some of it's about introducing new

some of it's about introducing new

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.590 
imaging for improved patient selection
and<00:01:28.259> then<00:01:28.890> there<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.189> other<00:01:29.549> areas<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.090> can<00:01:30.570> we

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
and then there is other areas of can we

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.990 
and then there is other areas of can we
actually<00:01:31.020> start<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.740> deliver<00:01:32.159> translational

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
actually start to deliver translational

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.499 
actually start to deliver translational

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
manipulated stem cells from the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.910 
manipulated stem cells from the
patient's<00:01:39.299> own<00:01:39.479> tissues<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.380> bloods<00:01:40.680> and

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
patient's own tissues and bloods and

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.219 
patient's own tissues and bloods and
then<00:01:41.340> re<00:01:41.610> implanting<00:01:42.240> them<00:01:42.450> either<00:01:42.689> on<00:01:42.930> their

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
then re implanting them either on their

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.080 
then re implanting them either on their

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.090 

so<00:01:50.090> far<00:01:50.360> I<00:01:50.390> think<00:01:50.570> we've<00:01:51.200> been<00:01:51.560> able<00:01:51.710> to<00:01:51.830> kick

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
so far I think we've been able to kick

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.190 
so far I think we've been able to kick
off<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:52.549> program<00:01:53.360> of<00:01:53.510> work<00:01:53.720> and<00:01:53.990> we've

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
off the program of work and we've

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.060 
off the program of work and we've
recruited<00:01:54.920> around<00:01:55.520> about<00:01:55.760> 33<00:01:56.450> new

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
recruited around about 33 new

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.980 
recruited around about 33 new
researchers<00:01:58.070> into<00:01:58.400> the<00:01:58.549> team<00:01:58.820> and<00:01:59.119> we<00:01:59.750> put

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
researchers into the team and we put

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.109 
researchers into the team and we put
that<00:02:00.200> funding<00:02:00.619> alongside<00:02:00.890> existing<00:02:01.369> funding

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
that funding alongside existing funding

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.230 
that funding alongside existing funding
we<00:02:02.299> have<00:02:02.509> from<00:02:02.950> epsrc<00:02:03.950> where<00:02:04.220> we<00:02:04.430> are<00:02:04.580> building

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
we have from epsrc where we are building

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.260 
we have from epsrc where we are building
new<00:02:05.840> equipment<00:02:06.649> to<00:02:06.740> new<00:02:06.920> simulators<00:02:07.670> so<00:02:08.090> we're

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
new equipment to new simulators so we're

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.850 
new equipment to new simulators so we're
just<00:02:08.300> at<00:02:08.600> this<00:02:08.750> present<00:02:08.989> time<00:02:09.229> really

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
just at this present time really

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.490 
just at this present time really
increasing<00:02:10.429> our<00:02:10.670> capacity<00:02:10.880> and<00:02:11.840> capability

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
increasing our capacity and capability

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
factor of two what inspires me is seeing

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.900 
factor of two what inspires me is seeing
the<00:02:20.390> research<00:02:20.900> that<00:02:21.080> I<00:02:21.110> do<00:02:21.260> actually<00:02:22.190> taken

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
the research that I do actually taken

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.520 
the research that I do actually taken
into<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.180> patients<00:02:23.810> and<00:02:23.959> I've<00:02:24.290> done<00:02:24.500> that

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
into the patients and I've done that

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.830 
into the patients and I've done that
many<00:02:24.890> times<00:02:25.070> in<00:02:25.489> my<00:02:25.640> career<00:02:25.700> and<00:02:26.209> and<00:02:26.570> the

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
many times in my career and and the

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.660 
many times in my career and and the
first<00:02:27.080> time<00:02:27.320> it<00:02:27.380> happens<00:02:27.890> is<00:02:28.130> highly

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
first time it happens is highly

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.640 
first time it happens is highly
motivating<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:29.420> that<00:02:29.630> just<00:02:29.930> encourage<00:02:30.500> you

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
motivating and that just encourage you

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.870 
motivating and that just encourage you

to to carry on and do more things our
vision<00:02:35.269> is<00:02:35.620> relatively<00:02:36.620> simple<00:02:36.860> is<00:02:37.340> that<00:02:37.370> we

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
vision is relatively simple is that we

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.070 
vision is relatively simple is that we
