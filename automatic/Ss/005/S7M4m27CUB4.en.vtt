Stinson<00:01:31.850> twice<00:01:33.700> you<00:01:34.700> have<00:01:34.910> to<00:01:35.090> you<00:01:35.480> have<00:01:35.660> to

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
Stinson twice you have to you have to

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.450 
Stinson twice you have to you have to
guess<00:01:36.080> that<00:01:36.350> it's<00:01:36.500> not<00:01:36.740> an<00:01:36.920> aerobatic

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
guess that it's not an aerobatic

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.510 
guess that it's not an aerobatic
airplane<00:01:37.960> if<00:01:38.960> you'd<00:01:39.200> watch<00:01:39.470> me<00:01:39.770> fly<00:01:40.040> about<00:01:40.340> all

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
airplane if you'd watch me fly about all

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.240 
airplane if you'd watch me fly about all
I<00:01:40.550> can<00:01:40.700> do<00:01:41.030> is<00:01:41.060> loops<00:01:41.450> and<00:01:41.720> elements<00:01:42.260> that's

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
I can do is loops and elements that's

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.160 
I can do is loops and elements that's
about<00:01:43.550> it<00:01:43.580> that's<00:01:44.090> that's<00:01:44.480> about<00:01:44.780> it<00:01:44.810> as<00:01:45.020> far

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
about it that's that's about it as far

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.260 
about it that's that's about it as far
as<00:01:45.500> aerobatics<00:01:45.710> go<00:01:46.160> it<00:01:46.280> doesn't<00:01:46.400> roll<00:01:46.820> good<00:01:47.120> at

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
as aerobatics go it doesn't roll good at

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.620 
as aerobatics go it doesn't roll good at
all<00:01:48.250> it's<00:01:49.250> just<00:01:49.370> that<00:01:49.640> well<00:01:49.790> I<00:01:49.820> guess<00:01:50.300> the<00:01:50.450> big

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
all it's just that well I guess the big

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.590 
all it's just that well I guess the big
Stinson<00:01:51.170> never<00:01:51.380> did<00:01:51.620> either<00:01:52.090> so<00:01:53.090> it's<00:01:53.330> pretty

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
Stinson never did either so it's pretty

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.540 
Stinson never did either so it's pretty
much<00:01:53.720> a<00:01:53.900> copy<00:01:54.230> of<00:01:54.410> the<00:01:54.650> real<00:01:54.830> airplane<00:01:55.340> it

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
much a copy of the real airplane it

00:01:55.550 --> 00:03:50.370 
much a copy of the real airplane it
flies<00:01:55.790> like<00:01:56.090> the<00:01:56.210> real<00:01:56.390> airplane

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380
