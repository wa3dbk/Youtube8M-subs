you<00:00:53.579> know<00:00:53.670> as<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.940> can<00:00:54.120> see<00:00:54.270> one<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.870> most

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
you know as you can see one of the most

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.540 
you know as you can see one of the most
notable<00:00:55.350> differences<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.039> fact<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.340> he

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
notable differences is the fact that he

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.610 
notable differences is the fact that he
has<00:00:56.789> been<00:00:57.030> moved<00:00:57.210> from<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.899> right<00:00:58.170> wing<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.590> a

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
has been moved from a right wing to a

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.889 
has been moved from a right wing to a
striker<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.579> that<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.239> basically<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.809> most

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
striker so that is basically the most

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.209 
striker so that is basically the most
notable<00:01:01.289> difference<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.800> guys<00:01:01.980> can

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
notable difference that you guys can

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.369 
notable difference that you guys can

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
probably get from the whole entire fact

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.109 
probably get from the whole entire fact
that<00:01:04.500> he<00:01:04.589> does<00:01:04.710> have<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> new<00:01:05.040> inform<00:01:05.460> card<00:01:05.700> but

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
like he didn't impress me too much he

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.380 
like he didn't impress me too much he
does<00:02:59.800> not<00:02:59.980> feel<00:03:00.220> like<00:03:00.370> he's<00:03:00.520> 91<00:03:00.910> pace<00:03:01.180> he's

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
does not feel like he's 91 pace he's

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.450 
does not feel like he's 91 pace he's
very<00:03:01.570> sluggish<00:03:02.080> on<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.380> ball<00:03:02.590> and<00:03:02.800> it's<00:03:03.400> a

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
very sluggish on the ball and it's a

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.680 
very sluggish on the ball and it's a
little<00:03:03.700> bit<00:03:03.820> difficult<00:03:04.000> to<00:03:04.240> kind<00:03:04.390> of<00:03:04.510> push

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
little bit difficult to kind of push

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.240 
little bit difficult to kind of push
through<00:03:04.900> with<00:03:05.050> him<00:03:05.230> I'm<00:03:05.440> he's<00:03:05.830> very<00:03:06.040> strong

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
through with him I'm he's very strong

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.530 
through with him I'm he's very strong
which<00:03:06.430> is<00:03:06.550> definitely<00:03:06.910> good<00:03:07.030> so<00:03:07.150> he<00:03:07.210> can<00:03:07.360> kind

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
which is definitely good so he can kind

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.060 
which is definitely good so he can kind
of<00:03:07.600> hold<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.900> defenders<00:03:08.260> off<00:03:08.380> the<00:03:08.500> ball<00:03:08.680> but

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
of hold the defenders off the ball but

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.950 
of hold the defenders off the ball but
the<00:03:09.190> biggest<00:03:09.430> problem<00:03:09.880> is<00:03:10.000> um<00:03:10.210> he<00:03:10.570> doesn't

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
the biggest problem is um he doesn't

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.330 
the biggest problem is um he doesn't
really<00:03:11.050> get<00:03:11.350> what<00:03:11.560> he<00:03:11.710> deserves<00:03:12.070> when<00:03:12.250> it

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
right here but that's cuz he's on a

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.630 
right here but that's cuz he's on a
breakaway<00:03:23.230> but<00:03:23.500> he<00:03:23.560> can't<00:03:23.860> he<00:03:24.280> can't<00:03:24.310> just

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.990 
and two up top at the right trigger so
he<00:04:08.680> was<00:04:08.830> able<00:04:09.010> to<00:04:09.130> use<00:04:09.190> that<00:04:09.310> left<00:04:09.670> foot<00:04:09.760> on<00:04:09.910> the

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
he was able to use that left foot on the

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.430 
he was able to use that left foot on the
inside<00:04:10.330> so<00:04:10.420> i<00:04:10.480> definitely<00:04:10.750> think<00:04:11.050> that's

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
inside so i definitely think that's

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.050 
inside so i definitely think that's
probably<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:11.800> best<00:04:11.950> area<00:04:12.340> to<00:04:12.400> use<00:04:12.670> him<00:04:12.880> in

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
probably the best area to use him in

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.970 
probably the best area to use him in
because<00:04:13.720> just<00:04:14.140> mainly<00:04:14.320> due<00:04:14.530> to<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.650> fact<00:04:14.830> that

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
because just mainly due to the fact that

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.979 
because just mainly due to the fact that
that's<00:04:15.220> what<00:04:15.489> he<00:04:15.550> excels<00:04:15.880> in<00:04:16.030> most<00:04:16.239> so<00:04:16.450> but

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
that's what he excels in most so but

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.510 
that's what he excels in most so but
hookahs<00:04:17.290> you<00:04:17.650> know<00:04:17.739> he's<00:04:17.919> pretty<00:04:18.160> he's<00:04:18.459> a

right wing Hulk if you guys are really
into<00:05:07.150> that<00:05:07.300> but<00:05:07.479> personally<00:05:07.840> guys<00:05:07.990> I<00:05:08.199> do<00:05:08.410> not

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
into that but personally guys I do not

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.200 
into that but personally guys I do not
think<00:05:08.770> that<00:05:09.130> the<00:05:09.280> right<00:05:09.430> wing<00:05:09.550> Hulk<00:05:09.789> is<00:05:09.970> very

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
think that the right wing Hulk is very

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.330 
think that the right wing Hulk is very
good<00:05:10.510> and<00:05:10.660> this<00:05:11.139> Hulk<00:05:11.410> is<00:05:11.560> very<00:05:11.830> good<00:05:12.039> is<00:05:12.190> he

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
good and this Hulk is very good is he

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.400 
good and this Hulk is very good is he
worth<00:05:12.490> 250<00:05:12.910> thousand<00:05:13.419> coins<00:05:13.539> I'm<00:05:14.169> not

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
worth 250 thousand coins I'm not

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.529 
worth 250 thousand coins I'm not
entirely<00:05:14.710> sure<00:05:14.889> I<00:05:15.010> do<00:05:15.190> not<00:05:15.490> think<00:05:15.550> so<00:05:15.910> his<00:05:16.240> left

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:16.539 
entirely sure I do not think so his left

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:18.480 
entirely sure I do not think so his left
foot<00:05:16.720> is<00:05:16.900> incredible<00:05:17.590> guys<00:05:17.710> his<00:05:17.949> right<00:05:18.160> foot<00:05:18.310> I

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
foot is incredible guys his right foot I

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.430 
foot is incredible guys his right foot I
definitely<00:05:19.030> lacks<00:05:19.389> some<00:05:19.599> power<00:05:19.780> in<00:05:20.050> there<00:05:20.260> and

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
definitely lacks some power in there and

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.140 
definitely lacks some power in there and
his<00:05:21.039> pace<00:05:21.280> definitely<00:05:21.760> seems<00:05:21.940> a<00:05:22.000> little

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
his pace definitely seems a little

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.909 
his pace definitely seems a little
slower<00:05:22.419> than<00:05:22.599> 91<00:05:22.990> but<00:05:23.139> overall<00:05:23.410> he<00:05:23.770> was<00:05:23.800> a

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
slower than 91 but overall he was a

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:24.990 
slower than 91 but overall he was a
pretty<00:05:24.070> decent<00:05:24.430> player<00:05:24.550> I'd<00:05:24.639> probably<00:05:24.789> give

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
pretty decent player I'd probably give

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.150 
pretty decent player I'd probably give
him<00:05:25.090> around<00:05:25.300> a<00:05:25.449> 7<00:05:26.020> or<00:05:26.139> an<00:05:26.199> 8<00:05:26.320> out<00:05:26.620> of<00:05:26.650> 10<00:05:26.919> if<00:05:27.070> I

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
him around a 7 or an 8 out of 10 if I

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.710
