Indiana game plan for two quarterbacks
um<00:02:55.900> probably<00:02:56.530> not<00:02:56.709> much<00:02:56.980> I<00:02:57.340> saw<00:02:57.760> Kevin<00:02:58.120> had<00:02:58.209> a

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
um probably not much I saw Kevin had a

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.340 
um probably not much I saw Kevin had a
comment<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.690> other<00:02:58.720> day<00:02:58.810> he's<00:02:59.019> not<00:02:59.170> telling

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
comment the other day he's not telling

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.460 
comment the other day he's not telling
what<00:02:59.560> he<00:02:59.620> started<00:02:59.860> either<00:03:00.010> you<00:03:00.310> know<00:03:00.340> so<00:03:00.660> but<00:03:01.660> I

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
what he started either you know so but I

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.710 
what he started either you know so but I
think<00:03:02.920> it's<00:03:03.040> a<00:03:03.100> little<00:03:03.220> bit<00:03:03.340> more<00:03:03.670> I<00:03:03.910> really

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
think it's a little bit more I really

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.300 
think it's a little bit more I really
wasn't<00:03:04.930> looking<00:03:05.380> for<00:03:05.410> a<00:03:05.620> strategical

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310
