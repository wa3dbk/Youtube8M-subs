this<00:00:01.140> is<00:00:01.350> a<00:00:01.380> Greg<00:00:01.829> freeze<00:00:02.100> from<00:00:02.340> Center<00:00:02.730> learn

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
this is a Greg freeze from Center learn

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.200 
this is a Greg freeze from Center learn
I<00:00:03.330> just<00:00:03.780> watched<00:00:04.020> this<00:00:04.350> screener<00:00:04.950> that<00:00:05.210> whoops

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
I just watched this screener that whoops

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.049 
I just watched this screener that whoops
the<00:00:06.660> screener<00:00:07.020> that<00:00:07.140> Zahra<00:00:07.620> put<00:00:08.370> together<00:00:08.519> of

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
the screener that Zahra put together of

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.350 
the screener that Zahra put together of
having<00:00:09.480> some<00:00:09.889> text<00:00:10.889> slide<00:00:11.519> across<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.059> screen

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
having some text slide across the screen

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.720 
having some text slide across the screen
and<00:00:12.840> it<00:00:13.530> got<00:00:13.710> me<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:13.980> thinking<00:00:14.040> about<00:00:14.370> how<00:00:14.700> I

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
and it got me to thinking about how I

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.609 
and it got me to thinking about how I
could<00:00:14.880> use<00:00:15.150> that<00:00:15.330> same<00:00:15.389> animation<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.410> make<00:00:16.590> a

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
could use that same animation to make a

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.450 
could use that same animation to make a
a<00:00:16.980> news<00:00:17.369> ticker<00:00:17.730> style<00:00:18.630> so<00:00:18.930> I've<00:00:19.380> got<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.740> slide

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
a news ticker style so I've got a slide

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.200 
a news ticker style so I've got a slide
here<00:00:21.240> where<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.740> talks<00:00:23.039> about<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.580> PDF

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
here where it talks about this PDF

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.300 
here where it talks about this PDF
document<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.289> added<00:00:25.529> along<00:00:25.949> the<00:00:26.099> bottom

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
document and I added along the bottom

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.689 
document and I added along the bottom
here<00:00:26.779> some<00:00:27.779> text<00:00:28.230> just<00:00:28.500> like<00:00:28.680> Zahra<00:00:29.039> describes

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
here some text just like Zahra describes

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.450 
here some text just like Zahra describes
with<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.210> fly<00:00:30.480> out<00:00:30.660> animation<00:00:31.619> that's<00:00:32.279> gonna

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
with the fly out animation that's gonna

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.299 
with the fly out animation that's gonna
move<00:00:33.420> across<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.200> bottom<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.710> screen<00:00:34.920> as

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
move across the bottom of the screen as

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.420 
move across the bottom of the screen as
we<00:00:35.520> watch<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:36.030> inarticulate<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.800> just

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
we watch this inarticulate and I just

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.850 
we watch this inarticulate and I just
did<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.640> couple<00:00:38.910> things<00:00:39.120> different<00:00:40.050> one<00:00:40.440> as<00:00:40.680> I

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
did a couple things different one as I

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.940 
did a couple things different one as I
added<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.520> appear<00:00:41.969> animation<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.170> then<00:00:43.800> when

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
added and appear animation and then when

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.100 
added and appear animation and then when
I<00:00:43.980> did<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.489> time<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.940> here<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.180> put<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.780> 30

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
I did the time in here I put it to 30

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.190 
I did the time in here I put it to 30
seconds<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:46.980> then<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.670> also<00:00:47.910> made<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:48.899> it

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
seconds and then I also made it so it

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.850 
seconds and then I also made it so it
has<00:00:49.469> under<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.129> effect<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:51.000> smooth<00:00:51.840> start<00:00:52.469> so

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
has under the effect a smooth start so

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.360 
has under the effect a smooth start so
it<00:00:53.070> comes<00:00:53.579> in<00:00:53.850> at<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.180> slower<00:00:54.690> speed<00:00:54.840> as<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:56.190> gets

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
it comes in at a slower speed as it gets

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.160 
it comes in at a slower speed as it gets
ready<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:56.940> let's<00:00:57.149> publish<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.989> inarticulate

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
ready so let's publish this inarticulate

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.979 
ready so let's publish this inarticulate
actually<00:01:01.879> so<00:01:02.879> we're<00:01:02.969> actually<00:01:03.120> taking<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.750> look

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
actually so we're actually taking a look

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.340 
actually so we're actually taking a look
at<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> preview<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.479> articulate<00:01:06.479> its<00:01:06.659> building

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
at a preview in articulate its building

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.580 
at a preview in articulate its building
these<00:01:07.500> slides<00:01:07.890> up<00:01:08.600> so<00:01:09.600> here's<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.020> articulate

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
click on that you can see we've got this

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.679 
click on that you can see we've got this
PDF<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.360> could<00:01:27.540> launch<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.590> browser

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
PDF and I could launch that in a browser

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.109 
PDF and I could launch that in a browser
so<00:01:30.689> again<00:01:30.900> that's<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.259> something<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.189> created

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
so again that's just something I created

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.330 
so again that's just something I created
with<00:01:33.390> PowerPoint<00:01:34.229> we're<00:01:34.439> close<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.740> preview

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
with PowerPoint we're close a preview

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.910 
with PowerPoint we're close a preview
maybe<00:01:36.270> make<00:01:36.509> this<00:01:36.689> bigger<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.500> see<00:01:37.799> it

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
maybe make this bigger so you see it

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.429 
maybe make this bigger so you see it
here's<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.549> text<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.270> just<00:01:39.299> like<00:01:39.570> Sarah<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:40.259> had

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
here's a text and just like Sarah I had

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.620 
here's a text and just like Sarah I had
it<00:01:40.619> go<00:01:40.890> well<00:01:41.159> off<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.610> side<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.299> slide

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
it go well off the side of the slide

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.399 
it go well off the side of the slide
here<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.979> spent<00:01:44.250> some<00:01:44.490> time<00:01:44.729> on<00:01:45.200> its<00:01:46.200> way

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
here so it spent some time on its way

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.469 
here so it spent some time on its way
out<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.490> would<00:01:47.610> have<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.880> time<00:01:48.180> this

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
out and so you would have to time this

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.770 
out and so you would have to time this
with<00:01:48.750> whatever<00:01:48.990> audio<00:01:49.710> length<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.790> associated

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
with whatever audio length is associated

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.469 
with whatever audio length is associated
with<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.470> slides<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.399> guess<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:54.030> could<00:01:54.119> say

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
with the slides so I guess I could say

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.870 
with the slides so I guess I could say
something<00:01:54.840> like<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.200> know<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:56.070> document

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
something like you know this document

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.969 
something like you know this document
from<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.149> CDC<00:01:57.689> covers<00:01:58.200> these<00:01:58.409> four<00:01:58.740> things

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
from the CDC covers these four things

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.340 
from the CDC covers these four things
and<00:01:59.579> talk<00:01:59.909> about<00:02:00.180> instructors<00:02:00.750> site<00:02:01.049> set<00:02:01.320> up

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
and talk about instructors site set up

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.310 
and talk about instructors site set up
site<00:02:01.710> safety<00:02:02.130> training<00:02:02.490> participants<00:02:03.320> crawls

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
site safety training participants crawls

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.320 
site safety training participants crawls
along<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.770> bottom<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.909> they

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
along the bottom that they
