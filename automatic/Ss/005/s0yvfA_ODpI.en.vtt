00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.860
 ringer z a keyboard that represents 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:03.460
 the evolution of the species 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.479
 starting immediately from the boxing is observed 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.670
 to whom the quality of the packaging is 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.710
 of the box will definitely reflect 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.160
 that of the product contained in his 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:18.640
 internal interior we also find one 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.380
 useful paper clip to pull out the keys 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.720
 in case they should replace them 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:28.890
 of course the usb cable touched in gold 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:32.050
 which will connect the keyboard to the PC and 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:37.090
 various leaflets with the 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:41.170
 warranty instructions and anything else here 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.770
 another sheet for the many functions 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.100
 that this keyboard has 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.040
 we will go out 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.960
 to discover them in more detail inside 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.600
 of the package we find therefore the 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.970
 wrist rest which will be integrated 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.940
 perfectly with the keyboard 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.310
 we note that even on the back it was well 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.190
 refined and refined 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.920
 but now let us pass what is the 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.220
 real subject of the review and therefore 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.580
 the trigger keyboard z3 gazette that is 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:17.070
 the evolution of the first trigger la 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:20.620
 which introduced some new features the 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:23.680
 wrist rest obviously goes to 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.900
 integrate into the part 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.420
 below on the back we find the logo 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.060
 sim store if in a dedicated keyboard 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.160
 essentially to gaming obviously i 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.370
 feet for raising the pastiera 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:41.720
 so as to allow easier 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.070
 writing with layout obviously mine 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.390
 Italian car at the top 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:50.450
 we find input for the usb in the part 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:54.620
 underlying instead the three holes for 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:57.880
 we can insert the wrist rest see 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.160
 that it is enough to approach it and go to 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.130
 fit the keyboard to the good one already 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.040
 this way we could write much more 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.990
 conveniently once connected to the 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.370
 our pc keyboard will not have to do 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.000
 other than waiting 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.740
 the lighting of the LED is not here at the top 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.880
 this will denote the fact that it is the 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.220
 keyboard and fa was 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.830
 recognized by the system and what time it is 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.660
 ready for 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.460
 be used with regard to 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.800
 lighting to activate it is enough 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.570
 gifts key function right and f 1 in 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.230
 this activates the brand keys 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.180
 the wasd keys and the darts to change 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.130
 light intensity level always on 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.660
 function key right and f 2 if yes 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.480
 wants to decrease 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:47.150
 or f3 evening you want to increase i 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.980
 elimination levels are five per 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.310
 change the type of vast lighting 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.140
 fever f function key plus f4 in 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.740
 this way you pass the elimination 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.480
 complete rather than that 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.580
 flashing light that comes and goes 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.030
 by pressing the function key again 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.800
 4 online site TV mode in addition to 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.500
 the keys to the national ones are those 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.480
 multimedia play the stop is on 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.580
 behind the keys for volume control 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.000
 to finally deactivate button 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.940
 of the windows button which would be button 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.630
 left function so as not to 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:26.060
 accidentally press it during the feet 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.800
 for example comparing it with one 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.780
 classic size keyboard does not 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.760
 they deviate too much if not for the presence 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.470
 of the macro keys on the left and 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.680
 dimensionally speaking we are from 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:42.320
 in front of a 25.3 cm high keyboard 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:44.510
 40 wide 7.6 cm deep 3.8 cm and weight 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.830
 of about 1.5 kg 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:52.730
 and quite important is the USB cable e 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.500
 completely covered using 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.180
 the accessory was enclosed 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.730
 we have the ability to remove each 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.350
 single keyboard key and how 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.330
 we can note in this case to the of 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.420
 below the button of a color switch 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.520
 brown it comes from the cerri mx brown that 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:11.150
 they are practically a cross between 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.900
 black and blue and are practically gods 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:17.930
 Hybrids are suitable both for gaming that the 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:20.630
 to normal writing below 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.570
 every single key and then a land the 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.990
 which guarantees excellent lighting 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:28.460
 and makes the brightness be 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.760
 we will do as much throughout the world 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.710
 keyboard 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.770
 then we move on to the part slightly 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.990
 more technical of course I remember that 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.880
 this is a full keyboard 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:45.530
 mechanical then there is the possibility 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:48.290
 albeit remote to render up to 64 keys 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.730
 at the same time and this is it 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.160
 factor that goes to distinguish keyboards 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:54.280
 mechanical from those made membrane 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.690
 that all keys are recognized 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.600
 individually 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:02.120
 in addition to this we have only to the left 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:05.570
 five keys corresponding to five 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:08.840
 profiles on which we can record 15 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.550
 macro for each profile so we will have 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.760
 a total of 75 but between 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.350
 storable keyboard who is 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.780
 schools internally in one 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:20.090
 processor which goes to store 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.940
 then later to reproduce 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.010
 the macros we can record 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.960
 manually 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:30.230
 personally they are not users of 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:32.390
 these functions because I don't need them but 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.520
 I'm sure those who play in 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:38.090
 particular game in which they are required 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:40.660
 precisely the action of a combination of 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:44.000
 keys in rapid sequence rather than 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:49.930
 certain functions this keyboard is 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:52.580
 really very very useful beyond that 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:57.440
 as already mentioned previously in switch 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:07:00.170
 some keys are brown so a great one 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.540
 comfort both at the level of kimi and for 

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:04.640
 regarding writing 

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:07.340
 obviously for all information vi 

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.050
 I leave the link in the description also for 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:13.240
 this review seems to be really 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.240
 everything and bye bye bye bye
