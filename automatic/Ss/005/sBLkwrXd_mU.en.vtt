I've seen a lot of videos on the Android
Bluetooth<00:00:09.879> scanner<00:00:10.690> and<00:00:11.020> I<00:00:11.889> decided<00:00:12.280> to<00:00:12.429> go

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:12.490 
Bluetooth scanner and I decided to go

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:14.669 
Bluetooth scanner and I decided to go
ahead<00:00:12.639> and<00:00:12.759> pick<00:00:12.910> up<00:00:13.090> on<00:00:13.360> and<00:00:13.660> I<00:00:14.230> see<00:00:14.410> there's<00:00:14.620> a

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:14.679 
ahead and pick up on and I see there's a

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.970 
ahead and pick up on and I see there's a
lot<00:00:14.889> of<00:00:15.040> videos<00:00:15.339> about<00:00:15.370> how<00:00:15.790> to<00:00:16.029> set<00:00:16.540> it<00:00:16.570> up<00:00:16.980> on

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
lot of videos about how to set it up on

how<00:00:24.730> to<00:00:24.760> get<00:00:25.029> it<00:00:25.150> working<00:00:25.180> I<00:00:25.689> thought<00:00:26.140> I<00:00:26.170> would

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
how to get it working I thought I would

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.710 
how to get it working I thought I would
skip<00:00:26.680> that<00:00:26.949> and<00:00:27.250> show<00:00:28.029> you<00:00:28.090> what<00:00:28.570> it<00:00:28.689> can

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
skip that and show you what it can

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.950 
skip that and show you what it can
actually<00:00:29.080> do<00:00:29.500> for<00:00:29.769> you<00:00:29.980> on<00:00:30.189> the<00:00:30.369> car<00:00:30.609> and<00:00:30.960> I'm

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
actually do for you on the car and I'm

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.460 
actually do for you on the car and I'm
working<00:00:32.169> on<00:00:32.349> a<00:00:32.410> car<00:00:32.710> today<00:00:32.949> that<00:00:33.489> set<00:00:33.790> a<00:00:33.820> code

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
working on a car today that set a code

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.979 
working on a car today that set a code
p0<00:00:35.850> 171<00:00:36.850> which<00:00:37.720> is<00:00:38.049> a<00:00:38.650> bank<00:00:39.220> one<00:00:39.549> oxygen<00:00:40.540> sensor

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
p0 171 which is a bank one oxygen sensor

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:47.009 
p0 171 which is a bank one oxygen sensor
lien<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:44.890> found<00:00:45.220> a<00:00:45.339> vacuum<00:00:45.729> leak<00:00:45.970> but<00:00:46.780> what

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
lien and I found a vacuum leak but what

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:49.770 
lien and I found a vacuum leak but what
I<00:00:47.049> wanted<00:00:47.320> to<00:00:47.440> show<00:00:47.620> you<00:00:47.650> was<00:00:48.119> that<00:00:49.119> on<00:00:49.510> the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
I wanted to show you was that on the

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.310 
I wanted to show you was that on the
torque<00:00:50.049> program<00:00:50.650> you<00:00:51.460> can<00:00:51.699> run<00:00:51.940> a<00:00:52.210> test<00:00:52.750> on<00:00:53.170> the

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
torque program you can run a test on the

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.490 
torque program you can run a test on the
oxygen<00:00:53.860> sensors<00:00:54.309> and<00:00:54.610> you<00:00:55.269> can<00:00:55.479> see<00:00:55.720> that<00:00:56.080> I

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
oxygen sensors and you can see that I

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.549 
oxygen sensors and you can see that I
had<00:00:57.100> confirmed<00:00:57.670> a<00:00:58.000> problem<00:00:58.690> with<00:00:59.110> one<00:00:59.350> of<00:00:59.379> the

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
had confirmed a problem with one of the

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.740 
had confirmed a problem with one of the
sensors<00:01:00.010> I<00:01:00.339> hope<00:01:00.610> this<00:01:00.790> can<00:01:00.970> come<00:01:01.210> up<00:01:01.360> in<00:01:01.570> the

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
sensors I hope this can come up in the

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.880 
sensors I hope this can come up in the
in<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:03.129> video<00:01:03.400> and<00:01:04.260> let<00:01:05.260> me<00:01:05.290> show<00:01:05.560> you<00:01:05.650> how<00:01:05.860> to

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.010 

of<00:03:44.050> course<00:03:44.260> it's<00:03:44.440> going<00:03:44.560> to<00:03:44.620> make<00:03:44.770> me<00:03:44.920> a<00:03:44.950> liar

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
of course it's going to make me a liar

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.680 
of course it's going to make me a liar
there<00:03:47.020> we<00:03:47.140> go<00:03:47.290> and<00:03:47.530> it<00:03:48.489> will<00:03:48.640> go<00:03:48.819> ahead<00:03:48.940> and<00:03:49.390> run

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
there we go and it will go ahead and run

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.949 
there we go and it will go ahead and run
standard<00:03:50.319> tests<00:03:50.910> for<00:03:51.910> oxygen<00:03:52.569> sensor<00:03:52.930> voltage

standard tests for oxygen sensor voltage
and<00:03:53.760> basically<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:54.879> information<00:03:55.000> that<00:03:55.569> we

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
and basically the information that we

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.130 
and basically the information that we
saw<00:03:55.900> on<00:03:56.050> the<00:03:56.080> graph<00:03:56.349> is<00:03:56.590> relayed<00:03:56.980> right<00:03:57.220> here

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
saw on the graph is relayed right here

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.880 
saw on the graph is relayed right here
basically<00:03:59.140> the<00:03:59.800> green<00:04:00.239> means<00:04:01.239> good<00:04:01.510> and<00:04:01.890> if

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
basically the green means good and if

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.970 
basically the green means good and if
you<00:04:03.010> have<00:04:03.190> a<00:04:03.220> sensor<00:04:03.640> that<00:04:03.790> fails<00:04:04.060> the<00:04:04.239> test

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
you have a sensor that fails the test

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.979 
you have a sensor that fails the test
you<00:04:05.980> will<00:04:06.190> see<00:04:06.519> that<00:04:06.849> result<00:04:07.120> in<00:04:07.480> red<00:04:07.750> and

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
you will see that result in red and

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.320 
you will see that result in red and
earlier<00:04:08.620> I<00:04:08.709> had<00:04:08.980> a<00:04:09.010> problem<00:04:09.340> but<00:04:09.730> that<00:04:09.970> has

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
earlier I had a problem but that has

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.770 
earlier I had a problem but that has
been<00:04:10.599> repaired<00:04:12.060> okay<00:04:13.060> thank<00:04:13.480> you<00:04:13.569> for

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
been repaired okay thank you for

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.240 
been repaired okay thank you for
watching<00:04:14.200> and<00:04:14.319> I<00:04:14.349> hope<00:04:14.379> you<00:04:14.650> can<00:04:14.799> use<00:04:14.830> some<00:04:15.220> of

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
watching and I hope you can use some of

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.729 
watching and I hope you can use some of
these<00:04:15.430> advanced<00:04:16.120> functions<00:04:16.870> from<00:04:17.229> the<00:04:17.440> torque
