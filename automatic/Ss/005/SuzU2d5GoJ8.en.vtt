of the pyramid can open up different
paths<00:01:03.769> a<00:01:06.430> good<00:01:07.430> way<00:01:07.520> to<00:01:07.550> find<00:01:07.820> some<00:01:08.090> extra<00:01:08.390> live

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:21.370 
time and we're afraid to get dragon I
guess<00:04:18.949> or<00:04:19.850> some<00:04:20.000> kind<00:04:20.209> of<00:04:20.299> Sam<00:04:20.600> the<00:04:20.870> worm<00:04:21.139> I

don't<00:04:21.680> know<00:04:22.330> this<00:04:23.330> boss<00:04:23.510> doesn't<00:04:23.720> make<00:04:23.870> any

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
don't know this boss doesn't make any

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.570 
don't know this boss doesn't make any

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.200 

so<00:04:30.180> basically<00:04:30.689> it's<00:04:31.139> that<00:04:31.669> the<00:04:32.669> strategy<00:04:33.180> is

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
so basically it's that the strategy is

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.899 
so basically it's that the strategy is
obvious<00:04:33.750> just<00:04:34.110> hit<00:04:34.319> him<00:04:34.699> eventually<00:04:35.699> he<00:04:35.819> will

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:35.909 
obvious just hit him eventually he will

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:39.920 
obvious just hit him eventually he will
split<00:04:36.180> into<00:04:36.300> two<00:04:36.810> smaller<00:04:37.080> dragons<00:04:38.719> in<00:04:39.719> that

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
split into two smaller dragons in that

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:50.420 
split into two smaller dragons in that
case<00:04:44.300> how<00:04:45.300> much<00:04:45.419> to<00:04:45.539> say<00:04:48.770> because<00:04:49.770> they're<00:04:50.189> so

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
case how much to say because they're so

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.119 
case how much to say because they're so
easily<00:04:50.699> defeated<00:04:51.030> it's<00:04:51.389> not<00:04:51.539> even<00:04:51.719> money<00:04:52.129> so

00:04:53.119 --> 00:04:53.129 
easily defeated it's not even money so

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:56.330 
easily defeated it's not even money so
this<00:04:53.280> level<00:04:53.610> I<00:04:53.699> don't<00:04:53.879> know<00:04:54.919> it<00:04:55.919> seems<00:04:55.979> kind<00:04:56.250> of

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
this level I don't know it seems kind of

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.580 
this level I don't know it seems kind of
at<00:04:56.460> a<00:04:56.490> place<00:04:56.759> it<00:04:56.969> seems<00:04:57.180> like<00:04:57.389> it<00:04:57.599> wasn't<00:04:58.110> hard

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
at a place it seems like it wasn't hard

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.890 
at a place it seems like it wasn't hard
enough<00:04:58.770> to<00:04:59.069> be<00:04:59.219> where<00:04:59.400> it<00:04:59.490> was<00:04:59.669> it<00:05:00.659> seems

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
enough to be where it was it seems

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.110 
enough to be where it was it seems
pretty<00:05:01.080> short<00:05:01.409> too<00:05:01.650> oh<00:05:01.889> well<00:05:02.219> in<00:05:02.490> fact<00:05:02.759> a<00:05:02.909> lot
