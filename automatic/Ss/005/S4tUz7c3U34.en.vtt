if you're gonna buy vanilla beans try to

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.370 
if you're gonna buy vanilla beans try to
make<00:02:22.640> sure<00:02:22.790> they're<00:02:22.940> nice<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:23.570> pliable

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
make sure they're nice and pliable

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.550 
make sure they're nice and pliable
like<00:02:25.160> this<00:02:25.459> is<00:02:25.700> right<00:02:26.000> here<00:02:26.450> so<00:02:26.630> this<00:02:27.350> way<00:02:27.500> you

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
like this is right here so this way you

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.050 
like this is right here so this way you
know<00:02:27.800> they're<00:02:27.980> good<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.220> fresh<00:02:28.489> if<00:02:28.760> they<00:02:28.910> are

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
know they're good and fresh if they are

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.040 
know they're good and fresh if they are
rock-hard<00:02:29.530> those<00:02:30.530> are<00:02:30.680> not<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.970> best<00:02:32.450> vanilla

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
rock-hard those are not the best vanilla

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.220 
rock-hard those are not the best vanilla
beans<00:02:33.350> to<00:02:33.709> use<00:02:33.950> so<00:02:34.700> make<00:02:35.060> sure<00:02:35.090> you<00:02:35.600> use<00:02:35.630> ones

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
beans to use so make sure you use ones

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.420 
beans to use so make sure you use ones
that<00:02:36.500> are<00:02:37.630> relatively<00:02:38.630> fresh<00:02:39.050> and<00:02:39.739> now<00:02:39.950> we<00:02:40.010> are

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
that are relatively fresh and now we are

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.120 
that are relatively fresh and now we are
simply<00:02:40.700> going<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.300> put<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:42.440> vanilla<00:02:42.830> beans

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
simply going to put the vanilla beans

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.080 
simply going to put the vanilla beans
into<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:43.970> jar<00:02:45.100> I'm<00:02:46.100> gonna<00:02:46.280> go<00:02:46.430> ahead<00:02:46.519> and<00:02:46.820> put

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
into the jar I'm gonna go ahead and put

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.259 
into the jar I'm gonna go ahead and put
all<00:02:47.299> of<00:02:47.390> these<00:02:47.720> vanilla<00:02:48.049> beans<00:02:48.350> in<00:02:48.620> here<00:02:48.920> and

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
all of these vanilla beans in here and

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:56.400 
all of these vanilla beans in here and
then<00:02:50.269> I<00:02:50.510> am<00:02:50.810> going<00:02:51.170> to<00:02:51.440> fill<00:02:52.370> it<00:02:52.610> with<00:02:53.120> um<00:02:54.549> vodka

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
then I am going to fill it with um vodka

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.930 
then I am going to fill it with um vodka
we're<00:02:57.410> just<00:02:57.590> gonna<00:02:57.709> simply<00:02:58.040> fill<00:02:58.489> the<00:02:58.700> top<00:02:58.910> a

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
we're just gonna simply fill the top a

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.490 
we're just gonna simply fill the top a
bucket<00:02:59.660> again<00:03:00.110> you<00:03:00.830> don't<00:03:00.980> need<00:03:01.370> to<00:03:01.549> use<00:03:01.820> an

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
bucket again you don't need to use an

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.039 
bucket again you don't need to use an
expensive<00:03:03.500> brand<00:03:03.680> in<00:03:04.070> fact<00:03:04.340> the<00:03:05.120> cheaper<00:03:05.570> it's

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
expensive brand in fact the cheaper it's

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.890 
expensive brand in fact the cheaper it's
probably<00:03:06.799> the<00:03:06.950> better<00:03:07.130> because<00:03:07.780> you<00:03:08.780> know

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
probably the better because you know

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.199 
probably the better because you know
what<00:03:09.079> the<00:03:09.260> vanilla<00:03:09.590> is<00:03:10.070> going<00:03:10.459> to<00:03:10.579> completely

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
what the vanilla is going to completely

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.509 
what the vanilla is going to completely
take<00:03:11.660> over<00:03:12.230> any<00:03:12.560> of<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.640> vodka<00:03:13.850> so<00:03:15.370> it's<00:03:16.370> not

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
take over any of the vodka so it's not

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.130 
take over any of the vodka so it's not
gonna<00:03:16.730> matter<00:03:17.350> you<00:03:18.350> know<00:03:18.470> what<00:03:18.680> this<00:03:19.130> is<00:03:19.489> um

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
gonna matter you know what this is um

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.360 
gonna matter you know what this is um
probably<00:03:21.140> the<00:03:21.320> most<00:03:21.500> difficult<00:03:21.769> part<00:03:22.010> for

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
probably the most difficult part for

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.770 
probably the most difficult part for
this<00:03:22.610> whole<00:03:22.790> step<00:03:23.060> is<00:03:23.329> just<00:03:23.480> trying<00:03:23.660> to<00:03:23.690> make

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
this whole step is just trying to make

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.009 
this whole step is just trying to make
sure<00:03:24.019> you<00:03:24.110> forward<00:03:24.500> notes<00:03:24.709> that<00:03:24.980> like<00:03:25.250> I<00:03:26.019> like

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019
