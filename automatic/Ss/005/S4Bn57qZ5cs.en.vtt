00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
you can just banks on it like this it it

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.420 
you can just banks on it like this it it
doesn't<00:00:21.840> go<00:00:21.930> any<00:00:21.960> high<00:00:22.320> or<00:00:22.500> low<00:00:22.769> I<00:00:22.800> don't<00:00:23.189> think

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
doesn't go any high or low I don't think

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
it's good to like get to the top so if I

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.020 
it's good to like get to the top so if I
show<00:00:32.520> like<00:00:32.669> this<00:00:33.920> you<00:00:34.920> get<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.340> top<00:00:35.520> easily

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
show like this you get to the top easily

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.920 
show like this you get to the top easily
so<00:00:37.190> yeah<00:00:38.190> it's<00:00:38.370> quite<00:00:38.700> it's<00:00:39.090> quite<00:00:39.210> nice<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.780> do

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
so yeah it's quite it's quite nice to do

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.290 
so yeah it's quite it's quite nice to do
that<00:00:40.160> that<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.280> how<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.460> craft<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:42.059> so

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
that that is how you craft it so

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.720 
that that is how you craft it so
pressure<00:00:42.570> plate<00:00:42.809> slamball<00:00:43.469> like<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.520> and

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
pressure plate slamball like that and

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.810 
pressure plate slamball like that and
you<00:00:44.820> can<00:00:44.940> just<00:00:45.059> place<00:00:45.300> them<00:00:45.450> around<00:00:45.600> like<00:00:45.870> this

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
you can just place them around like this

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.529 
you can just place them around like this
so<00:00:47.820> yeah<00:00:49.340> it's<00:00:50.340> also<00:00:50.460> good<00:00:50.760> for<00:00:50.789> going<00:00:51.149> like

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
so yeah it's also good for going like

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.689 
so yeah it's also good for going like
really<00:00:51.899> far<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.530> can<00:00:52.680> like<00:00:52.800> jump<00:00:53.100> down<00:00:53.250> and

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
really far you can like jump down and

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.260 
really far you can like jump down and
land<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:55.219> and<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.250> made<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.579> big<00:00:56.789> one<00:00:56.820> here<00:00:57.210> as

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
land on it and I made a big one here as

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.110 
land on it and I made a big one here as
well<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:58.020> when<00:00:58.620> i'll<00:00:58.770> show<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.120> another

well and when i'll show you another
example<00:01:00.329> i<00:01:00.840> made<00:01:01.109> sup<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.280> in<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.760> minute<00:01:02.879> ok

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
example i made sup that in a minute ok

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.479 
example i made sup that in a minute ok
so<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.320> next<00:01:04.350> block<00:01:04.799> i'm<00:01:05.100> going<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.309> show<00:01:05.430> you

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
so the next block i'm going to show you

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.710 
so the next block i'm going to show you
i'll<00:01:05.909> just<00:01:06.270> show<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.510> how<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.720> craft<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:08.720> come

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
i'll just show you how to craft it come

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.289 
i'll just show you how to craft it come
soon<00:01:09.990> each<00:01:10.200> side<00:01:10.439> go<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.610> middle<00:01:11.880> like

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
soon each side go to the middle like

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.280 
soon each side go to the middle like
that<00:01:12.330> instead<00:01:13.260> alkalete<00:01:14.159> collat<00:01:14.970> or<00:01:15.210> what<00:01:16.049> I

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
it does is I'll just check some some

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.520 
it does is I'll just check some some
cobblestone<00:01:32.850> here<00:01:33.270> oh<00:01:35.299> hang<00:01:36.299> on<00:01:36.390> put<00:01:37.290> on<00:01:37.409> this

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
cobblestone here oh hang on put on this

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.889 
cobblestone here oh hang on put on this
side<00:01:38.030> put<00:01:39.030> some<00:01:39.180> Commerce<00:01:39.479> down<00:01:39.630> here<00:01:41.270> and<00:01:42.270> it

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
side put some Commerce down here and it

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.410 
side put some Commerce down here and it
puts<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.259> out<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.590> other<00:01:43.680> end<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:45.060> reason<00:01:45.329> it

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
puts it out the other end the reason it

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.460 
puts it out the other end the reason it
didn't<00:01:45.570> do<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.780> once<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.320> different

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
didn't do that once is on a different

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.770 
didn't do that once is on a different
block<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.579> i<00:01:47.610> can<00:01:47.820> put<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.060> all<00:01:48.210> on<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.540> side

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
block so i can put it all on this side

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.850 
block so i can put it all on this side
and<00:01:50.299> with<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.329> redstone<00:01:51.960> power<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.649> goes

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
and with a redstone power it goes

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.969 
and with a redstone power it goes
through<00:01:53.220> it's<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.090> bit<00:01:54.270> like<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.420> dispenser<00:01:55.079> so

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
through it's a bit like a dispenser so

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:02.060 
through it's a bit like a dispenser so
now<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.969> works<00:01:57.299> for<00:01:57.450> like<00:01:57.600> any<00:01:57.810> block<00:02:01.070> like

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
now it works for like any block like

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.670 
now it works for like any block like
that<00:02:02.299> ok<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.360> now<00:02:03.659> i<00:02:03.689> will<00:02:04.049> filter<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.649> by

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
that ok so now i will filter it by

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.160 
that ok so now i will filter it by
putting<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.130> diamond<00:02:05.610> dinner<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.119> now<00:02:06.899> when<00:02:07.140> I

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
here so when I do this and that the

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.150 
here so when I do this and that the
diamond<00:02:27.930> goes<00:02:28.050> in<00:02:28.200> there<00:02:28.379> I'll<00:02:28.860> take<00:02:29.010> your

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
diamond goes in there I'll take your

diamond goes in there I'll take your
foot<00:02:29.250> out

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.910 

and<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.150> goes<00:02:36.270> in<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.600> chest<00:02:36.930> so<00:02:37.740> that's

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
and it goes in the chest so that's

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.150 
and it goes in the chest so that's
really<00:02:38.070> useful<00:02:38.340> for<00:02:39.000> like<00:02:39.800> things<00:02:40.800> I'll<00:02:41.010> give

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
really useful for like things I'll give

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.670 
really useful for like things I'll give
an<00:02:41.250> example<00:02:41.340> all<00:02:42.030> over<00:02:42.390> here<00:02:42.570> so<00:02:43.170> imagine<00:02:43.350> like

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
an example all over here so imagine like

you're going out and maybe tree cutting

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.980 
you're going out and maybe tree cutting
or<00:02:46.650> something<00:02:47.300> you'd<00:02:48.300> put<00:02:48.510> all<00:02:48.630> your<00:02:48.750> wood

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
or something you'd put all your wood

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.790 
or something you'd put all your wood
here<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.850> then<00:02:50.850> pull<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.120> lever<00:02:51.470> and<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.620> goes

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
here and then pull the lever and it goes

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.150 
here and then pull the lever and it goes
in<00:02:52.980> your<00:02:53.100> house<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:54.500> goes<00:02:55.500> into<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.890> chest

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
in your house and goes into the chest

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.570 
in your house and goes into the chest
hair<00:02:56.540> so<00:02:57.540> it's<00:02:57.810> quite<00:02:58.050> helpful<00:02:58.380> I<00:02:58.710> can<00:02:59.460> see

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
hair so it's quite helpful I can see

now i show the trap chest or chest wrap
so<00:03:08.730> this<00:03:08.910> is<00:03:09.060> how<00:03:09.180> you<00:03:09.210> craft<00:03:09.570> it<00:03:09.870> you<00:03:10.140> just<00:03:10.320> put

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
so this is how you craft it you just put

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.500 
so this is how you craft it you just put
chess<00:03:10.800> and<00:03:11.100> put<00:03:11.250> one<00:03:11.490> redstone<00:03:11.760> above<00:03:12.270> it<00:03:12.390> and

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
chess and put one redstone above it and

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.020 
chess and put one redstone above it and
I<00:03:12.660> gives<00:03:12.900> you<00:03:12.960> a<00:03:13.050> chest<00:03:13.380> strap<00:03:13.760> so<00:03:14.760> i'll<00:03:14.850> show

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
I gives you a chest strap so i'll show

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:23.720 
I gives you a chest strap so i'll show
you<00:03:15.120> how<00:03:15.150> what's<00:03:18.230> behind<00:03:21.410> ya<00:03:22.410> ok<00:03:23.190> so<00:03:23.250> when<00:03:23.610> you

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
you how what's behind ya ok so when you

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.790 
you how what's behind ya ok so when you
open<00:03:24.090> it<00:03:24.210> it<00:03:24.810> doesn't<00:03:25.020> trigga<00:03:25.380> nothing<00:03:25.650> but

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
open it it doesn't trigga nothing but

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.710 
open it it doesn't trigga nothing but
when<00:03:25.920> you<00:03:26.010> take<00:03:26.220> something<00:03:26.460> out<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:27.390> triggers

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
when you take something out it triggers

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.100 
when you take something out it triggers
the<00:03:27.840> redstone<00:03:28.380> and<00:03:29.270> so<00:03:30.270> if<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.510> put<00:03:30.630> stuff<00:03:30.870> in

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
the redstone and so if you put stuff in

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.980 
the redstone and so if you put stuff in
and<00:03:31.350> out<00:03:32.070> it<00:03:32.430> triggers<00:03:32.880> it<00:03:33.030> so<00:03:33.720> I'll<00:03:33.810> give<00:03:33.930> you

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
and out it triggers it so I'll give you

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.740 
and out it triggers it so I'll give you
the<00:03:34.020> example<00:03:34.350> over<00:03:34.740> here<00:03:35.300> so<00:03:36.300> this<00:03:36.480> will<00:03:36.690> be

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
the example over here so this will be

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.840 
the example over here so this will be
good<00:03:36.900> in<00:03:37.020> pvp<00:03:37.560> maps<00:03:37.800> or<00:03:38.040> like<00:03:38.190> adventure<00:03:38.610> maps

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
good in pvp maps or like adventure maps

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.500 
good in pvp maps or like adventure maps
so<00:03:39.570> when<00:03:39.720> you<00:03:39.810> loop<00:03:40.020> this<00:03:40.200> if<00:03:40.500> I<00:03:40.650> take<00:03:40.860> out<00:03:41.510> tnt

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
so when you loop this if I take out tnt

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.370 
so when you loop this if I take out tnt
gets<00:03:42.690> ignited

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.110 

whereas<00:03:47.040> quite<00:03:47.340> big<00:03:47.630> yeah<00:03:48.860> so<00:03:49.860> you<00:03:50.790> could<00:03:50.970> like

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
whereas quite big yeah so you could like

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.880 
whereas quite big yeah so you could like
do<00:03:51.360> some<00:03:51.540> cool<00:03:51.870> traps<00:03:52.110> with<00:03:52.290> that<00:03:53.960> oops<00:03:54.960> I<00:03:55.260> made

do some cool traps with that oops I made

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.050 
do some cool traps with that oops I made
a<00:03:55.950> pretty<00:03:56.190> kool<00:03:56.580> ok<00:03:57.500> so<00:03:58.500> now<00:03:58.710> I<00:03:58.740> will<00:03:59.060> that's

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
a pretty kool ok so now I will that's

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.410 
a pretty kool ok so now I will that's
all<00:04:00.240> the<00:04:00.360> blocks<00:04:00.600> so<00:04:01.610> again<00:04:02.610> the<00:04:02.790> fan<00:04:03.000> I've<00:04:03.210> got

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
all the blocks so again the fan I've got

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:13.040 
all the blocks so again the fan I've got
that<00:04:04.310> so<00:04:05.310> you<00:04:05.370> craft<00:04:05.940> it<00:04:06.210> like<00:04:06.990> this<00:04:11.870> any<00:04:12.870> one

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
that so you craft it like this any one

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:20.000 
that so you craft it like this any one
more<00:04:13.230> oh<00:04:13.700> there<00:04:15.890> you<00:04:16.890> go<00:04:17.570> so<00:04:18.799> you<00:04:19.799> put<00:04:19.980> a

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
more oh there you go so you put a

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.380 
more oh there you go so you put a
cobblestone<00:04:20.400> around<00:04:20.970> it<00:04:21.120> like<00:04:21.209> this<00:04:22.040> online

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
cobblestone around it like this online

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.440 
cobblestone around it like this online
like<00:04:24.390> that<00:04:24.570> and<00:04:24.750> it<00:04:25.110> gives<00:04:25.230> you<00:04:25.350> a<00:04:25.380> fan<00:04:26.450> and

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
like that and it gives you a fan and

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.990 
like that and it gives you a fan and
what<00:04:27.600> you<00:04:27.660> do<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:27.900> fan<00:04:28.110> you<00:04:28.830> place<00:04:29.070> it<00:04:29.310> like

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
what you do the fan you place it like

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
what you do the fan you place it like
this<00:04:31.550> it<00:04:32.550> needs<00:04:32.670> a<00:04:32.820> power<00:04:33.060> up<00:04:33.330> to<00:04:33.360> make<00:04:33.540> it<00:04:33.690> work

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
this it needs a power up to make it work

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.640 
this it needs a power up to make it work
and<00:04:34.380> then<00:04:35.370> like<00:04:35.780> these<00:04:36.780> particle<00:04:37.350> effects

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
and then like these particle effects

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.060 
and then like these particle effects
come<00:04:37.830> out<00:04:37.980> so<00:04:38.310> when<00:04:38.640> you<00:04:38.730> place<00:04:38.940> an<00:04:39.060> item<00:04:39.180> here

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
come out so when you place an item here

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.540 
come out so when you place an item here
it<00:04:41.070> pushes<00:04:41.610> it<00:04:42.290> like<00:04:43.290> that<00:04:43.470> so<00:04:44.190> that<00:04:44.340> can<00:04:44.520> be

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
it pushes it like that so that can be

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.240 
it pushes it like that so that can be
useful<00:04:44.790> for<00:04:45.030> like<00:04:45.330> other<00:04:46.100> inventions<00:04:47.100> of

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
useful for like other inventions of
