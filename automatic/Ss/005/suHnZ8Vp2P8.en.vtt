00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
throat and then comes to the epiglottis

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.770 
throat and then comes to the epiglottis
that's<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.250> little<00:01:02.520> flap<00:01:02.820> which<00:01:02.850> stops<00:01:03.510> food

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
stomach is right next to it so the part

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.500 
stomach is right next to it so the part
is<00:01:10.680> like<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.920> road<00:01:11.250> which<00:01:11.520> divides<00:01:12.000> into<00:01:12.270> two

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
is like a road which divides into two

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.550 
is like a road which divides into two
roads<00:01:12.890> can<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.070> see<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.430> on<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.760> picture

roads can you see that on the picture

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.039 
roads can you see that on the picture
wha-ho<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.369> interesting<00:01:17.729> yes<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.810> thought

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
into the branches that's the part which

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.450

to the air Melton well see how the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.100 
to the air Melton well see how the
branches<00:01:41.009> divides<00:01:41.400> into<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.850> two<00:01:42.030> lungs<00:01:42.329> the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
branches divides into the two lungs the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.139 
branches divides into the two lungs the
lungs<00:01:43.350> are<00:01:43.590> covered<00:01:43.950> by<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.159> special<00:01:44.700> covering

exchange carbon dioxide for oxygen then
you<00:01:54.659> can<00:01:55.079> breathe<00:01:55.409> out<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.829> carbon<00:01:56.250> dioxide<00:01:56.310> I

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
you can breathe out the carbon dioxide I

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.780 
you can breathe out the carbon dioxide I
get<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.780> now<00:01:57.960> what<00:01:58.950> about<00:01:59.100> these<00:01:59.430> things

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.770 
get it now what about these things
around<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.360> lungs

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
around the lungs

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.560 
around the lungs
those<00:02:01.380> are<00:02:01.770> your<00:02:01.979> ribs<00:02:02.219> there<00:02:03.030> are<00:02:03.180> spaces

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
those are your ribs there are spaces

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.380 
those are your ribs there are spaces
between<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:04.229> ribs<00:02:04.439> as<00:02:04.619> well<00:02:04.890> I'd<00:02:05.700> like<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.240> to

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.040 
between the ribs as well I'd like you to
look<00:02:06.600> at<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.869> two<00:02:07.079> diagrams<00:02:07.560> now<00:02:07.799> these<00:02:08.610> ones

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
look at the two diagrams now these ones

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.780 
look at the two diagrams now these ones
one<00:02:10.050> says<00:02:10.379> it's<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.679> picture<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:11.069> healthy<00:02:11.640> areas

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
one says it's a picture of healthy areas

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.890 
one says it's a picture of healthy areas
and<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.239> other<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.569> a

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
and the other is a

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.479 
and the other is a
of<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.319> person<00:02:13.709> who's<00:02:13.890> having<00:02:14.250> an<00:02:14.370> asthma

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
of a person who's having an asthma

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.750 
of a person who's having an asthma
attack<00:02:15.450> that's<00:02:15.870> right<00:02:16.349> this<00:02:17.250> one<00:02:17.580> is<00:02:17.730> a

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
attack that's right this one is a

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.729 
attack that's right this one is a
healthier<00:02:18.269> way<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.989> other<00:02:19.140> one<00:02:19.470> is<00:02:19.620> in

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
healthier way and the other one is in

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.130 
healthier way and the other one is in
asthmatic<00:02:20.069> airway<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:21.450> can<00:02:21.659> see<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.989> a

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
asthmatic airway you can see the a

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.199 
asthmatic airway you can see the a
healthy<00:02:22.500> Airways<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.370> lining<00:02:23.610> of<00:02:23.879> healthy

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
healthy Airways of a lining of healthy

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.690 
healthy Airways of a lining of healthy
tissue<00:02:24.379> the<00:02:25.379> tissue<00:02:25.409> layer<00:02:25.950> isn't<00:02:26.220> very<00:02:26.580> thick

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
tissue the tissue layer isn't very thick

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.420 
tissue the tissue layer isn't very thick
but<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.480> tissue<00:02:27.840> in<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.290> asthma<00:02:28.709> Airways<00:02:29.099> is

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
but the tissue in the asthma Airways is

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.330 
but the tissue in the asthma Airways is
thicker<00:02:29.760> isn't<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.480> yes<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.680> tissue<00:02:31.950> in<00:02:32.190> the

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
thicker isn't it yes the tissue in the

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.300 
thicker isn't it yes the tissue in the
asthma<00:02:32.760> air<00:02:32.940> was<00:02:33.150> become<00:02:33.599> swollen<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.920> muscle

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
asthma air was become swollen the muscle

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.280 
asthma air was become swollen the muscle
layer<00:02:35.519> around<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:36.060> air<00:02:36.299> was<00:02:36.540> contracts<00:02:37.170> or

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
layer around the air was contracts or

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.199 
layer around the air was contracts or
squeezes<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.099> swollen<00:02:38.519> tissue<00:02:38.790> in<00:02:39.060> the

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
squeezes the swollen tissue in the

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.119 
squeezes the swollen tissue in the
lining<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.870> air<00:02:40.019> was<00:02:40.260> swells<00:02:40.590> as<00:02:40.860> well

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
lining of the air was swells as well

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.059 
lining of the air was swells as well
this<00:02:42.030> means<00:02:42.420> that<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.900> airway<00:02:43.290> gets<00:02:43.500> narrower

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
this means that the airway gets narrower

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.610 
this means that the airway gets narrower
can<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.120> see<00:02:45.359> that<00:02:45.540> there<00:02:45.690> is<00:02:45.720> less<00:02:46.049> room<00:02:46.319> for

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
can you see that there is less room for

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.160 
can you see that there is less room for
air<00:02:46.799> to<00:02:46.980> go<00:02:47.129> through<00:02:47.160> whoa<00:02:47.940> huckle<00:02:48.720> football

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
air to go through whoa huckle football

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.680 
air to go through whoa huckle football
that's<00:02:49.799> why<00:02:50.190> your<00:02:50.459> chest<00:02:50.790> muscles<00:02:51.239> tighten

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
that's why your chest muscles tighten

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.349 
that's why your chest muscles tighten
and<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:51.989> becomes<00:02:52.410> difficult<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:53.129> breathe<00:02:53.400> you

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
and it becomes difficult to breathe you

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.780 
and it becomes difficult to breathe you
start<00:02:54.750> wheezing<00:02:55.200> when<00:02:55.379> you<00:02:55.530> breathe<00:02:55.769> in<00:02:56.040> it

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
start wheezing when you breathe in it

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.849 
start wheezing when you breathe in it
also<00:02:57.030> takes<00:02:57.510> much<00:02:57.870> longer<00:02:58.109> for<00:02:58.560> you<00:02:58.680> to

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
also takes much longer for you to

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.520 
also takes much longer for you to
breathe<00:02:59.040> out<00:02:59.280> again<00:02:59.489> our<00:03:00.150> little<00:03:00.480> hop<00:03:00.720> up<00:03:00.959> it's

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
breathe out again our little hop up it's

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.580 
breathe out again our little hop up it's
frightening<00:03:02.069> when<00:03:02.549> it<00:03:02.670> happens<00:03:03.060> isn't<00:03:03.510> it<00:03:03.870> now

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
frightening when it happens isn't it now

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.289 
frightening when it happens isn't it now
that<00:03:04.859> you<00:03:04.980> know<00:03:05.190> what<00:03:05.430> happens<00:03:05.849> during<00:03:06.060> an

that you know what happens during an
asthma<00:03:06.480> attack<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:07.590> will<00:03:07.859> make<00:03:08.069> it<00:03:08.220> easier<00:03:08.609> for
