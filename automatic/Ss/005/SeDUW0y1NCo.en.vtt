00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello to all the video today as you see 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.200
 in the title is measure of products 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.280
 finished is a pretty short video I 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.700
 I think because the truth is that I do not have 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.290
 many products but good but no 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.929
 short each time as soon as it does not 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.770
 nothing in a previous product video 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.449
 finishes 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.310
 I told you that I had finished a shampoo 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:26.699
 of the intense and abundant hair line 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:30.090
 abundant garnier sent me all the 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.550
 treatment in its day ago a lot what 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.469
 first thing to do this was the shampoo and the 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.829
 I have other products here 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:41.370
 finished at the same time these three products what 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:45.000
 which tells me that every two shampoos or 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.230
 three shampoos finished the rest not if the 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.239
 change that used more amount of 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.530
 shampoo and then for example the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.149
 conditioner is in process the 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.129
 mix with others mixed with the 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.710
 mask then we pretty 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.420
 more apart from the mask I think that 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.750
 it's quite bigger it has 400 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.280
 milliliters yes and the conditioner 250 me 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.659
 I imagine the shampoo also have 250 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.980
 and then there is this product that is the 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:12.850
 zero that has 50 milliliters 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:15.140
 in conclusion at the beginning it made me 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.030
 very much effect 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.670
 and then I kind of got used to it 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.409
 hair then I liked it very much and 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.460
 it's a life I want to repeat when 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:27.760
 I finished the 80 shampoos that I have but the 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.119
 I want to repeat as a treatment 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.759
 punctual I want to say not like a shampoo 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.200
 of frequent use nor a line of use 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.330
 frequent with a mask and the 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.880
 conditioner the truth that I do like 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.159
 a lot for frequent use but the shampoo 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.800
 I get the feeling that the hair is 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:48.140
 usually very fast then to 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.610
 use it once a week or something 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.350
 that 's fine because it maintains that 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.229
 volume in the hair the truth that has 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.229
 I liked it a lot and the serum also 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.510
 he liked it very much I do not know is a line 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.670
 what 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.230
 I do not know, I was surprised by the truth 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.950
 I'm used to sometimes use 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.960
 hair products more expensive and these me 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:15.780
 They have made the solution but perfectly 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:17.580
 salt what good that this abundant mane 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.440
 I liked it but I would like it 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.700
 also that if you have tried it because 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.840
 It is true that it has a lot of publicity 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.220
 I think it has been tested a lot 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.530
 you have proven it, you tell me that you 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.730
 It seems I do not think I'll give you the 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.200
 hair in plan super volume wild but 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.489
 yes I have noticed it compared to 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.280
 other shampoos like is to leave the 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:42.420
 much more crushed hair I finished the 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:46.040
 which it is my favorite product 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:50.640
 favorite product of manicure that is 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.650
 Milk beat and good has spent 2 what 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.790
 it happens that this one looks like I've dried 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.790
 such a thick product 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.530
 that it has dried up has more 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.040
 time and more home apart this yes that 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.750
 He has been able to take advantage of it a little more and 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.140
 the floors at the same time I am going to tell you 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.850
 a trick we appear is a product 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.830
 It costs about 11 euros something like that but 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.860
 those that lasts a lot to me the enamel me 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.930
 lasts a lot with this product in 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.970
 Ultimately I love and always 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.730
 I recommend because I really like what 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.890
 look in the cap I do not know is what you see this one 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.930
 he painted it for red enamel and then 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.020
 there is one that I only use with enamels 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.950
 red and burgundy and the other with the rest 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:39.010
 of colors because it's over 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.200
 having a little bit to be a shine myself 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.330
 maybe it has not dried out of all the 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.040
 layer and I already give the brightness then 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.660
 he has always spent a little color and 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.480
 the reds are very pigmented 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.920
 so I always have two top coat one 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.420
 for the reds and the other for the rest 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.970
 of colors 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.739
 and those orchards and that I like a lot and in 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.099
 those that I will repeat but I have already 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:03.800
 repeated I already have two others for red and 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:06.680
 another more tricolor and nail also 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.940
 finished this instant nail polish remover 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.069
 plus hands 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.810
 I like it a lot for days so I do not 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.630
 fancy 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.430
 that I do not feel like recreating better in doing 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.840
 a manicure or that for example I'm going to 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.850
 leave home and suddenly I realize 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.400
 I have all the tips chipped 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.800
 or that I have the manicure already of many 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.120
 days and it's very spoiled then I go 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.100
 to go out the door I realized and 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.230
 I say good, I do not have time to paint myself 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.850
 nail me desmaquillo superfast 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.370
 and instead it will be and good in cotton quoted 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.400
 and so on, because he usually uses these 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.530
 I always have one of these too and I do not 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.870
 is that it is spent is that it deteriorates 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.810
 already very much the foam that comes 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:47.419
 inside then ended up discarding it 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.110
 because it could continue to work but it 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:53.050
 it remains there as 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.790
 I know that you already put the nail and leave 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.680
 black pieces of sponge and that is it 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.560
 is disintegrating then that 's the 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.000
 time to change it and pick another one because 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.040
 you do not know about this type of products 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.800
 by one you remove the cap of a sponge 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.930
 and inside they will impregnate nail polish remover and not 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:11.530
 as with an immediate slit get the 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.720
 Your finger touches when you take it out as the enamel 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.610
 thanks to an invented one and I think that 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.620
 it works super well specifically this 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.090
 I really like mercadona 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.410
 almost always all my videos of 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.030
 finished products there is a product of 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.960
 rituals 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:30.370
 I like it a lot and today we have this 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:34.780
 product is the shower gel that is kind 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:37.510
 mousse that comes out then that as a mousse and 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.740
 is that of organic light milk and cherry 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:43.620
 blossom this line I love the line 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.900
 sensation 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.030
 and good because I'll always say 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.290
 I repeat already I tell you that this product almost 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.510
 always comes out in some product videos 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.699
 finished is a soap is not it either 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:56.040
 explain well so much if it's in foam 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:59.550
 from javier as well as very cool very good 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:02.370
 okay your extra stuff photo a lot 17 and for 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:05.130
 last finishes this cream product is 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:07.979
 the rowing in front of taste and I love it and 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.500
 I have already repeated I already have another I like 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:11.450
 much 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.920
 to see I'm going to the best I'm a little 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.320
 ordinary with this is that it is very difficult 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.330
 talk about an oar in front of taste 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.580
 talk about the taste of breasts and these 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:23.240
 things is a bit weird 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:27.349
 let's see is not that your chest goes up 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:29.360
 here in plan or my cut not to me does not give me 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:31.550
 the sensation that it goes up or anything 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:35.599
 this what gives me the feeling is that what 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:38.719
 reaffirms and I love the texture that 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:39.800
 leave on my skin and if the size will exist 

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:43.039
 of my breasts 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:45.860
 this is very weird but well I like me 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:47.509
 I like it a lot and I've used it to repeat 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:50.060
 what I like a lot what do you want 

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:52.460
 I tell you I like this product yes 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.289
 it is true that 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.410
 It is not a product that is a treatment 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:59.720
 it happens a little like creams 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:02.810
 firming at the time you shower 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:05.930
 the effect is passed but good to me 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:07.789
 like and I repeat and if you have tried it 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:11.199
 I would like you to tell me is that it is 

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:11.199
 difficult to talk about this product 

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.400
 I read a little the way of applied use 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.590
 morning and night with slight movements 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:21.220
 circular and ascending from the side 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:24.640
 lower breasts to the neckline 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:27.010
 well, we imagine that and finally, 

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.030
 It is already far today's video I have 

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.460
 said that it was quite correct 

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:33.100
 removing the garbage while he recorded it 

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:35.190
 I hope you liked it and both of you 

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:39.520
 the next chao 

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:45.849
 is that who speaks of tits you do not see 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:45.849
 not separated from seeds can suppose
