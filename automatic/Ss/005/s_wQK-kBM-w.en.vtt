00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:14.940
 This is my student. 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:18.119
 all right with them and then quiet beauty 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.619
 here he passed away teacher friend and 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.619
 already are caetano 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.240
 Let's go to another class and we're going 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.460
 talk about some types of 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.399
 switches and various notice here 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.440
 here we have the famous is is a 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.450
 kind of push - push because that 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.540
 the shampoo you tighten 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.250
 When you let go back to normal then 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.700
 is a campaign switch and did not have 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.460
 not even a pulse, took the steps or 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.280
 pension and left the attention yesterday came back 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.870
 to normal it did not count pulsor did 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:58.379
 it released and returned to the campaign 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.750
 we have another arrives with a driver who 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.719
 for example, there would be a return 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.170
 that 's when you pressed 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:12.420
 he closed let the tension go loose 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:16.860
 the normal tone is not beauty similar to this 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.439
 we have here, then, by the simple fact that 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.490
 you tighten it gets computed near him 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.590
 return to normal 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.720
 his signature contact here today 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.229
 to speak here you are forgiven and did 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.560
 he did it again here you do not 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.299
 need to press and re- connect 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.790
 you are usually here, there is no 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.630
 monitoring and when you go 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:45.180
 use for example is re-election momentum 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:48.420
 nor do we have here realize the time that 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.619
 I'm here, oh no, I do not even know if I'm going 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.619
 talk about this one 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.689
 the parallel switches are then 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.180
 I could parallel and have recorded lectures 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.340
 also about the installation that you 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.860
 can see this is the one searched for by 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.159
 work together with this then 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.909
 opted here is the intermediary who 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.860
 realize 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.740
 are apart details that neither comment 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.750
 enough 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.730
 not need to talk about them 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.880
 give a little straw about it here I 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.490
 I realize this here is a set alone 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.760
 plus a set of new ecc complaints from 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.020
 Simple switches like we're 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.350
 here o 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:30.520
 now only here the game over 36 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:33.370
 yesterday with your uncle only you can by 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.740
 example arrived told to do here nÃ© sr 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:42.460
 all this for an explosion lamp can 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:44.040
 dispute new eg same point in 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.810
 I do not know 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:54.450
 this one is the duckling though only a 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:57.400
 of 33 sessions three sessions of a trio and 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.190
 prefers to get their attention 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.320
 who then the parallel trio realize that 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.120
 this here has three screws 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.010
 this one does not necessarily today I am 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.740
 here's a reservation do not happen he loses 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.990
 I know but it did not necessarily come 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.960
 psy driver that the port has three 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.000
 selections bring together all the pressures I 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.080
 I have three then always look for 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.670
 thrill and then you'll see who's calling 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.920
 the driver arrives here leaves the return 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.750
 here for you the operation of this 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.480
 battle client and quickly learns 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:34.450
 right here my production team me 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:36.640
 Please respect gave me not the team 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.120
 can see too much is because it is too 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.930
 beautiful, well, let's continue our 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.930
 production team is increasing. 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.480
 remembering that everyone works with the girl 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.910
 ef 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:54.960
 although I say do not do my best 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:57.550
 I realize I'm going to put it here, oh my 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:02.320
 multimeter warrior I always put in the 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:05.350
 part of advertising give a touch of a 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.780
 Little do you give a balcony of that one. 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:11.100
 opportunity 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:14.190
 O country here I arrived in the middle and leave 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.660
 one end of the shuttle wheel 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.650
 in parallel 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:31.639
 It's like this if you do it, let's see 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:31.639
 here here and here 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:43.350
 now it's different 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:55.530
 come the end comes here in san 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:57.419
 paulo ever saw fault you command and use or 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:01.890
 intermediate in the middle 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:06.919
 he has four internet screws was the 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:13.050
 focus and neither 4 nor for example 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:16.680
 just a class recorded with details 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:20.100
 the installation of these switches will 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.650
 recording it on the channel is also only 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:27.900
 you see photo 4 our course are 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:30.630
 goals pre-trip to quito presented 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.430
 here if you want to sign with 12 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.410
 points being two parallel 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.250
 if you want on the spot with two more points 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:42.270
 to put an intermediate in the middle 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:45.120
 also called will see the internet is 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:49.710
 called focus and this is that in four 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:53.669
 screws to the files in 234 this 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.200
 here just to make reservation has 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:06:02.340
 free entry 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:05.250
 however leaving here I want to pass this 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.830
 difference between the right switches and 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:11.110
 various types of here the type of motor 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:16.000
 parallel faith comes 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:19.930
 together neither traction powder would leave between 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.540
 concern so great that I wanted to give 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.640
 to this list of ombudsmen and how the 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.800
 People work with flash video for 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.530
 Our full course is on the wire. 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.300
 this right electric class hope I 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.180
 has understood any doubts of the 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:37.420
 and this contact is you are in this 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:40.030
 lesson and dropped a video that won 

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.200
 other features aveiro and coque hug and 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:46.380
