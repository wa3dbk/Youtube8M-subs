really really hard for me and I could

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.170 
really really hard for me and I could
have<00:00:15.480> used<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.719> video<00:00:15.960> like<00:00:16.139> this<00:00:16.640> so<00:00:17.640> first<00:00:18.029> of

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
have used a video like this so first of

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.450 
have used a video like this so first of
all<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.830> have<00:00:20.420> the<00:00:21.420> kind<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:22.039> nose<00:00:23.039> ring<00:00:23.310> in

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
all I have the kind of nose ring in

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.259 
all I have the kind of nose ring in
that's<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.970> corkscrew<00:00:25.789> so<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.820> just<00:00:27.060> kind<00:00:27.240> of

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
that's a corkscrew so I just kind of

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.380 
that's a corkscrew so I just kind of
twist<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.720> out<00:00:27.900> so<00:00:28.609> it's<00:00:29.609> poking<00:00:30.060> out<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.330> my

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
twist it out so it's poking out of my

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.319 
twist it out so it's poking out of my
nose<00:00:30.570> like<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.369> and<00:00:32.369> it's<00:00:32.730> just<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:33.000> corkscrew

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
nose like that and it's just a corkscrew

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.100 
nose like that and it's just a corkscrew
so<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.820> to<00:00:35.820> get<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.059> out<00:00:36.180> just<00:00:36.210> push<00:00:36.809> straight

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
so I to get it out just push straight

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:45.619 
so I to get it out just push straight
out<00:00:39.410> from<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.530> inside<00:00:42.890> because<00:00:43.890> as<00:00:44.510> you<00:00:45.510> can

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
out from the inside because as you can

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.240 
out from the inside because as you can
see<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.930> needle<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.379> straight<00:00:46.739> for<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.010> while

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
see the needle is straight for a while

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.959 
see the needle is straight for a while
and<00:00:48.379> then<00:00:50.149> it<00:00:51.149> starts<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.539> curve<00:00:52.460> so<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.520> just

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
and then it starts to curve so you just

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.090 
and then it starts to curve so you just
want<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.239> get<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.480> straight<00:00:54.870> part<00:00:55.170> out<00:00:55.379> like

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
want to get the straight part out like

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.010 
want to get the straight part out like
that<00:00:56.340> just<00:00:57.210> kind<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.420> hanging<00:00:57.690> out<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.930> your

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
that just kind of hanging out of your

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.920 
that just kind of hanging out of your
nose<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:59.180> you<00:01:00.180> just<00:01:00.390> want<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.570> grab<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.899> like

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
it like this with the curve just like

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.760 
it like this with the curve just like
that<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:31.850> you're<00:01:32.850> going<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.090> put<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.590> this<00:01:34.590> is

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
that and you're going to put it this is

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.289 
that and you're going to put it this is
hard<00:01:35.009> because<00:01:35.159> I'm<00:01:35.369> using<00:01:35.549> my<00:01:35.640> laptop<00:01:36.119> on<00:01:36.150> a

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
hard because I'm using my laptop on a

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:45.310 
hard because I'm using my laptop on a
mirror<00:01:39.350> just<00:01:40.350> gonna<00:01:40.560> find<00:01:40.860> your<00:01:41.159> hole<00:01:41.880> ah<00:01:44.149> okay

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
mirror just gonna find your hole ah okay

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:55.140 
mirror just gonna find your hole ah okay
stick<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:46.560> there<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.070> then<00:01:47.810> twist<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:49.110> in

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.850 

just<00:01:55.750> like<00:01:55.870> that<00:01:56.050> so<00:01:56.320> it's<00:01:56.470> basically<00:01:56.710> the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
just like that so it's basically the

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.010 
just like that so it's basically the
opposite<00:01:57.160> of<00:01:57.220> what<00:01:57.370> you<00:01:57.490> just<00:01:57.520> did<00:01:57.850> and<00:01:58.810> then

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
opposite of what you just did and then

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.210 
opposite of what you just did and then
it's<00:01:59.200> straight<00:01:59.470> again<00:02:00.480> so<00:02:01.680> it's<00:02:02.680> okay<00:02:03.010> if<00:02:03.040> it

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
it's straight again so it's okay if it

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.530 
it's straight again so it's okay if it
hurts<00:02:03.490> because<00:02:05.550> before<00:02:06.550> I<00:02:06.610> was<00:02:06.790> doing<00:02:07.090> it<00:02:07.360> and

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
hurts because before I was doing it and

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.150 
hurts because before I was doing it and
it<00:02:07.690> was<00:02:07.900> hurting<00:02:08.170> really<00:02:08.440> bad<00:02:08.650> so<00:02:08.890> I<00:02:08.920> would

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
it was hurting really bad so I would

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.070 
it was hurting really bad so I would
stop<00:02:09.430> and<00:02:09.760> it<00:02:09.880> literally<00:02:10.210> took<00:02:10.540> me<00:02:10.690> like<00:02:10.840> four

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
stop and it literally took me like four

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.600 
stop and it literally took me like four
hours<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:12.550> get<00:02:12.700> it<00:02:12.820> back<00:02:12.970> in<00:02:13.290> because<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.650> don't

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
hours to get it back in because I don't

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.330 
hours to get it back in because I don't
know<00:02:15.790> I<00:02:16.170> was<00:02:17.170> too<00:02:17.290> afraid<00:02:17.470> of<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.680> pain<00:02:17.920> but<00:02:18.190> if

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
know I was too afraid of the pain but if

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.790 
know I was too afraid of the pain but if
you<00:02:18.430> just<00:02:18.610> push<00:02:18.790> it<00:02:18.820> through<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:20.170> pain<00:02:20.410> like

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
you just push it through the pain like

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.450 
you just push it through the pain like
it<00:02:21.130> doesn't<00:02:21.610> really<00:02:21.760> hurt<00:02:22.030> that<00:02:22.270> bad<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:23.460> you

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
it doesn't really hurt that bad and you

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.970 
it doesn't really hurt that bad and you
know<00:02:24.580> it<00:02:24.790> goes<00:02:24.940> in<00:02:25.320> then<00:02:26.320> what<00:02:26.560> I'm<00:02:26.680> gonna<00:02:26.770> do
