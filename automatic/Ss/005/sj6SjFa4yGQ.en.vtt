Fort Lauderdale Green Line yachts of the

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.790 
Fort Lauderdale Green Line yachts of the
only<00:00:13.710> production<00:00:14.519> built<00:00:15.120> hybrid<00:00:16.020> boats<00:00:16.500> in

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
only production built hybrid boats in

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.099 
only production built hybrid boats in
the<00:00:17.010> world<00:00:17.480> they're<00:00:18.480> absolutely<00:00:19.020> amazing

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
the world they're absolutely amazing

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.980 
the world they're absolutely amazing
they've<00:00:19.560> actually<00:00:20.100> built<00:00:20.520> over<00:00:20.850> 400<00:00:21.180> boats<00:00:21.689> in

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
they've actually built over 400 boats in

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.519 
they've actually built over 400 boats in
the<00:00:22.439> last<00:00:22.650> three<00:00:22.949> years<00:00:23.269> and<00:00:24.269> have<00:00:24.869> won<00:00:25.260> over

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
the last three years and have won over

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.589 
the last three years and have won over
30<00:00:26.099> international<00:00:26.820> awards<00:00:27.510> for<00:00:27.779> their<00:00:27.990> boats

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
30 international awards for their boats

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.720 
30 international awards for their boats
so<00:00:30.599> what<00:00:30.779> makes<00:00:30.990> these<00:00:31.289> boats<00:00:31.590> hybrid<00:00:32.070> every

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
so what makes these boats hybrid every

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.060 
so what makes these boats hybrid every
roof<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.210> filled<00:00:33.570> with<00:00:33.780> solar<00:00:34.050> panels<00:00:34.320> so

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
roof is filled with solar panels so

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.799 
roof is filled with solar panels so
you're<00:00:35.190> taking<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.640> free<00:00:35.969> sustainable

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
you're taking that free sustainable

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.069 
you're taking that free sustainable
solar<00:00:37.739> energy<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.489> we're<00:00:39.030> capturing<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.930> and

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
solar energy and we're capturing it and

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.750 
solar energy and we're capturing it and
we<00:00:40.770> were<00:00:40.829> saving<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.460> into<00:00:42.090> lithium<00:00:42.960> batteries

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
we were saving it into lithium batteries

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.880 
we were saving it into lithium batteries
so<00:00:44.760> storing<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.480> there<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:46.079> great<00:00:46.649> place

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
so storing it there is a great place

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.670 
so storing it there is a great place
that<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.129> can<00:00:47.280> run<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:48.059> electric<00:00:48.450> propulsion

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
that you can run the electric propulsion

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.799 
that you can run the electric propulsion
you<00:00:49.680> can<00:00:49.860> also<00:00:50.039> run<00:00:50.489> all<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.210> systems<00:00:51.629> onboard

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
you can also run all the systems onboard

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.520 
you can also run all the systems onboard
and<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.920> continually<00:00:53.640> renews<00:00:54.059> itself<00:00:54.530> while

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
and it continually renews itself while

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.310 
and it continually renews itself while
you're<00:00:55.710> using<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.190> boat<00:00:56.340> all<00:00:57.030> new<00:00:57.600> technology

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.330 
power and if I wanted to go to electric
propulsion<00:01:29.850> that's<00:01:30.360> real<00:01:30.570> simple<00:01:31.070> you<00:01:32.070> simply

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
propulsion that's real simple you simply

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.460 
propulsion that's real simple you simply
just<00:01:32.520> put<00:01:32.670> your<00:01:32.759> boat<00:01:32.909> in<00:01:32.939> neutral<00:01:33.360> turn<00:01:34.350> off

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
just put your boat in neutral turn off

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.359 
just put your boat in neutral turn off
your<00:01:34.500> diesel<00:01:34.920> engines<00:01:35.960> there's<00:01:36.960> one<00:01:37.170> switch

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
your diesel engines there's one switch

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.580 
your diesel engines there's one switch
switch<00:01:38.369> over<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.700> electric<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.470> then<00:01:40.470> you

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
switch over to electric and then you

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.710 
switch over to electric and then you
turn<00:01:40.770> on<00:01:40.799> your<00:01:41.009> ignition<00:01:41.159> switches<00:01:41.720> from

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
turn on your ignition switches from

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.139 
turn on your ignition switches from
there<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.590> diesel<00:01:44.250> engine<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.820> electric

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
there the diesel engine and the electric

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.179 
there the diesel engine and the electric
engine<00:01:45.329> have<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:46.020> clutch<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.380> separate<00:01:47.070> the

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
engine have a clutch that separate the

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.010 
engine have a clutch that separate the
two<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.430> them<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.790> we<00:01:48.390> just<00:01:48.600> simply<00:01:48.689> pushed

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
two of them and we just simply pushed

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.109 
two of them and we just simply pushed
into<00:01:49.140> low<00:01:49.320> power<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:50.579> off<00:01:50.790> we<00:01:50.939> go

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
into low power and off we go

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.990 
into low power and off we go
the<00:01:51.840> boat<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.140> sustainable<00:01:52.890> with<00:01:53.579> its<00:01:53.759> solar
