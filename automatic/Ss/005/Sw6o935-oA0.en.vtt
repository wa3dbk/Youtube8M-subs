soon my biggest concern with the stunt
is<00:00:20.609> wrecking<00:00:21.710> there's<00:00:22.710> really<00:00:22.890> four<00:00:23.189> ways

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
is wrecking there's really four ways

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.460 
is wrecking there's really four ways
that<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.640> could<00:00:23.699> wreck<00:00:23.970> first<00:00:24.750> most<00:00:25.230> likely

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
that I could wreck first most likely

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.380 
that I could wreck first most likely
would<00:00:25.769> be<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.130> lock<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.490> front<00:00:26.730> not<00:00:27.000> even<00:00:27.269> be

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
would be to lock the front not even be

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.849 
would be to lock the front not even be
able<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.570> pull<00:00:27.779> up<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.080> endo<00:00:28.349> because<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.740> all

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
able to pull up the endo because of all

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.439 
able to pull up the endo because of all
the<00:00:28.980> wind<00:00:29.250> forces<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.730> be<00:00:29.789> pushing<00:00:30.029> out<00:00:30.240> me<00:00:30.359> at

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
the wind forces to be pushing out me at

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.139

150<00:00:31.320> miles<00:00:31.500> an<00:00:31.710> hour<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.309> if<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.520> don't<00:00:32.579> release

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
150 miles an hour and if I don't release

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.940 
150 miles an hour and if I don't release
the<00:00:33.300> front<00:00:33.510> brake<00:00:33.719> in<00:00:33.870> time<00:00:33.930> could<00:00:34.680> very

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
the front brake in time could very

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.680 
the front brake in time could very
easily<00:00:35.010> tuck<00:00:35.610> out<00:00:35.820> from<00:00:36.000> underneath<00:00:36.210> me<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.510> I

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
easily tuck out from underneath me and I

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.090 
easily tuck out from underneath me and I
could<00:00:36.930> find<00:00:37.110> myself<00:00:37.260> sliding<00:00:37.590> on<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.890> ground

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
could find myself sliding on the ground

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.690 
could find myself sliding on the ground
before<00:00:38.219> I<00:00:38.370> knew<00:00:38.550> what<00:00:38.579> happened<00:00:40.309> the<00:00:41.309> second

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
before I knew what happened the second

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.569 
before I knew what happened the second
way<00:00:41.790> would<00:00:42.629> be<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.780> tank<00:00:43.079> slapper<00:00:43.250> I'm<00:00:44.250> on<00:00:44.430> the

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
way would be a tank slapper I'm on the

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.700 
way would be a tank slapper I'm on the
front<00:00:44.820> tire<00:00:45.000> everything's<00:00:45.600> going<00:00:45.780> fine<00:00:45.840> front

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
front tire everything's going fine front

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.410 
front tire everything's going fine front
ends<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:47.039> saw<00:00:47.280> sleep<00:00:47.610> next<00:00:47.879> thing<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.059> know<00:00:48.180> on

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
ends I saw sleep next thing I know on

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.569 
ends I saw sleep next thing I know on
the<00:00:48.600> ground<00:00:48.809> sliding<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.530> third<00:00:50.219> way<00:00:50.370> would<00:00:50.550> be

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
the ground sliding a third way would be

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.069 
the ground sliding a third way would be
for<00:00:50.940> me<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.270> real<00:00:51.539> bump<00:00:51.719> into<00:00:51.930> an<00:00:52.050> end<00:00:52.199> of

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
for me to real bump into an end of

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.290 
for me to real bump into an end of
the<00:00:53.320> back<00:00:53.800> end<00:00:54.100> of<00:00:54.190> the<00:00:54.219> motorcycle<00:00:54.519> starts<00:00:55.179> to

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
the back end of the motorcycle starts to

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.840 
the back end of the motorcycle starts to
drift<00:00:55.480> so<00:00:56.320> I<00:00:56.350> panic<00:00:56.859> let<00:00:57.159> off<00:00:57.309> the<00:00:57.429> front<00:00:57.579> brake

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
drift so I panic let off the front brake

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.579 
drift so I panic let off the front brake
causing<00:00:58.539> the<00:00:58.629> back<00:00:58.750> tire<00:00:58.960> to<00:00:59.050> come<00:00:59.199> back<00:00:59.409> down

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589 
causing the back tire to come back down

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:01.619 
causing the back tire to come back down
sharply<00:00:59.979> it<00:01:00.190> could<00:01:00.609> very<00:01:00.940> easily<00:01:01.030> clean<00:01:01.479> me<00:01:01.600> up

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
sharply it could very easily clean me up

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:03.689 
sharply it could very easily clean me up
and<00:01:01.929> over<00:01:02.079> the<00:01:02.170> handlebars<00:01:02.440> and<00:01:03.100> then<00:01:03.250> finally

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
and over the handlebars and then finally

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.820 
and over the handlebars and then finally
the<00:01:04.239> most<00:01:04.420> dangerous<00:01:04.809> worst-case<00:01:05.379> scenario

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
the most dangerous worst-case scenario

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.080 
the most dangerous worst-case scenario
would<00:01:05.950> be<00:01:06.130> for<00:01:06.430> me<00:01:06.490> to<00:01:06.520> apply<00:01:06.820> too<00:01:06.880> much

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
would be for me to apply too much

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.330 
would be for me to apply too much
breaking<00:01:07.570> once<00:01:08.320> the<00:01:08.470> back<00:01:08.619> tire<00:01:08.830> comes<00:01:09.040> up<00:01:09.159> off

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
breaking once the back tire comes up off

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.990 
breaking once the back tire comes up off
the<00:01:09.520> ground<00:01:09.640> and<00:01:09.939> to<00:01:10.240> just<00:01:10.420> go<00:01:10.619> endo<00:01:11.619> up<00:01:12.580> and

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000
