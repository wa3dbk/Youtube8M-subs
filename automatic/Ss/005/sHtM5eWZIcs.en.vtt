00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.149
 see the behavior of these two 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.149
 lg cell phones 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:14.330
 I searched for wireless network 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:14.330
 I found you have to connect if 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:30.830
 Connected I searched for a show 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:30.830
 let's upgrade again did not find 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.200
 third time did not find it now 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.129
 found the same network look there 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:53.910
 the signal underneath not according to another 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:58.980
 found connector now so it fails 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:05.040
 when connecting again 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:09.750
 upgrade the network the second time too 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:19.439
 found not again did not find 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:22.470

 new did not find the found it is 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.780
 very weak the signal he found of 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.630
 very weak some eventuality 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.680
 problem , or the inability to adapter 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.680
 wireless network this device is possible 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.680
 to connect 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:50.360
 I said that one again that is connected. 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:57.350
 to disconnect aim to connect 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:58.820
 again and has already connected has not got 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:05.540
 problem 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:06.800
 this crap here in my network two 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.690
 devices within one meter of the 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.180
 distance 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:15.170
 Come on, the network has already found the final 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:23.440
 excellent, very well, let's connect oo 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:23.440
 lg with 95 of 365 failure corner 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:36.360
 already connected what's wrong with this 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.680
 device that matters here รณ there will 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.810
 put here 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.569
 almost on top of the radio, let's see 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:52.020
 tell where it will connect O fails 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:55.280
 upgrade to see this now let's see 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.280
 believe there 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:10.690
 Here is the connector on how someone 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:14.800
 will use a device with wifi 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:18.730
 at such a distance from the impossible dictator and 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.100
 your here he is 195 is very weak 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.060
 horrible do not recommend do not buy 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.060
 terrible
