the top five Harvick and dissipated that
stop<00:00:09.929> and<00:00:10.260> I<00:00:10.500> think<00:00:10.830> what<00:00:11.010> he<00:00:11.130> did<00:00:11.160> was

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
stop and I think what he did was

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.640 
stop and I think what he did was
perfectly<00:00:12.000> legal<00:00:12.090> well<00:00:12.900> he<00:00:13.049> actually<00:00:13.200> didn't

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
perfectly legal well he actually didn't

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.350

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
complete the pen no I think even shadows

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.330 
complete the pen no I think even shadows
did<00:00:15.870> he<00:00:15.990> happen<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.619> inside<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:16.980> Jeter

coming<00:00:17.640> off<00:00:17.789> shirt<00:00:18.060> I<00:00:18.180> think<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.539> think<00:00:18.750> Harvey

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
coming off shirt I think I think Harvey

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.420 
coming off shirt I think I think Harvey
gave<00:00:19.260> that<00:00:19.439> back<00:00:19.619> because<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:19.980> think<00:00:20.039> he<00:00:20.310> was

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
gave that back because I think he was

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.210
