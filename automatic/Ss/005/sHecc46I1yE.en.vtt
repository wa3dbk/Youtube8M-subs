 no one is never justified 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:28.770
 At the point when I got some education on

 Standing in the game, the president of that very ground 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.670
 As a result, he soon becomes the chief editor 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:55.860

 I also personally 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:15.450
 I'm not on the road now , but in that part 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:19.609
 Finally, we are one degree to those who originally 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:24.409
 Can you talk about people not forbid Now 

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:27.320
 At that time, Moses was much younger than now . 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.800
 He said he'd be younger. 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.670
 Ah 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.670
 Of course 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:39.399

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:47.009
 When you are comparing pay more now, because the girls self 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.680
 Now, those issues are being used by the East, and 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.780
 The news just now that the candy man the consciousness is so dwaetneunde 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:07.860
 What is the patient's age 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:09.850
 Expect more from the people who are new than those who are already existing. 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.950
 You will have 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:16.460
 Also, those who have not got a new sentence graduate more 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.720

 And the report that will continue to follow that comparison 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:38.300
 And the juniors around them are going to keep them going. 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:42.680
 I think so. 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:47.180
 The more the problem becomes, the more 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.970
 Something needs to be done and a little about scope 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.480
 What's wrong with these things? 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.540
 I understand that I can not help it. 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.540
 Ah 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.660
 Too little time 5 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:10.489
 Even anjotgo trick would have been 15, but came to look at the production that 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.489
 Things that lead young 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:17.510
 These things are rather 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:21.849
 The more I am discriminated against 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.849
 It grows so much that I can not hold on to it.
