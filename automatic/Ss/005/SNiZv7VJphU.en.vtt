like to view I like to break down what

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.060 
like to view I like to break down what
zones<00:00:17.039> I'm<00:00:17.369> going<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.609> pass<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:18.150> buy<00:00:19.039> what<00:00:20.039> they

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
zones I'm going to pass to buy what they

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.710 
zones I'm going to pass to buy what they
are<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.789> first<00:00:21.000> one<00:00:21.210> we're<00:00:21.390> going<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.539> look

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
are so the first one we're going to look

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.970 
are so the first one we're going to look
look<00:00:22.199> at<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.880> the<00:00:23.880> flats<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:25.019> usually<00:00:25.470> you

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
look at is the flats and usually you

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.120 
look at is the flats and usually you
know<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.849> flats<00:00:27.119> consist<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.769> maybe<00:00:28.769> flares

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
know the flats consist of maybe flares

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.229 
know the flats consist of maybe flares
out<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.640> running<00:00:29.970> back<00:00:30.119> screen<00:00:30.630> passes<00:00:30.960> and

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
out to running back screen passes and

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.440 
out to running back screen passes and
things<00:00:33.239> like<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.770> usually<00:00:35.239> these<00:00:36.239> are

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
things like that usually these are

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.069 
things like that usually these are
really<00:00:36.719> quick<00:00:37.230> type<00:00:37.680> route<00:00:38.280> Sun<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.120> really

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
really quick type route Sun and really

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.400 
really quick type route Sun and really
effective<00:00:40.500> against<00:00:40.770> blitzes<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.629> things

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
effective against blitzes and and things

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.639 
effective against blitzes and and things
like<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:45.120> second<00:00:45.660> zone<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.530> we're

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
like that the second zone that we're

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.729 
like that the second zone that we're
going<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.829> look<00:00:46.980> at<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.879> short<00:00:48.660> zone<00:00:49.020> again

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
going to look at is the short zone again

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.930 
going to look at is the short zone again
this<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.449> something<00:00:51.449> used<00:00:52.699> should<00:00:53.699> be<00:00:53.789> showing

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
this is something used should be showing

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.229 
this is something used should be showing
up<00:00:54.120> there<00:00:54.360> we<00:00:54.449> go<00:00:54.570> it's<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.590> used<00:00:56.280> mainly<00:00:56.789> for

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
up there we go it's a used mainly for

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.189 
up there we go it's a used mainly for
short<00:00:57.750> passes<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:59.510> like<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.660> use<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.930> against

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
short passes I like to use it against

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.070 
short passes I like to use it against
the<00:01:01.320> blitz<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:01.890> it's<00:01:02.820> fairly<00:01:03.180> actually<00:01:03.989> it's

the blitz it's it's fairly actually it's

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.960 
the blitz it's it's fairly actually it's
really<00:01:04.350> good<00:01:04.500> against<00:01:04.860> blitzes<00:01:05.339> uh<00:01:05.369> people

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
really good against blitzes uh people

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.620 
really good against blitzes uh people
that<00:01:06.090> like<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.270> blitz<00:01:06.600> heavy<00:01:08.150> especially<00:01:09.150> from

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
that like to blitz heavy especially from

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.550 
that like to blitz heavy especially from
the<00:01:09.720> outside<00:01:10.340> usually<00:01:11.340> consists<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.909> curls

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
the outside usually consists of curls

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.700 
the outside usually consists of curls
quick<00:01:13.560> slants<00:01:14.040> really<00:01:14.760> quick<00:01:14.970> six<00:01:15.810> yard<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.290> n

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
quick slants really quick six yard and n

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.310 
quick slants really quick six yard and n
passes<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:18.090> third<00:01:18.570> zone<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.080> we're<00:01:19.200> going

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
passes the third zone that we're going

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.880 
passes the third zone that we're going
to<00:01:19.409> take<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.619> look<00:01:19.830> at<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.840> the<00:01:21.890> intermediate

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
to take a look at is the intermediate

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.859 
to take a look at is the intermediate
zone<00:01:24.229> on<00:01:25.850> here<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:26.970> go<00:01:27.060> should<00:01:27.390> be<00:01:27.509> showing<00:01:27.659> up

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
zone on here we go should be showing up

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:35.929 
zone on here we go should be showing up
now<00:01:29.960> this<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.140> more<00:01:31.380> like<00:01:31.790> your<00:01:32.790> uh<00:01:33.320> your<00:01:34.939> posts

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
now this is more like your uh your posts

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.429 
now this is more like your uh your posts
and<00:01:36.030> maybe<00:01:36.960> some<00:01:37.229> corners<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.829> whatnot<00:01:39.439> these

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
and maybe some corners and whatnot these

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.130 
and maybe some corners and whatnot these
routes<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.430> fit<00:01:41.610> into<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:42.150> zone<00:01:42.210> tend<00:01:43.020> to

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
routes that fit into this zone tend to

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.350 
routes that fit into this zone tend to
take<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.350> little<00:01:43.680> bit<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.920> time<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.549> develop<00:01:44.729> so

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
take a little bit of time to develop so

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.179 
take a little bit of time to develop so
you<00:01:45.899> want<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.140> keep<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.619> mind<00:01:46.799> if<00:01:47.009> you're

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
you want to keep that in mind if you're

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.719 
you want to keep that in mind if you're
ever<00:01:47.250> trying<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.850> look<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.930> throw<00:01:49.110> there<00:01:49.439> and

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
ever trying to look to throw there and

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.730 
ever trying to look to throw there and
then<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:51.299> last<00:01:51.540> own<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.439> we're<00:01:52.560> going<00:01:52.680> to

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
then the last own that we're going to

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.209 
then the last own that we're going to
take<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> look<00:01:53.159> at<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.409> deep<00:01:55.409> zone<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:56.040> this

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
take a look at is the deep zone and this

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.080 
take a look at is the deep zone and this
is<00:01:57.020> pretty<00:01:58.020> much<00:01:58.110> anything<00:01:59.009> further<00:01:59.610> down<00:01:59.969> the

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
is pretty much anything further down the

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.750 
is pretty much anything further down the
field<00:02:00.299> then<00:02:01.159> 15<00:02:02.159> 16<00:02:02.490> yards

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
field then 15 16 yards

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.390 
field then 15 16 yards
and<00:02:04.230> pretty<00:02:05.230> much<00:02:05.320> that's<00:02:05.440> that's<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:06.250> way

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
and pretty much that's that's the way

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.310 
and pretty much that's that's the way
that<00:02:06.640> I've<00:02:06.850> you<00:02:07.800> what<00:02:08.800> I<00:02:08.830> like<00:02:09.130> to<00:02:09.310> do<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:11.200> know

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
I'm going to take a look at a play

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.720 
I'm going to take a look at a play
that's<00:02:13.600> going<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:13.930> exploit<00:02:14.710> all<00:02:15.220> of<00:02:15.580> those

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
that's going to exploit all of those

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.350 
that's going to exploit all of those
zones<00:02:16.090> all<00:02:16.750> at<00:02:17.080> one<00:02:17.350> time<00:02:17.380> so<00:02:17.940> I'm<00:02:18.940> going<00:02:19.120> to<00:02:19.180> go

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
zones all at one time so I'm going to go

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.340 
zones all at one time so I'm going to go
to<00:02:20.700> shotgun<00:02:21.700> normal<00:02:22.090> slot<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:24.360> see<00:02:25.360> going<00:02:26.260> to

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
to shotgun normal slot and see going to

the back of the flats will be up and
just<00:05:17.090> at<00:05:17.750> this<00:05:17.990> point<00:05:18.259> I'm<00:05:18.410> cannon<00:05:18.949> directly

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
just at this point I'm cannon directly

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.310 
just at this point I'm cannon directly
on<00:05:19.610> him<00:05:19.849> and<00:05:20.030> reading<00:05:20.300> exactly<00:05:20.930> what<00:05:21.110> he's

doing and he decides to go out to cover
the<00:05:29.570> back<00:05:29.780> so<00:05:30.320> now<00:05:30.710> I've<00:05:30.919> got<00:05:31.099> the<00:05:32.080> drag<00:05:33.080> route

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:33.289 
the back so now I've got the drag route

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:35.589 
the back so now I've got the drag route
ran<00:05:33.650> by<00:05:33.800> the<00:05:33.830> receiver<00:05:34.190> coming<00:05:34.880> open<00:05:35.150> over<00:05:35.510> the

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:35.599 
ran by the receiver coming open over the

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:40.300 
ran by the receiver coming open over the
middle<00:05:35.630> um<00:05:37.030> now<00:05:38.030> here<00:05:38.810> it<00:05:39.050> kind<00:05:39.979> of<00:05:40.070> gets<00:05:40.190> a

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
middle um now here it kind of gets a

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.540 
middle um now here it kind of gets a
little<00:05:40.580> tricky<00:05:41.440> if<00:05:42.440> I'm<00:05:42.949> going<00:05:42.979> to<00:05:43.190> make<00:05:43.250> this

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
little tricky if I'm going to make this

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.279 
little tricky if I'm going to make this
pass<00:05:43.789> I<00:05:44.000> want<00:05:44.180> to<00:05:44.240> make<00:05:44.389> sure<00:05:44.419> I<00:05:44.599> lead<00:05:45.169> the

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:45.289 
pass I want to make sure I lead the

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:47.200 
pass I want to make sure I lead the
receiver<00:05:45.620> away<00:05:46.190> from<00:05:46.550> the<00:05:46.669> lime<00:05:46.880> and<00:05:46.909> the

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
receiver away from the lime and the

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.480 
receiver away from the lime and the
linemen<00:05:47.900> do<00:05:48.050> tend<00:05:48.320> to<00:05:48.380> block<00:05:48.620> downfield<00:05:48.889> some

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
linemen do tend to block downfield some

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.760 
linemen do tend to block downfield some
so<00:05:49.820> you've<00:05:50.599> got<00:05:50.780> to<00:05:50.870> be<00:05:50.960> wary<00:05:51.199> of<00:05:51.289> that<00:05:51.380> when

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
so you've got to be wary of that when

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.140 
so you've got to be wary of that when
you're<00:05:51.919> when<00:05:52.430> you're<00:05:52.520> trying<00:05:52.699> to<00:05:52.849> run<00:05:53.000> this

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
you're when you're trying to run this

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.180 
you're when you're trying to run this

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
middle like this for that matter got

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.649 
middle like this for that matter got
another<00:05:58.070> quick<00:05:58.639> little<00:05:58.940> snippet<00:05:59.870> for<00:06:00.110> you<00:06:01.659> all

another quick little snippet for you all
right<00:06:02.900> now<00:06:03.490> at<00:06:04.490> this<00:06:04.729> point<00:06:05.680> the<00:06:06.680> this<00:06:07.430> play<00:06:07.639> is

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:07.789 
right now at this point the this play is

00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:10.360 
right now at this point the this play is
attacking<00:06:08.360> this<00:06:08.630> the<00:06:09.470> safety<00:06:09.860> in<00:06:10.039> the<00:06:10.130> middle

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
attacking this the safety in the middle

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.760 
attacking this the safety in the middle
of<00:06:10.430> the<00:06:10.520> field<00:06:10.699> now<00:06:11.570> for<00:06:12.229> the<00:06:12.320> sake<00:06:12.500> of<00:06:12.530> this

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
of the field now for the sake of this

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.240 
of the field now for the sake of this
write-up<00:06:13.960> let's<00:06:14.960> assume<00:06:15.259> you<00:06:15.590> know<00:06:15.710> that<00:06:16.039> the

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.250 
write-up let's assume you know that the

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.710 
write-up let's assume you know that the
defense<00:06:16.610> is<00:06:16.759> blitzing<00:06:17.150> or<00:06:17.330> something<00:06:17.599> like

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 
defense is blitzing or something like

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.850 
defense is blitzing or something like
that<00:06:17.780> and<00:06:17.930> I<00:06:18.050> don't<00:06:18.229> really<00:06:18.380> have<00:06:18.470> a<00:06:18.590> whole<00:06:18.830> lot

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
that and I don't really have a whole lot

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.110 
that and I don't really have a whole lot
of<00:06:19.099> time<00:06:19.370> to<00:06:19.400> throw<00:06:19.789> but<00:06:20.570> as<00:06:20.810> you<00:06:21.020> can<00:06:21.110> see<00:06:21.320> here

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
of time to throw but as you can see here

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.330 
of time to throw but as you can see here
this<00:06:23.120> would<00:06:23.360> be<00:06:23.539> the<00:06:23.750> way<00:06:23.900> to<00:06:23.960> attack<00:06:24.529> this

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:25.340 
this would be the way to attack this

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.559 
this would be the way to attack this
defense<00:06:26.020> with<00:06:27.020> two<00:06:27.620> people<00:06:27.919> run<00:06:28.070> a<00:06:28.099> deep

00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:28.569 
defense with two people run a deep

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:31.200 
defense with two people run a deep
it<00:06:28.689> I've<00:06:29.349> got<00:06:29.619> my<00:06:29.800> receiver<00:06:30.460> coming<00:06:30.789> open<00:06:30.999> over

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
it I've got my receiver coming open over

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.369 
it I've got my receiver coming open over
the<00:06:31.300> middle<00:06:31.330> so<00:06:31.659> I'm<00:06:31.749> just<00:06:31.929> going<00:06:32.050> to<00:06:32.110> throw

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:32.379 
the middle so I'm just going to throw

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:34.980 
the middle so I'm just going to throw
him<00:06:32.800> a<00:06:32.830> little<00:06:33.099> dump-off<00:06:33.460> pass<00:06:33.490> and<00:06:34.059> see<00:06:34.839> what

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
him a little dump-off pass and see what

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:39.419 
him a little dump-off pass and see what
goes<00:06:35.169> from<00:06:35.619> there<00:06:36.749> and<00:06:38.069> receiver<00:06:39.069> makes<00:06:39.249> the

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:39.429 
goes from there and receiver makes the
