00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.899 
last longer for me and what I do is I
just<00:01:52.049> leave<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.560> for<00:01:52.770> as<00:01:53.549> long<00:01:53.700> as<00:01:53.759> possible

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
just leave it in for as long as possible

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.300 
just leave it in for as long as possible
and<00:01:54.479> then<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.720> wash<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:54.899> out<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.439> just<00:01:55.470> really

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
and then I wash it out and I just really

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.740 
and then I wash it out and I just really
deep<00:01:56.490> conditioned<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.060> my<00:01:57.180> hair<00:01:57.360> like<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.689> know

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
deep conditioned to my hair like I know

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.539 
deep conditioned to my hair like I know
it<00:01:57.930> says<00:01:58.110> only<00:01:58.380> three<00:01:58.740> minutes<00:01:58.860> on<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.280> but<00:01:59.520> I

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
it says only three minutes on this but I

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.179 
it says only three minutes on this but I
normal<00:01:59.969> even<00:02:00.270> for<00:02:00.299> longer<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.040> that's<00:02:02.040> my

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
normal even for longer and that's my

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.580 
normal even for longer and that's my
advice<00:02:02.280> if<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:02.670> want<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.049> use<00:02:04.049> any<00:02:04.290> kind<00:02:04.500> of

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
a small bit longer than

a small bit longer than

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
wet after the shower and it will just

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.839 
wet after the shower and it will just
kind<00:02:27.440> of<00:02:27.560> seal<00:02:27.800> in<00:02:27.950> moisture<00:02:27.980> into<00:02:28.580> your<00:02:28.670> hair

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
long time I never use any kind of heat

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.080 
long time I never use any kind of heat
protecting<00:02:51.350> spray<00:02:51.709> and<00:02:51.980> when<00:02:52.640> I<00:02:52.670> started

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
protecting spray and when I started

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.220 
protecting spray and when I started
using<00:02:53.269> they're<00:02:53.510> likely<00:02:53.750> to<00:02:53.780> see<00:02:54.080> the

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
using they're likely to see the

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.050 
using they're likely to see the
difference<00:02:54.560> right<00:02:54.709> away<00:02:54.769> and<00:02:55.280> this<00:02:55.880> is<00:02:56.000> the

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
difference right away and this is the

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.880 
difference right away and this is the
one<00:02:56.180> I<00:02:56.209> use<00:02:56.540> so<00:02:56.780> I'm<00:02:56.989> at<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.260> moment<00:02:57.530> it's<00:02:57.650> Toni

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
a lot and my advice is to get the

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.990 
a lot and my advice is to get the
damaged<00:03:45.019> ends<00:03:45.260> cut<00:03:45.560> off<00:03:45.709> and<00:03:46.040> sometimes<00:03:46.790> this

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
damaged ends cut off and sometimes this

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.699 
damaged ends cut off and sometimes this
could<00:03:47.180> mean<00:03:47.299> that<00:03:47.450> your<00:03:47.600> hair<00:03:47.840> will<00:03:47.870> like<00:03:48.290> you

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
could mean that your hair will like you

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.349 
could mean that your hair will like you
know<00:03:48.829> you'll<00:03:49.250> be<00:03:49.400> an<00:03:49.489> inch<00:03:49.670> or<00:03:49.850> so<00:03:49.880> taking<00:03:50.239> off
