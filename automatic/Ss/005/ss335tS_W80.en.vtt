00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 the ball two or three times from jacques 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.760
 straight the goal 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:11.160
 chito is missing 15 minutes 31 11 against 10 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.679
 I'm going to change the ball, let's work this out. 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.470
 ball in the quietly clip that goes 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.080
 passing a side will pass a point and the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.560
 people will have the opportunity to goal this is 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.740
 this is we are hungry for many 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.000
 things stop ball 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.019
 while we did not make a ball goal 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.610
 It seems that it is a sign that 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.410
 We 're not going to hit it. 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.350
 This is what I've been talking to them about. 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.480
 that have a car mano will happen a 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.820
 ball of this well beat we have good 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.820
 scouts will happen the goal 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.180
 it's no use getting mad 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:53.340
 thinking about that 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:56.489
 sorry and people are working 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:02.670
 just another thing and I think we 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:05.309
 we are reasonably evolving to the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.340
 right moment we have a team well 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.409
 organized and to what extent the felip 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.920
 these players who have already been confirmed 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.650
 the maico and obrari rodrigues you will have 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.330
 experience to really have a 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:24.299
 team are the players who arrived in 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.340
 beginning of the week and the monkey arrived today 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.829
 Know your companions will train 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.740
 at the beginning of the week but is a 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:36.270
 technical quality and that the 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.060
 of the possible return I already intend that 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.890
 return the ramiro the game against the ypiranga 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:48.270
 It is at least for part of the 18 the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.490
 geromel already here 10 in which two one 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.460
 week and a half may already be in the group 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:58.229
 we're going to have a little team then 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:02.189
 more competitive where young people 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:05.299
 will not be responsible and yes they have entered 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.299
 of course in the team 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.849
 Let's see if we can work and what is it? 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.470
 good that we have players there so that 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:17.190
 we can have 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:20.730
 position for certain situations 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.310
 of 1 or 1 playing and one of great 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.960
 quality that you can do can 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.690
 to modify the result, this is what people 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.510
 intending it was very difficult to start 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.160
 Sergipe hence his reaction playing it 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.900
 had asked me if I was going to ask 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.630
 for you it's just that, well I said 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.600
 It's very difficult, you said so I go. 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.360
 get there so in front of the large area 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.390
 I would arrive there in front of the goal. 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.600
 beat the other then it looks like it had 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.450
 give you a stone something will hit 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.060
 corner kick now makes a little goal 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.480
 I talked to paulo autuori he said 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.690
 so I lost a corner goal to start 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.040
 losing was almost tied with a goal by 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.470
 sideways 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.780
 therefore my son let's look at that 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.209
 people have to correct our mistakes and 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.470
 work well there the team has 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.310
 conditions that I have to work on 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.380
 my here 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.870
 mistakes happen both there and 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.360
 let's go over here was not what I 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.040
 said because I said they what 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:25.040
 I used the expression had to be like this 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.040
 because the normal thing did not happen to me
