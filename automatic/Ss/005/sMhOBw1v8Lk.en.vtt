00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.880
 hello everyone will be francesco panic 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.009
 Italian spreads are here and with barcelona 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.400
 congress and there are several innovations that 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:21.660
 nokia announced specifically here 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.449
 today we have a long and 720 on the table 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.910
 â‚¬ 520 so yours and two new ones 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.320
 b series smartphone has me 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:35.010
 announced today and then three phones 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.170
 of the same evening however of 301 that 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.520
 they are phones instead of more band 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.579
 low and we'll see which ones 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.579
 features 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.680
 let's start from the Puglia series the first that 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.140
 I show that we are talking about is the lumia 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:53.850
 722 620 is a mid-range smartphone 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.739
 which, however, fails to satisfy 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.210
 to meet all the needs of a 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.430
 young and wanting to be a public 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.160
 always connected so it has all the 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.769
 features to be appreciated 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.760
 also from those who need to have 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.560
 some 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.060
 features like a camera for 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.190
 performance example to be able to 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.190
 share photos and videos with with 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.860
 design level friends is a lot 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.020
 interesting because it is the lumia more 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.840
 thin and light existing to date 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.170
 for audi 9 mm thick is 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.930
 of 128 grams of weight so it really is 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.700
 very very light we are seeing the 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.770
 back and takes the opportunity to do 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.580
 dilate to the carl zeiss camera 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.920
 hence carl zeiss 627 megapixel lenses 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.500
 and an extraordinary opening because 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.080
 let's talk about an opening point 9 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.580
 probably the largest in existence 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.490
 on the smartphone allows us to do 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.220
 very bright photos even when 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.600
 the light conditions are not those 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.240
 best yours in the back 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.220
 we can also note that there are gods 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.290
 connectors are connectors ci 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.750
 allow you to recharge your phone 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.220
 wireless by applying a dedicated cover 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.720
 so thanks to this cover that 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.210
 obviously it goes to protect the phone 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.440
 we also manage to recharge the phone 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:15.700
 in short, wireless mode coming back 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.520
 on the phone at the front 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.890
 we see a 4 2 3 clearblack display 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.959
 inches so still generous for the 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.980
 Its convenient size to use 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:30.160
 especially in navigation and we have 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.650
 obviously all the windows ecosystem 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.600
 phone 8 and all typical applications 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.110
 of nokia for the imaging part like 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:41.230
 photo beemer smart shop is called graf e 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.209
 localization applications that a 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.560
 which of course they were used to because 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:51.790
 are those year maps year drive and gear 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.650
 transit i 720 also supports lens sites 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.519
 unfortunately here it is not pre-installed but 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.540
 however it allows me to 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.489
 basically from reality 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.850
 increased and discover the points of 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:04.130
 interest and around me this for 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:08.020
 as for the 720 we pass instead to 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.460
 watch the 520 which is a smartphone 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.810
 entry level for us in the entry sense 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.180
 level for the long series windows phone 8 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.170
 but with that it is absolutely not entry 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.240
 level in terms of features 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.680
 because here too we find the same 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.920
 processor that we have 7 20 then a 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:25.060
 512 megabyte dual core processor of ram 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.610
 and 8 gigabytes of available memory 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.530
 expandable to 60 with other 64 gb s of 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:35.960
 this in both smartphones then 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:37.370
 are 720 that the 520 the 520 is proposed 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.900
 precisely as the first price the only one 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.280
 windows phone 8 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.250
 it is a price anyway 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.050
 lower 200 euros and has an experience 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.690
 really complete smartphone because 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.670
 he also obviously integrates windows with 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.930
 excellent of all the windows ecosystem 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.520
 phone 8 all the applications that 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.590
 we have already mentioned for the lumia 720 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.780
 so hurry to make the most of it 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.180
 this phone the particular thing of the 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.600
 520 is certainly the fact of being able to 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.600
 change the body because in this case 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.400
 let's see this yellow cover but 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.940
 not a fault of a body armpit 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.000
 surrounding the phone I can 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.930
 remove it can then access the 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.720
 battery and therefore may possibly 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.040
 change it if I'm interested I can access it 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.040
 in the compartment of the micro sim 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.480
 and then the microsd at this point 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.210
 I decide for example to put a new one 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.750
 a new red body in this case 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:35.120
 so I'll buy a red body in 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.830
 store and the phone becomes to this 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.510
 point becomes a new phone and in 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.300
 this case is a red phone is a lot 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.080
 convenient if I want to 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.290
 personalize mine as much as possible 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.810
 phone on an aesthetic level both in the case 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:51.380
 in which it ruins a for example scratch 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.970
 original cover or falling maybe me 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.500
 in this case it really breaks the navel 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.690
 new 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:01.630
 that the whole body is completely 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:03.100
 instead we see the reminder instead 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.340
 a moment the colors of both but 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:09.190
 we have in this case and 720 was so 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.930
 let's see here and blue or cyan though 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.460
 we obviously also have black and white 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.190
 yellow and red then five colors 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.350
 same thing available for the 520 also 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.800
 for him they are available to the five 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.420
 different colors but let's go to the new 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.520
 iphone 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:29.440
 this is the nokia 301 is a 3g phone 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.669
 so anyway we are talking about a 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.000
 phone that does not give up the 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:36.340
 connectivity because the 3g allows us to 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.480
 connect to the internet very quickly 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.410
 and it's the first nokia dual sim phone 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.760
 sign up in single simeto version 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.120
 asean which also supports 3g then 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:49.000
 I can buy a 3g dual phone 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.490
 sim only one 325 moon per mine 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.669
 glassing the other in 3g sweaty to the other 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:56.320
 instead it is the peculiarity of this 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:57.940
 phone takes full advantage of 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:01.660
 connectivity potential therefore 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:03.460
 being a 3g to a browser then that l 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.190
 express browser pinotti that allows both 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.400
 to use youtube for example of di 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.930
 see the video on youtube that of 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.400
 browse fast thanks to a 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.120
 browser thanks to the compression of 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.860
 data 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.330
 in addition to this it has a camera from between 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:17.760
 vico 2 megapixel then in the network of 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.229
 make the most of quality too 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.760
 phone multimedia and how you notice 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:24.640
 there are elements of design that 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.410
 the telephone was taken up in this 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.110
 which recall the lumia series for example 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.490
 the posterive plaque of the camera 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.900
 remember very much indeed it is taken 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.780
 practically from stretched event of the 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.600
 1900 so with this phone we go 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.520
 to approach in terms of design 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:42.040
 mobile phone to our entire series 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.200
 lumia in terms of 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:47.500
 in terms of design, here too the colors 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:50.080
 colors we find you see the magenta the 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:52.390
 black and white but there are also the already 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.010
 all these colors are blue 

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.960
 are available not only for the 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:58.420
 long series but also for our 1 bari 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.760
 last thing we talk about services a 

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.830
 he had cited as far as he was concerned 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.150
 Lumia smartphones today was 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.430
 also announced the fact that it is 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:10.060
 can download the applications of 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:12.130
 arma p's the hard drives and transit for 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.630
 all windows phone 8 phones then 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.400
 also the phones of other brands that 

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.350
 surpassed however integrates windows phone 8 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.730
 I can't download these now 

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.470
 applications and use of services 

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.820
