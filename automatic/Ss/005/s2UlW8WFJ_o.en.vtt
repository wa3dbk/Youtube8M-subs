00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.719
 Polynesians hello today I will teach 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:11.500
 how to make nails with stamps so super 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.740
 pretty 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.750
 a cut with varnish base and color 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.689
 based on transparent tests the uses 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.579
 a cotton and acetone we are going to put a 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.470
 little acetone or nail polish remover in the 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:26.400
 cotton to clean our nails 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.630
 now let's use red varnish 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.740
 we apply the varnish in all our 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.500
 nails as we normally do 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.809
 since I finished painting my nails 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.430
 red color we will use 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.860
 transparent bernÃ­s I'm going to use 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.420
 transparent varnish on the other hand for 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.730
 that you see two different ways of 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.530
 use the little children in your nails 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.860
 you can paint both hands of a 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.100
 just color in secret so we can stay 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.160
 we will go 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:58.320
 and then it's a kit that comes a plate 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:01.989
 of designs a scraper and a sealer 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.699
 this these 3 is a kit and you can 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.250
 get in any nail store 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.710
 any for our red varnish 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.840
 we are going to use a white so that 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.299
 see and then until the last we remove it 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.310
 note first let's put some 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.860
 her nail varnish on the plate 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.049
 designs you do not have to cover all the 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.030
 design because then we will use 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:25.090
 the scraper to remove the excess 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.369
 enamel now the seal we put it 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.950
 over the enamel and then in our 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:34.450
 nail clean every time you use a 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.610
 sealer and you and your scraper clean it 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.009
 this is very easy to do is like 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.490
 we put crimes on a sheet of paper 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:45.929
 but with nail polish on our nails 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.929
 we do the same with the other nails 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.670
 cotonete as we used the 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.590
 to put some acetone and we're going to 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.660
 clean all our contour of our 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.420
 year since it happens because we paint with 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.400
 the sushi itto use cotton swab to make it 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.270
 easier to clean your contour of your 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.909
 hands 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.909
 and so are our nails are cebritas 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.380
 and our red base and our 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.380
 white followers 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.069
 Now let's put the cocks of 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.620
 our transparent base can use 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.260
 varnishes of colors that are stronger 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.660
 because they are very very notorious we are going to 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.910
 use our flowers let's paint 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.450
 which I'm going to do in various colors 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.450
 this 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.690
 and we 're going to put it in our girl 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.690
 why 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.380
 the little children that reach because I see 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.050
 I have one left over because it's because I do not 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.480
 I have my fingers so thick and so 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:50.330
 from his first follow 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.330
 and now I'm going to use a red color 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:59.290
 and then and so you can touch the 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.390
 seal and already that is already dried 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.540
 immediately when you put it on 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.860
 your finger 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.860
 let's use a pink color 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.930
 you 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.629
 Y

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.720

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.540

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.920
