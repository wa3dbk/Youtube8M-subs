00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.180 
mean I thought you don't want to send my
dad's<00:00:33.899> at<00:00:33.960> all<00:00:34.079> times<00:00:34.290> it's<00:00:34.890> really

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
dad's at all times it's really

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.880 
dad's at all times it's really
irritating<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:36.390> um<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:37.290> think<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.800> a

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
irritating so um I think this is a

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.290 
irritating so um I think this is a
really<00:00:38.190> neat<00:00:38.430> idea<00:00:38.820> using<00:00:39.350> legacy<00:00:41.149> here<00:00:42.149> are

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
really neat idea using legacy here are

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.500 
really neat idea using legacy here are
some<00:00:42.450> clips<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:43.020> how<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.440> use<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:44.390> first<00:00:45.390> we

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
some clips of how to use this first we

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.080 
some clips of how to use this first we
download<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.020> app<00:00:46.140> called<00:00:46.500> legacy<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.129> then

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
download the app called legacy and then

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.619 
download the app called legacy and then
you<00:00:48.149> download<00:00:48.660> joypad<00:00:49.620> connect<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.520> it's<00:00:51.390> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
you download joypad connect and it's the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.029 
you download joypad connect and it's the
it's<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.989> idea<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.379> basically<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:53.010> just

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
it's the idea that basically it just

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.100 
it's the idea that basically it just
connects<00:00:53.460> up<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.210> can<00:00:54.360> customize<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:55.020> as

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
connects up and you can customize it as

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.549 
connects up and you can customize it as
well<00:00:55.520> right<00:00:56.520> now<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:57.030> have<00:00:57.420> got<00:00:57.449> an<00:00:57.960> n64

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
well right now I have got an n64

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.590 
well right now I have got an n64
controller<00:00:59.520> and<00:01:02.059> you<00:01:03.059> can<00:01:03.210> choose<00:01:03.449> different

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
controller and you can choose different

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.880 
controller and you can choose different
ones<00:01:04.580> you<00:01:05.580> can<00:01:05.760> also<00:01:05.880> have<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.890> gameboy

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
ones you can also have a gameboy

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.380 
ones you can also have a gameboy
controller<00:01:10.280> and<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.400> can<00:01:11.520> also<00:01:11.640> have<00:01:11.850> snares

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
controller and you can also have snares

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.350 
controller and you can also have snares
controller<00:01:12.960> which<00:01:13.229> looks<00:01:13.500> quite<00:01:13.860> mad

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
controller which looks quite mad

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.920 
controller which looks quite mad
actually<00:01:15.360> that's<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.630> what's<00:01:15.750> quite

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
actually that's and what's quite

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.120 
actually that's and what's quite
tempting<00:01:16.320> actually<00:01:16.619> i<00:01:16.680> might<00:01:16.799> go<00:01:16.950> over<00:01:16.979> that

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
tempting actually i might go over that

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.999 
tempting actually i might go over that
more<00:01:17.820> button<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.180> n64<00:01:18.560> go<00:01:19.560> there's<00:01:19.860> more

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
more button to the n64 go there's more

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.580 
more button to the n64 go there's more
buttons<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.430> n64<00:01:21.320> that's<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.380> good<00:01:22.530> idea

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
buttons in the n64 that's a good idea

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.499 
buttons in the n64 that's a good idea
okay<00:01:23.009> go<00:01:23.159> with<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.400> snares<00:01:23.759> next<00:01:24.299> time

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
okay go with the snares next time

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.969 
okay go with the snares next time
because<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.470> have<00:01:25.860> four<00:01:26.220> buttons<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.979> and

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
because you have four buttons and and

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.450 
because you have four buttons and and
it's<00:01:29.700> quite<00:01:30.030> cool<00:01:30.360> because<00:01:30.630> um<00:01:31.189> yeah<00:01:32.189> it's

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460

it's quite cool because um yeah it's
quite<00:01:32.700> cool<00:01:32.850> because<00:01:33.079> there's<00:01:34.079> more<00:01:34.200> choice

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
quite cool because there's more choice

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.810 
quite cool because there's more choice
because<00:01:34.619> I'm<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.829> n64<00:01:35.159> controller<00:01:35.579> which<00:01:35.729> I

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
because I'm the n64 controller which I

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.190 
because I'm the n64 controller which I
had<00:01:35.939> before<00:01:36.270> which<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.509> have<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.659> switch<00:01:37.020> back

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
had before which I have to switch back

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.950 
had before which I have to switch back
to<00:01:37.259> now<00:01:37.560> because<00:01:38.360> that's<00:01:39.360> what<00:01:39.509> my<00:01:39.600> default

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
to now because that's what my default

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.450 
to now because that's what my default
was<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.320> memorized<00:01:41.540> okay<00:01:42.540> so<00:01:42.600> let's<00:01:43.590> create

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
was it memorized okay so let's create

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.100 
was it memorized okay so let's create
new<00:01:44.640> world<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.240> idea<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.720> I'm<00:01:45.869> using

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
new world so the idea is that I'm using

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.749 
new world so the idea is that I'm using
the<00:01:46.320> mouse<00:01:46.530> with<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:48.509> also<00:01:48.960> called<00:01:49.290> roto

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
the mouse with the I also called roto

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.520 
the mouse with the I also called roto
our<00:01:50.759> car<00:01:51.180> is<00:01:51.329> called<00:01:51.570> now<00:01:51.720> it's<00:01:52.409> not

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
our car is called now it's not

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.410 
our car is called now it's not
rotoscoping<00:01:53.189> it's<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.810> Photoshop<00:01:54.810> method

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
rotoscoping it's a Photoshop method

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.889 
rotoscoping it's a Photoshop method
let's<00:01:57.420> make<00:01:57.570> new<00:01:57.780> world<00:01:59.509> you<00:02:00.509> know<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.659> mean

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
let's make new world you know I mean

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.060 
let's make new world you know I mean
this<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.979> movement<00:02:02.340> things<00:02:02.579> the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
this the movement things the

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.760 
this the movement things the
you<00:02:05.880> know<00:02:05.970> we<00:02:06.090> never<00:02:06.150> use<00:02:06.450> move<00:02:06.870> an<00:02:07.020> iphone<00:02:07.470> you

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
you know we never use move an iphone you

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.859 
you know we never use move an iphone you
can<00:02:07.800> tell<00:02:08.220> which<00:02:08.460> way<00:02:08.640> you're<00:02:08.759> moving<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.179> okay

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869
