00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.730
 hello I'm Claudia from blog ave educate 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.039
 from our youtube channel birds educate 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.919
 here we are to make some hearts 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.869
 chocolate white chocolate rich the 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.849
 particularity is that this chocolate if 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.770
 harden you will see that it is very 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.770
 well we can almost imagine that we are 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.290
 enjoying a real chocolate in 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.090
 what you have to keep in mind is that 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.670
 it's for from cruise phase because 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.129
 we are using tolerated in one is the 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.739
 defatted cocoa and another one that is milk 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.350
 skimmed though the milk powder that 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:49.089
 we use is skimmed that has a little 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.159
 more carbohydrates than milk 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:53.319
 skimmed normal the liquid so 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:54.609
 let's be cautious you will know that 

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:56.379
 we will use for each of the 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:58.780
 chocolates 5 tablespoons of milk 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.870
 skimmed so try to eat them for 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.579
 at least in two days because good for 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.950
 more than anything to not abuse this 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.590
 tolerated let's see the ingredients 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.780
 what we need we will need for each 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.159
 one of the chocolates 5 tablespoons of 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.560
 skimmed milk powder 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:19.130
 three tablespoons of skimmed milk 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.590
 liquid and three teaspoons of 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.539
 liquid sweetener and a sheet of 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.740
 neutral gelatin that will drench and 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:29.450
 hydrate in water and then we're going to 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.240
 dissolve in the same milk that we will use 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.670
 and hot we are going to put him for the 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.490
 black chocolate one teaspoon of tea 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.859
 defatted cocoa and for chocolate 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.810
 white three essence drops of 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:44.390
 white chocolate and this is a brand 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.459
 German is bar marked expensive ma 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.829
 it is not difficult to get this essence 

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:51.500
 and I advise you to look for it houses 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:54.140
 pastry specialty houses let 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:59.580
 then to do it you will see that it is very 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:02.420
 easy and let's do both at once 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.610
 for you to see 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.439
 that we can have it ready in a few 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:11.319
 we are going to put then the 5 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:11.319
 tablespoons of milk in each 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.290
 I'm already warming my milk 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:23.790
 the milk 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:26.099
 natural and liquid if I have it right here 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:31.680
 hot is a little bit and then I'm going to 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:35.510
 put the two sheets of gelatin that 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.510
 he was already here treating 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:43.610
 and we are going to dissolve it 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:46.750
 It is a leaf for each chocolate 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.750
 we dissolve 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.750
 notice that it is completely liquid 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.270
 then I will add it go adding 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.770
 a spoonful to each one to make sure 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.770
 that both have jellies 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.830
 we have been a little bit 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.200
 and we can use it in the case that 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.239
 we need a little more liquid 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.989
 let's take the tablespoons of 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.989
 sweetener 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.460
 we said 3 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.790
 you can always put less if you do not 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.690
 like so much 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:35.020
 and then now we will use 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:37.090
 the droplets of essence 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.380
 you have to be very careful when the 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.090
 put 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:45.130
 and this is going to be the white chocolate 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.130
 we are going to use just droplets 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.999
 let's put a teaspoon so that 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.999
 be easier 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.080
 and 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:05.629
 remember that essences you should always 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:05.629
 try better with less than with more 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.330
 because if we have too much flavor left 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.490
 essence will be very artificial 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.590
 gives off a delicious aroma 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:21.959
 and now then we will put a 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:25.230
 teaspoon of the bitter cocoa to the other 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.420
 part of the recipe that we are making 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.030
 also as I tell you if you want to 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.980
 you can put more if I'm going to put one and 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.420
 half 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.460
 so that it is a little stronger 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.720
 so now what we are going to do is 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.720
 simply mix 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.910
 and this is very easy 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:47.510
 remember that since it has jello also 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:49.940
 you assure yourself that a little bit before 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:53.200
 harden we are going to add little to 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.200
 little the rest of the milk 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.820
 Well , here we have finished, look 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.160
 this is the consistency that has to 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.410
 have not worry if you want some 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.750
 group because that later you do not notice 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:10.479
 when we are both cooling when 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.880
 hardens and if you see that you need a 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:14.860
 little more milk as I told you then 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.530
 throw the milk you need until you 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.630
 wants' this consistency because of this 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.370
 way is how are we going to put it in 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.620
 our molds 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.360
 I am using a silicone mold 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.760
 so it's very easy, you know that 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.720
 It is demold in this way it is very easy 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:34.510
 then let's go putting 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.710
 a thin layer we do not want to be left 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:39.350
 very thick 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.660
 paying attention that I know that it fills up well 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:44.900
 on the edges milestones so that we stay 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:47.860
 the shape of the heart more or less look 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:50.259
 which is a spoonful 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.819
 for each one of the chocolates because we 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.909
 come on you do not know what to do that we 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:56.860
 are thin to be able to join two 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:58.689
 let's then complete and complete 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.300
 in half white chocolate half 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:04.120
 of black chocolate we will take 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.849
 the fridge for about an hour 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.900
 until you see that they have hardened 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:10.750
 we completely do not need to take them 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.069
 to the freezer in the fridge is fine 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.409
 because this later we will be able to 

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:16.840
 use in other cakes or desserts and if you're 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:19.150
 frozen we could only eat it 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.759
 frozen then we do not get the video like this 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.590
 that we take it for an hour in the 

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:25.569
 fridge and then after we go back and I'll go 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.689
 show the way we unmold and 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:30.569
 arm them 

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:34.009
 very well let's see how they have been what 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:38.729
 I told you we are going to unmold them 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:43.789
 look, they are very hard 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:43.789
 and we're going to take one and one 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:51.490
 and we are going to put on a plate 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:51.490
 see how good they have been 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:58.430
 we can unite itself 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:58.430

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.759
