00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:09.440
 good afternoon anna fast men vladislav i 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.210
 I am a trainer and crossfit today 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.340
 we are on vkontakte festival 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.650
 today's video will be on the feeders 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.300
 exercises to the exit on the rings 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.460
 or in gymnastics this exercise 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.349
 called lifting swoop forward given 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.529
 exercise I would like to divide into two 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:27.560
 The main unit is a move itself and already 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.810
 the final part is the exit on the very 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.199
 Deal max is not such a difficult exercise 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.239
 as it seems first you must 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:37.239
 disable active shoulders I'm about it 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.949
 explained in previous videos 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.739
 strain the bark muscles strain the buttock 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:44.870
 leg muscles should be together and start 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.510
 swing with a minimum amplitude 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.969
 to increase the amplitude in moss 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.000
 the movements need to focus on two 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.710
 things the first main movement should 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.460
 occur exactly in the shoulder area 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.440
 joint and in no case need to bend 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.140
 pelvis should always be tense 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.990
 second and not in any way when driving 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.090
 back does not need to bend his legs because 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.490
 it creates excessive compression in 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.680
 lumbar spine area 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.610
 some videos suggest watching 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.340
 only forward 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.409
 especially when you go back on the very 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.869
 there is no fundamental difference 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.360
 however, in some cases, unnecessary 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.670
 neck muscle tension is not always helpful 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.799
 if the change of direction is not 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.020
 leads to destabilization of the shoulder 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.619
 the joint during the execution of the flywheel 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.570
 movements 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.450
 what not to pay attention to it 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.000
 when you have mastered the swinging movements you can 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.770
 go to casting cases 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.740
 horizontal driving position 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.539
 forward when mighty back can be diluted 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.850
 hands a little apart it will 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:47.479
 most convenient when doing flywheels 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.810
 movements 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.750
 however first they are worth relaxing 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.850
 shoulders when you spread your arms 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.640
 body back so there is no jerk 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.299
 forward moves is first 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.189
 the second 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.399
 in no case should not bend 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.289
 lower back thereby kicking your legs and so 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.509
 I recall a few nuances regarding 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.489
 march of on rings first you must not 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.530
 relax your shoulders when you make magician 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.650
 forward and also in the rearmost 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.439
 position you are not 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.180
 should relax the second when you 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.709
 make the magician go ahead he must be made 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.720
 the whole body is not worth bending 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.269
 legs in the knee joints because 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.459
 subsequently it will reduce the flight up 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.079
 now let's talk about the second part of the outputs 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.750
 on the rings this is the so-called cast 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.879
 pelvis up or movement resembling 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.519
 undermining a heavy athletic jerk 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.829
 so first you need to try 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.450
 pull up on the rings but not including 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:44.129
 hands only by the pelvis 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:46.139
 it looks like so please 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.790
 attention to the fact that the shoulders should not 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.750
 stay down when doing 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.069
 pelvic movement 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.930
 that is, you get something 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.090
 wavy movement begins after 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.180
 pelvic count and then follow him shoulders 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.879
 second when you got it 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.889
 pulling up now let's try to fly out 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.579
 as high as possible so that the shoulders are above 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:11.040
 rings 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:13.109
 I'll show you what it looks like if you 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.659
 do right that is movement with the pelvis 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.069
 quite active then your legs 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.290
 I will fly over the stand 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.959
 now for the next move you need 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.120
 take a deep hold on how it is done 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.370
 here is the ulna 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.829
 there is a small bump and here we see 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.949
 behind him is a small hole in essence a shaft 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:34.169
 rings should be here in this fossa 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:36.629
 maybe you'll hold a little deeper 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:38.430
 but it's not scary now you need 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.440
 take a deep hold and did it all 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.690
 same but throw shoulders as much as possible 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.620
 more up and forward it looks 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.620
 in the following way 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.980
 Now you need to understand how to behave 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.550
 rings when performing a directly 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.380
 output 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.970
 the previous exercise could 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.030
 notice that the rings are maximized 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.520
 90 degrees if so will you 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.950
 go to the rings then the exit itself you have not 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.980
 get rings should turn 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:11.340
 as much as possible and cuddle up to the body 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.050
 in some videos recommends delay 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.480
 rings directly to the stomach 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.579
 or chest oh actually it depends 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.769
 solely on how good to be 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.959
 work out too if you fly in 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.760
 high above the rings it doesn't matter where 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.680
 you will have rings here or here 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.060
 now directly in this position 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:35.130
 when the legs are on the cabinet 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:37.020
 need to try to make a way out so 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.540
 when did you get this one 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.970
 called blasting using thumbs 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.700
 Now you need to try to combine both 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:47.310
 parts of which I told by doing 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.080
 full output on the rings like 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.000
 remember the first part when you do 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.690
 magician go straight ahead to horizontal 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.630
 provisions 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.150
 so should be a little down then you 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.600
 do this undermining throw pelvis and 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.910
 it depends essentially on how sharply from 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.220
 you brush and how sharp you 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:08.760
 go elbows over the rings you need 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.620
 press the rings to yourself and in principle for 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.720
 this will be accomplished by 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.600
 rings in the next video we 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.340
 talk about a few other exercises 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.970
 on rings that will also be you 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.040
 helpful 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.060
