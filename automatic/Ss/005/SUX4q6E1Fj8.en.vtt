00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
like that into a triangle and my crazy

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:32.269 
like that into a triangle and my crazy
casita<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:25.109> x<00:00:28.279> plus<00:00:29.279> x<00:00:30.980> coordinates<00:00:31.980> like

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
casita the x plus x coordinates like

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.040 
casita the x plus x coordinates like
that<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.759> would<00:00:32.880> be<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> first<00:00:33.329> time<00:00:33.600> but<00:00:33.809> if<00:00:33.899> it

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
want to have it is right the plus sign

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.930 
want to have it is right the plus sign
on<00:00:38.129> them<00:00:39.710> you<00:00:40.710> grab<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.129> one<00:00:41.309> side<00:00:41.760> right

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
on them you grab this one side right

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.990 
on them you grab this one side right
here<00:00:42.120> put<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:42.989> towards<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.440> middle<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.010> then

do that to the sides next one really you

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.979 
do that to the sides next one really you
could<00:00:48.809> actually<00:00:48.989> use<00:00:49.379> any<00:00:50.010> side<00:00:50.760> but<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.629> only

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
could actually use any side but it only

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.930 
could actually use any side but it only
could<00:00:52.320> be<00:00:52.350> soon<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.120> then<00:00:55.219> you<00:00:56.219> fold<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.789> like
