 canon eos 5d sr it's full frame 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.170
 SLR cameras crafted 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.970
 especially for taking pictures 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.850
 super high resolution as in canon 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.880
 eos 5d with full-frame 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.660
 image sensor with a size of 24 by 36 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.890
 millimeter and resolution 50.6 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.320
 megapixels but with this camera you can 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.840
 achieve even higher resolution images 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.600
 and here is used modernized 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.550
 low pass filter on the matrix 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.890
 the low pass filter is practically in 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.719
 each chamber it artificially reduces 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.730
 image sharpness to avoid 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.250
 special distortions which are called 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.010
 moire moire occurs when laying 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.760
 regular image textures on the grid 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.579
 pixels 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.429
 if this filter is replaced 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.230
 won and how it is done canon eos 5d 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:00.300
 detail images will increase but 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.640
 there will be a risk of moire 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.860
 therefore we recommend their camera 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.780
 only a professional photographer who 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.320
 it is important to maximize him sharpness to 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.240
 printing up to a0 format is not a problem 50 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.399
 megapixels come in handy and the studio is not 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.039
 language lamp and in stock photography 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:19.830
 but let's not forget canon eos 5d 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:21.960
 sr has a heat and moisture protection so that 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.939
 Landscapes on this camera can also be shot 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.100
 in this camera everything is directed 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.909
 mother we get as sharp as possible 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.920
 Photo 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.890
 mirror mechanism have a special 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.330
 vibration control system 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.360
 helping to avoid micro oiled 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.360
 snapshots 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.330
 autofocus system consists of 61 points 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.850
 which cover a large frame area 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.280
 so almost any plot can be 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.479
 remove without transcoding to the maximum 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.209
 precise focus 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.970
 in addition to the services of the photographer system 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:55.100
 intellectual movement and 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.800
 object grounds this technology 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.440
 use information about faces and colors 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.720
 to track from the wind 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.880
 moving within the frame despite 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.610
 unusually high resolution canon 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.899
 eos 5d cheese is a reflex camera with 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.360
 all his virtues 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.820
 for example the speed of syria is light in full 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.880
 Resolution is up to 5 frames per 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.400
 give me a sec

 quick access menu canon eos 5d page 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.050
 Now you can customize compliance with 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.300
 photographerâ€™s needs and size and 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.630
 the location of the icons on the screen choose 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.880
 you 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.680
 for recording snapshots so high 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.910
 permissions and here two are used 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.670
 card slots 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.590
 one format and bend another compact flash 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.810
 writing to memory cards can 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.550
 be carried out in parallel 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.080
 sequentially or section 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.330
 name with a computer applied 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.730
 speedy interface and beaten renolit 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.340
 and of course the camera records logically 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.550
 video at up to 30 frames per second 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.090
 In addition, the camera can record 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.180
 interval video 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.590
 canon eos 5d sr it's powerful but 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.030
 quite difficult to work 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.190
 professional tool 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.410
 therefore, we recommend this camera only 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.930
 professional photographer who 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.500
 know exactly how to uncover all her huge 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.500
 potential and
