I'm<00:00:47.670> doing<00:00:47.910> now<00:00:48.440> I've<00:00:49.440> taken<00:00:49.680> these<00:00:49.920> pieces

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
I'm doing now I've taken these pieces

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.729 
I'm doing now I've taken these pieces
and<00:00:51.149> I'm<00:00:51.360> sticking<00:00:51.870> them<00:00:51.989> inside<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:53.390> these

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
and I'm sticking them inside of these

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.779 
and I'm sticking them inside of these
I'll<00:00:55.739> show<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.010> how<00:00:56.100> that's<00:00:56.280> done<00:00:58.670> so<00:00:59.670> when

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
I'll show you how that's done so when

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.459 
I'll show you how that's done so when
you<00:00:59.850> put<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.120> all<00:01:00.239> together<00:01:00.360> it<00:01:01.140> looks<00:01:01.199> like

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
you put it all together it looks like

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.279 
you put it all together it looks like
this<00:01:01.879> which<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:02.910> basically<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.989> exact<00:01:04.259> same

00:01:04.279 --> 00:01:04.289 
this which is basically the exact same

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:07.190 
this which is basically the exact same
thing<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:05.149> just<00:01:06.149> a<00:01:06.240> lot<00:01:06.450> stronger<00:01:06.899> and

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
thing is this just a lot stronger and

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.850 
thing is this just a lot stronger and
hopefully<00:01:08.780> hopefully<00:01:09.780> my<00:01:10.080> only<00:01:10.350> weak<00:01:10.530> part

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
hopefully hopefully my only weak part

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.730 
hopefully hopefully my only weak part
will<00:01:11.760> be<00:01:11.880> these<00:01:12.200> even<00:01:13.200> though<00:01:13.290> these<00:01:13.530> are<00:01:13.680> the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
will be these even though these are the

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.960 
will be these even though these are the
ones<00:01:13.920> I've<00:01:14.070> been<00:01:14.100> running<00:01:14.610> up<00:01:14.729> on<00:01:14.850> my

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
ones I've been running up on my

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.510 
ones I've been running up on my
transmission<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.070> these<00:01:17.070> are<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.340> new<00:01:17.490> ones

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
transmission and these are the new ones

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.230 
transmission and these are the new ones
you<00:01:18.090> can<00:01:18.960> see<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.439> those<00:01:19.619> are<00:01:20.100> nice<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.759> they

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
you can see that those are nice and they

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.380 
you can see that those are nice and they
fit<00:01:21.509> really<00:01:21.689> snug<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.200> there<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:23.250> my<00:01:23.880> old<00:01:24.119> one

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
fit really snug in there and my old one

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.570 
fit really snug in there and my old one
is<00:01:24.869> kind<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.500> starting<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.830> oval<00:01:26.189> out<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> little

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
is kind of starting to oval out a little

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.560 
is kind of starting to oval out a little
bit<00:01:28.340> so<00:01:29.340> I'm<00:01:29.430> gonna<00:01:29.549> just<00:01:29.759> turn<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.119> around<00:01:30.210> and

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
bit so I'm gonna just turn it around and

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.090 
bit so I'm gonna just turn it around and
run<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:30.930> other<00:01:31.080> way<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.619> I'm<00:01:31.770> gonna<00:01:31.860> run

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
run it the other way and I'm gonna run

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.120 
run it the other way and I'm gonna run
these<00:01:32.280> down<00:01:32.549> by<00:01:33.110> down<00:01:34.110> by<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.320> wheel<00:01:34.619> instead

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
these down by down by the wheel instead

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.920 
these down by down by the wheel instead
and<00:01:35.460> because<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.450> had<00:01:36.630> them<00:01:36.780> up<00:01:36.900> here<00:01:38.869> and<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
and because I had them up here and the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.830 
and because I had them up here and the
way<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.079> was<00:01:40.590> holding<00:01:40.890> these<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.750> when<00:01:42.750> you

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
way I was holding these on is when you

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.200 
way I was holding these on is when you
buy<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.020> new<00:01:43.560> pack<00:01:43.740> of<00:01:43.920> these<00:01:44.040> they<00:01:44.820> come<00:01:45.030> with

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
buy a new pack of these they come with

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.920 
buy a new pack of these they come with
the<00:01:45.360> two<00:01:45.990> little<00:01:46.290> tiny<00:01:46.439> screws<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.750> you<00:01:48.750> just

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
the two little tiny screws and you just

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.050 
the two little tiny screws and you just
take<00:01:49.619> these<00:01:49.799> little<00:01:50.070> screws<00:01:50.310> screw<00:01:50.880> them<00:01:50.970> in

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
take these little screws screw them in

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.190 
take these little screws screw them in
there<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.540> since<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.710> flat<00:01:53.479> it<00:01:54.479> just

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
there and since this is flat it just

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.990 
there and since this is flat it just
grabs<00:01:55.799> onto<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.430> little<00:01:56.610> hole<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:56.790> there

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
grabs onto it and a little hole in there

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.480 
grabs onto it and a little hole in there
it<00:01:57.119> kind<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.329> goes<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.479> little<00:01:57.689> hole<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.490> was

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
it kind of goes a little hole I was

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.190 
it kind of goes a little hole I was
trying<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.850> use<00:02:00.090> these<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.780> go<00:02:00.899> all<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.170> way

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
trying to use these to go all the way

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.899 
trying to use these to go all the way
through<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.619> but<00:02:01.860> these<00:02:01.979> don't<00:02:02.250> fit<00:02:02.460> in<00:02:02.670> this

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
through it but these don't fit in this

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.499 
through it but these don't fit in this
hole<00:02:07.429> basically<00:02:08.429> what<00:02:08.579> you<00:02:08.700> need<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.060> do<00:02:09.179> to

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
hole basically what you need to do to

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.250 
hole basically what you need to do to
make<00:02:09.690> these<00:02:10.009> is<00:02:11.009> all<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.520> have<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:11.819> do<00:02:12.260> cut

make these is all you have to do cut
this<00:02:13.440> off<00:02:13.680> with<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.010> dremel<00:02:14.550> or<00:02:14.720> you<00:02:15.720> know

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
this off with a dremel or you know

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.650 
this off with a dremel or you know
something

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
something

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.500 
something
something<00:02:17.650> sharp<00:02:18.090> anything<00:02:19.090> that<00:02:19.240> will<00:02:19.330> cut

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
something sharp anything that will cut

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.950 
something sharp anything that will cut
stuff

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
stuff

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.330 
stuff
I<00:02:19.990> mean<00:02:20.230> plastics<00:02:20.650> really<00:02:20.860> easy<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.160> cut

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
I mean plastics really easy to cut

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.640 
I mean plastics really easy to cut
through<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:22.180> then<00:02:22.480> you<00:02:22.600> need<00:02:22.780> a<00:02:23.050> punch<00:02:23.320> or

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
through and then you need a punch or

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.710 
through and then you need a punch or
something<00:02:24.430> like<00:02:24.730> that<00:02:24.790> or<00:02:25.030> pressed<00:02:25.420> to<00:02:25.600> get

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
something like that or pressed to get

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.210 
something like that or pressed to get
the<00:02:25.840> pin<00:02:26.020> that<00:02:26.230> will<00:02:26.350> be<00:02:26.470> inside<00:02:26.770> of<00:02:26.800> this<00:02:27.040> out

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
the pin that will be inside of this out

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.170 
the pin that will be inside of this out
the<00:02:28.060> pin<00:02:28.300> looks<00:02:29.160> pretty<00:02:30.160> much<00:02:30.340> just<00:02:30.850> like<00:02:31.000> this

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
the pin looks pretty much just like this

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.180 
the pin looks pretty much just like this
just<00:02:31.450> like<00:02:31.630> the<00:02:31.810> pins<00:02:32.020> that<00:02:32.200> fit<00:02:32.260> inside<00:02:33.010> of

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
just like the pins that fit inside of

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.410 
just like the pins that fit inside of
your<00:02:33.310> hexes<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:34.990> then<00:02:35.770> to<00:02:36.070> make<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.490> these

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
your hexes and then to make the these

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.480 
your hexes and then to make the these
yokes<00:02:37.780> all<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:38.620> have<00:02:38.710> to<00:02:38.800> do<00:02:38.890> is<00:02:39.010> cut<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.310> cuff

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
yokes all you have to do is cut the cuff

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.480 
yokes all you have to do is cut the cuff
off<00:02:39.730> I<00:02:40.030> use<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.630> Metabo<00:02:41.160> that's<00:02:42.160> what<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:42.340> had

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
off I use the Metabo that's what I had

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.340 
off I use the Metabo that's what I had
it<00:02:42.670> opened<00:02:42.880> at<00:02:42.940> the<00:02:42.970> time<00:02:43.210> and<00:02:43.450> then<00:02:43.570> I<00:02:43.930> just

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
it opened at the time and then I just

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.980 
it opened at the time and then I just
took<00:02:45.100> a<00:02:45.160> file<00:02:45.520> and<00:02:45.850> filed<00:02:46.210> it<00:02:46.420> down<00:02:46.450> it's<00:02:46.870> not

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
took a file and filed it down it's not

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.300 
took a file and filed it down it's not
too<00:02:47.200> smooth<00:02:47.440> this<00:02:47.650> thing<00:02:47.860> but<00:02:48.130> it<00:02:48.460> should<00:02:48.640> work

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
too smooth this thing but it should work

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.950 
too smooth this thing but it should work
and<00:02:51.310> then<00:02:51.490> just<00:02:51.940> let<00:02:52.090> you<00:02:52.210> just<00:02:52.360> slide<00:02:52.630> them<00:02:52.780> on

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
and then just let you just slide them on

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.030 
and then just let you just slide them on
screw<00:02:53.950> them<00:02:54.040> in<00:02:54.190> and<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:55.060> have<00:02:56.040> some

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
screw them in and you have some

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.160 
screw them in and you have some
high-quality<00:02:57.600> modifications<00:02:58.600> for<00:02:58.720> your<00:02:58.840> exit

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
high-quality modifications for your exit

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.170 
high-quality modifications for your exit
slash<00:03:02.430> alright<00:03:03.430> so<00:03:03.580> here's<00:03:03.760> what<00:03:03.940> they<00:03:04.030> look

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
slash alright so here's what they look

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.020 
slash alright so here's what they look
like<00:03:04.210> when<00:03:04.600> you<00:03:04.690> get<00:03:04.780> them<00:03:04.900> all<00:03:04.960> put<00:03:05.110> together

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
like when you get them all put together

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.550 
like when you get them all put together
so<00:03:07.030> it's<00:03:07.210> still<00:03:07.780> got<00:03:07.900> weak<00:03:08.080> points<00:03:08.410> in<00:03:08.470> the

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
so it's still got weak points in the

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.930 
so it's still got weak points in the
middle<00:03:08.800> because<00:03:09.040> of<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.220> plastic<00:03:09.400> probably

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
middle because of the plastic probably

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.870 
middle because of the plastic probably
some<00:03:10.170> some<00:03:11.170> candy<00:03:11.530> Canaan<00:03:11.920> in<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.520> middle<00:03:12.760> on

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
some some candy Canaan in the middle on

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.800 
some some candy Canaan in the middle on
these<00:03:13.380> these<00:03:14.380> sheriff's<00:03:15.210> but<00:03:16.210> hopefully

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
these these sheriff's but hopefully

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.560 
these these sheriff's but hopefully
having<00:03:17.050> these<00:03:17.260> ends<00:03:17.740> with<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.820> metal<00:03:19.150> and<00:03:19.420> the

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
having these ends with the metal and the

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.620 
having these ends with the metal and the
square<00:03:20.310> u-joints<00:03:21.310> will<00:03:21.910> help<00:03:22.360> them<00:03:22.480> last

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
square u-joints will help them last

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.780 
square u-joints will help them last
longer<00:03:22.750> because<00:03:23.200> one<00:03:24.070> thing<00:03:24.220> I<00:03:24.310> noticed<00:03:24.670> when

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
longer because one thing I noticed when

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.910 
longer because one thing I noticed when
I<00:03:24.850> was<00:03:25.030> just<00:03:25.300> running<00:03:25.480> on<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:25.780> top<00:03:25.990> half<00:03:26.230> is

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
I was just running on the top half is

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.650 
I was just running on the top half is
since<00:03:27.190> this<00:03:27.370> has<00:03:27.550> the<00:03:27.730> square<00:03:27.970> you<00:03:28.270> joined<00:03:28.540> in

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
since this has the square you joined in

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.500 
since this has the square you joined in
it<00:03:28.780> wasn't<00:03:29.440> putting<00:03:29.590> as<00:03:29.770> much<00:03:29.890> wear<00:03:30.420> onto<00:03:31.420> the

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
it wasn't putting as much wear onto the

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.710 
it wasn't putting as much wear onto the
drive<00:03:31.750> shaft<00:03:32.050> the<00:03:32.350> plastic<00:03:32.770> try<00:03:32.920> shaft

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
drive shaft the plastic try shaft

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.240 
drive shaft the plastic try shaft
it<00:03:34.720> was<00:03:34.870> like<00:03:35.050> there's<00:03:35.290> there's<00:03:35.530> less<00:03:35.770> play<00:03:36.040> in

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
it was like there's there's less play in

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.490 
it was like there's there's less play in
it<00:03:36.370> because<00:03:36.520> of<00:03:36.610> that<00:03:36.700> squareness<00:03:37.090> and<00:03:37.540> when

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
it because of that squareness and when

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.210 
it because of that squareness and when
you<00:03:39.280> got<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.550> round<00:03:39.730> ones<00:03:40.800> these<00:03:41.800> round<00:03:42.070> ones

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
you got the round ones these round ones

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.520 
you got the round ones these round ones
really<00:03:42.670> they<00:03:43.300> let<00:03:43.480> it<00:03:43.600> slide<00:03:43.840> around<00:03:44.050> a<00:03:44.350> lot

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
really they let it slide around a lot

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.110 
really they let it slide around a lot
more<00:03:44.770> and<00:03:44.980> stop<00:03:45.250> and<00:03:45.520> there's<00:03:45.640> a<00:03:45.700> lot<00:03:45.880> of<00:03:45.940> play

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
more and stop and there's a lot of play

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.120 
more and stop and there's a lot of play
in<00:03:46.150> it<00:03:46.390> but<00:03:48.360> having<00:03:49.360> square<00:03:49.630> on<00:03:49.780> both<00:03:49.990> ends<00:03:50.380> I'm

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
in it but having square on both ends I'm

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.500 
in it but having square on both ends I'm
hoping<00:03:51.430> should<00:03:51.640> last<00:03:51.850> longer<00:03:52.120> and<00:03:52.330> then<00:03:52.450> the

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
hoping should last longer and then the

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:53.640 
hoping should last longer and then the
only<00:03:52.630> thing<00:03:52.810> I'll<00:03:52.900> have<00:03:53.020> to<00:03:53.110> worry<00:03:53.320> about<00:03:53.440> is

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
only thing I'll have to worry about is

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.070 
only thing I'll have to worry about is
the<00:03:53.800> the<00:03:54.700> oval<00:03:55.060> hang<00:03:55.209> out<00:03:55.390> on<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:57.640> yokes<00:03:58.080> but

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
the the oval hang out on the yokes but

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.260 
the the oval hang out on the yokes but
hopefully<00:03:59.410> that<00:03:59.680> won't<00:04:00.340> be<00:04:00.459> too<00:04:00.640> bad<00:04:00.880> maybe

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
hopefully that won't be too bad maybe

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.500 
hopefully that won't be too bad maybe
the<00:04:01.390> deal<00:04:01.540> because<00:04:01.900> I've<00:04:02.770> been<00:04:02.920> running<00:04:03.100> these

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
the deal because I've been running these

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.350 
the deal because I've been running these
these<00:04:04.510> ones<00:04:04.810> right<00:04:05.050> here<00:04:05.080> which<00:04:05.560> which<00:04:06.010> were

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
these ones right here which which were

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.880 
these ones right here which which were
up<00:04:07.360> in<00:04:07.570> the<00:04:07.600> top<00:04:07.870> by<00:04:08.020> the<00:04:08.050> transmission<00:04:08.560> I've

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
up in the top by the transmission I've

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.030 
up in the top by the transmission I've
been<00:04:09.010> running<00:04:09.280> those<00:04:09.430> since<00:04:10.860> probably<00:04:11.860> about

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
been running those since probably about
