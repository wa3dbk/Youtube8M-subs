Hey guys, this is Lacey Baier with A Sweet
Pea Chef and I have my little stinker of a

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.960
baby with me today because he heard I was
going to teach you guys how to make fresh

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.250
creamed corn. This recipe is so ridiculously
good. Your kids are going to gobble it up.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.300
You're gonna to gobble it up. And it is so
easy. And we use freshly grilled creamed corn.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.300
And guess what?

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.609
We're outside today. Let's get started.

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:46.719
So in order to get started, we need to start
grilling the corn and if you want to have

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:52.059
a really detailed video on how to husk your
own corn, check out this video. Otherwise

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:58.390
all we got to do is take all the husk almost
all the way off of the corn and peel off the

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.109
silk that's on there. Remove all that, it
gets kind of messy, so do it over a counter

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.700
top or something. And then we're going to
put all that nice husk back all the way up

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.030
to the whole corn on the cob part. And then
we're going to put that on a grill over low

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.110
to medium heat.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.720
And what we're going to do is we're going
to grill those for about 10 minutes. See,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.229
he knows. Ten minutes on both sides. We're
going to have to check it and as soon as it

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.740
gets a little bit burned and crispy, we're
going to flip them over. And I use my fingers

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.220
to toss them over. You can use the tongs.
Either way, just make sure you don't over

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.520
burn one side or the other. When they're all
good and ready, take them off and they're

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.520
good to go into the creamed corn.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.520
Okay, so once it's off of the grill, go ahead
and let it cool for about five minutes so

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.520
we can touch it. This guy is so excited for
some creamed corn. So what we do is we take

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.229
all the husk off of the corn and we're going
to use a chef knife and we're going to stand

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:45.750
the corn straight up and we're going to just
slice all the kernels off and as much of it

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.479
as you can possibly get off of it. Then we're
going to add that into the pot.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:59.600
So go ahead and get all that ready, and we're
going to heat a pan over medium-high heat

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.729
and we're going to put the butter into the
pan. We're going to let that melt. Then we're

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:14.250
going to add in the flour, the salt and the
sugar. And we're going to stir all of that

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.000
up and we're going to allow that to get nice
and thick.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.489
Now go ahead and put all that yummy grilled
corn into the pan and stir everything around

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.920
until it's nice and coated. So once that mixture
is nice and thick, we're going to go ahead

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.170
and add in the cream, and we're going to stir
that in and allow that to cook on medium heat

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.920
for about five to six minutes until it gets
nice and thick and it's no longer watery.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.090
Then it's time to let the kids and yourself
just go to town and enjoy this ridiculously

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.530
good fresh creamed corn. So thanks for watching.
