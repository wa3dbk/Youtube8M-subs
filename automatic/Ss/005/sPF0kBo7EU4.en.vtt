00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:09.970
 Well then I would like to start practicing sr first sr 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:12.960
 Tteyuu of the Well and the drag shot 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.430
 Quick shots and 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.890
 jump shot 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.180
 This can be divided into about three Well 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.970
 Well To sister 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.690
 From to jump and say 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.690
 Such a quick shot 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:30.530
 There is such a person , too 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:32.230
 Even though it's the practice direction or rather morning of Uchikata in 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:36.450
 Drag shot 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.450
 I guess maybe everyone will do it 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.870
 It's not like this 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.780
 I think you are practicing 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:55.140
 Or ct painting at the enemy appeared suddenly 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.140
 When you say suddenly it appeared Tatte in to this kind of behavior 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.190
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:08.320
 And Is not before 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.320
 I also practice in this way 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.240
 Shooting Quick Shot Quick Shot Eh et al. 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:20.810
 But it has a Well aim green line of this handgun 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.990
 Together 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:28.960
 Let's go for a target and sell 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:33.100
 When I put out a normal battle , the enemy's name comes out 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.990
 Or sr also it's not Well, this of the mark O is eh in the same way 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:40.350
 There is no mark of the line of 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.990
 The name comes out if heavy industry is properly matched 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.860
 Name is out = 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.450
 Correct 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.320
 Because it is a sign that it hits 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.320
 According to it 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.380
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.860
 Well, first, 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.690
 The name is coming out 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.740
 After confirmation 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.740
 Take a quick shot 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.780
 Feeling 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.130
 but 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.130
 I think it might be good 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.730
 It Hyatt Oh 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.730

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.010
 Jump to a thing and mouse mom 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.060
 Roughly 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.060
 Go to the point 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.950
 It looks like this 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:47.140
 To some not when you have to jump I thought Naa is a little shift 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.140
 While moving and fine-tuning 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:58.290
 I'm doing iron bridge Yes 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.290
 Well , after the monkey practice I did not need much this time I first went around 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.740
 For example, this weight 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.130
 the brunt in the sr 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.130
 For example 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.549
 When you want to fit in of a 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.489
 I haven't been there for a while 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.490
 t if available 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.830
 I'm not doing 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.450
 Toka this it was You're d 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.790
 If it was j, this was strange or this 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:33.280
 While fitting like this 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:35.110
 To fit as quickly as possible 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.850
 It is or practice 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.850
 These ends of the box 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.370
 While practicing this 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.000
 Somehow of sr 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.690
 Sense of being 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.690
 If you practice 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.700
 I think that I think we hit Well 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.090
 I'm removing it 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.090
