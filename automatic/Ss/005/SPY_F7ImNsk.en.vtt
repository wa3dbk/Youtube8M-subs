00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
to make the large world i think it's the

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.830 
to make the large world i think it's the
farthest<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.279> can<00:00:26.460> go<00:00:26.640> we<00:00:27.510> don't<00:00:27.599> have

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
like that so we have four diamonds here

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.690 
like that so we have four diamonds here
not<00:03:28.049> too<00:03:28.169> bad<00:03:28.349> that's<00:03:28.590> pretty<00:03:28.799> good<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:29.579> we

have another cave right here we have
some<00:03:31.560> lava<00:03:31.799> over<00:03:32.190> here<00:03:32.519> and<00:03:32.700> we're<00:03:33.480> going<00:03:33.599> to

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
some lava over here and we're going to

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.700 
some lava over here and we're going to
go<00:03:33.750> ahead<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:33.900> head<00:03:34.139> back<00:03:34.349> up<00:03:34.620> here

let's see where's our next one next

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.400 
let's see where's our next one next
target<00:03:41.680> next<00:03:41.890> target<00:03:42.900> we've<00:03:43.900> got<00:03:44.020> another<00:03:44.230> one

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
target next target we've got another one

target next target we've got another one
right<00:03:44.620> here<00:03:44.830> this<00:03:45.010> one's<00:03:45.160> pretty<00:03:45.340> close<00:03:45.670> so

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
right here this one's pretty close so

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.940 
right here this one's pretty close so
we're<00:03:46.630> going<00:03:46.690> to<00:03:46.810> go<00:03:46.900> and<00:03:46.990> hit<00:03:47.260> this<00:03:47.440> one<00:03:47.650> real

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
we're going to go and hit this one real

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.820 
we're going to go and hit this one real
quick<00:03:48.150> put<00:03:49.150> this<00:03:49.270> block<00:03:49.570> up<00:03:49.810> here<00:03:50.170> and<00:03:50.350> we're

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
quick put this block up here and we're

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.670 
quick put this block up here and we're
going<00:03:50.950> to<00:03:51.010> go<00:03:51.220> ahead<00:03:51.250> and<00:03:51.430> jump<00:03:51.670> down<00:03:52.170> so<00:03:53.170> there
