00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.070 
heads that we manufacture previously we

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.270 
heads that we manufacture previously we
had<00:00:10.309> the<00:00:10.580> whole<00:00:11.179> pattern<00:00:12.169> come<00:00:12.620> from<00:00:12.889> here

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280 
had the whole pattern come from here

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.900 
had the whole pattern come from here
back<00:00:13.879> to<00:00:13.910> here<00:00:14.499> but<00:00:15.499> always<00:00:16.129> learning<00:00:16.610> from

back to here but always learning from

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.150 
back to here but always learning from
the<00:00:17.060> ice<00:00:17.150> makers<00:00:17.660> they<00:00:18.500> told<00:00:18.770> us<00:00:18.980> that

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
the ice makers they told us that

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.000 
the ice makers they told us that
sometimes<00:00:19.430> some<00:00:20.000> of<00:00:20.030> these<00:00:20.830> sprinkles<00:00:21.830> will

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.010 
sometimes some of these sprinkles will

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.740 
sometimes some of these sprinkles will
get<00:00:22.160> back<00:00:22.400> on<00:00:22.760> their<00:00:23.030> clothing<00:00:23.330> which<00:00:23.720> was

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
get back on their clothing which was

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.170 
get back on their clothing which was
uncomfortable<00:00:24.680> of<00:00:24.770> course<00:00:25.070> so<00:00:25.730> now<00:00:25.940> we've

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
uncomfortable of course so now we've

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.570 
uncomfortable of course so now we've
changed<00:00:26.540> our<00:00:26.780> pattern<00:00:27.260> to<00:00:27.890> the<00:00:28.010> holes<00:00:28.220> come

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
changed our pattern to the holes come

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.550 
changed our pattern to the holes come
here<00:00:28.970> and<00:00:29.180> of<00:00:29.330> course<00:00:29.600> we've<00:00:29.780> got<00:00:29.810> rid<00:00:30.260> of<00:00:30.290> that

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
here and of course we've got rid of that

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.790 
here and of course we've got rid of that

putting them into your retainer here you

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.729 
putting them into your retainer here you
put<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:16.000> letters<00:03:16.690> outward<00:03:17.579> like<00:03:18.579> X<00:03:18.910> F<00:03:19.180> or<00:03:19.739> fine

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
put the letters outward like X F or fine

or medium that has to be pointing

outwards because these are drilled in an

outwards because these are drilled in an
angle<00:03:26.709> so<00:03:26.920> that<00:03:26.950> the<00:03:27.310> water<00:03:27.670> flares<00:03:28.150> out<00:03:29.340> now

as<00:03:30.730> you'll<00:03:31.269> see<00:03:31.480> here<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:31.989> disc<00:03:32.950> gets<00:03:33.220> to<00:03:33.370> go

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
as you'll see here the disc gets to go

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.199 
as you'll see here the disc gets to go
in<00:03:33.730> with<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.090> rubber<00:03:34.329> between<00:03:35.290> it<00:03:35.530> and<00:03:35.709> the

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
ice makers like the pressurized better

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.390 
ice makers like the pressurized better
is<00:03:45.639> because<00:03:46.630> rather<00:03:47.440> than<00:03:47.709> having<00:03:47.950> to

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.030 

swing<00:03:51.400> your<00:03:51.610> hands<00:03:52.000> so<00:03:52.180> hard<00:03:53.019> especially<00:03:53.530> with

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
ice makers that are volunteer and not

ice makers that are volunteer and not
doing<00:04:00.580> on<00:04:00.819> the<00:04:00.970> whole<00:04:01.150> lot<00:04:01.390> of<00:04:01.540> pedaling<00:04:01.989> with

the pressurized pedal head all you have

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.699 
the pressurized pedal head all you have
to<00:04:07.120> do<00:04:07.239> is<00:04:07.360> just<00:04:07.569> wave<00:04:07.810> your<00:04:07.989> wrists<00:04:08.260> like<00:04:08.530> this

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
to do is just wave your wrists like this

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.640 
to do is just wave your wrists like this
and<00:04:08.920> you'll<00:04:09.010> get<00:04:09.160> a<00:04:09.220> nice<00:04:09.459> even<00:04:10.410> thread<00:04:11.410> of<00:04:11.560> the

water
but<00:04:12.760> I<00:04:12.790> do<00:04:12.910> say<00:04:13.330> that<00:04:13.690> most<00:04:14.220> ice<00:04:15.220> makers<00:04:15.640> do

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
but I do say that most ice makers do

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.140 
but I do say that most ice makers do

we have the insulated grip on here also

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.700 
we have the insulated grip on here also
because<00:04:49.210> some<00:04:50.210> ice<00:04:50.509> makers<00:04:50.960> prefer<00:04:51.319> to<00:04:51.499> have<00:04:51.680> a
