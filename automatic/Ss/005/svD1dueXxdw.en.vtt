but<00:00:22.660> basically<00:00:23.169> the<00:00:23.349> question<00:00:23.710> was<00:00:23.890> how<00:00:24.220> I

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
but basically the question was how I

but basically the question was how I
painted<00:00:24.759> the<00:00:25.360> cloak<00:00:25.660> off<00:00:25.869> of<00:00:26.050> this<00:00:26.230> figure<00:00:27.029> now

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
painted the cloak off of this figure now

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:29.670 
painted the cloak off of this figure now
instead<00:00:28.300> of<00:00:28.419> just<00:00:28.660> giving<00:00:28.840> a<00:00:29.050> list<00:00:29.259> of<00:00:29.410> color

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680

instead of just giving a list of color
that<00:00:29.829> I<00:00:29.919> used<00:00:30.160> I<00:00:30.789> decided<00:00:31.570> to<00:00:31.869> make<00:00:32.379> a<00:00:32.410> short

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
that I used I decided to make a short

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
when I start working on a model surely

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.889 
when I start working on a model surely
for<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:57.760> for<00:00:57.910> the<00:00:57.969> large<00:00:58.180> area<00:00:58.510> the<00:00:58.600> always

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
for the for the large area the always

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:03.299 
for the for the large area the always
write<00:00:59.110> down<00:01:00.449> their<00:01:01.449> paint<00:01:01.809> recipes<00:01:02.379> two

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
write down their paint recipes two

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.290

reasons<00:01:03.730> first<00:01:03.969> of<00:01:04.089> all<00:01:04.710> if<00:01:05.710> I<00:01:05.890> want<00:01:06.130> to<00:01:06.310> have<00:01:07.240> a

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
reasons first of all if I want to have a

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.300 
reasons first of all if I want to have a
similar<00:01:07.780> look<00:01:07.930> on<00:01:08.080> another<00:01:08.110> model<00:01:08.800> later<00:01:09.160> I

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
similar look on another model later I

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.700 
similar look on another model later I
just<00:01:09.640> can<00:01:09.940> consult<00:01:10.240> it<00:01:10.450> is<00:01:10.630> these<00:01:11.380> recipes

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
just can consult it is these recipes

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.580 
just can consult it is these recipes
here<00:01:12.100> another<00:01:12.970> thing<00:01:13.149> is<00:01:13.300> that<00:01:13.330> if<00:01:13.810> I<00:01:14.050> make

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
here another thing is that if I make

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.650 
here another thing is that if I make
mistakes<00:01:14.740> somewhere<00:01:15.460> in<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:15.789> later<00:01:16.210> stage

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
mistakes somewhere in the later stage

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.219 
mistakes somewhere in the later stage
then<00:01:17.470> I<00:01:17.619> had<00:01:18.100> to<00:01:18.310> go<00:01:19.030> back<00:01:19.210> and<00:01:19.450> then<00:01:19.570> fix<00:01:19.869> for

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
then I had to go back and then fix for

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.340 
then I had to go back and then fix for
example<00:01:20.650> I<00:01:20.710> painted<00:01:21.040> a<00:01:21.159> spot<00:01:21.400> on<00:01:21.430> the<00:01:21.970> skin

I don't measure any drops or something I
just<00:02:11.440> yeah<00:02:13.980> usually<00:02:14.980> I<00:02:15.250> just<00:02:15.549> judge<00:02:16.060> the

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
just yeah usually I just judge the

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.940 
just yeah usually I just judge the
amount<00:02:16.630> of<00:02:16.720> paint<00:02:16.989> it's<00:02:17.350> not<00:02:17.530> precise

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
amount of paint it's not precise

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.870 
amount of paint it's not precise
knowledge<00:02:18.940> not<00:02:19.480> precise<00:02:20.350> science<00:02:20.799> but

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
knowledge not precise science but

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.420 
knowledge not precise science but
that's<00:02:22.480> really<00:02:22.690> not<00:02:22.930> really<00:02:23.260> a<00:02:23.290> problem<00:02:23.620> so

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
that's really not really a problem so

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.030 
that's really not really a problem so
like<00:02:25.360> I<00:02:25.480> said<00:02:25.540> that<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.930> basecoat<00:02:26.500> of<00:02:26.800> the

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
like I said that the basecoat of the

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.390 
like I said that the basecoat of the
cloak<00:02:27.340> was<00:02:27.580> done<00:02:27.820> by<00:02:28.420> mixing<00:02:28.660> a<00:02:29.070> 50/50<00:02:30.070> mix<00:02:30.280> of

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
cloak was done by mixing a 50/50 mix of

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.800 
cloak was done by mixing a 50/50 mix of
khaki<00:02:30.760> grey<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:31.630> black<00:02:31.990> gray<00:02:32.200> I<00:02:33.390> got<00:02:34.390> a<00:02:34.420> lot<00:02:34.780> of

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.410 
shops I did yeah people like the some
harm<00:02:52.210> of<00:02:52.540> course<00:02:52.570> like<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.590> D<00:02:54.280> saturated<00:02:55.090> the

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
harm of course like the D saturated the

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.160 
harm of course like the D saturated the
monochromatic<00:02:56.290> look<00:02:56.910> that's<00:02:57.910> really

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
monochromatic look that's really

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.450 
monochromatic look that's really
something<00:02:59.170> of<00:02:59.200> me<00:03:00.100> that<00:03:01.000> I<00:03:01.030> so<00:03:01.840> technique

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
something of me that I so technique

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.060 
something of me that I so technique
style<00:03:03.460> I<00:03:03.550> developed<00:03:04.030> over<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.330> past<00:03:04.360> years<00:03:05.070> so

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
style I developed over the past years so

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.130 
style I developed over the past years so
how<00:03:06.760> to<00:03:06.820> achieve<00:03:07.030> this<00:03:07.360> style<00:03:07.660> is<00:03:07.780> basically

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
how to achieve this style is basically

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.330 
how to achieve this style is basically
by<00:03:08.350> mixing<00:03:08.650> in<00:03:08.980> a<00:03:09.220> lot<00:03:09.640> of<00:03:09.760> praise<00:03:10.980> in<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.190> the

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
by mixing in a lot of praise in the the

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.180 
by mixing in a lot of praise in the the
paints<00:03:12.670> I<00:03:12.790> used<00:03:12.970> so<00:03:13.240> I<00:03:13.270> rarely<00:03:13.540> put<00:03:13.870> on<00:03:14.190> pure

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
paints I used so I rarely put on pure

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.000 
paints I used so I rarely put on pure
paints<00:03:15.640> like<00:03:15.790> this<00:03:16.470> usually<00:03:17.470> mention<00:03:17.800> a<00:03:17.860> bit

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
paints like this usually mention a bit

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.260 
paints like this usually mention a bit
of<00:03:18.130> gray<00:03:18.880> gray<00:03:19.360> tones<00:03:20.340> this<00:03:21.340> khaki<00:03:21.880> graves

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
of gray gray tones this khaki graves

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:28.950 
of gray gray tones this khaki graves
also<00:03:23.430> quite<00:03:24.430> grey<00:03:24.670> of<00:03:24.790> itself<00:03:27.840> she<00:03:28.840> had

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:28.960 
also quite grey of itself she had

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.780 
also quite grey of itself she had
actually<00:03:29.200> in<00:03:29.650> technical<00:03:30.070> terms<00:03:30.250> called

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
actually in technical terms called

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.450 
actually in technical terms called
desaturating<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.930> paint<00:03:32.200> so<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:32.620> saturated

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
desaturating the paint so the saturated

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.610 
desaturating the paint so the saturated
color<00:03:33.880> means<00:03:34.210> is<00:03:34.570> a<00:03:34.690> pure<00:03:34.960> color<00:03:35.260> like<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:36.730> see

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
color means is a pure color like you see

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.880 
color means is a pure color like you see
something<00:03:38.620> very<00:03:38.650> bright<00:03:39.510> yet<00:03:40.510> just<00:03:40.750> this<00:03:41.590> red

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
something very bright yet just this red

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.920 
something very bright yet just this red
for<00:03:42.100> example<00:03:42.130> is<00:03:42.700> very<00:03:42.730> saturated<00:03:43.180> this<00:03:43.750> is

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
for example is very saturated this is

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.380 
for example is very saturated this is
almost<00:03:44.440> a<00:03:44.590> pure<00:03:44.800> red<00:03:45.040> if<00:03:45.820> you<00:03:45.880> start<00:03:46.240> adding

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
almost a pure red if you start adding

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.990 
almost a pure red if you start adding
some<00:03:46.750> gray<00:03:47.290> then<00:03:47.950> you<00:03:48.040> will<00:03:48.160> take<00:03:48.400> out<00:03:48.580> some<00:03:48.820> of

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
some gray then you will take out some of

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.250 
some gray then you will take out some of
the<00:03:49.120> color<00:03:49.360> you<00:03:49.570> will<00:03:49.720> desaturate<00:03:52.020> the<00:03:53.020> color

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
the color you will desaturate the color

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.920 
the color you will desaturate the color
so<00:03:53.950> yeah<00:03:54.100> we<00:03:54.250> started<00:03:54.460> with<00:03:54.760> a<00:03:54.790> 50/50<00:03:55.600> mix<00:03:55.780> of

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
so yeah we started with a 50/50 mix of

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.740 
so yeah we started with a 50/50 mix of
these<00:03:56.080> two<00:03:56.350> and<00:03:57.190> then<00:03:57.340> what<00:03:57.460> I<00:03:57.490> do<00:03:57.750> that's

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
these two and then what I do that's

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.750 
these two and then what I do that's
right<00:03:59.020> the<00:03:59.230> base<00:03:59.800> coat<00:04:00.100> is<00:04:00.250> first<00:04:00.490> I<00:04:00.580> do<00:04:00.640> the

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
right the base coat is first I do the

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.670 
right the base coat is first I do the
shading<00:04:02.280> in<00:04:03.280> this<00:04:03.550> case<00:04:03.820> I<00:04:03.850> did<00:04:04.150> the<00:04:04.240> shading

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
shading in this case I did the shading

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.360 
shading in this case I did the shading
by<00:04:05.680> mixing<00:04:05.950> in<00:04:07.230> some<00:04:08.230> violet<00:04:08.680> red<00:04:08.890> and<00:04:09.160> some

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
by mixing in some violet red and some

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.810 
by mixing in some violet red and some
some<00:04:10.240> black<00:04:10.830> now<00:04:11.830> some<00:04:12.040> people<00:04:12.310> might<00:04:12.550> think

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
some black now some people might think

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.630 
some black now some people might think
it's<00:04:13.270> strange<00:04:13.360> to<00:04:13.810> add<00:04:13.930> some<00:04:14.310> violet<00:04:15.310> red<00:04:15.460> to

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
it's strange to add some violet red to

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.729 
it's strange to add some violet red to
the<00:04:15.760> to<00:04:16.000> the<00:04:16.090> mix<00:04:16.239> of<00:04:16.390> shade<00:04:16.600> why<00:04:17.020> not<00:04:17.230> add<00:04:17.590> only

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
the to the mix of shade why not add only

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.920 
the to the mix of shade why not add only
black<00:04:19.049> now<00:04:20.049> that<00:04:20.650> I<00:04:20.680> use<00:04:21.360> color<00:04:22.360> you<00:04:22.570> when<00:04:22.840> I'm

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
black now that I use color you when I'm

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.480 
black now that I use color you when I'm
painting<00:04:23.260> these<00:04:23.350> things<00:04:23.830> comfortably<00:04:24.310> on<00:04:24.400> my

if<00:04:37.460> for<00:04:37.700> example<00:04:37.730> you<00:04:38.270> want<00:04:38.480> to<00:04:38.540> shade<00:04:39.470> the

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
if for example you want to shade the

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.210 
if for example you want to shade the
color<00:04:39.890> for<00:04:40.820> example<00:04:40.850> red<00:04:41.830> you<00:04:42.830> have<00:04:42.890> to<00:04:43.100> look

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
color for example red you have to look

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.550 
color for example red you have to look
at<00:04:43.460> the<00:04:43.580> other<00:04:43.760> side<00:04:44.090> of<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:44.570> color<00:04:45.290> wheel<00:04:45.380> and

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
at the other side of the color wheel and

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.260 
at the other side of the color wheel and
add<00:04:45.890> that<00:04:46.160> color<00:04:46.430> so<00:04:46.640> if<00:04:46.700> you<00:04:46.760> want<00:04:46.970> to<00:04:47.060> shade

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
add that color so if you want to shade

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.750 
add that color so if you want to shade
red<00:04:47.510> you<00:04:48.410> can<00:04:48.560> add<00:04:48.680> green<00:04:48.950> just<00:04:49.250> this<00:04:49.430> try<00:04:49.700> it

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
red you can add green just this try it

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.690 
red you can add green just this try it
if<00:04:50.630> you<00:04:50.690> take<00:04:51.500> some<00:04:51.680> red<00:04:51.830> add<00:04:51.950> some<00:04:52.160> dark<00:04:52.400> green

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
if you take some red add some dark green

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.750 
if you take some red add some dark green
then<00:04:53.600> you<00:04:53.720> will<00:04:53.870> not<00:04:53.990> get<00:04:54.260> D<00:04:54.860> saturated<00:04:55.580> or

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
then you will not get D saturated or

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.330 
then you will not get D saturated or
dark<00:04:56.060> red<00:04:56.150> you<00:04:56.600> will<00:04:56.720> get<00:04:56.930> a<00:04:56.960> warm<00:04:57.710> kind<00:04:58.010> of<00:04:58.160> red

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
dark red you will get a warm kind of red

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.940 
dark red you will get a warm kind of red
the<00:04:58.970> same<00:04:59.180> goes<00:04:59.390> for<00:04:59.420> green<00:04:59.810> if<00:05:00.320> you<00:05:00.590> want<00:05:00.800> to

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
the same goes for green if you want to

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.330 
the same goes for green if you want to
shade<00:05:01.340> green<00:05:01.730> then<00:05:02.660> add<00:05:02.840> red

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
shade green then add red

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.860 
shade green then add red
so<00:05:04.340> yeah<00:05:04.460> this<00:05:04.580> khaki<00:05:04.880> color<00:05:05.210> is<00:05:05.390> somewhere

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
so yeah this khaki color is somewhere

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.920 
so yeah this khaki color is somewhere
between<00:05:06.290> pee<00:05:06.710> yellow<00:05:06.980> and<00:05:07.400> green<00:05:07.610> and<00:05:08.000> so

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
between pee yellow and green and so

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.140 
between pee yellow and green and so
what's<00:05:09.110> on<00:05:09.260> the<00:05:09.380> other<00:05:09.410> side

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
what's on the other side

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.210 
what's on the other side
violet<00:05:11.150> red<00:05:11.300> violet<00:05:11.750> someone's<00:05:12.220> somewhere

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
violet red violet someone's somewhere

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.620 
violet red violet someone's somewhere
over<00:05:13.400> here<00:05:14.110> so<00:05:15.110> that's<00:05:15.320> why<00:05:15.470> I<00:05:15.500> added<00:05:16.630> the

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.630 
over here so that's why I added the

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.230 
over here so that's why I added the
violet<00:05:17.960> red<00:05:18.140> if<00:05:18.770> you're<00:05:19.070> going<00:05:19.280> to<00:05:19.490> add<00:05:19.940> this

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
violet red if you're going to add this

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.880 
violet red if you're going to add this
they<00:05:20.480> are<00:05:20.630> going<00:05:21.020> to<00:05:21.080> create<00:05:21.230> a<00:05:21.380> very<00:05:21.590> colorful

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
they are going to create a very colorful

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.650 
they are going to create a very colorful
shade<00:05:22.430> it's<00:05:22.640> not<00:05:22.760> really<00:05:23.060> realistic<00:05:25.210> so<00:05:26.210> as<00:05:26.480> I

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
shade it's not really realistic so as I

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.870 
shade it's not really realistic so as I
go<00:05:26.870> I<00:05:27.170> just<00:05:27.470> have<00:05:27.740> a<00:05:27.890> bit<00:05:28.250> more<00:05:28.280> black<00:05:28.640> so<00:05:28.850> I

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
go I just have a bit more black so I

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.970 
go I just have a bit more black so I
start<00:05:29.210> with<00:05:29.390> a<00:05:29.690> pool<00:05:29.990> file<00:05:30.350> is<00:05:30.500> red<00:05:30.680> with<00:05:30.830> only

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:30.980 
start with a pool file is red with only

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.610 
start with a pool file is red with only
a<00:05:31.130> pin<00:05:31.400> pin<00:05:32.210> point<00:05:32.480> of<00:05:32.660> of<00:05:32.810> black<00:05:32.990> in<00:05:33.260> it<00:05:33.350> and

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
a pin pin point of of black in it and

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.590 
a pin pin point of of black in it and
then<00:05:33.800> I<00:05:33.890> add<00:05:34.250> a<00:05:34.310> bit<00:05:34.490> more<00:05:34.670> black<00:05:35.480> to<00:05:35.990> the<00:05:36.110> mix

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
then I add a bit more black to the mix

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.820 
then I add a bit more black to the mix
and<00:05:38.600> then<00:05:38.750> to<00:05:38.930> create<00:05:39.200> a<00:05:39.230> highlight<00:05:39.650> that

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
and then to create a highlight that

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.390 
and then to create a highlight that
started<00:05:40.220> off<00:05:40.310> with<00:05:40.490> Dec<00:05:41.330> 10th<00:05:41.600> -<00:05:42.170> color<00:05:42.470> and

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
started off with Dec 10th - color and

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.970 
started off with Dec 10th - color and
just<00:05:43.550> very<00:05:44.270> warm<00:05:45.190> warm<00:05:46.190> of<00:05:46.370> white<00:05:47.650> this<00:05:48.650> is<00:05:48.800> not

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:48.980 
just very warm warm of white this is not

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.530 
just very warm warm of white this is not
wide<00:05:49.160> enough<00:05:49.190> to<00:05:49.550> create<00:05:49.730> a<00:05:49.820> final<00:05:50.120> highlight

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.540 
wide enough to create a final highlight

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.990 
wide enough to create a final highlight
to<00:05:51.200> do<00:05:51.320> that<00:05:51.530> I<00:05:54.040> added<00:05:55.040> a<00:05:55.070> bit<00:05:55.400> of<00:05:55.460> pure<00:05:55.790> white

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
to do that I added a bit of pure white

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.780 
to do that I added a bit of pure white
and<00:05:56.540> then<00:05:57.290> I<00:05:57.380> did<00:05:57.560> something<00:05:57.980> I<00:05:58.070> guess<00:05:58.400> if<00:05:58.640> I

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
and then I did something I guess if I

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.500 
and then I did something I guess if I
remember<00:05:59.120> correctly<00:05:59.450> something<00:05:59.900> I<00:05:59.960> didn't

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
remember correctly something I didn't

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.080 
remember correctly something I didn't
write<00:06:02.510> down<00:06:02.540> in<00:06:02.930> the<00:06:03.140> notebook<00:06:03.850> that<00:06:04.850> was

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
write down in the notebook that was

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.260 
write down in the notebook that was
applying<00:06:05.720> some<00:06:05.990> some<00:06:06.260> glazes<00:06:06.880> now<00:06:07.880> it's<00:06:08.120> also

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
applying some some glazes now it's also

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.980 
applying some some glazes now it's also
a<00:06:08.770> completely<00:06:09.770> separate<00:06:10.220> subject<00:06:10.870> that<00:06:11.870> I'm

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
a completely separate subject that I'm

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.390 
a completely separate subject that I'm
not<00:06:12.140> going<00:06:12.320> to<00:06:12.500> cover<00:06:12.710> entirely<00:06:13.130> in<00:06:13.310> this

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
not going to cover entirely in this

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.690 
not going to cover entirely in this
video<00:06:14.470> this<00:06:15.470> involves<00:06:15.950> adding<00:06:16.190> some<00:06:16.460> glaze

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:16.700 
video this involves adding some glaze

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.570 
video this involves adding some glaze
medium<00:06:17.180> to<00:06:17.870> paint<00:06:18.170> just<00:06:18.920> to<00:06:19.070> create<00:06:19.220> a<00:06:19.310> very

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
medium to paint just to create a very

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.850 
medium to paint just to create a very
thin<00:06:19.970> paint<00:06:20.300> and<00:06:20.630> then<00:06:21.260> I<00:06:21.470> think<00:06:21.890> I<00:06:22.570> did<00:06:23.740> one<00:06:24.740> or

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
thin paint and then I think I did one or

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.220 
thin paint and then I think I did one or
two<00:06:25.010> blazes<00:06:25.520> in<00:06:25.820> the<00:06:25.970> shadow<00:06:26.210> areas<00:06:26.630> with<00:06:26.840> pure

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:27.230 
two blazes in the shadow areas with pure

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.070 
two blazes in the shadow areas with pure
violet<00:06:27.680> red<00:06:27.890> and<00:06:28.820> then<00:06:29.180> with<00:06:29.420> pink<00:06:29.930> with<00:06:30.050> the

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 
violet red and then with pink with the

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.470 
violet red and then with pink with the
Dec<00:06:30.380> 10<00:06:30.620> or<00:06:30.800> us<00:06:30.980> some<00:06:31.460> yellowish<00:06:31.910> or<00:06:32.120> white

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:34.480 
Dec 10 or us some yellowish or white

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:40.560 
Dec 10 or us some yellowish or white
some<00:06:35.480> glazes<00:06:35.750> on<00:06:36.080> the<00:06:36.380> highlighting<00:06:36.860> areas<00:06:38.320> so

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:40.570 
some glazes on the highlighting areas so

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.620 
some glazes on the highlighting areas so
turning<00:06:41.570> off<00:06:41.750> camera<00:06:42.140> again

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:43.630 
turning off camera again

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.570 
turning off camera again
so<00:06:44.630> I<00:06:44.660> hope<00:06:44.840> to<00:06:45.680> give<00:06:45.890> you<00:06:45.920> some<00:06:46.190> insight<00:06:46.550> on

how<00:06:46.790> I<00:06:47.120> painted<00:06:47.690> the<00:06:48.170> cloak<00:06:50.170> peeking<00:06:51.170> the

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:51.230 
how I painted the cloak peeking the

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:56.040
