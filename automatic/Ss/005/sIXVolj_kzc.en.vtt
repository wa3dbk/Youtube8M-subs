00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.290
 good 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.579
 let's start being the extreme spinach I have in the estate 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:15.849
 in the refrigerator that Spain will show that it seems problematic Perez alleged 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.589

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:24.159
 about two kilos to be an idea of ​​ekin here 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.539
 the killer in the following way 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.269
 we heat a frying pan 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.040
 we put butter with this retreat we put a good mattress turned off 

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:36.010
 spinach and in share 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.250
 because it's going to go a lot liquid the pan and amalgamated account containers 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.510
 as we can and fear 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.160
 five minutes 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.359
 and so that the tape arrives like putting 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:51.729
 murcia losing water we take it out and we do the same with everyone 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:55.199
 Northeast giant colander by stage already also in heap of water 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.910
 important that it is very close 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.980
 because otherwise we are not going to stop mar the extrovert here 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.670
 in the melted butter only trolley a bread of butter 200 the 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.960
 motion now walk 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.920
 and all this is finished 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.240
 but good and running to one side 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.930
 what is meant by poverty in butter 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.050
 the cabinet of those tasks the fat who has stated that down there 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.350
 is I'm not going to although you know how it enters and transverse 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.980
 a brush 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.230
 I will not enter from this slope the mass 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.580
 gilad 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.930
 this is an Armenian mass 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.610
 and as for the hypotheses are 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.420
 a lot is like some sabaneta 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.260
 what I am going to do 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.180
 directly to remove it 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.650
 and there is the see cut 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:52.660
 to use 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.380
 half of it is the size of our right and we have right like that of 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.790
 apple made is 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.070
 Nothing more traditional the hotel name but because it seemed like 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.380
 this plate 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.840
 the fear 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.840
 aida 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.639
 and my aunt of alakismo madrina 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:16.639
 every one of my aunts that I have a lot on a plate 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.289
 that as your logo 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:25.059
 some of lemon pay the milanesas everything very well traditionally initial- 

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:26.179
 poplar 

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:27.409
 in this order 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:30.509
 thorn japan the most affected 

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:34.679
 right now so I'm not told I'm talking while the people who are talking 

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:38.299
 For example, he also aspired to clarify that you do not get a little 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.670
 ballet down or to the valentina k 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.640
 also like in argentina cazorla I do not like it is that the traditional expo in the 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.679
 that appeared with butter 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:50.679
 obviously the white sauce quintero no longer 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:54.469
 eye the fifteenth of the butter that is the most important thing 

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:58.449
 i a this task is not simple 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:01.369
 I'm going to do it 

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:04.369
 four times or with four captains 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.819
 above 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.309
 jean buru bouza 

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:14.439
 and if it breaks a bit and everything else do not get discouraged because at the beginning 

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:19.050
 after the stage the hand 10 really is 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.959
 very easy 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.959
 because this fight like this puff 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:27.919
 that looks like my peace look 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.579
 this one when a bubble that was left is a little high 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:42.679
 and it would be fine 

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:46.019
 in vaduz madóz everything 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.079
 in the interesting note that proves to be like 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:51.779
 a little
