one guy is to stay in the middle that

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.300 
one guy is to stay in the middle that
way<00:02:32.110> he<00:02:33.110> doesn't<00:02:33.230> get<00:02:33.440> near<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.769> explosions

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
way he doesn't get near the explosions

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.339 
way he doesn't get near the explosions
and<00:02:34.819> the<00:02:35.060> enemies<00:02:35.659> don't<00:02:35.780> get<00:02:35.959> too<00:02:36.110> close<00:02:36.230> to

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
and the enemies don't get too close to

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.430 
and the enemies don't get too close to
and<00:02:37.150> just<00:02:38.150> always<00:02:38.390> you<00:02:38.780> can<00:02:38.810> i<00:02:39.079> oughtta<00:02:39.290> cause

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
and just always you can i oughtta cause

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.229 
and just always you can i oughtta cause
it's<00:02:39.890> going<00:02:40.459> to<00:02:40.549> start<00:02:40.700> to<00:02:40.760> get<00:02:40.940> a<00:02:40.970> little<00:02:41.030> bit

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
it's going to start to get a little bit

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.390 
it's going to start to get a little bit
harder<00:02:41.629> the<00:02:41.840> base<00:02:42.019> enemy<00:02:42.769> will<00:02:42.950> stuff<00:02:43.129> and<00:02:43.310> be

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
harder the base enemy will stuff and be

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.550 
harder the base enemy will stuff and be
coming<00:02:43.670> from<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.879> other<00:02:43.909> side<00:02:44.180> from<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.260> down

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
coming from the other side from the down

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.890 
coming from the other side from the down
towards

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.990 

like<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:48.960> said<00:02:49.170> it's<00:02:49.830> easiest<00:02:50.310> just<00:02:50.520> to<00:02:50.760> stick

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
like I said it's easiest just to stick

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.660 
like I said it's easiest just to stick
with<00:02:51.150> one<00:02:51.420> guy<00:02:52.010> rather<00:02:53.010> than<00:02:53.190> try<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.400> save

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
with one guy rather than try to save

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.320 
with one guy rather than try to save
them<00:02:53.700> both<00:02:54.000> I<00:02:55.010> don't<00:02:56.010> think<00:02:56.100> human<00:02:56.790> souls<00:02:57.090> that

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
them both I don't think human souls that

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.890 
them both I don't think human souls that
badly

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
badly

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.839
