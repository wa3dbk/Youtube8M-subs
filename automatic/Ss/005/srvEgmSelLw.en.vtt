00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:07.200
 Tell me, what are you going to do? 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.719
 a new channel all our personal games 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.380
 In this new channel the first video I will 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.000
 talk about original and parallel games 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.000
 Whether or not it's worth it 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.750
 I'm an electronics technician. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.080
 I studied the xbox driver a lot 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.180
 to find out that the xbox drive is 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.510
 one of the best powerful drive in the 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.880
 games market personal 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.860
 So I'll tell you about the 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.120
 media quality here is a game 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.520
 parallel 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:47.579
 I'll get the media to you see right 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:52.289
 purple media containing the game image 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:57.000
 right staff this media I have 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:00.480
 sure that 90% of the people who play 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.690
 do not know that this media is not adequate 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.479
 for any type of personal drive none 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.729
 type of drive mainly for xbox 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:15.390
 xbox should not very powerful 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.799
 that is the slightest he does not have the weight 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.229
 ideal 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.080
 I'll explain already because he does not have 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.060
 the ideal personal weight is his quality 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.650
 not good may it be that the graph seems 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.650
 it looks good but it is not 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:34.560
 has a few minutes nobody and 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.770
 mm and personal difference of the 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.729
 unique and lightweight game with the power of 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.009
 drive cd he can not stand no 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.090
 Hold on if you see your wheel. 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.119
 xbox with the parallel game and an original 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:54.509
 parallel it will be knocking on the ceo 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.950
 nuno drum side of the box where the cd is 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.510
 he will run and try to 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:06.830
 imitate the noise and was running 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:09.440
 from now on it starts on a uhuuu shoulder 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.480
 who realized this is because the game the 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.110
 People are hitting and it's going to end the year. 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:20.720
 reader and go from your video game 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:22.870
 Let's open a game now. 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.870
 original 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:37.310
 the only team the cd is heavier the height 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:43.000
 it's a lot of day it's a little bigger than 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:47.960
 the parallel has all the quality 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.420
 You see and the team comes and saves and it's 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.390
 this is personal he has an ideal weight 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.130
 in order to run in the ninth game year 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:00.880
 video game when it 's running and goes 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:06.320
 run your it will not hit everybody everything 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:08.080
 just like this parallel game, you two 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.580
 can see the difference 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.239
 it is much lighter and this is much more 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.340
 heavy 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.380
 ie it is the original game has already been 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.860
 done with the fucking perfection of 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.200
 drive from xbox to personal then I advise 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.860
 You guys think hard before using games. 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.840
 pirates because the staff is not worth it 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.989
 You're spoiling your console. 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.130
 taking the life of your console and 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.120
 folks 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.800
 so it looks like the quality is the same 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.989
 but not so good staff 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.820
