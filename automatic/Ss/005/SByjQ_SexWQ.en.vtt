00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 given the last chapter of one's manga 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.680
 where he makes his first 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.769
 appearance the script dropped has been 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.500
 formulated innumerable questions 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.849
 around this character more 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.460
 specifically in why he has not yet 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.859
 dead in friends are welcome to the 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.080
 theories why has not fallen dead 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.570
 First, mention that it has been 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.830
 sentenced to death 40 times 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.439
 according to the 795 manga the weapons that have 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.800
 used are the gallows guillotine 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.860
 spears and swords for different reasons 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.350
 not yet revealed this man did not die 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.350
 the following theories may sound and 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.629
 logical or a bit empty and this should be 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.450
 more than anything to the information of the 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.450
 character that said we started 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.530
 theory number 1 fruit of the devil the 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.259
 first theory that comes to me 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.600
 head is that fallen has one like the 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:10.600
 humble the guys or maybe a 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.939
 elephant or rhino shark 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.799
 mention some 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.590
 mainly these animals have a 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:20.350
 extremely hard skin enduring 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.500
 great temperatures and sometimes 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.840
 some predators dropped by owning a 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.060
 from these to commas I would not explain 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.819
 what spears and swords failed to 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.909
 try to cross it but it would not explain 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:37.149
 how he did not die drowned by hanging 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.250
 just like fallen he tried to commit suicide by 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.250
 what would not be much simpler 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.770
 throwing yourself into the water and drowning dying 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.679
 be that its fruit is a shark 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.270
 which its gills would allow 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:54.700
 breathe underwater number two theory 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.399
 immortal is handled the possibility that 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.350
 fallen is immortal I do not talk about it being 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.350
 I ate a fruit that gave him such 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.770
 ability or some user to give it is 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.740
 the 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.440
 like the fruit of water but this is the 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.349
 got another way how to take a 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.390
 kind of liquid or own some object 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.940
 that prevents him from dying but what does not 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.819
 fits is that according to the definition of 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.090
 obtain immortality when the 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:25.180
 people will no longer continue to grow by 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.370
 what if dropped I take said liquid its 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.400
 age should not move forward but 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:34.720
 according to the ode drawing the years and have 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.569
 passed for fallen theory number 3 taste 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.000
 it sounds a bit crazy but first 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:43.720
 I heard first let's say as an example 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.880
 kuma that is a flavor totally what 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.670
 it prevents you from growing and your skin becomes 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.130
 much harder than normal so it 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.709
 fallen could be fully coated 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.099
 of metal and thus acquire so 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:00.790
 simplified immortality but being 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:04.150
 100% taste your age does not advance but according to 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.549
 seen the age of fallen if it advances to what 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.819
 that this one could simply possess 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:12.609
 some metal parts franky style 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:16.389
 mention that at some point in the manga 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:19.180
 it is mentioned that fallen owns a great and 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:21.849
 advanced technology so no 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:25.060
 It would sound preposterous the only doubt that 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:27.579
 I'm left because if you're part Xavi 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.660
 board would call you dropped from 100 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:32.830
 beasts 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.830
 unless 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.190
 honey 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.190
 and the last theory is 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:46.900
 themselves lucky as lucky heard such 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.720
 once fallen has only had the luck that 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.480
 at the moment of being executed the weapons 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.170
 fail and it would be an easy way to 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:59.200
 explain why he has not died even though that 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.950
 would not explain why his suicides did not 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.260
 have been produced in a good way well 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.080
 friends that was all for today's video 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.480
 it's a bit hasty and difficult to get 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.030
 theories of a character that barely gets 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.280
 has little information I hope and have them 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.980
 liked the theories and I would love 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.950
 know what you think because they believe 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:23.200
 that fallen has not died leave everything in 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.420
 the comment area please with nothing 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.800
 more than saying thank you very much for watching the 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:32.190
 video see you in the next be me 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.190
