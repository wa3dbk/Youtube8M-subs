00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:12.160
 since a liter of milk is 100 grams two 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:14.570
 tablespoon of cornstarch 100 grams of sugar 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.660
 Everyone has to do this less or more 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:22.180
 decide for yourself a tablespoon 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.180
 butter or margarine all were true 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:36.860
 To make up for a cream is the chef 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.460
 I now have half an additional minute 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:43.280
 it was given for about five minutes 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.719
 They constantly say that they are very important to me 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.239
 I keep saying that is the mistake 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.629
 make the error that they are the cream a 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.760
 factor advised and called for 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.789
 information here we will produce the songs 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.510
 anyway not be filled out 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:01.340
 but he wants me beaten 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.580
 I have a tin with me now 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:08.210
 baking paper willi the perpetrator easy 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.960
 were distributed to talk about it grated coconut 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:17.090
 then hopes the coco grate my still 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:19.000
 warm kreml and put that a ca 2 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.880
 hours cold 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.310
 so now i tell my fight the 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.530
 front as it is on the packaging 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.950
 but I take less here 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.690
 Milk as stated first 200 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.410
 milliliter indicated but I only have 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:38.700
 150 milliliters because the cream 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.700
 should be a little firmer 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.100
 200 milliliters cream with cream 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.100
 beat stiff 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.070
 so my mystery now completely 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:00.450
 cooled down about it now comes my stop 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.450
 just strip off 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:09.970
 so now I cut that 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.970
 certainly in ten twelve-meter-thick pieces 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.920
 and then want that 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:33.020
 also from this side exactly 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:41.630
 have a lot of coconut shavings down below 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:44.060
 so that's an oll either 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.739
 can you leave it like that now or you can 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.739
 cut even smaller 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.390
 today simply in coconut shavings again 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.390
 worlds 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.800
 so that's a bit now i was 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.810
 but we will then in the 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.150
 the button to set refrigerator and sneeze 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.700
 firm and taste really great 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.190
 yummy so half of it I have 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.110
 now simply left as great on a 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.840
 plate shows you later and this 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:37.400
 I will then cut even smaller so 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.400
 I like it then again through the free 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:54.450
 then come in such small funds the 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.450
 Loan I have so big left 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:11.380
 that is the one variant and that is 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.510
 because the other variant is better 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.269
 cut out of now we come to 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.810
 master recovery i got from that 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:22.240
 cake what was left in easy 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:26.280
 the kitchen machine cut small and 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.280
 I'll just sprinkle it over there 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.240
 Finally, I have on each one 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.870

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.910

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.669
