00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.869
 How to slow down a little music is new 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.660
 next lane next do not want to see this 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:38.480

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.109
 go through a quick tutorial to 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.629
 learn all about the race 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.270
 staff does not take into account the 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.750
 The name you're playing is 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.240
 the apparatus or the fluidity of the 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.860
 game if you crash or not does not turn 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.040
 So you take all this into account 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.400
 - a number that is behind the camera 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.759
 Playing 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:23.220
 the main focus is the game not the cloud 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.960
 ok let's go there adorned use the 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.600
 infinite propulsion to achieve the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.860
 other pilots who pass infection to 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.860
 spend less time 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:45.500

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.090
 At the moment you can not move the car 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.299

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:11.510

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:27.069

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.720

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.000
