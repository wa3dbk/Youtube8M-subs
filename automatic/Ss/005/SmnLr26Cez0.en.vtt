we had the ball three times so it's hard

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.660 
we had the ball three times so it's hard
to<00:01:15.380> get<00:01:15.590> into<00:01:15.680> a<00:01:15.740> rhythm<00:01:15.950> when<00:01:16.220> you<00:01:16.340> do<00:01:16.460> that

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.610 
to get into a rhythm when you do that
with<00:01:16.940> no<00:01:16.970> excuses<00:01:17.659> for<00:01:17.870> the<00:01:17.990> three<00:01:18.200> times<00:01:18.409> that

has<00:06:48.210> something<00:06:48.840> to<00:06:48.900> do<00:06:48.960> with<00:06:49.080> that<00:06:51.169> so<00:06:52.169> coach<00:06:52.409> r

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 
has something to do with that so coach r

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.050 
has something to do with that so coach r
