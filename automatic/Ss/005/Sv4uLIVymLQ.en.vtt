will activate it and and zoom or boot to

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.140 
will activate it and and zoom or boot to
the<00:00:42.800> network<00:00:43.129> already<00:00:43.280> so<00:00:43.760> it<00:00:43.910> will<00:00:44.030> be

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
the network already so it will be

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.759 
the network already so it will be
broadcasting<00:00:44.750> inside<00:00:45.080> E<00:00:45.110> and<00:00:45.440> it<00:00:45.530> will<00:00:45.620> be

generally Zumo a pin numbers 1 2 3 4 so

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:05.560 
generally Zumo a pin numbers 1 2 3 4 so
I<00:00:58.190> went<00:00:58.489> to<00:00:58.610> 1<00:00:58.790> 2<00:00:59.030> 3<00:00:59.420> 4<00:01:03.070> and<00:01:04.420> devices<00:01:05.420> are

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
I went to 1 2 3 4 and devices are

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.060 
I went to 1 2 3 4 and devices are
connected<00:01:05.869> together<00:01:06.229> accuracy<00:01:06.920> on<00:01:07.039> the
