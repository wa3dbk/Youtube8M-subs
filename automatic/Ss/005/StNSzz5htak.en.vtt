this is the weakest shotgun in the game
but<00:00:36.480> there's<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.750> reason<00:00:37.170> for<00:00:37.380> it's<00:00:37.649> an

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
but there's a reason for it's an

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.369 
but there's a reason for it's an
attachment<00:00:38.219> yes<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.420> has<00:00:39.600> very<00:00:39.870> short<00:00:40.110> range

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
attachment yes it has very short range

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.889

yes it has weak pellets it does fire
eight<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.379> them<00:00:43.559> however<00:00:43.800> they<00:00:44.040> only<00:00:44.280> do

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
eight of them however they only do

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.700 
eight of them however they only do

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
between 10 and 30 damage so there's a

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.470 
between 10 and 30 damage so there's a
good<00:00:47.039> chance<00:00:47.100> you're<00:00:47.730> not<00:00:47.760> going<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.210> kill

shotgun in the game and also that
crosshair<00:01:07.979> size<00:01:08.400> does<00:01:08.880> not<00:01:08.909> change<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.960> is

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
crosshair size does not change that is

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.039 
crosshair size does not change that is
huge<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.010> even<00:01:11.520> bigger<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.330> my<00:01:12.479> opinion<00:01:12.930> is

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
huge and even bigger in my opinion is

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.020 
huge and even bigger in my opinion is
the<00:01:13.470> fact<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.070> can<00:01:14.250> pop<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.700> on<00:01:14.820> your

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
the fact that you can pop it on your

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.240 
the fact that you can pop it on your
guns<00:01:15.299> like<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.659> FAL<00:01:16.140> or<00:01:16.350> Fowler<00:01:16.590> fail<00:01:16.920> I'm<00:01:17.100> not

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
guns like the FAL or Fowler fail I'm not

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.429 
guns like the FAL or Fowler fail I'm not
here<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.580> argue<00:01:17.610> names<00:01:18.210> but<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.900> can<00:01:19.080> pop<00:01:19.290> it

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
here to argue names but you can pop it

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.350 
here to argue names but you can pop it
on<00:01:19.560> there<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.670> have<00:01:20.880> an<00:01:21.000> assault

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.270 
on there and so you have an assault
rifle<00:01:21.450> with<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.080> shotgun<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.950> still
