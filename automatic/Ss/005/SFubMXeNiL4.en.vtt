00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.049
 unleashed and this is minecraft today 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.360
 I extract like every Saturday video 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.670
 randomly random and without 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.670
 no logic whatsoever today is a 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.850
 tutorial on how to surf in mind without 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.390
 use any type of voice 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.710
 good let's start that is the project but 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:27.829
 we are going to start from above 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.829
 if we arrived flying with a boom 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.780
 well here we are 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.140
 very easy we come here we are giving 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.820
 this button and hop 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.700
 I'm already letting go by the water 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.920
 quietly and at the same time lowering this 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.890
 you can also use it already speaking 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.980
 seriously 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.880
 as lift mode to lower our 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.710
 floors below 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.900
 but always to go down because 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.030
 to go up as you see 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.180
 as an adventure or whatever because no 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.820
 you do any kind of harm 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.440
 and well I explain how to do it 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.500
 first of all you already know that my model 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.240
 preferred is the iron block 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.480
 what he used in all my videos the if 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.480
 we climb 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.450
 and well let's see you have curiosities 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:20.049
 of the red stone that the truth that this 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.049
 madness a 3 for 4 is worth 1 2 3 and 4 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.619
 very well now we take a buyer 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:33.759
 we can not because 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:37.229
 and two young people one is looking for that 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:41.049
 there and this one plugging in here 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:44.140
 let's say a diamond for example and what 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.450
 we put our watch 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.250
 the diamond here more active and helping 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.460
 activating 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.840
 and now nothing we answer we break this and 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.450
 here we are going to put a torch of 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.450
 rest where it is here is the two 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:05.850
 we take a button 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:10.580
 the button gives equal so that another 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.580
 activate it you see us take a dispenser 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.860
 and we call a couple of blocks for 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.550
 put the things so you do not go 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.090
 the water on the sides this case 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.090
 A) Yes 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.110
 we put a bit of ground 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.930
 so that I can sit here 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.409
 quietly 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.590
 we cover that important to break the block 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:39.569
 from below that is important of everything and 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.090
 place a block of water 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.069
 in the scattered and when we give 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.780
 and then the meter is what will follow 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.900
 inside you see 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.520
 and to go down is very easy, this is the 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.250
 tutorial in a minute basically because 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.490
