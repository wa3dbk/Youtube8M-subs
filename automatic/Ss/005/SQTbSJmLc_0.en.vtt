around grab a bomb flower and this is

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.240 
around grab a bomb flower and this is
basically<00:05:45.390> the<00:05:45.600> tactic<00:05:46.050> you<00:05:46.200> this<00:05:46.620> is<00:05:46.830> my

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
basically the tactic you this is my

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.670 
basically the tactic you this is my
preferred<00:05:47.760> tactic<00:05:48.390> and<00:05:48.540> then<00:05:49.140> you<00:05:49.260> just<00:05:49.470> throw

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
preferred tactic and then you just throw

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.490 
preferred tactic and then you just throw
the<00:05:49.950> bomb<00:05:50.730> flower<00:05:51.060> in<00:05:51.330> him<00:05:51.510> and<00:05:51.780> then<00:05:52.290> he'll

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
the bomb flower in him and then he'll

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.790 
the bomb flower in him and then he'll
take<00:05:53.460> a<00:05:53.490> hit<00:05:53.940> and<00:05:54.180> then<00:05:54.630> you<00:05:54.840> can<00:05:55.080> hit<00:05:55.320> him<00:05:55.560> and

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
take a hit and then you can hit him and

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.770 
take a hit and then you can hit him and
I<00:05:55.950> did<00:05:56.160> that<00:05:56.340> really<00:05:56.850> and<00:05:56.970> efficiently<00:05:57.480> by<00:05:57.720> the

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
I did that really and efficiently by the

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:58.250 
I did that really and efficiently by the
way

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260 
way

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.550 
way
normally<00:05:58.890> I<00:05:59.250> I<00:05:59.850> don't<00:06:00.150> forget<00:06:00.900> to<00:06:01.050> pull<00:06:01.230> out<00:06:01.350> my

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
normally I I don't forget to pull out my

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.990 
normally I I don't forget to pull out my
sword<00:06:01.890> and<00:06:02.280> I<00:06:02.570> jump<00:06:03.570> attack<00:06:04.170> him<00:06:04.440> and<00:06:04.820> if<00:06:05.820> you

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
sword and I jump attack him and if you

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.080 
sword and I jump attack him and if you
do<00:06:06.150> this<00:06:06.360> method<00:06:06.840> it<00:06:07.470> shouldn't<00:06:08.250> take<00:06:08.280> long

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090 
do this method it shouldn't take long

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.450 
do this method it shouldn't take long
he<00:06:09.480> basically<00:06:09.870> just<00:06:10.020> rinses<00:06:10.710> and<00:06:10.740> repeats<00:06:11.250> his

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
he basically just rinses and repeats his

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.320 
he basically just rinses and repeats his
attacks<00:06:12.350> so<00:06:13.350> he's<00:06:13.890> really<00:06:14.280> easy<00:06:14.700> to<00:06:14.970> defeat

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
attacks so he's really easy to defeat

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.350 
attacks so he's really easy to defeat
and<00:06:15.630> then<00:06:16.140> he's<00:06:16.290> gonna<00:06:16.380> roll<00:06:16.800> around<00:06:17.010> and<00:06:17.670> just

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
and then he's gonna roll around and just

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.770 
and then he's gonna roll around and just
rehash<00:06:19.020> uh<00:06:19.560> so<00:06:20.520> like<00:06:20.700> Queen<00:06:21.060> I<00:06:21.240> I<00:06:21.270> actually

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
rehash uh so like Queen I I actually

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.230 
rehash uh so like Queen I I actually
think<00:06:22.260> he<00:06:22.410> might<00:06:22.740> be<00:06:22.770> easier<00:06:23.430> than<00:06:23.640> Queen<00:06:23.970> go

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
think he might be easier than Queen go

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.590 
think he might be easier than Queen go
my<00:06:24.510> my<00:06:24.780> opinion<00:06:25.170> I<00:06:25.590> have<00:06:26.430> never<00:06:26.850> struggled

easy<00:06:31.140> despite<00:06:31.980> the<00:06:32.160> fact<00:06:32.430> that<00:06:32.580> he<00:06:32.880> could<00:06:33.240> eat

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 
easy despite the fact that he could eat
