and<00:02:12.520> then<00:02:12.550> we<00:02:12.760> put<00:02:13.030> used<00:02:13.450> masking<00:02:13.780> tape<00:02:14.260> and

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
and then we put used masking tape and

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.010 
and then we put used masking tape and

with<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.470> masking<00:02:17.980> tape<00:02:18.160> well<00:02:18.640> we<00:02:19.120> took<00:02:19.360> the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
with the masking tape well we took the

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.900 
with the masking tape well we took the
masking<00:02:20.050> tape<00:02:20.320> and<00:02:20.590> we<00:02:21.070> copied<00:02:21.459> a<00:02:21.520> design<00:02:21.880> that

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
masking tape and we copied a design that

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.570 
masking tape and we copied a design that
we<00:02:22.390> found<00:02:22.630> that<00:02:23.080> matches<00:02:23.530> his<00:02:23.680> drum<00:02:24.010> set<00:02:24.040> and

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.410 
we found that matches his drum set and
mine's<00:02:25.209> a<00:02:25.570> little<00:02:25.600> more<00:02:26.080> across<00:02:27.150> rather<00:02:28.150> than

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
mine's a little more across rather than

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.050 
mine's a little more across rather than
diagonal<00:02:29.230> like<00:02:29.440> hers<00:02:29.680> was<00:02:30.070> and<00:02:30.430> then<00:02:30.550> I<00:02:30.820> add<00:02:31.030> my

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
diagonal like hers was and then I add my

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.500 
diagonal like hers was and then I add my
own<00:02:31.480> touch<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:31.990> I<00:02:32.050> made<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.260> bigger<00:02:32.530> X<00:02:33.510> right

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
own touch and I made a bigger X right

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.500 
own touch and I made a bigger X right
there<00:02:35.010> I'm<00:02:36.010> still<00:02:36.340> struggling<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:37.030> then<00:02:37.420> we

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
there I'm still struggling and then we

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.030 
there I'm still struggling and then we
take<00:02:37.660> a<00:02:37.720> black<00:02:37.989> sharpie<00:02:38.290> and<00:02:38.530> we<00:02:38.770> went<00:02:38.980> around

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
take a black sharpie and we went around

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.699 
take a black sharpie and we went around
the<00:02:39.220> edges<00:02:39.459> of<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.880> masking<00:02:40.390> tape<00:02:40.600> and<00:02:40.840> then

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
the edges of the masking tape and then

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.440 
the edges of the masking tape and then
we<00:02:41.800> just<00:02:41.980> pull<00:02:42.130> the<00:02:42.250> tape<00:02:42.430> off<00:02:42.459> so<00:02:43.090> basically

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
we just pull the tape off so basically

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.030

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.050 
sharpie'd it with black paint did we
ever<00:03:11.260> yeah<00:03:11.620> we<00:03:11.950> couldn't<00:03:12.280> get<00:03:12.340> fabric<00:03:12.670> paint

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
ever yeah we couldn't get fabric paint

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.220 
ever yeah we couldn't get fabric paint
because<00:03:13.299> the<00:03:13.810> stores<00:03:14.080> that<00:03:14.200> we<00:03:14.440> have<00:03:14.650> or<00:03:15.220> crap

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
because the stores that we have or crap

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.020 
because the stores that we have or crap
this<00:03:17.230> might<00:03:17.440> be<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.739> best<00:03:17.769> way<00:03:18.220> to<00:03:18.280> just<00:03:18.580> a<00:03:18.760> bit

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
this might be the best way to just a bit

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.840 
this might be the best way to just a bit
like<00:03:19.239> that<00:03:20.010> instead<00:03:21.010> of<00:03:21.040> trying<00:03:21.280> to<00:03:21.489> paint

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
like that instead of trying to paint

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.910 
like that instead of trying to paint
strokes

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.410 

our<00:03:26.920> shirts<00:03:27.250> like<00:03:27.640> say<00:03:27.880> the<00:03:28.000> same<00:03:28.150> thing<00:03:28.300> but

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
our shirts like say the same thing but

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.510 
our shirts like say the same thing but
they<00:03:28.510> look<00:03:28.660> a<00:03:28.780> little<00:03:28.900> differently<00:03:29.410> jazz<00:03:30.310> this

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
they look a little differently jazz this

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.890 
they look a little differently jazz this
looks<00:03:30.670> a<00:03:30.700> little<00:03:30.790> bit<00:03:30.970> cooler<00:03:31.270> than<00:03:31.450> mine<00:03:31.600> well

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
looks a little bit cooler than mine well

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.870 
looks a little bit cooler than mine well
I<00:03:31.960> think<00:03:32.200> it<00:03:32.260> does<00:03:32.350> because<00:03:32.590> I'm<00:03:33.400> that<00:03:33.670> person

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
I think it does because I'm that person

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.030 
I think it does because I'm that person
that's<00:03:34.150> like<00:03:34.330> I<00:03:34.510> like<00:03:34.810> straight<00:03:35.140> lines<00:03:35.380> I<00:03:35.650> need

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
that's like I like straight lines I need

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.860 
that's like I like straight lines I need
them<00:03:36.280> to<00:03:36.310> be<00:03:36.580> straight<00:03:36.940> so<00:03:37.510> when<00:03:37.660> I<00:03:37.690> was

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
them to be straight so when I was

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.870 
them to be straight so when I was
painting<00:03:38.290> in<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.590> outlines<00:03:39.040> I<00:03:39.250> like<00:03:39.370> refused

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
painting in the outlines I like refused

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.640 
painting in the outlines I like refused
to<00:03:40.000> go<00:03:40.090> outside<00:03:40.240> the<00:03:40.480> line<00:03:40.630> but<00:03:41.230> she<00:03:41.440> did<00:03:41.620> it

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
to go outside the line but she did it

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.370 
to go outside the line but she did it
she<00:03:41.800> just<00:03:41.980> kind<00:03:42.370> of<00:03:42.490> like<00:03:42.780> she's<00:03:43.780> is<00:03:43.900> painted

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
she just kind of like she's is painted
