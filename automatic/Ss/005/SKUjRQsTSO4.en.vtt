over sentence be granted he only did

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.039 
over sentence be granted he only did
play<00:01:43.680> 10<00:01:44.100> games<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.790> season<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.750> guess

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
play 10 games that season so I guess

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.480 
play 10 games that season so I guess
they<00:01:46.200> did<00:01:46.380> face<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.770> off<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.070> previous

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
injury and killing it and seriously

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.410 
injury and killing it and seriously
killing<00:02:22.620> he<00:02:22.739> he<00:02:23.040> really<00:02:23.220> did<00:02:23.340> work<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:24.090> now

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
killing he he really did work and now

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.119 
killing he he really did work and now
obviously<00:02:24.870> he<00:02:25.049> has<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.319> whole<00:02:25.439> summer<00:02:25.739> to<00:02:26.010> do

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
obviously he has the whole summer to do

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.460 
obviously he has the whole summer to do
more<00:02:26.430> rehab<00:02:26.670> more<00:02:27.209> conditioning<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.170> think

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
more rehab more conditioning and I think

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.630 
more rehab more conditioning and I think
this<00:02:28.560> season<00:02:28.920> he's<00:02:29.099> going<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.370> be<00:02:29.430> ready

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
this season he's going to be ready

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.819 
this season he's going to be ready
obviously<00:02:30.629> I<00:02:30.659> can't<00:02:30.959> be<00:02:31.079> biased<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.560> now<00:02:31.650> it's

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:31.829 
obviously I can't be biased and now it's

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:33.920 
obviously I can't be biased and now it's
time<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.129> think<00:02:32.340> of<00:02:32.519> a<00:02:32.579> writing<00:02:32.849> team<00:02:33.030> STG<00:02:33.720> for

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
time to think of a writing team STG for

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.949 
time to think of a writing team STG for
Derrick<00:02:34.260> Rose<00:02:34.409> in<00:02:34.590> NBA<00:02:34.890> 2k16<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:35.970> don't<00:02:36.480> see<00:02:36.750> him

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
Derrick Rose in NBA 2k16 I don't see him

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.990 
Derrick Rose in NBA 2k16 I don't see him
being<00:02:36.989> in<00:02:37.439> the<00:02:37.890> 90s<00:02:38.310> this<00:02:38.459> year<00:02:38.670> as<00:02:38.790> well<00:02:38.939> I

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
being in the 90s this year as well I

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.819 
being in the 90s this year as well I
think<00:02:39.209> he's<00:02:39.510> going<00:02:39.629> to<00:02:39.750> start<00:02:39.900> off<00:02:40.079> as<00:02:40.319> an<00:02:40.439> 88

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829 
think he's going to start off as an 88

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.280 
think he's going to start off as an 88
maybe<00:02:41.489> even<00:02:41.609> an<00:02:41.970> 89<00:02:42.450> since<00:02:42.840> he<00:02:42.959> did<00:02:43.140> play

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
maybe even an 89 since he did play

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.589 
maybe even an 89 since he did play
better<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:43.859> see<00:02:44.310> Derrick<00:02:44.670> Rose<00:02:44.849> as<00:02:45.000> an<00:02:45.150> 89<00:02:45.569> I

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
better I see Derrick Rose as an 89 I

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.360 
better I see Derrick Rose as an 89 I
