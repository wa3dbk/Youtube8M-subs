00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.030
 you are welcome 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.170
 today's training lesson the envelope how much exercise 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.169
 cardiovascular should make a skinny 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:15.429
 you must do it after your training or before 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.429
 so let's talk about cardiovascular exercises again 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:22.419
 or what I taught my clients is doing their cardiovascular exercise 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:25.659
 after they finish their training 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:28.749
 is the best time to burn stored fat 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:31.169
 let's do this training 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.930
 I'm going to warm up for five minutes 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.970
 I'm going to do it around 13 kilometers per hour 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.580
 nothing fast 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.540
 good and stable 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.950
 13 kilometers per hour for five minutes is simply going to warm us 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.080
 after five minutes 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.220
 let's run hard for ten minutes 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.010
 I will run at full speed for one minute and then I will walk during 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.390
 one minute 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.360
 we are reaching the number one interval 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.830
 nor five minutes of warm-up were finished 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.320
 now we are going to around 16 kilometers per hour keep that up 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.600
 the end 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.460
 you must be relaxed 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.900
 lower the shoulders 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.390
 sepi feels 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.070
 you do not belong 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.740
 just relax 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.929
 peace to perceive that one minute passes very fast in the slow part 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.000
 this is the reason why today food and pop 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.590
 to stay focused 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.050
 many people tell me 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.050
 because I have to do cardiovascular exercises at intervals 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.780
 by the way you're told like that because you're going fast slow waltz 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.070
 fast peace you go slow 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.070
 Bodybuilders do not do cardiovascular exercises 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.980
 that's why they take many drugs 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.420
 those drugs help them not store fat 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.240
 remember 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.729
 Cardiovascular exercises are totally related to the amount 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.170
 total calories what else 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.990
 you can use the bicycle 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.980
 a climber 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.440
 preferably choose things that work your glutes and your quadriceps 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.110
 here we go again 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.489
 now we give it to 18 points 5 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.889
 we almost reached the end of training 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:16.639
 Even if you do not believe it, sometimes you begin to feel that you find a 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:19.639
 little easier because you are becoming more efficient 

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:23.759
 you feel more comfortable and find your rhythm 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:26.879
 very good now I'm just walking 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:28.809
 5 points 6 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:30.849
 comfortable and slow 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.730
 once you have the 10 minute intervals 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.359
 high speed 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:37.769
 you should not do more than ten 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.769
 then you must concentrate on increasing the speed 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.059
 right now 

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:47.159
 neither treadmill only climbs up to 19 points 3 kilometers per hour 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.549
 so I must get up to 19 points 3 during the next week 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.299
 in your case 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.879
 concentrate on doing it faster 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.879
 it is difficult to do it 8 kilometers per hour faster 

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:03.119
 focus on quality versus quantity 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:05.179
 catch your breath 

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:06.859
 cool t 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.719
 give yourself five minutes 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:10.159
 shake 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.829
 I'm going to take a sip of this to start the recovery process 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.170
 my training ended up observing that I did not drink any carbohydrate drink during 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.429
 the exercise 

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:23.769
 this is because I wanted to burn fat if I had taken it I would have started to 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.619
 burn your house until soon 

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:26.509
 thanks friends
