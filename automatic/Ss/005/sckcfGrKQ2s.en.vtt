00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
series and I have to say the gun Kippur

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.270 
series and I have to say the gun Kippur
is<00:05:14.310> yeah<00:05:15.210> that<00:05:15.690> gun<00:05:16.140> is<00:05:16.289> just<00:05:16.530> ridiculously

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
is yeah that gun is just ridiculously

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.159 
is yeah that gun is just ridiculously
bad<00:05:17.550> in<00:05:17.849> my<00:05:18.000> opinion<00:05:18.300> as<00:05:18.570> far<00:05:18.900> as<00:05:19.020> dual

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
bad in my opinion as far as dual

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.589 
bad in my opinion as far as dual
wielding<00:05:19.590> weapons<00:05:19.950> are<00:05:20.250> concerned<00:05:20.640> um<00:05:20.940> I

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:21.599 
wielding weapons are concerned um I

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:23.750 
wielding weapons are concerned um I
think<00:05:22.440> it<00:05:22.560> has<00:05:22.650> the<00:05:22.710> most<00:05:23.010> recall<00:05:23.370> out<00:05:23.520> of<00:05:23.640> all

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
think it has the most recall out of all

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.020 
think it has the most recall out of all
the<00:05:23.880> guns<00:05:24.090> when<00:05:24.510> you<00:05:24.599> do<00:05:24.750> a<00:05:24.780> wheeled<00:05:25.020> and<00:05:25.260> I

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
the guns when you do a wheeled and I

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.909 
the guns when you do a wheeled and I
can't<00:05:27.030> I<00:05:27.210> mean<00:05:27.360> I<00:05:27.479> could<00:05:27.840> get<00:05:27.990> a<00:05:28.020> gameplay<00:05:28.440> it's
