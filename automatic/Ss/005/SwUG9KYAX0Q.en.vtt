00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.510
 hello dear viewers we never 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.269
 there was no fight i present my work on 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.610
 competition from electronics art only 24 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.929
 attacker I choose you why 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.600
 still attack aircraft my choice is not 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.189
 scout no support not even engineer 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.260
 the thing is that the game is correct 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.210
 attack aircraft we are in the neighborhood and doctors 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.000
 brings the most benefit to our 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.130
 the team and us we benefit in the form 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.630
 points of fast leveling but 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.579
 the rest of the guys in the team are always 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.410
 get the benefit see your someone them 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.090
 treats someone saves them if suddenly they 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.600
 hit q is a very unpleasant situation 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.940
 and others like that, but that 's not all 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.489
 naturally playing for attack aircraft we can 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.559
 perform functions not only physician but from 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.469
 the most attack aircraft then from this storm 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.390
 point and walk and kill enemies we can 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.090
 kill absolutely any enemy Putin 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.550
 engineers Putin support be he scout 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.969
 just because we have the most 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.500
 exact the most powerful and most generally the most 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.210
 the best weapon that had just been 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.189
 represented by developers in this game 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.320
 Well, as a result of all this, we 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.450
 we have what a huge amount of points and 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.210
 you can bring in being only medical 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.549
 there is a need for someone 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.830
 saved someone cured never 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.140
 disappears on any server on any 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.420
 map never in this universe 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.490
 well and since we play btr-4 they are in 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.979
 simulator surgeon 4 then forever and with 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.110
 gathering something like a won go kill five 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.020
 clamping enemies caused rather than 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.180
 so powerful accurate and go destroy 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.409
 That is not a beautiful house that does not obscure 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.020
 one can see the mountains with the help of his 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.329
 grenade launcher well naturally 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.250
 a small incident is that against 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.130
 we presented practically nothing 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.259
 we can not get out and if we 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.930
 we will kill to either engineer enemy we will take away 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.930
 his gear and shoot the enemy 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.119
 the tank and equipment of this gaping 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.030
 the engineers thereby show their 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.829
 multifunctionality and ability 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.020
 adapt in difficult situations and 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.640
 continuing your story is worth noting something 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.350
 that the medic is the very class that 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.090
 gives people the most good 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.129
 moods because absolutely everyone 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.289
 nice when they are saved when they are treated 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.830
 and this is a feeling that can not be compared with 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.140
 the senses 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.120
 when you and you ammo or once 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.620
 tank mending or when you see on 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.990
 minimap for crowded ally 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.070
 scout of enemies is something special and 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:26.220
 methods of communicating words are these feelings 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:28.680
 scientists from Britain have not yet invented 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.420
 so you gave them to you in words not 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.700
 I can only need it to go into the game and 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.280
 just test it so to speak 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.840
 medic this class who has direct 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.120
 use absolutely on all maps 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.340
 absolutely in all battlefield modes 4 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.470
 for example let's take the engineer that he 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.890
 can do in mode tim dematch 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:51.000
 he can kill enemies he can kill 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.920
 enemies and he can kill enemies seems 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.590
 Yes, I'm sure that he can do 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.080
 one thing he can kill enemies he can't 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.850
 to repair the technique he cannot ride in 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.830
 tank he can't do it all 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.810
 just because of all this mode 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.450
 does not give attack aircraft is always and everywhere 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.370
 performs his functions he treats he 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.990
 saves regardless of modes 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.150
 which play and regardless of 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.740
 cards you play if you 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.860
 you play attack aircraft then your services 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.900
 absolutely always will be needed 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.670
 just because it's a battlefield here 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.160
 someone always kills someone 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.140
 someone hurts need to be treated need to be saved 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.060
 and of course this is a huge plus for this 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.190
 class well and bringing this video to 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.720
 final logical i would like to 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.840
 systematize everything 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.480
 said already and all the same why attack aircraft 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.430
 the first reason is a huge factor 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.080
 beneficial for their team and 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.360
 actually for ourselves we get huge 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.550
 the number of points is simply playing 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.500
 command second is what we have 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.019
 the easiest to use 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.370
 the exact most powerful weapon the third one is 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.670
 that we give people a good mood 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.920
 when we save and when we treat them and 4 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.510
 this is what we can play for the purpose 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.769
 absolutely in all game modes and 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.989
 absolutely everywhere we will find ourselves 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.430
 application on that note I complete my 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.019
 the story about the medic thanks to everyone who 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.850
 I watched this video until the end I wish 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.340
 jury members who are in a good mood 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:11.780
 will rate this video thanks to all 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.780
 for watching all bye
