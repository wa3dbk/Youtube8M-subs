leads<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.870> something<00:01:55.080> keep<00:01:55.350> stay<00:01:55.979> tuned<00:01:56.190> for

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
leads to something keep stay tuned for

map<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.080> there's<00:02:01.260> a<00:02:01.320> three<00:02:01.620> in<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.740> bottom

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
map and there's a three in the bottom

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.940 
map and there's a three in the bottom
left<00:02:02.310> hand<00:02:02.400> corner<00:02:03.020> so<00:02:04.020> I'd<00:02:04.350> also<00:02:04.590> know<00:02:04.920> that

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
theory check this out three shown and

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.390 
theory check this out three shown and
