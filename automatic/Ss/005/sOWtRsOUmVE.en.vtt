that's<00:01:22.650> quite<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.130> big<00:01:23.520> gap<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.420> time<00:01:24.780> it's

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
that's quite a big gap of time it's

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.410 
that's quite a big gap of time it's
obviously<00:01:25.590> not<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:26.430> tributed<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.909> one<00:01:27.030> story

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
obviously not the tributed the one story

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.100 
obviously not the tributed the one story
like<00:01:27.630> Mark<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.470> we<00:01:28.530> also<00:01:29.659> got<00:01:30.659> injured<00:01:30.990> in

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
like Mark and we also got injured in

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.020 
like Mark and we also got injured in
that<00:01:31.140> period<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:31.920> it's<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.189> big<00:01:32.369> sort<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.790> gap

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
that period so it's the big sort of gap

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.670 
that period so it's the big sort of gap
I<00:01:33.329> would<00:01:33.750> have<00:01:33.840> fought<00:01:34.020> fought<00:01:34.409> they<00:01:34.560> would

have just focused more on the hidden

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.710 
have just focused more on the hidden
being<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.610> champion<00:01:39.119> but<00:01:39.299> obviously<00:01:39.540> they're

being the champion but obviously they're

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.630

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
going a bit further which could be a

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.219 
going a bit further which could be a
good<00:01:41.759> thing<00:01:41.820> could<00:01:42.270> be<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> bad<00:01:42.570> thing<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.960> mean
