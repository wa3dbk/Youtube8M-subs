group<00:02:55.100> but<00:02:56.710> got<00:02:57.710> to<00:02:57.800> move<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:58.040> site<00:02:58.280> over<00:02:58.550> to

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
group but got to move the site over to

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.900 
group but got to move the site over to
the<00:02:58.760> right<00:02:58.970> but<00:02:59.440> first<00:03:00.440> shots<00:03:00.709> through<00:03:01.010> it<00:03:01.130> it

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
the right but first shots through it it

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.540 
the right but first shots through it it
works<00:03:02.209> the<00:03:02.450> actions<00:03:02.870> have<00:03:03.170> really<00:03:03.950> smooth<00:03:04.280> and

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
works the actions have really smooth and

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.330 
works the actions have really smooth and
I<00:03:05.140> think<00:03:06.140> Ruger<00:03:06.410> hit<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:06.620> home<00:03:06.830> run<00:03:06.860> with<00:03:07.220> this

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
I think Ruger hit a home run with this

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.959
