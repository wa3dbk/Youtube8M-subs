00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.869
 otherwise you actually get nothing 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.869
 shortage with this car 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.759
 the chassis of the car is also good 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.259

 position you can slope to snow position 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.560
 Stand to really tell you that out 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.459

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.920
 slopes 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.120
 then you notice the changed car b 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.700
 but considering it also the range rover sport 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.430
 has been left completely 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.819
 still and dynamic function and then it goes 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.130

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.209
 at the counter they become with a red 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.070
 and here you just notice by the 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.160
 handling we know immediately then you can 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.970
 harder and 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.970

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.260
 for the sinus but this time really one 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.540
 function of this one they each 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.469
