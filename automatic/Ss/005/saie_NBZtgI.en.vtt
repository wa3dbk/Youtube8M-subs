 months you can see a 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.850
 more natural and definitive result 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.820

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.170
 scars 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.630
 each person has a process of 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.720
 healing that does not depend on 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.780
 of mexico but of the organism

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.010
 used can be opened or closed in the 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.320
 open technique 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:22.169
 make a small incision that is 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.960
 hidden below the nasal tip 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:27.449
 already in the closed technique the incision is 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.260
 performed only on the inside of the 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.020

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.949
 the nose and the scars are 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.350
 hidden in the nasal juice and in some 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:48.990
 cases it may be necessary to use 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:52.590
 caps on the nose that are removed in 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:55.050
 a little while the scars mature and 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.010
 become imperceptible with the passing of 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.100

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.490
 harmonizing the face and also improving 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.490
 respiratory function 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.490

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.310
 be indicated for cleaning and clearing
