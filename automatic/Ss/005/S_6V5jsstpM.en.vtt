00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:40.540
 patient character pleasure the gt 86 that's 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.670
 all this at once after almost a 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.160
 decade without producing sports coupe 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.110
 Toyota returns to the cars of yesteryear 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.160
 Toyota finally left a 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.440
 blank sheet to develop this 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.930
 car where some builders 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.910
 decide to drift and a sports coupe 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.360
 a sports car from a car of 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.010
 big series 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.630
 we took the problem backwards 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.320
 finally gave up what solutions 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.260
 techniques 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.760
 should we put in place to get the 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.610
 best sports possible 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.400
 solutions here they are a clean look and 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.880
 slender with a muscular front despite everything 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:16.000
 and like any self-respecting sportsman 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.460
 it is a motor propulsion before the 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.710
 precisely atmospheric engine 200 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.119
 opposed 4-cylinder flat horses 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.400
 the great benefit of this architecture 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:27.040
 makes it possible to have an engine that 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.630
 implanted very very low also in 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.490
 back you see here the motor there and 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.770
 it is really very low in the 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.970
 compartment and the benefit of that 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.520
 is that we will lower the center of 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.840
 gravity and which are of low gravity d 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.210
 a car that will be much better 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.470
 the road there is much more agile in 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.899
 term of road behavior 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.330
 let's take a walk inside one 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.190
 I was 86 turns out to be a twice 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.899
 Luxurious two- seater everything is within reach 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.390
 hand for the driver and 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.610
 pedals treated in polished aluminum recalls well 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.960
 the race and vehicle touch and I 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.069
 think who characterizes it the driest 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.229
 it's finally a car in 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:59.740
 which we will have fun even at 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.420
 low speed 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.180
 we do not need to drive fast to get 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.000
 to please 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.770
 the car really gives the sensation 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:15.700
 to communicate with the road she is 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:20.610
 very communicative saintais 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.610
 to score 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.380
 hardly the day starts and the surroundings 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.830
 of the gt 86 have invaded by a crowd of 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.020
 curious 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.550
 just by posing next to the visitors 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.590
 already feel like stars 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:39.080
 movie really a very nice nape 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:41.060
 is there it was long ago 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.380
 I had not seen such a racy toyota 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:48.140
 frankly if we have the means to 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:55.610
 swords live on gives the keys I 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:56.020
 request the gray card also yes level 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.830
 look 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:04.100
 it sends it's nice it gives meaning to 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.180
 his level look it's successful we did not 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.390
 that a desire is tender with the 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.190
 contact no problem to cross 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.620
 the not a simulator offers the 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.240
 opportunity to drive the gt the tone 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.220
 of a race 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.270
 not so easy as it sounds 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.070
 taken in hand is a little weird this 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.190
 that there are a lot of returns in the 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.050
 flying but 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.670
 but once we've taken 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.440
 the habit here is at the end of the end of 30 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.060
 seconds after that goes no what's it 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.730
 What is that dream 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.050
 I wish I had it is the turn of 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.050
 camille and mickaÃ«l to embark 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:43.459
 the want it is superior 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.900
 these last camille is not very 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.940
 comfortable with sports driving 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.150
 but after a while it seems to be going 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.150
 better 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.650
 well there I was maybe not at 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.470
 put in all hands 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.880
 but for about 30,000 euros it will be 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.880
 seduce and find his audience
