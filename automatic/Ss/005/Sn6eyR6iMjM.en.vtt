00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:21.000
 hi to all these fps b today i 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.610
 will show you how to have a tank 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.279
 have a police helicopter or 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.759

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.340
 5 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:32.040
 so for that you are going to have to 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.140
 makes it to the secret military base of 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.180
 gta 5 so when she secretes 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.290
 you can not have on a good mac 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.699
 sure then she is right here so 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.070
 here we go to the city 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.890
 you go up this highway by 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.559
 example and you will come to a 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.940
 given moment aston here so if you're there 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.790
 go to the coast this is the place just 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.790
 there is a bump and actually this place 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.470
 hides a secret military base on 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:03.180
 this base is going you can find the 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:06.840
 tanks the helicopters 1 via several series 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.510
 like the fighter plane etc and I'm going 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.490
 show the easiest way to 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.130
 to get into the base and stole this 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.530
 that you want for that you go 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.740
 have to go here so far 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.530
 the highway north of the base so 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.350
 justice and where we can see my little 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.420
 slider and you're going to have to have a 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.250
 pretty good car 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.890
 finally you are going to have to have a 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.480
 pretty powerful car so a truck 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.940
 life it will not work you go 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.870
 see directly why here ben me 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.420
 I'm not pissed off I took a 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:44.340
 lamborghini you are coming here 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.020
 accelerate as quickly as possible 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:51.060
 could do as fast as you 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.280
 can and just arrived at the soul at the base 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.240
 in fact you will take a right from the 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:00.320
 tunnel on the hill and you will see 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.320
 right now what's going to happen 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.090
 and here we are in the base 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.520
 military then he has he will have to get himself 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.590
 hurry up very quickly who's coming 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.660
 directly spot and here you have 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.580
 that four stars and you 're going to 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.040
 hurry to take a plane 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:21.630
 so there are several locations 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.680
 plane a Norman if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:30.690
 not good here 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:33.120
 here you have to run here you are 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.900
 get on the plane you do triangle 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.360
 close right next 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.910
 there it will take a few seconds to 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.610
 take the plane and hurry to 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.980
 take off from you press r26 do not 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.010
 will surpass and you as soon as you put 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.330
 the jay style straight up and 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.820
 they're going to take off on barely 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.260
 a few meters so that's not bad 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:56.310
 then to pay attention to 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.680
 missiles after if you managed to 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.469
 to escape to learn it should go 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.810
 it's practically safe so 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:07.870
 it's the only thing it's difficult 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.189
 it's to avoid the hemicycle they 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.099
 send directly as it is at 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:16.170
 above the base then you can 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:18.280
 press square can the different 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.829
 the different sets that you have 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.040
 on this plane you have the missiles and 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:26.379
 the cannon voc the cannon do not know I 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.599
 not terrible we do not really know touched 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.629
 that's the funniest thing of course these are 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:33.870
 the homing missiles and more 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:37.120
 so you press square to change 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.489
 super in any case that since 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.109
 stops to change weapons and you 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.530
 press x dick lock to 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:48.010
 shoot and there you can do a 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:50.370
 frankly amuse you a rsa the 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.370
 carnage 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.070
 so here I took a fighter 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.440
 because that's of course the one thing the 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.910
 more impressive to arouse at 5 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.010
 but you can also take some 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.590
 temples for the time you have fast 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.090
 you go next to a time so that 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.070
 it's time like life it's the 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.350
 hardest thing what they spot 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:14.710
 directly and shoot you big shells 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.269
 above and after that you went to 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.000
 side of time you will go to 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.519
 the left front of the tank and you go 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.290
 can actually get out the character who 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.090
 drive the time and take yourself the 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.620
 time it must be said that as soon as you 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:30.010
 know as you are limit 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.710
 invincible they know more they will have 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.230
 evil in any case kill you and finally 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:38.530
 Ben the helicopter 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:42.190
 he was just left in fact what 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.690
 I flew to the hangars finally 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:47.190
 to the sheds actually right in front 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.190
 you will find helicopters 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.010
 and that's me I thought everything said knowing 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.920
 that the plane also that I took there is 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.210
 not the only place there really is the 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.610
 a lot of places 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:04.570
 you can find them ads 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:06.730
 military base and one can also call 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.260
 second only to change the view but 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:14.110
 that's what you say it's great 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:17.140
 choice to drive like that so here I 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.830
 no longer decent are in my plane on 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:23.440
 put it would have landed actually 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.570
 I'm going to die now and now 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.880
 apartment actually I do not know what 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.080
 happens is it's the one who who 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.690
 is broken or is it my life is 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.130
 maybe it's done on purpose not to 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.070
 that you can hold too much 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.910
 long in the plane and so from 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.820
 of a certain moment there is no longer 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.640
 of gasoline in it and you fall so 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.630
