don't like any of the results you can

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.750 
don't like any of the results you can
reroll<00:01:30.870> any<00:01:31.050> number<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.500> them<00:01:31.620> one<00:01:31.950> time<00:01:32.220> so

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
reroll any number of them one time so

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.390
