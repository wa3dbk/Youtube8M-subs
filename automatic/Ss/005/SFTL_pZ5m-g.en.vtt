00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
his charizard because at this point I'm

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.089 
his charizard because at this point I'm
so<00:02:57.690> expecting<00:02:58.079> Charizard<00:02:58.409> y<00:02:58.500> so<00:02:58.920> when<00:02:59.040> you

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
so expecting Charizard y so when you

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.740 
so expecting Charizard y so when you
cease<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.430> exa<00:02:59.849> I<00:03:00.090> see<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.450> window<00:03:00.629> of

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
cease the exa I see a window of

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.030 
cease the exa I see a window of
opportunity<00:03:00.840> but<00:03:01.409> at<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.620> same<00:03:01.769> time<00:03:01.920> I'm

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
opportunity but at the same time I'm

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.339 
opportunity but at the same time I'm
also<00:03:02.129> like<00:03:02.400> okay<00:03:02.760> this<00:03:03.000> is<00:03:03.060> probably<00:03:03.269> over<00:03:03.599> but

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
also like okay this is probably over but

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.680 
also like okay this is probably over but
i<00:03:04.829> do<00:03:05.220> get<00:03:05.849> my<00:03:05.970> leech<00:03:06.180> nadal<00:03:06.450> thought<00:03:06.599> to

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
i do get my leech nadal thought to

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.539 
i do get my leech nadal thought to
Charizard<00:03:07.079> so<00:03:07.260> there's<00:03:07.709> still<00:03:08.129> a<00:03:08.340> small

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
Charizard so there's still a small

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.819 
Charizard so there's still a small
window<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:08.970> opportunity<00:03:09.060> I<00:03:09.569> know<00:03:09.829> Magnezone

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
window of opportunity I know Magnezone

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.160 
window of opportunity I know Magnezone
can't<00:03:11.040> do<00:03:11.129> very<00:03:11.280> much<00:03:11.400> to<00:03:11.760> me<00:03:11.909> as<00:03:12.569> a<00:03:12.629> whole<00:03:12.930> so<00:03:12.959> I

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
can't do very much to me as a whole so I

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.509 
can't do very much to me as a whole so I
just<00:03:13.379> need<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:13.560> kill<00:03:13.709> this<00:03:13.739> trouser<00:03:14.099> time<00:03:14.400> I

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
just need to kill this trouser time I

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.670 
just need to kill this trouser time I
might<00:03:15.150> just<00:03:15.359> be<00:03:15.420> able<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.690> win<00:03:15.810> this<00:03:15.959> game<00:03:16.049> now

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
might just be able to win this game now

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.830 
might just be able to win this game now
this<00:03:16.829> next<00:03:17.040> turn<00:03:17.280> I<00:03:17.459> he's<00:03:18.000> probably<00:03:18.269> expecting

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
this next turn I he's probably expecting

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.180 
this next turn I he's probably expecting
me<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:18.989> protect<00:03:19.319> once<00:03:19.560> again<00:03:19.859> because<00:03:20.160> I

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
me to protect once again because I

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.800 
me to protect once again because I
didn't<00:03:20.430> protect<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.849> last<00:03:21.030> turn<00:03:21.239> so<00:03:21.480> for<00:03:21.690> two

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
didn't protect the last turn so for two

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.930 
didn't protect the last turn so for two
turns<00:03:22.019> in<00:03:22.109> a<00:03:22.200> row<00:03:22.230> i<00:03:22.560> leave<00:03:23.040> my<00:03:23.190> further<00:03:23.609> in<00:03:23.760> on

this<00:03:24.060> Charizard<00:03:24.480> X<00:03:24.540> not<00:03:24.840> protecting<00:03:25.319> but<00:03:25.440> it

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
this Charizard X not protecting but it

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.080 
this Charizard X not protecting but it
plays<00:03:25.799> off<00:03:25.980> as<00:03:26.160> he<00:03:26.250> gets<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.579> kale<00:03:26.730> onto<00:03:27.000> my

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
plays off as he gets the kale onto my

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.240 
plays off as he gets the kale onto my
rhythm<00:03:27.359> wash<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.780> Faron<00:03:28.650> is<00:03:28.799> going<00:03:29.099> to<00:03:29.160> be

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
rhythm wash and Faron is going to be

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.009 
rhythm wash and Faron is going to be
able<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.519> get<00:03:29.639> an<00:03:29.730> attack<00:03:29.970> off<00:03:30.209> but<00:03:30.510> will<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:30.840> be

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
able to get an attack off but will it be

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.170 
able to get an attack off but will it be
enough<00:03:31.049> I<00:03:31.560> am<00:03:32.010> going<00:03:32.160> to<00:03:32.280> go<00:03:32.400> gyro<00:03:32.700> ball<00:03:32.940> this

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
enough I am going to go gyro ball this

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.089 
enough I am going to go gyro ball this
Charizard<00:03:33.930> which<00:03:34.139> will<00:03:34.440> do<00:03:34.590> a<00:03:34.620> lot<00:03:34.889> even

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
Charizard which will do a lot even

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:36.680 
Charizard which will do a lot even
though<00:03:35.250> it<00:03:35.430> resists<00:03:35.849> because<00:03:36.150> the<00:03:36.480> speed

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
though it resists because the speed

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.390 
though it resists because the speed
difference<00:03:36.810> is<00:03:37.139> so<00:03:37.290> big<00:03:37.500> you<00:03:37.709> see<00:03:38.129> here<00:03:38.370> I

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
difference is so big you see here I

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.159 
difference is so big you see here I
bring<00:03:39.269> it<00:03:39.359> down<00:03:39.480> to<00:03:39.569> around<00:03:39.660> twenty<00:03:40.019> five

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:40.169 
bring it down to around twenty five

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.589 
bring it down to around twenty five
percent<00:03:40.200> so<00:03:40.650> I'm<00:03:41.220> gonna<00:03:41.459> heal<00:03:42.030> back<00:03:42.209> half<00:03:42.480> of

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
percent so I'm gonna heal back half of

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.629 
percent so I'm gonna heal back half of
that<00:03:42.720> would<00:03:42.870> leave<00:03:43.019> see<00:03:43.230> so<00:03:43.379> I<00:03:43.410> need<00:03:43.769> a<00:03:43.799> double

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
that would leave see so I need a double

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:45.949 
that would leave see so I need a double
protect<00:03:44.970> here<00:03:45.150> actually<00:03:45.480> no<00:03:45.569> excuse<00:03:45.810> me<00:03:45.930> I

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
protect here actually no excuse me I

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.839 
protect here actually no excuse me I
don't<00:03:46.230> need<00:03:46.319> to<00:03:46.379> protect<00:03:46.889> I<00:03:47.069> mean<00:03:47.489> to<00:03:47.549> protect

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
don't need to protect I mean to protect

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.369 
don't need to protect I mean to protect
here<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.150> first<00:03:48.329> time<00:03:48.569> but<00:03:48.870> that<00:03:49.079> might<00:03:49.319> not

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
here the first time but that might not

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.080 
here the first time but that might not
be<00:03:49.530> enough<00:03:49.680> let's<00:03:50.040> see<00:03:50.190> her<00:03:50.760> throats<00:03:51.000> gonna

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
be enough let's see her throats gonna

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.449 
be enough let's see her throats gonna
get<00:03:51.299> the<00:03:51.419> first<00:03:51.599> protect<00:03:51.930> off<00:03:52.280> charizard<00:03:53.280> is

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
get the first protect off charizard is

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.159 
get the first protect off charizard is
going<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:53.879> go<00:03:53.970> for<00:03:54.150> an<00:03:54.209> overheat<00:03:54.660> instead<00:03:54.959> of<00:03:55.079> a
