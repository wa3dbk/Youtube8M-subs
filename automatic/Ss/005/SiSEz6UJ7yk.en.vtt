00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:18.600
 here in the femur will have those who 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.920
 are two lower upper extremities 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:26.460
 will have three faces a previous 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:29.310
 one lateral one half and will have 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.369
 three edges of which the average 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.900
 bilateral are not very visible the edge 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.110
 later will be more marked 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:43.070
 the upper extremity let's see that 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:45.980
 it goes in the neck in head neck and 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.290
 head collar is going to be a head 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.110
 rounded that will present a 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.330
 notch in the shape of a little thing where 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.450
 is going to insert what is the ligament 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.600
 real 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.450
 the neck this is the anatomical neck 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.550
 because it's the anatomical neck because 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.500
 study this neck is going to be like a 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.000
 prolongation of the head that goes towards 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.730
 down that will join continue to the 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.250
 body in the body of what is the 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.320
 upper extremity let's count on 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.300
 two large tubers in tuber 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.920
 greater that is the greater trochanter and the 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.170
 minor tuber that is going to be the 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.780
 minor trochanter 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.690
 and there we can appreciate 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.210
 not what it is 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.550
 stress the narrowing of the 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.050
 upper extremity that is going to be the 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.630
 surgical neck because cabbage 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:37.640
 surgical because here they go to all 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.640
 fractures and injuries the fabulous 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.240
 here we can appreciate the back face 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.979
 where we are going to see a very salient edge 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.770
 which is going to be the back edge or line 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:51.369
 is the back edge is going to be divided 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:55.149
 that nothing in the top three 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.880
 lines one side line one half line 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.130
 and a medial line 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.799
 the most lateral line you go another sing 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.079
 the gluteus is going to be inserted here 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.740
 greater the middle line goes is the trochanter 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.899
 less 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.660
 and here the muscle is going to be inserted 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.819
 This line is also going to be 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.350
 called effective line 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.240
 the most medial 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.950
 and will end up in the previous part 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.050
 bottom of the chicken our will insert 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.600
 the vastus medialis muscle 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:30.140
 the line but as we said is a 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.140
 rough line that gives a lip 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.020
 inter station and a medium lip where 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.830
 it goes insertion to the vast adductor and 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.830
 femoral biceps 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.930
 on the back edge on your part 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.930
 lower is going to continue with two 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.470
 lines that will end up in their 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.470
 extremes 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.780
 here we can see what the condyles are 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.060
 medial 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.000
 here we can see what the furrows are 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.090
 supra hidden that go in which 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.640
 they will find the medial tubers and 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.330
 laterals in the middle one is going to insert 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:11.270
 the gastronomic medial and on the lateral 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.910
 is going to split in two the superior one is going 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.650
 to insert what is gastronomy 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.060
 lateral and in the inferior the tendon of 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.280
 bit 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.890
 on the side parts of the codes 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.630
 which are going to insert respectively the 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.630
 tibial collateral ligament and the 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:30.180
 ligament the peroneal ligament 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.980
 in the previous face we will see what 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.730
 it's the mop where it's going to 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.880
 articulate the kneecap by means of a 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.840
 set of 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.840
 fibrous
