00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
battle now this is very interesting what

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.349 
battle now this is very interesting what
if<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.670> was<00:00:18.210> Frieza<00:00:18.690> in<00:00:19.109> his<00:00:19.680> second<00:00:20.220> form<00:00:20.550> that

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
if it was Frieza in his second form that

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.720 
if it was Frieza in his second form that
battled<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:22.109> perfect<00:00:22.740> cell<00:00:23.039> at<00:00:23.250> his<00:00:23.369> first

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
battled in perfect cell at his first

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.050 
battled in perfect cell at his first
form<00:00:24.390> now<00:00:24.900> this<00:00:25.859> would<00:00:26.099> be<00:00:26.250> very<00:00:26.460> interesting

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
form now this would be very interesting

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.609 
form now this would be very interesting
because<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.420> have<00:00:27.449> cell<00:00:27.900> right<00:00:28.140> here<00:00:28.410> and

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
because you have cell right here and

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.220 
because you have cell right here and
then<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.099> have<00:00:29.340> Frieza<00:00:29.939> right<00:00:30.179> over<00:00:30.449> here<00:00:30.750> now

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
then you have Frieza right over here now

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.930 
then you have Frieza right over here now
a<00:00:31.260> lot<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.619> people<00:00:31.859> would<00:00:32.009> say<00:00:32.219> cell<00:00:32.579> would<00:00:32.730> win

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
a lot of people would say cell would win

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.590 
a lot of people would say cell would win
this<00:00:33.120> one<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:34.340> honestly<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.370> can<00:00:36.090> really<00:00:36.300> see

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
this one and honestly I can really see

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.450 
this one and honestly I can really see
cell<00:00:36.960> winning<00:00:37.350> this<00:00:37.500> one<00:00:37.739> but<00:00:37.890> not<00:00:38.040> really<00:00:38.340> by

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
cell winning this one but not really by

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.229 
cell winning this one but not really by
much<00:00:38.760> I<00:00:39.120> mean<00:00:39.329> if<00:00:40.040> if<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.340> was<00:00:41.430> freezer<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:42.030> this

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
much I mean if if it was freezer in this

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.229 
much I mean if if it was freezer in this
form<00:00:42.629> yeah<00:00:43.500> he'd<00:00:43.800> give<00:00:44.010> cell<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.700> little<00:00:45.030> bit<00:00:45.149> of

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
form yeah he'd give cell a little bit of

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.690 
form yeah he'd give cell a little bit of
a<00:00:45.329> run<00:00:45.539> for<00:00:45.780> his<00:00:45.870> money<00:00:45.950> but<00:00:46.950> then<00:00:47.190> again<00:00:47.460> you

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
a run for his money but then again you

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.979 
a run for his money but then again you
know<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.850> have<00:00:48.120> cell<00:00:48.420> who<00:00:48.600> already<00:00:48.719> knows

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
know you have cell who already knows

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.690 
know you have cell who already knows
everybody's<00:00:49.440> power<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.039> he<00:00:50.100> knows<00:00:50.250> how<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.489> do

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
everybody's power and he knows how to do

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.310 
everybody's power and he knows how to do
things<00:00:50.910> very<00:00:51.059> well<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.570> plus<00:00:51.719> he<00:00:51.840> has<00:00:51.960> Frieza

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
things very well and plus he has Frieza

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.979 
things very well and plus he has Frieza
selling<00:00:52.860> him<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:53.670> would<00:00:54.239> say<00:00:54.449> cell<00:00:54.809> would

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
selling him so I would say cell would

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.600 
selling him so I would say cell would
win<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:55.320> not<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.680> much<00:00:55.920> because<00:00:56.100> what<00:00:56.520> if

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
win but not that much because what if

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.580 
win but not that much because what if
Frieza<00:00:56.910> transformed<00:00:57.629> into<00:00:57.780> his<00:00:57.930> third<00:00:58.230> form

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
Frieza transformed into his third form

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.790 
Frieza transformed into his third form
you<00:00:59.160> know<00:00:59.480> that<00:01:00.480> would<00:01:00.660> be<00:01:00.780> very<00:01:00.989> very<00:01:01.289> you

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
you know that would be very very you

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.860 
you know that would be very very you
know<00:01:01.829> hard<00:01:02.280> for<00:01:02.579> son<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.879> come<00:01:03.000> back<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.840> know

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
know hard for son to come back you know

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.289 
know hard for son to come back you know
because<00:01:04.290> he<00:01:05.040> can't<00:01:05.309> just<00:01:05.519> transform<00:01:06.090> like

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
because he can't just transform like

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.910 
because he can't just transform like
Frieza<00:01:06.570> can<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:06.990> know<00:01:07.080> he<00:01:07.200> has<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.350> absorb<00:01:07.830> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
Frieza can you know he has to absorb the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.440 
Frieza can you know he has to absorb the
androids<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.490> we're<00:01:08.580> talking<00:01:08.760> realistically

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
androids and we're talking realistically

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.880 
androids and we're talking realistically
here<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:10.110> know<00:01:10.200> if<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.439> was<00:01:10.560> just<00:01:10.590> regular

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
here you know if it was just regular

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.950 
here you know if it was just regular
freezing<00:01:11.460> versus<00:01:11.700> regular<00:01:11.880> cell<00:01:12.270> how<00:01:12.750> it's

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
freezing versus regular cell how it's

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.840 
freezing versus regular cell how it's
all<00:01:13.140> supposed<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.470> transform<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.549> know<00:01:14.640> if<00:01:14.760> he

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
all supposed to transform you know if he

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.950 
all supposed to transform you know if he
doesn't<00:01:15.090> have<00:01:15.180> any<00:01:15.330> androids

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
doesn't have any androids

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.749 
doesn't have any androids
you<00:01:16.320> know<00:01:16.409> if<00:01:16.530> Frieza<00:01:16.799> decided<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.280> transform

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
you know if Frieza decided to transform

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.420 
you know if Frieza decided to transform
it'll<00:01:18.000> be<00:01:18.060> game<00:01:18.390> over<00:01:18.420> for<00:01:18.720> cell<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:20.310> know

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
it'll be game over for cell so you know

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.890 
it'll be game over for cell so you know
let<00:01:21.030> me<00:01:21.090> know<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.270> comment<00:01:21.600> section<00:01:21.869> below

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
let me know in the comment section below

let me know in the comment section below
guys<00:01:22.259> on<00:01:22.530> V<00:01:22.680> guys<00:01:22.979> think<00:01:23.220> with<00:01:23.310> win<00:01:23.490> this<00:01:23.610> one

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
guys on V guys think with win this one

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.420 
guys on V guys think with win this one
and<00:01:24.000> why<00:01:24.150> don't<00:01:24.750> just<00:01:24.930> say<00:01:25.229> cell<00:01:25.920> or<00:01:26.189> freeze

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
and why don't just say cell or freeze

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.890 
and why don't just say cell or freeze
and<00:01:26.700> not<00:01:26.759> give<00:01:27.060> me<00:01:27.119> an<00:01:27.210> explanation<00:01:27.570> because

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
and not give me an explanation because

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.109 
and not give me an explanation because
you<00:01:28.650> know<00:01:28.770> by<00:01:28.979> people<00:01:29.280> explaining<00:01:29.790> things<00:01:29.909> it

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
you know by people explaining things it

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.030 
you know by people explaining things it
elaborates<00:01:30.360> your<00:01:30.810> opinion<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.259> lot<00:01:31.380> further<00:01:31.650> so

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
elaborates your opinion a lot further so

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.219 
elaborates your opinion a lot further so
it<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.700> very<00:01:32.909> interesting<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.420> hear<00:01:33.600> how<00:01:33.810> you

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
it is very interesting to hear how you

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.630 
it is very interesting to hear how you
know<00:01:34.350> everybody<00:01:34.829> feels<00:01:35.070> about<00:01:35.250> certain

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
know everybody feels about certain

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.480 
know everybody feels about certain
characters<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.270> but<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.259> me<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.470> think<00:01:37.680> cell<00:01:38.220> if

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
characters so but to me I think cell if

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.300 
characters so but to me I think cell if
they<00:01:39.060> were<00:01:39.119> both<00:01:39.570> at<00:01:39.900> their<00:01:40.110> perfect<00:01:40.920> forms

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
they were both at their perfect forms

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.160 
they were both at their perfect forms
full<00:01:41.520> power<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.909> think<00:01:42.060> obviously<00:01:42.630> cell<00:01:42.990> would

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
full power I think obviously cell would

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.649 
full power I think obviously cell would
wipe<00:01:43.560> out<00:01:43.740> Frieza<00:01:44.220> but<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:45.210> current

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
wipe out Frieza but in this current

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.569 
wipe out Frieza but in this current
stage<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.470> know<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.680> have<00:01:46.829> imperfect<00:01:47.220> cell

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
stage you know you have imperfect cell
