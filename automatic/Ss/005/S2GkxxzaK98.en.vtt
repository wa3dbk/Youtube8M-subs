because they have such an ability to
shoot<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.040> three<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.730> that's<00:00:39.510> not<00:00:39.660> all<00:00:39.780> they

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
shoot the three and that's not all they

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.780 
shoot the three and that's not all they
do<00:00:40.230> they<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.950> know<00:00:41.070> top<00:00:41.309> ten<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.700> nation

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
do they you know top ten in the nation

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.600 
do they you know top ten in the nation
and<00:00:42.210> steals<00:00:42.540> they<00:00:42.870> had<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.260> great<00:00:43.890> backcourt

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
and steals they had a great backcourt

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.209 
and steals they had a great backcourt
and<00:00:44.820> they<00:00:45.300> ended<00:00:45.510> up<00:00:45.629> scoring<00:00:45.989> but<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.620> thought

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
and they ended up scoring but I thought

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.040 
and they ended up scoring but I thought
from<00:00:47.430> our<00:00:47.610> perspective<00:00:47.940> our<00:00:48.360> players<00:00:48.719> really

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
from our perspective our players really

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.020 
from our perspective our players really
locked<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.620> on<00:00:49.800> what<00:00:50.039> we<00:00:50.160> were<00:00:50.309> trying<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.760> do

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
locked in on what we were trying to do

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.240 
locked in on what we were trying to do
play<00:00:51.570> great<00:00:51.899> defense<00:00:51.930> especially<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
play great defense especially in the

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.910 
play great defense especially in the
first<00:00:53.399> half<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.030> then<00:00:54.809> as<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.289> game<00:00:55.500> wore<00:00:55.739> on

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
first half and then as the game wore on

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.180 
first half and then as the game wore on
we<00:00:56.399> really<00:00:56.910> got<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.660> ball<00:00:57.899> inside<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.530> as<00:00:59.010> we

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
we really got the ball inside and as we

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.459 
we really got the ball inside and as we
got<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.520> ball<00:00:59.670> inside<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.390> lot<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.079> good<00:01:01.109> things

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
got the ball inside a lot of good things

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.009 
got the ball inside a lot of good things
followed<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.309> guess<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.180> stat<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.449> that's

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
followed I guess the stat that that's

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.929 
followed I guess the stat that that's
overwhelming<00:01:04.379> when<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.010> look<00:01:05.220> at<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.700> our

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
overwhelming when you look at it is our

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.109 
overwhelming when you look at it is our
rebounding<00:01:06.470> 44<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.619> 18<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.400> think<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.090> really

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
rebounding 44 to 18 I think that really

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.850 
rebounding 44 to 18 I think that really
shows<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.750> effort<00:01:10.049> level<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.439> we<00:01:10.590> played

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
shows the effort level that we played

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.190 
shows the effort level that we played
with<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.479> like<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.630> said<00:01:12.689> whether<00:01:12.990> it's

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
with and like I said whether it's

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.830 
with and like I said whether it's
defense<00:01:13.590> or<00:01:13.799> offensive<00:01:14.640> rebounding<00:01:15.119> taking

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
defense or offensive rebounding taking

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.050 
defense or offensive rebounding taking
advantage<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.470> our<00:01:16.650> strains<00:01:17.009> versus<00:01:17.610> Belmont
