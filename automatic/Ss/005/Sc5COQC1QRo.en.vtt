00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
place enough tension on the spring to

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.800 
place enough tension on the spring to
keep<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.220> pulled<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:23.640> if<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.479> hoist<00:01:24.689> rope

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
keep it pulled in if the hoist rope

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.020 
keep it pulled in if the hoist rope
snapped<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.560> tension<00:01:26.280> on<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.430> center<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.850> the

someone saying the buttons use heat you

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.670 
someone saying the buttons use heat you
can<00:07:06.669> correct<00:07:06.939> them<00:07:07.149> now<00:07:07.269> tell<00:07:08.169> them<00:07:08.439> where<00:07:08.589> you

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:08.680 
can correct them now tell them where you

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.209 
can correct them now tell them where you
learned<00:07:08.889> this<00:07:09.039> have<00:07:09.939> them<00:07:10.089> send<00:07:10.569> me<00:07:10.629> a<00:07:10.689> dollar

00:07:11.209 --> 00:07:11.219 
learned this have them send me a dollar
