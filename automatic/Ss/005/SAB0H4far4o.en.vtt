this guitar for many years now in
particular<00:00:28.439> what<00:00:28.800> I've<00:00:28.920> been<00:00:29.010> wanting<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.369> do

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
particular what I've been wanting to do

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.179 
particular what I've been wanting to do
is<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.000> exploit<00:00:30.929> this<00:00:31.260> tuning<00:00:31.679> system<00:00:32.009> that<00:00:32.160> I

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
is to exploit this tuning system that I

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.840 
is to exploit this tuning system that I
developed<00:00:32.360> for<00:00:33.360> our<00:00:33.390> violins<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.160> self

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
developed for our violins this is a self

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.540 
developed for our violins this is a self
clamping<00:00:36.510> tuning<00:00:36.870> system<00:00:37.260> that's<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:38.190> really

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
clamping tuning system that's a really

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.450 
clamping tuning system that's a really
unique<00:00:38.730> patented<00:00:39.739> way<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.980> dealing<00:00:41.340> with<00:00:41.370> a

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
unique patented way of dealing with a

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.760 
unique patented way of dealing with a
headless<00:00:41.879> instrument<00:00:42.390> so<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.170> can<00:00:43.440> demonstrate

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
headless instrument so I can demonstrate

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.110 
headless instrument so I can demonstrate
a<00:00:44.070> little<00:00:44.340> bit<00:00:44.460> how<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:44.730> tuner<00:00:45.690> works<00:00:45.899> by

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
a little bit how this tuner works by

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.479 
a little bit how this tuner works by
opening<00:00:48.120> up<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.440> string<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.469> removing<00:00:50.399> it

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
opening up this string and removing it

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.660 
opening up this string and removing it
we<00:00:51.180> this<00:00:52.170> instrument<00:00:52.710> does<00:00:52.739> not<00:00:53.039> use<00:00:53.250> double

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
we this instrument does not use double

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.660 
we this instrument does not use double
ball<00:00:53.820> strings<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.809> does<00:00:54.960> not<00:00:55.110> require<00:00:55.320> any

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
ball strings and it does not require any

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.900 
ball strings and it does not require any
allen<00:00:56.670> wrench<00:00:56.850> or<00:00:57.030> other<00:00:57.210> tool<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.719> order<00:00:57.960> to

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
allen wrench or other tool in order to

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.189 
allen wrench or other tool in order to
install<00:00:59.910> strings<00:01:00.420> now<00:01:00.629> with<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.870> we're

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
install strings now with you we're

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.450 
install strings now with you we're
starting<00:01:01.530> from<00:01:01.620> scratch<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.160> would<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.430> a

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
starting from scratch you would have a

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.640 
starting from scratch you would have a
full<00:01:03.300> length<00:01:03.480> string<00:01:03.899> which<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.110> no<00:01:04.439> problem

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
full length string which is no problem

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.060 
full length string which is no problem
you<00:01:05.070> just<00:01:05.100> put<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.290> ball<00:01:07.290> end<00:01:07.670> in<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.970> head

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
you just put the ball end in the head

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.440 
you just put the ball end in the head
there's<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.159> little<00:01:11.400> keyhole<00:01:11.640> arrangement

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
there's a little keyhole arrangement

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.420 
there's a little keyhole arrangement
here<00:01:12.659> as<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.900> can<00:01:12.930> see<00:01:13.110> just<00:01:13.650> slides<00:01:13.920> right<00:01:14.070> in

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
here as you can see just slides right in

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.289 
here as you can see just slides right in
and<00:01:16.130> if<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.340> had<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> longer<00:01:17.790> string<00:01:18.180> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
and if you had a longer string the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.450 
and if you had a longer string the
stream<00:01:18.540> would<00:01:18.689> actually<00:01:19.229> come<00:01:20.130> out<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
stream would actually come out the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.370 
stream would actually come out the
bottom<00:01:20.759> end<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.299> through<00:01:21.630> like<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.080> in

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
bottom end and and through like that in

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.350 
bottom end and and through like that in
this<00:01:22.530> case<00:01:22.740> we've<00:01:22.950> cut<00:01:23.189> them<00:01:23.340> off<00:01:23.580> already<00:01:24.000> and

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
this case we've cut them off already and

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.539 
this case we've cut them off already and
you<00:01:24.990> can<00:01:25.140> replace<00:01:25.439> these<00:01:25.710> strings<00:01:26.009> many<00:01:26.220> times

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
you can replace these strings many times

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.160 
you can replace these strings many times
I've<00:01:26.790> been<00:01:26.820> demonstrating<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:27.659> at<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.930> show

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
I've been demonstrating this at the show

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.499 
I've been demonstrating this at the show
and<00:01:28.200> we<00:01:29.070> must<00:01:29.280> have<00:01:29.430> changed<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.420> know

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
and we must have changed this you know

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.450 
and we must have changed this you know
taking<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:30.990> string<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.530> out<00:01:31.619> 50<00:01:32.430> times

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
taking this string in and out 50 times

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.200 
taking this string in and out 50 times
and<00:01:33.000> it's<00:01:33.630> working<00:01:34.200> just<00:01:34.460> as<00:01:35.460> good<00:01:35.790> as<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.060> did

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
and it's working just as good as it did

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.819 
and it's working just as good as it did
to<00:01:36.329> begin<00:01:36.450> with<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:37.170> know<00:01:37.259> if<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> string

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
to begin with you know if the string

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.649 
to begin with you know if the string
itself<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.340> in<00:01:38.460> as<00:01:38.579> good<00:01:38.729> shape<00:01:38.790> as<00:01:39.150> ever<00:01:39.390> so

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
itself is in as good shape as ever so

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.719 
itself is in as good shape as ever so
there's<00:01:39.869> no<00:01:39.990> damage<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:41.100> string<00:01:41.340> taking

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
there's no damage to the string taking

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.819 
there's no damage to the string taking
it<00:01:41.820> in<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.119> out<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.479> it's<00:01:43.320> not<00:01:43.500> easy<00:01:43.710> to

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
it in and out and it's not easy to

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.710 
it in and out and it's not easy to
change<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.430> string<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.299> course<00:01:45.479> this<00:01:45.570> is

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
change the string and of course this is

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.660 
change the string and of course this is
a<00:01:45.780> precision

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
a precision

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.050 
a precision
sooner<00:01:47.030> very<00:01:47.689> very<00:01:47.930> stable<00:01:48.490> and<00:01:49.490> that's<00:01:49.759> kind

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
sooner very very stable and that's kind

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.800 
sooner very very stable and that's kind
of<00:01:50.150> a

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.840 

in<00:01:53.170> a<00:01:53.260> lot<00:01:53.410> of<00:01:53.440> ways<00:01:53.680> though<00:01:53.980> raison<00:01:54.430> d'etre

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
in a lot of ways though raison d'etre

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.550 
in a lot of ways though raison d'etre
for<00:01:54.880> this<00:01:55.120> instrument<00:01:55.450> is<00:01:55.690> to<00:01:55.870> take<00:01:56.440> advantage

I don't know the strap on it but

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.540 
I don't know the strap on it but
especially<00:03:40.780> it<00:03:41.230> balances<00:03:41.710> perfectly<00:03:41.920> on<00:03:42.370> the

especially it balances perfectly on the

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.080 
especially it balances perfectly on the
strap<00:03:42.850> because<00:03:43.480> we<00:03:44.320> don't<00:03:44.500> have<00:03:44.650> all<00:03:44.830> that<00:03:45.090> all

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
end of the neck the neck itself is maple

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.490 
end of the neck the neck itself is maple
on<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.660> outside<00:03:53.080> but<00:03:54.010> it's<00:03:55.170> almost<00:03:56.170> all

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
on the outside but it's almost all

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.260 
on the outside but it's almost all
carbon<00:03:56.980> fiber<00:03:57.010> on<00:03:57.460> the<00:03:57.490> inside<00:03:57.940> so<00:03:58.150> it's

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
carbon fiber on the inside so it's

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.570 
carbon fiber on the inside so it's
essentially<00:03:58.600> a<00:03:58.750> carbon<00:03:59.020> fiber<00:03:59.410> neck<00:03:59.710> with<00:04:00.460> the

essentially a carbon fiber neck with the
feel<00:04:00.820> of<00:04:01.120> a<00:04:01.360> wood<00:04:01.570> neck<00:04:01.810> of<00:04:02.470> course<00:04:02.740> it<00:04:03.520> has

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
feel of a wood neck of course it has

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.830 
feel of a wood neck of course it has
this<00:04:04.320> volute<00:04:05.320> here<00:04:06.090> at<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.300> head<00:04:07.480> end<00:04:07.660> which

this volute here at the head end which

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.700 
this volute here at the head end which
is<00:04:07.990> similar<00:04:08.410> to<00:04:08.440> our<00:04:08.590> violin<00:04:09.190> really<00:04:09.490> the<00:04:10.710> this

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
is similar to our violin really the this

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.320 
is similar to our violin really the this
instrument<00:04:12.400> uses<00:04:12.730> a<00:04:12.760> lot<00:04:12.970> of<00:04:13.000> the<00:04:13.150> same

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
instrument uses a lot of the same

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.060 
instrument uses a lot of the same
technology<00:04:14.020> that<00:04:14.050> we<00:04:14.290> did<00:04:14.470> develop<00:04:14.860> for<00:04:15.040> the

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
technology that we did develop for the

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.220 
technology that we did develop for the
violin<00:04:15.610> and<00:04:16.739> I<00:04:18.630> think<00:04:19.630> those<00:04:19.780> are<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:19.959> salient

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 
violin and I think those are the salient

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:29.380 
violin and I think those are the salient
points

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.450
