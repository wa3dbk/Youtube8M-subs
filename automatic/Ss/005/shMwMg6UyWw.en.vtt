00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
that's the hair cell that I was that I

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.420

had<00:03:02.030> in<00:03:02.269> that<00:03:02.420> video<00:03:02.720> I've<00:03:03.560> had<00:03:03.829> something<00:03:04.340> a

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
had in that video I've had something a

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.569 
had in that video I've had something a
little<00:03:04.549> bit<00:03:04.700> more<00:03:04.849> poufy<00:03:05.859> you<00:03:06.859> just<00:03:07.220> keep

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
little bit more poufy you just keep

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.900 
little bit more poufy you just keep
doing<00:03:08.000> that<00:03:08.209> and<00:03:08.799> then<00:03:09.799> unfit<00:03:10.370> for<00:03:10.609> the<00:03:10.640> back

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
doing that and then unfit for the back

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.229 
doing that and then unfit for the back
so<00:03:11.269> that<00:03:11.299> it's<00:03:11.450> not<00:03:11.780> like<00:03:12.230> if<00:03:12.349> you<00:03:12.500> want<00:03:12.739> it<00:03:13.239> not

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
too flat obviously we don't want that as

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.430 
too flat obviously we don't want that as
