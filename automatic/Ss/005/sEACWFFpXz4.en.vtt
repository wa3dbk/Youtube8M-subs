00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.900 
but seriously it just there's not enough
software<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.560> support<00:02:18.709> it<00:02:19.100> unless<00:02:19.459> you're

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
software to support it unless you're

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.420

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
really really good but you know Kinect

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.830 
really really good but you know Kinect
Sports<00:02:25.670> is<00:02:26.060> okay<00:02:26.630> and<00:02:27.050> Kinect<00:02:27.709> Adventures<00:02:27.830> is

drive<00:02:41.450> I<00:02:41.780> would<00:02:41.900> say<00:02:42.260> that<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.590> first<00:02:42.800> bundle

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
drive I would say that the first bundle

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.509 
drive I would say that the first bundle
is<00:02:43.760> probably<00:02:44.269> the<00:02:44.420> best<00:02:44.690> one<00:02:45.220> because<00:02:46.220> it

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
is probably the best one because it

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.460 
is probably the best one because it
comes<00:02:46.730> with<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:47.330> two<00:02:47.630> games<00:02:47.930> they're<00:02:48.290> just
