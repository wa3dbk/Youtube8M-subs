shortener<00:00:18.600> or<00:00:19.080> i<00:00:19.140> guess<00:00:19.289> you<00:00:19.470> could<00:00:19.560> just<00:00:19.710> say

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
shortener or i guess you could just say

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.970 
shortener or i guess you could just say
shortener<00:00:20.340> as<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.730> icon<00:00:21.270> says<00:00:21.539> here<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.380> this

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
shortener as the icon says here and this

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.620 
shortener as the icon says here and this
is<00:00:23.160> essentially<00:00:23.550> exactly<00:00:24.060> what<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.300> think<00:00:24.330> it

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
is essentially exactly what you think it

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.570 
is essentially exactly what you think it
would<00:00:24.720> be<00:00:24.869> it's<00:00:25.230> an<00:00:25.470> app<00:00:25.740> that<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:26.070> shortened

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
would be it's an app that a shortened

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.089 
would be it's an app that a shortened
URL<00:00:27.029> links<00:00:27.359> in<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.960> style<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.320> tiny<00:00:28.590> URL<00:00:29.070> or

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
which is grand and then it just spits

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.820 
which is grand and then it just spits
out<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.090> URL<00:04:24.900> according<00:04:25.500> to<00:04:25.560> whichever
