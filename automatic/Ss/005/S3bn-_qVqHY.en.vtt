no idea what it's going to be it could
be<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.390> shotgun<00:02:06.960> I'm<00:02:07.140> kind<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.799> hoping<00:02:08.129> it's<00:02:08.429> a

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
be a shotgun I'm kind of hoping it's a

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.360 
be a shotgun I'm kind of hoping it's a
SMG<00:02:09.300> as<00:02:09.780> they've<00:02:10.470> only<00:02:10.649> done<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.039> assault

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
SMG as they've only done the assault

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.100 
SMG as they've only done the assault
rifles<00:02:11.819> and

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
rifles and

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.340 
rifles and
the<00:02:13.350> rippers<00:02:13.680> an<00:02:13.860> SMG<00:02:14.870> assault<00:02:15.870> rifle<00:02:16.170> hybrid

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
the rippers an SMG assault rifle hybrid

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.750 
the rippers an SMG assault rifle hybrid
and<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.970> maverick<00:02:18.390> was<00:02:18.540> an<00:02:18.630> assault<00:02:18.900> rifle<00:02:19.050> or

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
and the maverick was an assault rifle or

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.980 
and the maverick was an assault rifle or
you<00:02:20.760> could<00:02:20.940> use<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.120> as<00:02:21.270> a<00:02:21.330> sniper<00:02:21.630> so<00:02:21.930> they

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
you could use it as a sniper so they

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.440 
you could use it as a sniper so they
haven't<00:02:22.200> had<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.350> true<00:02:22.860> single<00:02:23.790> weapon<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:24.300> don't
