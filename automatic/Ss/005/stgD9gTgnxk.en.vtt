00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.500
 very good friends i am the one he started another 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:16.039
 time and time again and always because I'm eloy 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.529
 gómez and this is my ntv channel so 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:19.130
 do after introduction go back to 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.529
 start 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:26.039
 hello friends I am the gomez and we come to 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:30.449
 talk about this fantastic room 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.579
 what is the gamer google 4 based on stock 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.010
 in the last stock that is available 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.809
 for this terminal for the huawei 510 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.620
 I have to say that it is valid for him and 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.839
 300 and so let's see it is a rumba 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.280
 already as he has repeated based on stock 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:50.620
 in the 200 in a 411 and with the 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.250
 emotion interface 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.020
 for my taste a worse interface than 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.629
 There are in the market 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:02.199
 huawei the truth that here has not been 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:05.110
 lucido in price yes but in this I do not know 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:08.380
 nothing we are going to welcome us and 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.270
 all this roll as you see also a 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:15.470
 little with respect to the last rooms 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:20.630
 that I have climbed is a bit different everything 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:23.740
 is stoke 1 and hard or is authentic pure and 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.740
 hard stop 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.120
 so let's wait while we 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.980
 will give a little bit of length that is very 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.800
 lightened with respect to the original a 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:37.120
 original has been passing about 600 megabytes 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:39.070
 more or less and it 's regret 208 or something 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.610
 less 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.610
 the 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:49.329
 the built-in play store brings the sad 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:54.549
 the 3 that we have incorporated the memory 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:58.179
 ebay bigger integrated and then a lot 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:02.009
 a lot of improvements that we will now see 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:07.689
 how much ram do we get 3 implemented the 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:10.869
 stock kernel of jazztel and 062 no 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:14.940
 Now let's set up the account as 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.940
 you see the route is quite fluid 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.800
 so nothing as you see let's start 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.320
 from zero see the rom 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.600
 and they bring new series launcher but 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:31.380
 look at the fluency of the rom without 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:33.210
 have touched absolutely nothing 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.850
 so nothing to begin with let's see 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.120
 how much ram memory does this series bring 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.120
 mobile 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:47.350
 nothing else start nothing are called dark 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:50.650
 195 megas free or something incredible 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.120
 let's adjust it at least says that the 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.420
 application is installed we launch from 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.260
 someone 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:01.040
 as you can see is the interface of motion uy 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:05.900
 let's go here we go down we remove benefit 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:13.550
 fast near the phone and here excitement 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:17.330
 we 1.0 the tex tex kernel the kernel 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:22.170
 I've read it wrong in the thread of jose is the 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:26.380
 kernel text the game room v4 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:29.650
 and here everything goes more 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.659
 let's go back and let's see 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.959
 what brings us from memory is what we 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:39.780
 brings the serial one we start with the one of 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:44.099
 info we accept the ok of the zinc log 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.099
 here as you can see the cache 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:53.360
 and something very important brings swap is a 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.390
 room that brings its built-in app we're going to 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:00.580
 to update 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:02.650
 and 405 mb of ram with this kernel the ram 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.560
 I will not give an opinion on the 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.890
 regarding that branch 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.959
 but the branch is the same as with 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.660
 any other type of calf this is 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.810
 to apply 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.280
 modifications that is the sad the mod 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.799
 we give you super users permissions as 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.129
 you see well is routine of the room 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.289
 and nothing this is to configure the the cpu 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:27.810
 here you see the use of the cpu of a nucleus 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:30.510
 of the other 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.750
 and nothing like that is that this is going around 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:37.080
 with the room go seeing the tool 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:40.810
 as you can see that wifi can be 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.790
 activate a lot a lot of things 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.210
 fiddling as long as 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:49.470
 knowledge as you see you can upload the 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:53.990
 frequency has gone up 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:56.230
 you can block the frequencies for 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.920
 that do not move from there 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.920
 you can make him slow down 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.920
 very much 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.820
 the phone option has nothing to do 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:11.110
 with av shop is 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:15.280
 The phone option to play game well 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:18.830
 that if you want a room stop that 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:21.980
 work very well that works well 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:25.370
 but other than this stock swear 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:28.550
 This is a very good option since 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:31.660
 It is a room with everything standard with the 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.660
 serial bookstores 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.560
 but with the standard bookstores with the 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.800
 serial drivers with the serial camera 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:43.090
 all 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:46.419
 the camera application 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:51.190
 Focused perfectly and fast or not 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:53.190
 has nothing to do with the 442 climbs 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.130
 so far in the forum 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:06:01.980
 I do not want to use the sun 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:04.920
 I recommend gamer room game room v4 the 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:07.820
 based on the 200's our friend 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:10.650
 jacques go updating it because always 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:13.320
 there are some bug and some history there 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.600
 to update but they are books without 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.240
 importance if there are them right now as 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.129
 You see there is none, everything works 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.390
 energy saving 

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:27.050
 the file manager 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:29.390
 the recorder has radio fm notes 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.330
 messages brings built-in play store 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:36.200
 so that we will be our applications 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:38.690
 that is, everything is perfectly done 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.440
 the notifications work you can 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.440
 go here directly 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:48.370
 the developer father as you see 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:51.370
 comes all for one, that is, it is not 0 5 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:54.010
 how can you put it in another break 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.870
 for 1 and the fluency the truth that I 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:59.060
 love is what I like this room is 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:01.910
 the extreme fluidity that has 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:04.229
 yes yes you will say how I repeat a 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:06.729
 option of 

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:09.449
 speed 

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:13.800
 all 100% configured 

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:16.470
 and stoke this is your room 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.629
 If you have any questions I will leave below 

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:22.620
 down here down the link of the 

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:25.259
 description and take a look at the room 

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:27.650
 in the forum a greeting 

00:07:25.259 --> 00:07:27.650
