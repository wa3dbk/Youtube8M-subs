referred to as the trophy pose okay a
few<00:00:20.600> mistakes<00:00:21.020> I<00:00:21.200> see<00:00:21.230> around<00:00:21.740> the<00:00:21.890> club<00:00:22.130> level

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
few mistakes I see around the club level

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.109 
few mistakes I see around the club level
on<00:00:22.580> the<00:00:22.670> overhead<00:00:23.470> all<00:00:24.470> happen<00:00:25.070> in<00:00:25.160> setup<00:00:25.520> too

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 
on the overhead all happen in setup too

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.810 
on the overhead all happen in setup too
many<00:00:26.390> people<00:00:26.900> see<00:00:27.740> the<00:00:27.890> ball<00:00:28.070> come<00:00:28.400> up<00:00:28.580> in<00:00:28.700> the

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
many people see the ball come up in the

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.810 
many people see the ball come up in the
air<00:00:28.970> and<00:00:29.270> don't<00:00:30.110> turn<00:00:30.470> the<00:00:30.619> shoulders<00:00:31.130> to<00:00:31.580> set

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
air and don't turn the shoulders to set

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.330 
air and don't turn the shoulders to set
the<00:00:32.000> racket<00:00:32.419> so<00:00:33.020> the<00:00:33.170> arm<00:00:33.350> sets<00:00:33.770> more<00:00:34.100> to<00:00:34.220> the

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
the racket so the arm sets more to the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.150 
the racket so the arm sets more to the
side<00:00:34.610> of<00:00:34.790> the<00:00:34.880> body<00:00:35.110> and<00:00:36.110> without<00:00:36.440> a<00:00:36.650> shoulder

side of the body and without a shoulder

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.550 
side of the body and without a shoulder
turned<00:00:37.460> all<00:00:38.030> we're<00:00:38.480> producing<00:00:39.020> is<00:00:39.110> a<00:00:39.140> swing

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:39.560 
turned all we're producing is a swing

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.800 
turned all we're producing is a swing
that<00:00:39.860> that<00:00:40.160> we<00:00:40.310> call<00:00:40.520> arming<00:00:41.000> it<00:00:41.149> ok<00:00:41.660> and

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:41.810 
that that we call arming it ok and

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.180 
that that we call arming it ok and
you're<00:00:41.899> not<00:00:42.020> going<00:00:42.140> to<00:00:42.200> be<00:00:42.350> as<00:00:42.500> accurate<00:00:42.710> and

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
you're not going to be as accurate and

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.740 
you're not going to be as accurate and
you're<00:00:43.370> not<00:00:43.520> going<00:00:43.670> to<00:00:43.730> hit<00:00:43.880> as<00:00:44.030> powerful<00:00:44.660> of

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
you're not going to hit as powerful of

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.139 
you're not going to hit as powerful of
an<00:00:44.870> overhead<00:00:45.260> okay<00:00:45.950> so<00:00:46.190> what<00:00:46.550> we<00:00:46.700> like<00:00:46.910> in

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
an overhead okay so what we like in

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.080 
an overhead okay so what we like in
tennis<00:00:47.510> is<00:00:47.660> the<00:00:48.440> trophy<00:00:48.860> pose<00:00:49.070> where<00:00:49.850> if<00:00:49.940> any

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
tennis is the trophy pose where if any

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.180 
tennis is the trophy pose where if any
of<00:00:50.239> you<00:00:50.390> have<00:00:50.570> ever<00:00:50.720> actually<00:00:51.020> seen<00:00:51.620> the<00:00:51.890> top

of<00:00:52.399> a<00:00:52.460> tennis<00:00:52.820> trophy<00:00:53.270> you<00:00:53.930> see<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.440> position

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
of a tennis trophy you see the position

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
of the little guy on the top of the

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.709 
of the little guy on the top of the
trophy<00:00:57.950> with<00:00:58.129> that<00:00:58.309> left<00:00:58.670> arm<00:00:58.969> nice<00:00:59.239> and<00:00:59.540> high

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
trophy with that left arm nice and high

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.130 
trophy with that left arm nice and high
and<00:01:00.110> that<00:01:00.739> racket<00:01:01.340> head<00:01:01.520> sitting<00:01:02.480> right<00:01:02.840> up

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
and that racket head sitting right up

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.580 
and that racket head sitting right up
behind<00:01:04.039> the<00:01:04.249> players<00:01:04.549> head<00:01:04.939> okay<00:01:05.810> and<00:01:06.049> that

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
behind the players head okay and that

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.219 
behind the players head okay and that
really<00:01:06.920> should<00:01:07.069> be<00:01:07.249> the<00:01:07.520> setup<00:01:08.049> for<00:01:09.049> the

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
really should be the setup for the

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.469 
really should be the setup for the
overhead<00:01:09.560> everytime<00:01:10.490> you<00:01:10.729> see<00:01:10.939> the<00:01:11.090> ball<00:01:11.270> go

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
overhead everytime you see the ball go

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:12.190 
overhead everytime you see the ball go
up<00:01:11.630> in<00:01:11.780> the<00:01:11.869> air

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
up in the air

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.469 
up in the air
okay<00:01:12.799> so<00:01:12.859> a<00:01:13.009> little<00:01:13.219> analogy<00:01:13.789> I<00:01:13.909> want<00:01:14.179> to<00:01:14.270> make

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
okay so a little analogy I want to make

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.449 
okay so a little analogy I want to make
when<00:01:15.229> you<00:01:15.319> guys<00:01:15.469> are<00:01:15.740> setting<00:01:16.009> that<00:01:16.219> is

00:01:16.449 --> 00:01:16.459 
when you guys are setting that is

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:19.690 
when you guys are setting that is
similar<00:01:17.329> to<00:01:17.359> a<00:01:17.630> quarterback<00:01:18.380> in<00:01:18.679> football<00:01:19.459> if

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
similar to a quarterback in football if

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.459 
similar to a quarterback in football if
you<00:01:20.149> guys<00:01:20.299> have<00:01:20.509> ever<00:01:20.630> watched<00:01:21.049> a

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469 
you guys have ever watched a

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:24.399 
you guys have ever watched a
quarterbacks<00:01:22.130> take<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:22.729> snap<00:01:23.319> from<00:01:24.319> the

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
quarterbacks take the snap from the

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.639 
quarterbacks take the snap from the
center<00:01:24.529> they<00:01:25.399> grab<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:25.969> ball<00:01:26.209> and

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
center they grab the ball and

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.789 
center they grab the ball and
immediately<00:01:27.729> they're<00:01:28.729> into<00:01:29.299> a<00:01:29.329> turn<00:01:29.770> okay

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
immediately they're into a turn okay

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.919 
immediately they're into a turn okay
quarterbacks<00:01:31.490> don't<00:01:31.849> take<00:01:32.119> the<00:01:32.299> ball<00:01:32.509> and

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:32.929 
quarterbacks don't take the ball and

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:37.870 
quarterbacks don't take the ball and
stand<00:01:33.880> square<00:01:35.709> downfield<00:01:36.709> they're<00:01:37.490> turning

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
stand square downfield they're turning

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.859 
stand square downfield they're turning
the<00:01:38.179> upper<00:01:38.479> body<00:01:38.689> and<00:01:39.139> both<00:01:39.859> hands<00:01:40.340> are<00:01:40.789> up<00:01:41.630> at

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
the upper body and both hands are up at

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.269 
the upper body and both hands are up at
shoulder<00:01:42.289> height<00:01:42.319> okay<00:01:43.249> so<00:01:44.679> with<00:01:45.679> my<00:01:45.859> set<00:01:46.130> up

00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:46.279 
shoulder height okay so with my set up

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:47.649 
shoulder height okay so with my set up
on<00:01:46.399> the<00:01:46.520> overhead<00:01:46.639> I<00:01:46.999> want<00:01:47.270> to<00:01:47.359> make<00:01:47.479> it

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
on the overhead I want to make it

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.980 
on the overhead I want to make it
similar<00:01:48.139> to<00:01:48.169> that<00:01:48.439> when<00:01:48.829> I'm<00:01:48.950> here<00:01:49.689> my<00:01:50.689> left

similar to that when I'm here my left

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.839 
similar to that when I'm here my left
hand<00:01:51.439> is<00:01:51.649> actually<00:01:51.829> going<00:01:52.219> to<00:01:52.310> stay<00:01:52.549> on<00:01:52.579> the

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.830 
into this nice turn okay and once I feel
that<00:02:06.169> then<00:02:07.159> I'll<00:02:07.369> let<00:02:07.549> the<00:02:07.729> left<00:02:07.939> hand<00:02:08.300> go<00:02:08.509> and

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
that then I'll let the left hand go and

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.260 
that then I'll let the left hand go and
get<00:02:09.590> into<00:02:09.890> that<00:02:10.009> traditional<00:02:10.640> trophy<00:02:11.090> pose

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.349 
and this will produce a swing
that<00:02:14.150> requires<00:02:15.129> all<00:02:16.129> sorts<00:02:16.489> of<00:02:16.730> torque<00:02:17.060> and
