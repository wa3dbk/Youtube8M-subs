00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.440
 well found this new video 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.560
 today we are with the best applications 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.920
 for android it is with an application yes 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.990
 he calls aida64 what allows us to do 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.420
 this program allows us to 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.680
 know everything we want on 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.329
 our smartphone for example gpu 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:36.520
 we click tell us it's a tech media 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:38.200
 with cortex 71.3 giger and so on 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.560
 how much was actually used in 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:45.090
 this minute unique system bloom like 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:49.090
 see 1 gb of total memory ram 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.640
 reactivated you have that expandable via 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.109
 saying 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.370
 battery information for example 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:01:00.809
 like you, it is 76 percent for now 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.780
 good and in this case even if it says 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.990
 sorry wake up we come back a moment 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.130
 juicy battery where he said it is the 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.670
 1000 mile battery capacity 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.860
 ampere 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.390
 it is not true this is a small example 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.950
 this one is a small thing that he then has 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.530
 but almost everything is wrong 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.540
 this will be practically the same 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.909
 simply to see all the various 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.689
 things about your smartphone or maybe you 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.369
 interested in knowing the things of the device for 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:31.090
 example move as a reduction of 5 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:35.560
 megapixel 2.1 the front will tell you 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:39.810
 as much as 1.9 solution with various videos like 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.490
 see, however, there is everything 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.619
 a series of information inside 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.140
 which surely can be useful to 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.960
 many second application of the day 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.840
 that androidify as you see here a lot 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.259
 cute this startling den plague 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.259
 application 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:00.570
 ok drag down the whole series of 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.250
 applications of this application I have it 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.009
 already seen a long time ago because it is not 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.789
 certainly new we can go to 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.890
 choose the color as of the 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:15.090
 skin 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.550
 and we can go to decide on this 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.260
 in case we might leave it green on 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.170
 crÃ©a noemi and android and the accounts there 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.680
 turns ok we leave it green for 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:29.250
 example which to show as it should be yes 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.880
 must move very nice as a movement 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.880
 this was 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.900
 but we can even share it with 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.580
 in the various social networks, however, we cannot 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.260
 do it in our image and likeness 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.130
 we can enlarge it and tighten it too 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.840
 even the head lengthening it had saying 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.569
 even the feet rather than the arms 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.930
 like you we can go to enlarge 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:58.330
 very nice with me as an application 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.930
 surely you can personalize it 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.599
 I see for example the accessories and shoes 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.860
 then let's go back we put the 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.590
 trousers let's go back there again 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.450
 let 's put on the shirts anyway you can 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.989
 customize it how you want to do it to 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.310
 your image and likeness gsg sun 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.569
 bacteria monitor 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.640
 this is the third application of the 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:22.750
 day as you see vicky from between serving 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.530
 to manage your battery 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.329
 device 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.790
 in this case we see how many calls 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:30.010
 you have made 0 what has been 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.500
 used a screen this 67 for 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.849
 one hundred seventy percent of 3 percent is fine from 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.190
 when you are activated anyway 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.319
 this application the use of the app 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.170
 bluetooth and so on 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:45.720
 there are so many settings then here 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:49.959
 we can go and see various types of 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:52.170
 graphs we can go and see who 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.859
 to the application is consuming more 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.950
 beat right now is a 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:58.480
 paradoxically, to the application itself 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.549
 however there are various types of hips of 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.590
 preferences according to update a 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.180
 see other settings for sure 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.090
 however a very useful application for 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.700
 managing the battery is how long you are 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.920
 wish 16 kg of batteries saying 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.720
 then last application of the day in 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.060
 shape shop 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:21.080
 then it is practically an application 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:23.420
 which allows you to go and do 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:27.710
 for example look here 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:29.360
 zaia soloist g ok and here lets you 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.280
 go and change the photos unfortunately 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.569
 which allows him to edit later 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:38.830
 having taken them then not 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:42.219
 first the various things then taking then 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:47.439
 in this case I took a photo 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:48.759
 any as you see from some thing 

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:51.759
 very pretty and to go to 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:53.619
 customize your photos as 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:56.050
 you have various shapes various various objects 

00:04:53.619 --> 00:04:58.419
 various lines an application surely 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.839
 very pretty to be able to use us for 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:04.089
 example here and I pay water 

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:06.490
 onwards as you see while these here 

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:08.080
 in fact, set up should work 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.119
 turandot mais we can go 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.369
 even to change the color nothing 

00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:14.080
