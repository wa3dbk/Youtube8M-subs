00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
you can launch a turret to spawn in the

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.199 
you can launch a turret to spawn in the
air<00:02:26.599> so<00:02:27.560> you<00:02:27.650> can<00:02:27.799> use<00:02:27.889> it<00:02:27.920> to<00:02:28.219> find<00:02:28.430> any<00:02:28.790> of<00:02:29.030> you

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
deploy it and actually see it through

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.589 
deploy it and actually see it through
walls<00:02:35.870> so<00:02:36.530> one<00:02:36.680> of<00:02:36.709> the<00:02:36.920> old<00:02:37.519> me2<00:02:38.030> powers<00:02:38.419> that

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:48.189 
flying through the air with high force

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:50.259 
flying through the air with high force
so<00:03:49.189> the<00:03:49.340> engineers<00:03:49.669> have<00:03:49.909> email<00:03:50.120> is

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
so the engineers have email is

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:51.610 
so the engineers have email is
completely<00:03:50.689> different<00:03:51.019> it's<00:03:51.139> high<00:03:51.349> damage

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
completely different it's high damage

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.860 
completely different it's high damage
very<00:03:52.250> little<00:03:52.400> force<00:03:52.790> and<00:03:53.120> it's<00:03:53.419> all<00:03:53.569> fire

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
very little force and it's all fire

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.140 
very little force and it's all fire
based<00:03:54.169> so<00:03:55.159> this<00:03:55.310> is<00:03:55.459> going<00:03:55.579> to<00:03:55.639> help<00:03:55.969> the

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
based so this is going to help the

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.790 
based so this is going to help the
engineer<00:03:56.569> take<00:03:56.810> out<00:03:57.019> heavily

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
engineer take out heavily

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.720 
engineer take out heavily
opponents<00:03:59.440> we've<00:04:00.440> revamped<00:04:00.890> the<00:04:01.130> enemy<00:04:01.580> AI

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
opponents we've revamped the enemy AI

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.170 
opponents we've revamped the enemy AI
and<00:04:02.120> mass<00:04:02.300> effect<00:04:02.330> 3<00:04:03.020> so<00:04:03.500> here<00:04:04.010> Erickson<00:04:04.760> adept

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
and mass effect 3 so here Erickson adept

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.060 
and mass effect 3 so here Erickson adept
and<00:04:05.420> as<00:04:05.570> you<00:04:05.660> can<00:04:05.840> see<00:04:05.870> shooting<00:04:06.500> The<00:04:06.740> Guardian

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
and as you can see shooting The Guardian

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.920 
and as you can see shooting The Guardian
head-on<00:04:07.490> is<00:04:07.730> probably<00:04:08.120> not<00:04:08.300> the<00:04:08.480> best<00:04:08.510> way<00:04:08.900> of

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
head-on is probably not the best way of

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.440 
head-on is probably not the best way of
going<00:04:09.200> about<00:04:09.380> it<00:04:09.650> but<00:04:10.250> the<00:04:10.460> adapt<00:04:10.820> has<00:04:11.060> a<00:04:11.090> trick

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
going about it but the adapt has a trick

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.690 
going about it but the adapt has a trick
up<00:04:11.600> his<00:04:11.750> sleeve<00:04:11.810> you<00:04:12.650> can<00:04:12.800> pull<00:04:13.160> the<00:04:13.370> shield

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
up his sleeve you can pull the shield

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.580 
up his sleeve you can pull the shield
right<00:04:14.000> out<00:04:14.210> of<00:04:14.240> the<00:04:14.360> Guardians<00:04:14.810> hand<00:04:15.200> and

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
right out of the Guardians hand and

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.500 
right out of the Guardians hand and
other<00:04:16.040> classes<00:04:16.670> may<00:04:16.880> have<00:04:17.090> different

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
other classes may have different

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.449 
other classes may have different
strengths<00:04:18.019> or<00:04:18.230> weaknesses<00:04:18.260> against<00:04:19.190> certain

strengths or weaknesses against certain

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.820 
strengths or weaknesses against certain
enemies<00:04:19.730> so<00:04:20.390> for<00:04:20.630> example<00:04:20.690> the<00:04:21.350> Cerberus

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
enemies so for example the Cerberus

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.190 
enemies so for example the Cerberus
engineer<00:04:22.340> can<00:04:22.640> deploy<00:04:22.970> a<00:04:23.000> little<00:04:23.510> turret<00:04:23.990> in

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
engineer can deploy a little turret in

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.380 
engineer can deploy a little turret in
the<00:04:24.320> world<00:04:24.590> which<00:04:25.340> is<00:04:25.490> pretty<00:04:25.700> hard<00:04:26.000> to<00:04:26.150> deal

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
the world which is pretty hard to deal

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.390 
the world which is pretty hard to deal
with<00:04:26.420> but<00:04:26.870> if<00:04:27.260> you're<00:04:27.470> the<00:04:27.590> engineer<00:04:27.770> player

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
with but if you're the engineer player

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.150 
with but if you're the engineer player
class<00:04:28.760> you<00:04:29.390> can<00:04:29.570> hack<00:04:29.930> that<00:04:30.320> turret<00:04:30.740> and<00:04:30.860> turn

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
class you can hack that turret and turn

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.210
