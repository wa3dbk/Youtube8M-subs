 lee 

00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:11.499
 a 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.980
 One of the greatest secrets of landscape photography is the use of 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.230
 many press 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.810
 I have a beautiful landscape beautiful blue skies white clouds 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:45.609
 later on 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:47.800
 after a much too late that perfect for a sisser 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.740
 polarization filter 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.150
 and that that is actually not possible, it seems to me a colorful year later 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.310
 brighter 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.900
 And it makes the sky a lot of contrasts when knowledge gets much more exciting 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.050
 air 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.350
 what bored there is for you to do is remove reflections in the water 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.900
 So this is really one of the most used filters through 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.900
 landscape photography 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.340
 watson polarizing filter actually does is actually 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.130
 then all the light rays come from my bottom and the camera but they have 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.350
 all one way 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.650
 and what to do as a lot is that later certain rays let it through 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.820
 and other rays houthi against so I actually only part of the 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.920
 light rays arrive in the room 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.360
 well do to turn the silence I can determine myself 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.570
 let this make a large and matty pass that you don't see changing 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.080
 I see you in the air 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.460
 you become a lot dull 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.800
 the struggle for a little by thousands of children who are spectacular 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.770
 cloudy skies 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.850
 and that the blue sky becomes much darker 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.550
 she got a lot of nice contrast 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.550
 the super much more dramatic effect 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.110
 well you have to 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.110
 each run it a lot until you like it 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.350
 and then take the recordings 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.350
 who can see perfectly what's happening here 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.709
 after that moment that you like 

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:36.479
 and on the other much required in advance 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:38.909
 price trend filter with a basement 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.469
 which actually has an expired transparency 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:43.919
 slowly to a little grayer 

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:46.229
 and what that much to do 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:49.229
 I am at a location I have deep dark red in the foreground 

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:52.459
 and there I also have some light air 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.830
 well that contrast is too big my eyes can easily bridge it 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.249
 the room that sometimes with difficulty 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:01.560
 and then I am going to write that much traffic is slowly writing into the picture 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.249
 so that the sky becomes darker 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:06.409
 this also makes it more threatening 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:09.409
 and so i get create i have much nicer image 

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:14.789
 and because filter what 

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:18.519
 up or down 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:19.819
 that becomes the a50 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.819
 the strong poor and rich strong 

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:28.489
 and I'll show you much better 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.629
 then you see what happens 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.629
 watch I write slowly in the picture 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.669
 she came clear judgment small progress in the picture 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.429
 the white parts there turned out to be more to the doctor at kelme 

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:49.429
 then actually get it 

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:53.759
 that is the gray of a lot of time and now we have to drive 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:08.169
 yes but a lot of time 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:28.869
 my pastor landscape tip for the project use filters 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.199
 you know even less attractive for problems 

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.399
 the
