and<00:02:34.840> for<00:02:35.710> my<00:02:35.800> point<00:02:36.040> of<00:02:36.100> view<00:02:36.160> it<00:02:36.370> looks<00:02:36.430> like<00:02:36.670> a

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
and for my point of view it looks like a

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.030 
and for my point of view it looks like a
mix<00:02:37.030> from<00:02:37.390> Assassin's<00:02:37.960> Creed<00:02:38.290> and<00:02:38.320> Bioshock

put together which would equal

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.360 
put together which would equal
awesomeness<00:02:41.320> but<00:02:41.500> it's<00:02:42.040> coming<00:02:42.280> from
