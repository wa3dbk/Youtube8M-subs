00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.940
On a fine summer day,

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.120
there lived a happy grasshopper on the field.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.980
The grasshopper loved to

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.780
play, sing and dance all the  day.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.220
What a lovely day ?

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.840
La la la la la la la

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.500
I feel like singing a song now.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.760
La la la la la la la.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.380
As she was singing,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.640
an ant passed by.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.240
Don't you

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.040
ever get tired of

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.800
playing like this ?

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.240
Who ? Me?  No. Of course not.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.680
Oh. Don't you ever work at all?

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.020
Who ? Me ?  Of course not.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.640
Do you want to come and play with me now?

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.640
hmm, no no no

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.640
I have work to do.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.740
Come on, let's sing together.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.160
No no no

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.860
I am very busy.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.480
Right now, I have lot of work.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.220
Work, work, work

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.480
that's all you think of doing

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.300
You don't have time to

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.880
play, sing and move around with people ?

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.220
and enjoy yourself?

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.820
No  ah  I don't.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.360
Why are you in such a hurry?

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.020
I have to take home

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.160
this kernel of corn.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.440
For what now ?

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.540
I have to store food for the winter.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.680
How can you think of winter

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.520
on such a fine day ?

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.900
We're enjoying ourselves.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.680
Because the winter will be here soon

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:59.840
and food will be too hard to find

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.700
and you should do the same.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.620
Mmm, soon you will not have

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.720
enough food to eat.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.880
I don't want to be

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.900
worrying about winter now.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.740
You just go and do your work.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.220
Work, work, work

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.320
And I will just go and play, sing and dance.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.080
Please listen to me.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.420
Then you will not have anything to eat.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.120
I have plenty of food right now

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.000
And what will you do tomorrow  food for eat ?

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.620
I don't worry about tomorrow at all.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.920
But I will do

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.960
Good bye .

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.600
And the ant went on its way.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.660
La la la la la la la

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.880
La la la la la la

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.360
Continuing its work

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.180
Soon the weather turned cold.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.360
All the food lying in the field

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.100
were covered with

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.400
a thick blanket of snow.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.160
I should have listened to the ant

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.160
when he told me

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.700
It's so cold, I can't even play

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.880
I can't sing anything else also

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.620
I don't have any food to eat also

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.900
that ant will definitely help me

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.780
the grasshopper went o the ant's place.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.800
Please give me something to eat

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:44.380
Hmmm

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.640
It's very cold

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.860
I'm feeling very hungry

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.500
Why should I help you ?

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.060
What did you do in all these summer days ?

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.240
I'd been very playful

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.320
playing, singing and enjoying myself

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.180
All summer long

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.080
I worked hard.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.500
Why,  you made fun of me.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.640
And you sang, played and danced.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.280
You should

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.180
have thought of winter then.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.380
Find some where else to sing, hm.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.220
There is no warmth or food for you here.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.920
Listen here, I can't do anything for you.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.480
Goodbye .

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.000
The ant shut the door, in front of  the grasshopper's face.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.120
So my dear kids,

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.180
Here is the moral of the story.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.340
That that work to be done at that time
