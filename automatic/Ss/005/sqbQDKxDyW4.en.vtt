enough<00:00:39.960> most<00:00:40.620> important<00:00:41.040> thing<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.460> test

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
enough most important thing is to test

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.340 
enough most important thing is to test
the<00:00:41.879> heat<00:00:42.149> first<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:42.750> we<00:00:42.870> take<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> drop<00:00:43.320> of

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
the heat first so we take a drop of

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.760 
the heat first so we take a drop of
water<00:00:44.270> sounds<00:00:45.270> like<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.719> alright

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
water sounds like it alright

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.920 
water sounds like it alright
so<00:00:46.890> even<00:00:47.219> though<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.340> have<00:00:47.610> all<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:48.059> MRAP<00:00:48.539> here

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
so even though I have all this MRAP here

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.869 
so even though I have all this MRAP here
in<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.170> cup<00:00:49.379> I'm<00:00:49.860> actually<00:00:50.070> only<00:00:50.399> going<00:00:50.700> to

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
one of the best things about amaranth is

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.010 
one of the best things about amaranth is
besides<00:01:48.789> the<00:01:48.909> fact<00:01:49.090> that<00:01:49.179> it's<00:01:49.390> incredibly

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
besides the fact that it's incredibly

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.990 
besides the fact that it's incredibly
entertaining<00:01:50.289> at<00:01:50.679> the<00:01:50.710> moment<00:01:51.070> is<00:01:51.759> that<00:01:51.820> it's

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
entertaining at the moment is that it's

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.539 
entertaining at the moment is that it's
really<00:01:52.479> high<00:01:52.659> in<00:01:52.689> protein<00:01:53.259> and<00:01:53.500> this<00:01:54.189> makes<00:01:54.429> it

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
really high in protein and this makes it

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.730 
really high in protein and this makes it
especially<00:01:54.729> good<00:01:55.359> for<00:01:55.420> folks<00:01:55.990> who<00:01:56.140> are<00:01:56.259> on<00:01:56.439> a

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
especially good for folks who are on a

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.010 
especially good for folks who are on a
gluten-free<00:01:57.100> diet<00:01:57.340> and<00:01:57.939> I'm<00:01:58.509> mentioning<00:01:58.899> that

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
gluten-free diet and I'm mentioning that

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.440 
gluten-free diet and I'm mentioning that
specifically<00:01:59.799> because<00:01:59.950> may<00:02:00.399> is<00:02:00.670> celiac
