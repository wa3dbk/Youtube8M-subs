way<00:02:09.209> over<00:02:10.099> so<00:02:11.099> for<00:02:11.310> example<00:02:11.790> if<00:02:12.000> i<00:02:12.209> zoom<00:02:12.239> in

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
way over so for example if i zoom in

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.560 
way over so for example if i zoom in
I'll<00:02:14.130> have<00:02:14.430> this<00:02:14.610> be<00:02:14.850> my<00:02:15.000> first<00:02:15.240> picture<00:02:17.570> once

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
I'll have this be my first picture once

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.570 
I'll have this be my first picture once
the<00:02:18.720> picture<00:02:19.020> is<00:02:19.050> captured<00:02:19.680> it'll<00:02:20.160> put<00:02:20.340> half

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
the picture is captured it'll put half

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.730 
the picture is captured it'll put half
of<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:20.880> over<00:02:21.030> on<00:02:21.270> this<00:02:21.420> side<00:02:21.480> which<00:02:22.230> allows<00:02:22.530> you

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
of it over on this side which allows you

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.850 
of it over on this side which allows you
to<00:02:22.980> align<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.460> images<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:25.410> vertical

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
to align the images the vertical

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.220 
to align the images the vertical
alignment<00:02:25.980> needs<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.120> be<00:02:27.270> pretty<00:02:27.540> careful

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
alignment needs to be pretty careful

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.990 
alignment needs to be pretty careful
but<00:02:28.710> don't<00:02:28.890> worry<00:02:29.070> so<00:02:29.400> much<00:02:29.430> about<00:02:29.640> the

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
but don't worry so much about the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.360 
but don't worry so much about the
horizontal<00:02:30.570> alignment<00:02:30.980> meaning<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.100> doesn't

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
horizontal alignment meaning it doesn't

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.460 
horizontal alignment meaning it doesn't
have<00:02:32.460> to<00:02:32.580> be<00:02:32.700> completely<00:02:33.210> overlapping<00:02:33.780> the

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
have to be completely overlapping the

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.370 
have to be completely overlapping the
way<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.740> suggests<00:02:35.370> in<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:35.880> camera<00:02:36.300> you<00:02:37.200> can

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
way it suggests in the camera you can

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.550 
way it suggests in the camera you can
leave<00:02:37.560> it<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:37.740> little<00:02:37.980> bit<00:02:38.100> less<00:02:38.340> than<00:02:38.520> that

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
leave it a little bit less than that

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.360 
leave it a little bit less than that
take<00:02:40.560> another<00:02:40.860> picture<00:02:41.330> and<00:02:43.160> then<00:02:44.160> this

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
take another picture and then this

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.270 
take another picture and then this
picture<00:02:44.820> is<00:02:45.000> placed<00:02:45.600> over<00:02:45.810> here<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.350> I<00:02:47.130> can

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
picture is placed over here and I can

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.300 
picture is placed over here and I can
keep<00:02:47.460> going<00:02:47.520> in<00:02:47.910> that<00:02:47.940> way<00:02:48.590> down<00:02:49.590> here<00:02:50.070> you'll

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
keep going in that way down here you'll

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.950 
keep going in that way down here you'll
notice<00:02:50.520> I<00:02:50.730> have<00:02:50.880> this<00:02:51.030> little<00:02:51.210> arrow<00:02:51.480> icon

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
notice I have this little arrow icon

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.010 
notice I have this little arrow icon
what<00:02:52.620> that<00:02:52.800> means<00:02:53.070> is<00:02:53.430> that<00:02:53.760> I<00:02:54.000> can<00:02:54.180> move<00:02:54.510> back

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
what that means is that I can move back

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.710 
what that means is that I can move back

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
lock the white balance and I would also

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.280 
lock the white balance and I would also
