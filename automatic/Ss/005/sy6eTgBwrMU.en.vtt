00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:03.569
 i 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:15.289
 hi how about alex here in version 1.4 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.860
 points 7 with a new rebellion of a 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:20.230
 mod called underground scripts 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:23.689
 this mode what it does is add 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.480
 many new types of rock with what 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:30.050
 which will find good configurations 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.890
 like these what will give us biomes between 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:37.340
 rocky quotes these biomes look 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.940
 better in caves now we will enter a 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.310
 thing to see and depending on the type of rock 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.840
 that we collect we are going to have covers 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:50.239
 stones or we will be able to click if 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.470
 let's go for a walk around here and you'll see 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.190
 what I mean with the curves 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.960
 It really is very interesting because 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.899
 minecraft something bad that it has is that 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.200
 all things are equal, truth 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:06.909
 And look around here and we can go and 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:10.450
 We are seeing several types of rock 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.110
 and here and here really great is a 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.810
 past this 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.350
 In addition, the mod changes the configuration of 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:25.140
 the poor makes them appear in veins 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:27.870
 bigger or relocated there you have it 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.890
 great truth is a very very simple 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:35.790
 truth is they add that rock and 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.250
 the configuration of smells 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.480
 so if it's very simple but I 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.350
 It has seemed very interesting especially 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.390
 for the fact that I always minecraft 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.810
 it has some equal caves and they are made 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.400
 boring at the end but yet all 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.100
 these rocks different then you can 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:57.270
 find enough decorations 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.580
 and interesting things to see besides 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.060
 is the brics to the team days 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:07.119
 do it with four of the rock and the 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.100
 tom covers that depending on which rock 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.040
 you find then pick up is the collision 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:15.280
 directly or will not have coulston and 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.030
 pick up 'aces' the rock itself you'll see 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.120
 as for example this one 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:25.830
 this one has with the stone and this one seems to me 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.720
 that is not there you have seen it great and 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.350
 then with the goebbels tone 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:35.310
 We can do any object that 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.260
 we could do with covers ton 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.390
 it's a past truth is very good 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.970
 integrated the mod 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.210
 Well, I 've seen this, it only fits me 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:50.150
 watch 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:51.320
 a little thing is the limit is not here the 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.890
 art 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.960
 I dedicate myself to the blog this block is worth 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.070
 can find in less quite 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:06.280
 great and if it bites it jce paisa in 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:06.280
 contrary to find this here 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.560
 and I would not see this 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.940
 Maybe it 's that he releases it in a 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.510
 small 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:23.330
 percentage in any case this walk 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.370
 and from ccoo to the blog can be captured with 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.720
 four coal and it's very interesting 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.070
 because with him 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:34.940
 you can burn up to 37 objects if I do not 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:38.950
 I'm wrong I'll tell you in a moment 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:42.459
 32 thirty-two objects 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:46.390
 the truth is great but this way of 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:49.630
 here the limit only burns an object like that 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:52.510
 that if you meet this 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.670
 it's not worth much in any case 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.870
 It's a very entertaining way that you 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:01.660
 I advise because only to decorate is 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.970
 very well I said this we are going to leave 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.410
 here I hope you liked the video 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.560

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.460
