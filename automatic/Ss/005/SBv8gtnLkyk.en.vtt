00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:06.160
 but 3 new sweepers able to remove 20 quintals a day between 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.300
 foliage leaves from the most peripheral plants in the city have been 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.320
 in the last few weeks made available to active pescara spa 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.590
 presented this morning by mayor mascia 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.789
 response not even so bald 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.519
 to the controversies of the opposition on the next budget that does not provide for new ones 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.899
 appropriations for the company that deals with urban hygiene 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:29.639
 I dream of coming to terms with the course 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:35.380
 resources that are not extraordinary on the other hand the administration of 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:37.269
 center-right made a choice 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:38.600
 the in particular well 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.890
 in precise 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.770
 which is that of not increasing the tarsu, whatever the pd may say, whatever it may say 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.830
 the opposition that instead had reported for 6 years 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.650
 for having paid citizens of Pescara with continuous increases in taxes and 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.110
 therefore also of tarsu 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.780
 our administration for a year and a half and also for next year has 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:56.740
 considered 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.770
 to manage with the available resources in the best way of gene speed 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.829
 and color 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.070
 important investment that brings these three great sweepers that are able 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.080
 elmi a 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.799
 to collect about 2 quintals per day of paper access 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.560
 generally waste 20 tons per day of waste 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.700
 and therefore in a year calculate how many tons these vehicles succeed 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.770
 intercept 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.680
 the collaboration of the citizens is always asked because an administration 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.510
 can do so much but can do so if the citizens are educated they are civil 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.710
 also use baskets use 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.460
 the normal containers 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.650
 because this becomes fundamental 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.470
 occasion mayor reported from Rome to the separate waste collection of 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.910
 urban solid waste of all citizens can still be located 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.210
 using the bins 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.310
 now reached with the door to door 50% of families and at the end of 2010 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.800
 I kept the door of 27 5% 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.360
 catch a virtuous city that is set for the collection percentage 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.160
 differentiated levels 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.470
 the municipalities of central and northern Italy make us proud, however 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.100
 it also gives us the incentive to do better and to be able to identify together with the 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.300
 region a suitable system so that it is this sacrifice that it makes 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.460
 the administration that citizens do with a great collaborative spirit either 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.350
 finalized also is a better use of resources therefore to a killing 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.240
 of our coasts of our expenses
