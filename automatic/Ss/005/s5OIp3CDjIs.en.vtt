00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
foundations for the future at the same

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.609 
foundations for the future at the same
time<00:01:12.560> so<00:01:13.549> my<00:01:13.700> goal<00:01:13.940> here

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
time so my goal here

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.410 
time so my goal here
yes<00:01:15.619> I'm<00:01:15.799> physically<00:01:16.520> karate-chopping<00:01:17.150> him

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
yes I'm physically karate-chopping him

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.960 
yes I'm physically karate-chopping him
while<00:01:17.630> we're<00:01:17.840> coaching<00:01:18.080> here<00:01:18.909> there's<00:01:19.909> a

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
while we're coaching here there's a

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.289 
while we're coaching here there's a
reason<00:01:20.270> for<00:01:20.299> that<00:01:20.770> but<00:01:21.770> my<00:01:21.830> goal<00:01:22.310> was<00:01:22.670> to<00:01:23.180> be

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
reason for that but my goal was to be

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:24.880 
reason for that but my goal was to be
able<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:23.510> control<00:01:23.869> his<00:01:24.080> knee<00:01:24.229> positions<00:01:24.740> so

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
able to control his knee positions so

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.460 
able to control his knee positions so
that<00:01:24.920> we<00:01:25.070> can<00:01:25.220> get<00:01:25.430> him<00:01:25.670> to<00:01:25.880> where<00:01:26.390> he<00:01:26.450> can<00:01:26.659> hit

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
that we can get him to where he can hit

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.130 
that we can get him to where he can hit
depth<00:01:27.740> and<00:01:28.299> apply<00:01:29.299> at<00:01:29.479> to<00:01:29.689> the<00:01:29.750> bar

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
depth and apply at to the bar

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.590 
depth and apply at to the bar
we<00:01:30.290> started<00:01:30.680> with<00:01:30.830> stabilizing<00:01:31.549> his<00:01:31.670> core<00:01:32.060> so

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
we started with stabilizing his core so

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.929 
we started with stabilizing his core so
he's<00:01:32.810> gonna<00:01:32.930> definitely<00:01:33.320> gonna<00:01:33.409> need<00:01:33.619> that

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
he's gonna definitely gonna need that

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.230

perspective<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:16.530> may<00:02:16.680> see<00:02:16.739> with<00:02:17.459> some

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
perspective that you may see with some

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.949 
perspective that you may see with some
of<00:02:17.640> my<00:02:17.730> videos<00:02:18.230> with<00:02:19.230> band<00:02:19.470> aren<00:02:19.769> t<00:02:19.950> squats<00:02:20.959> the

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
of my videos with band aren t squats the

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.580 
of my videos with band aren t squats the
whole<00:02:22.280> activation<00:02:23.280> sequence<00:02:24.290> so<00:02:25.290> we<00:02:25.379> walk

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
whole activation sequence so we walk

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.800 
whole activation sequence so we walk
through<00:02:25.860> all<00:02:26.010> these<00:02:26.220> things<00:02:26.519> as<00:02:26.760> well<00:02:27.000> if

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
through all these things as well if

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.420 
through all these things as well if
you've<00:02:28.019> watched<00:02:28.260> any<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.620> them<00:02:28.950> eats<00:02:29.129> prior

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
you've watched any of them eats prior

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.220 
you've watched any of them eats prior
squat<00:02:29.849> videos<00:02:30.209> you<00:02:30.450> would<00:02:30.569> notice<00:02:30.780> that<00:02:31.019> this

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
squat videos you would notice that this

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.220 
squat videos you would notice that this
is<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.440> very<00:02:32.129> dramatic<00:02:32.370> change<00:02:32.940> in<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.569> pretty

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
is a very dramatic change in a pretty

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.089 
is a very dramatic change in a pretty
short<00:02:34.410> period<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:34.830> time<00:02:34.890> on<00:02:35.370> what<00:02:36.209> he's<00:02:36.299> doing

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
short period of time on what he's doing

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.100 
short period of time on what he's doing
day<00:02:38.099> three<00:02:38.489> we<00:02:39.330> decide<00:02:39.629> we're<00:02:39.750> gonna<00:02:39.840> hit<00:02:40.049> some

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
day three we decide we're gonna hit some

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.630 
day three we decide we're gonna hit some
weights<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.650> see<00:02:40.860> where<00:02:41.099> we're<00:02:41.250> at<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:44.310> cues

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
weights and see where we're at the cues

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.089 
weights and see where we're at the cues
you<00:02:44.849> hear<00:02:45.090> me<00:02:45.450> giving<00:02:45.840> are<00:02:46.019> not<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.890> be-all

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
you hear me giving are not the be-all

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:49.670 
you hear me giving are not the be-all
and<00:02:47.640> end-all<00:02:47.910> of<00:02:48.180> everything<00:02:48.810> these<00:02:49.319> are<00:02:49.530> one

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
and end-all of everything these are one

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.370 
and end-all of everything these are one
specific<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.610> what<00:02:50.790> I<00:02:51.150> have<00:02:51.540> seen<00:02:51.840> going<00:02:52.230> on

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
specific to what I have seen going on

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.199 
specific to what I have seen going on
with<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.650> meat<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.069> they're<00:02:53.280> gonna<00:02:53.430> have<00:02:53.880> an

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
with the meat and they're gonna have an

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.870 
with the meat and they're gonna have an
immediate<00:02:54.959> impact<00:02:55.290> on<00:02:55.730> accomplishing<00:02:56.730> what

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
immediate impact on accomplishing what

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.100 
immediate impact on accomplishing what
we're<00:02:57.000> trying<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.299> accomplish<00:02:57.660> here

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
we're trying to accomplish here

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.539 
we're trying to accomplish here
so<00:02:58.709> that's<00:02:59.340> variable<00:02:59.940> by<00:03:00.329> athlete<00:03:00.810> by<00:03:01.079> goals

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
so that's variable by athlete by goals

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.770 
so that's variable by athlete by goals
but<00:03:02.549> there's<00:03:02.790> some<00:03:02.940> pretty<00:03:03.120> common<00:03:03.420> themes

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
but there's some pretty common themes

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.979 
but there's some pretty common themes
though<00:03:04.019> with<00:03:04.879> with<00:03:05.879> my<00:03:06.060> approach<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.720> you've

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
though with with my approach and you've

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.539 
though with with my approach and you've
probably<00:03:07.110> seen<00:03:07.290> that<00:03:07.620> in<00:03:07.799> a<00:03:07.890> lot<00:03:08.010> of<00:03:08.129> my

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
probably seen that in a lot of my

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.259 
probably seen that in a lot of my
instructional<00:03:09.120> videos<00:03:10.099> so<00:03:11.099> the<00:03:11.310> current

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
instructional videos so the current

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.740 
instructional videos so the current
all-time<00:03:13.140> record<00:03:13.650> with<00:03:14.160> no<00:03:14.730> knee<00:03:14.940> wraps<00:03:15.150> and

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
all-time record with no knee wraps and

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.199 
all-time record with no knee wraps and
the<00:03:15.810> 198<00:03:16.319> class<00:03:16.560> that<00:03:16.829> meets<00:03:17.190> going<00:03:17.549> for<00:03:17.760> the

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
the 198 class that meets going for the

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.000 
the 198 class that meets going for the
keys<00:03:18.359> weighing<00:03:18.600> 205<00:03:18.930> in<00:03:19.290> this<00:03:19.410> video<00:03:19.680> here

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
keys weighing 205 in this video here

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.930 
keys weighing 205 in this video here
that's<00:03:20.670> what<00:03:20.790> he<00:03:20.880> told<00:03:21.030> me<00:03:21.209> is<00:03:21.859> 705<00:03:22.859> pounds<00:03:23.430> so

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
that's what he told me is 705 pounds so

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.400 
that's what he told me is 705 pounds so
we<00:03:24.420> decided<00:03:24.750> to<00:03:24.840> work<00:03:24.959> up<00:03:25.170> to<00:03:25.200> that<00:03:27.109> the<00:03:28.109> number

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
we decided to work up to that the number

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.140 
we decided to work up to that the number
of<00:03:28.500> these<00:03:28.590> videos<00:03:29.220> you<00:03:29.400> can<00:03:29.519> see<00:03:29.639> us<00:03:29.760> changing

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
of these videos you can see us changing

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.990 
of these videos you can see us changing
outside<00:03:30.510> judges<00:03:30.930> on<00:03:31.049> some<00:03:31.230> of<00:03:31.319> this<00:03:31.410> stuff

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
outside judges on some of this stuff

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
size of that quad sweep it's really

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.539 
size of that quad sweep it's really
tough<00:03:40.170> to<00:03:40.200> tell<00:03:40.530> unless<00:03:41.250> you're<00:03:41.400> actually

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
tough to tell unless you're actually
