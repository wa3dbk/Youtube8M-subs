00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
great features as well we start by

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.150 
great features as well we start by
talking<00:00:24.180> about<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.689> fabric<00:00:25.050> first<00:00:25.320> this<00:00:25.950> is<00:00:26.130> a

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
talking about the fabric first this is a

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.729 
talking about the fabric first this is a
gore-tex<00:00:26.790> Pro<00:00:27.090> shell<00:00:27.540> fabric<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.590> it's

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:28.739 
gore-tex Pro shell fabric so it's

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:30.859 
gore-tex Pro shell fabric so it's
unbelievably<00:00:29.369> waterproof<00:00:29.970> exceptionally

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
unbelievably waterproof exceptionally

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.240 
unbelievably waterproof exceptionally
breathable<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.770> very<00:00:32.009> lightweight<00:00:32.309> as<00:00:32.759> well

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
breathable and very lightweight as well

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.920 
breathable and very lightweight as well
so<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.340> benefit<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:35.880> obviously<00:00:36.690> being

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
so the benefit of this obviously being

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.030 
so the benefit of this obviously being
very<00:00:37.410> breathable

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
very breathable

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.640 
very breathable
this<00:00:38.970> wicks<00:00:39.270> any<00:00:39.630> moisture<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.200> might<00:00:40.350> build

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:40.650 
this wicks any moisture that might build

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.740 
this wicks any moisture that might build
up<00:00:40.860> inside<00:00:41.400> the<00:00:41.700> pan<00:00:42.030> obviously<00:00:42.420> if<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.570> get

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
up inside the pan obviously if you get

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.110 
up inside the pan obviously if you get
too<00:00:42.960> warm<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:44.040> dissipates<00:00:44.520> through<00:00:45.030> the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
too warm so it dissipates through the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.000 
too warm so it dissipates through the
material<00:00:45.540> itself<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.200> then<00:00:46.290> evaporates<00:00:46.800> into

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
material itself and then evaporates into

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.440 
material itself and then evaporates into
the<00:00:47.160> air<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.730> makes<00:00:47.880> it<00:00:47.940> exceptionally

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
the air so it makes it exceptionally

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.030 
the air so it makes it exceptionally
comfortable<00:00:48.660> inside<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.620> obviously<00:00:49.860> keeps
