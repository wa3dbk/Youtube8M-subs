 Turn 8 This is it 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:22.800
 Hebiramu echoing rumble of Bromwich 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:24.460
 It is a thing called full support good pru support, but it is quite a cat 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.609
 It is Rette exogenous 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.609
 The soldier of the previous child 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.970
 Or say Grant 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:40.890
 A large shower in the box compared to this person 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:46.800

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.970
 Oh 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.270
 It's like this when you take it out of the box 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.570
 It is now 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:04.680

 I think I'm slow feet Gachotto's room without so that you are Gachi' 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:12.120
 It is quite long to put 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:18.120
 In Kedomo this is I'm Well a little while ago of 1/12 of the grant

 Those who like the West porch 4 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:42.070
 I do this is with is not in that hook it here with 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.700
 On the hook 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.700
 Catch this 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.540
 That 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.540
 It Hikkakan well 1 here the two-plant 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.870
 Was deep 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.200
 I 'm hooked like this 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.200
 4th 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.490
 Yes I did 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.490
 It's nice to stick with you 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.470
 It is like this 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:27.910
 Oh, that's up and running in such a system 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:35.550
 Feeling success or not 10 schools 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:35.550
 Moving the motion will base of the foot Monet hip joint because there is a great well until finger joint 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.940
 Hey do you say 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:44.450
 Another unique feature of this figure is the dirty paint 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:49.250
 It's Well is this is do amazing I did you and say, weather Ringu' 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:52.370
 In that because I've crowded paint that joint portion Toka another all 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:56.910
 Hereabouts Hen Toka also because you no matter Neo 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:02.670
 Part with or even considered it anything other any rubbing 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:05.160
 Come come off while you are moving after all because I feel that they painted all without 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.610
 This year also has 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:12.010
 I have also painted the ball joints of the shoulders , but I still shoot motion 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:15.170
 It feels like you're falling down 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:19.720
 In this joint paint is that 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:23.920
 Certainly the atmosphere is good, but there are other negative effects 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:28.180
 It is said that the joints are fused 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:33.040
 I'm going to stick in this part of the painting, so I 'm fine now 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:39.740
 When the terrible I'd say if done is by minute in this much I'd feel I Chikachikachi 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:45.130
 It seems that there is a guy who doesn't really move, so far I've been there 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:49.030
 There is no such thing, but there are times, for example, when you want to go crazy 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:54.430
 It might be so After a moment I collar this is Hey if However 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:57.010
 I think I did not move to strike while ago I'd had it around likely daddy once again premonition 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.410
 It was nice to move Jean 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.610
 You can feel a lot like it 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.850
 Good 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.950
 Please let me feel a sense of java 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.860
 Let's get serious mode 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.610
 Is better this Truly record is good to see the super Tsuka 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:16.250
 Good 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:20.090
 Try side by side and try this way because you are taller than you 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:26.210
 The height of two people is about 2 people 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:27.320
 I'm holding this cat There 's a picture here, but it's open here, but come back 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.480
 Maybe go 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:34.170
 I'd think what a place to be in and out Rene fire in the count 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:39.510
 It looks like it's moving and it doesn't seem to move 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:41.400
 If you look at it in various nets, people who break down here looks like great grandmothers, so here a little 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.120
 It looks like attention 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.490
 I also will do amazing 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.689
 Hey I say 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:54.180
 I was able to put out an Aim 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:56.720
 Moving force 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.280
 Very big 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:03.090
 Already a little more 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:06.750
 What a 1/12 Nei soldier 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:09.330
 I wonder if this is something I do not understand 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:15.840
 Let's bring Figuarts 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:19.260
 Yes, if you line it up with Samurai , it looks like this, and if you go to the place of this mother's cat 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:25.170
 Aim about 1.5 times the size 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:26.730
 It looks like this when I line it up with glad Even if you look at this, Grant itself is better than the arts 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:33.450
 I 'm passing a little day 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:39.249
 Or something say amazing formula dragon of this what Te say kana Japanese style Naa feeling anymore of Yoroibu 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:40.910
 It is by I still image great as the Warring States period and feel different era fighting 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:44.660
 It is- 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:49.000
 Takeshi Yamazaki, let's go down this much 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:51.670
 For the time being, Grant and Ne Square had been side by side . 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.569
 Is it head? 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:55.060
 Then yes 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:58.720
 It's cool 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:05.889
 And this is probably a stage called a blog post 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:12.130
 Pink color I'm this person worse is there are ne its series of Maybe red robot Nde color 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:14.090
 I Toka troops organized in feeling like a align such a softening this color it a little Nde supposed 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.940
 If you can make it 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:20.430
 It looks interesting 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.430
 Little it was somehow ride to the form 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.169
 ni 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:35.960
 Since I do not know hey it I well I'd like a there is a setting in a variety Somehow 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:36.800
 It's simply as if I 'm just like this I like to think about it myself 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.210
 I will 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:45.480
 I would like to buy it if there is another chance for the 3 sound figure, so if you are interested 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:48.140
