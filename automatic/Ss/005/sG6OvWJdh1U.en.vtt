hey<00:00:00.750> what's<00:00:00.930> up<00:00:01.050> guys<00:00:01.560> um<00:00:01.620> in<00:00:02.100> this<00:00:02.220> lesson<00:00:02.490> I'm

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
hey what's up guys um in this lesson I'm

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.160 
hey what's up guys um in this lesson I'm
just<00:00:02.820> gonna<00:00:02.939> show<00:00:03.210> you<00:00:03.270> how<00:00:03.480> you<00:00:03.540> can<00:00:03.810> model

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
just gonna show you how you can model

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.829 
just gonna show you how you can model
the<00:00:04.259> human<00:00:04.529> brain<00:00:05.270> basically<00:00:06.270> just<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.540> rough

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
the human brain basically just a rough

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.480 
the human brain basically just a rough
model<00:00:07.230> of<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.589> human<00:00:07.830> brain<00:00:07.950> I<00:00:08.220> wouldn't

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
model of the human brain I wouldn't

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.330 
model of the human brain I wouldn't
recommend<00:00:08.970> using<00:00:09.269> this<00:00:09.480> for<00:00:10.130> medical<00:00:11.130> use

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
recommend using this for medical use

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.140 
recommend using this for medical use
trying<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.059> be<00:00:12.120> accurate<00:00:12.269> or<00:00:12.570> not<00:00:13.070> but<00:00:14.070> um<00:00:14.219> so

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
trying to be accurate or not but um so

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.080 
trying to be accurate or not but um so
anyway<00:00:15.690> my<00:00:16.379> scene<00:00:16.619> here<00:00:16.650> I<00:00:17.039> just<00:00:17.730> have<00:00:17.970> a

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
anyway my scene here I just have a

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.359 
anyway my scene here I just have a
reference<00:00:18.750> image<00:00:19.050> I'll<00:00:19.619> be<00:00:19.830> human<00:00:20.070> braiding

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
reference image I'll be human braiding

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.320 
reference image I'll be human braiding
the<00:00:20.460> side<00:00:20.750> the<00:00:21.750> tops<00:00:22.020> pretty<00:00:22.380> basic<00:00:22.910> you<00:00:23.910> can

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
the side the tops pretty basic you can

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.210 
the side the tops pretty basic you can
see<00:00:24.570> here<00:00:24.920> so<00:00:27.260> anyway<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.320> start<00:00:28.650> off<00:00:28.800> I'm<00:00:29.010> just

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
see here so anyway to start off I'm just

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.000 
see here so anyway to start off I'm just
gonna<00:00:29.420> drop<00:00:30.420> in<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:31.940> polygon<00:00:32.940> sphere<00:00:33.739> if<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.860> can

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
gonna drop in a polygon sphere if I can

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.310 
gonna drop in a polygon sphere if I can
find<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:36.140> there<00:00:37.140> we<00:00:37.320> go<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:39.079> I'm<00:00:40.079> just<00:00:40.140> gonna

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
find it there we go and I'm just gonna

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.639 
find it there we go and I'm just gonna
drop<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.710> lattice<00:00:41.160> around<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.550> sphere<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.809> try

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
drop a lattice around the sphere and try

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.100 
drop a lattice around the sphere and try
and<00:00:43.800> shape<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.280> into<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:45.420> shape<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.899> brain

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
and shape it into the shape of the brain

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.610 
and shape it into the shape of the brain
I<00:00:46.410> can<00:00:47.340> never<00:00:47.430> find<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.289> lattice<00:00:49.289> let's<00:00:49.500> go

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
I can never find this a lattice let's go

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.369 
I can never find this a lattice let's go
into<00:00:49.800> my<00:00:49.920> settings<00:00:50.190> here<00:00:51.079> alright<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.140> we<00:00:52.320> have

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
into my settings here alright so we have

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.869 
into my settings here alright so we have
4<00:00:52.710> 4<00:00:52.980> 4<00:00:53.280> pretty<00:00:53.670> basic<00:00:54.289> should<00:00:55.289> work<00:00:55.879> create

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
4 4 4 pretty basic should work create

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.869 
4 4 4 pretty basic should work create
that<00:00:57.090> lattice<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:58.460> select<00:00:59.460> my<00:00:59.579> lattice

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
that lattice and select my lattice

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.420 
that lattice and select my lattice
points<00:01:02.449> let's<00:01:03.449> see<00:01:03.690> here<00:01:03.960> I'm<00:01:04.619> gonna<00:01:04.739> go<00:01:05.159> into

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
points let's see here I'm gonna go into

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.070 
points let's see here I'm gonna go into
my<00:01:06.200> side<00:01:07.200> view<00:01:07.229> here<00:01:08.030> start<00:01:09.030> shaping<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.659> up

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.480 

I'm<00:01:13.080> not<00:01:13.229> gonna<00:01:13.380> worry<00:01:13.530> about<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:14.010> medulla

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
I'm not gonna worry about the medulla

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.140 
I'm not gonna worry about the medulla
wherever<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.240> hell<00:01:15.360> that's<00:01:15.450> called<00:01:15.780> for<00:01:16.500> now

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
wherever the hell that's called for now

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.710 
wherever the hell that's called for now
but<00:01:18.150> um<00:01:19.490> yeah<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.549> know<00:01:20.759> how<00:01:20.850> drag<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.210> these

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
but um yeah you know how drag this these

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.249 
but um yeah you know how drag this these
points<00:01:22.140> around<00:01:22.759> get<00:01:23.759> them<00:01:23.850> into<00:01:24.090> place<00:01:24.259> ever

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
points around get them into place ever

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.740 
points around get them into place ever
you<00:01:25.439> want<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:26.009> need<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.909> few<00:01:27.180> more<00:01:27.390> points

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
you want I need a few more points

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:35.289 
you want I need a few more points
actually<00:01:29.299> underestimated<00:01:30.299> but<00:01:31.259> um<00:01:33.110> I'm<00:01:34.110> just

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
actually underestimated but um I'm just

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:46.480 
actually underestimated but um I'm just
basically<00:01:36.299> forming<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.049> brain<00:01:39.500> let's<00:01:40.500> see

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.359 

x-ray<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.700> way<00:01:47.970> we<00:01:48.119> can<00:01:48.270> see<00:01:48.540> how<00:01:49.009> the<00:01:50.009> brain

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
x-ray this way we can see how the brain

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.490 
x-ray this way we can see how the brain
looks<00:01:50.640> behind<00:01:50.850> it

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.120 

all<00:01:57.500> right<00:01:57.680> I<00:01:58.719> mean<00:01:59.719> this<00:02:00.200> isn't<00:02:00.469> exact<00:02:00.890> I

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
all right I mean this isn't exact I

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.370 
all right I mean this isn't exact I
suggest<00:02:01.549> you<00:02:01.640> add<00:02:01.759> more<00:02:02.049> divisions<00:02:03.049> to<00:02:03.259> your

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
suggest you add more divisions to your

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.740 
suggest you add more divisions to your
lattice<00:02:03.740> points<00:02:04.159> but<00:02:04.430> you're<00:02:05.360> trying<00:02:05.570> to<00:02:05.630> give

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
lattice points but you're trying to give

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.619 
lattice points but you're trying to give
you<00:02:05.840> some<00:02:06.020> basic<00:02:06.259> tips<00:02:06.740> here<00:02:07.070> um<00:02:10.120> keep<00:02:11.120> shaping

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 
you some basic tips here um keep shaping

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:22.089 
you some basic tips here um keep shaping
this<00:02:11.750> up<00:02:11.989> here<00:02:14.920> worry<00:02:15.920> about<00:02:16.190> that<00:02:16.430> after<00:02:21.099> all

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
this up here worry about that after all

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.009 
this up here worry about that after all
right<00:02:22.280> you<00:02:22.400> can<00:02:22.580> have<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.330> indent<00:02:23.720> if<00:02:23.900> you

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
right you can have the indent if you

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.449 
right you can have the indent if you
want<00:02:24.230> I'm<00:02:24.349> not<00:02:24.410> going<00:02:24.500> to<00:02:24.680> do<00:02:24.830> that<00:02:24.980> for<00:02:25.190> now

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.259 

basically<00:02:28.459> this<00:02:28.670> should<00:02:28.880> be<00:02:29.000> flat<00:02:29.330> so<00:02:29.360> you<00:02:29.810> can

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
basically this should be flat so you can

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.990 
basically this should be flat so you can
match<00:02:32.269> it<00:02:32.299> up<00:02:32.599> with<00:02:32.660> the<00:02:32.810> other<00:02:33.019> guy<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.970> other

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
match it up with the other guy the other

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:44.080 
match it up with the other guy the other
half<00:02:35.360> of<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.569> brain<00:02:41.620> all<00:02:42.620> right<00:02:42.849> that's<00:02:43.849> fine

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
half of the brain all right that's fine

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.370 
half of the brain all right that's fine
for<00:02:44.329> now<00:02:45.160> just<00:02:46.160> select<00:02:46.489> your<00:02:46.549> object<00:02:47.230> get<00:02:48.230> this

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
for now just select your object get this

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.009 
for now just select your object get this
lattice<00:02:48.769> off<00:02:48.950> of<00:02:49.160> it<00:02:49.310> just<00:02:49.880> go<00:02:50.450> up<00:02:50.510> to<00:02:50.690> file

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
lattice off of it just go up to file

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:51.759 
lattice off of it just go up to file
well

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
well

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.479 
well
edit<00:02:52.400> delete<00:02:52.610> by<00:02:52.760> type<00:02:52.910> history<00:02:53.950> and<00:02:54.950> your

edit delete by type history and your

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:56.830 
edit delete by type history and your
life<00:02:55.640> is<00:02:55.910> gone<00:02:56.060> you<00:02:56.390> don't<00:02:56.510> have<00:02:56.599> to<00:02:56.690> worry

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
life is gone you don't have to worry

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.979 
life is gone you don't have to worry
about<00:02:56.900> that<00:02:57.230> so<00:02:58.010> we<00:02:58.459> have<00:02:58.579> the<00:02:58.670> basic<00:02:58.849> shape<00:02:59.690> of

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
about that so we have the basic shape of

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.009 
about that so we have the basic shape of
one<00:03:00.290> half<00:03:00.500> of<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.709> brain<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.660> now<00:03:02.660> in<00:03:02.900> order

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
one half of the brain and now in order

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.569 
one half of the brain and now in order
to<00:03:03.170> get<00:03:03.350> all<00:03:03.500> these<00:03:03.650> little<00:03:03.859> tubes<00:03:04.190> and<00:03:04.459> stuff

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
to get all these little tubes and stuff

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.520 
to get all these little tubes and stuff
um<00:03:06.250> this<00:03:07.250> is<00:03:07.400> just<00:03:07.639> a<00:03:07.959> kind<00:03:08.959> of<00:03:09.109> shortcut

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
um this is just a kind of shortcut

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.160 
um this is just a kind of shortcut
method<00:03:09.920> and<00:03:10.400> use<00:03:10.549> it<00:03:10.670> if<00:03:10.760> you<00:03:10.880> want<00:03:10.989> just<00:03:11.989> go<00:03:12.109> to

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
method and use it if you want just go to

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.550 
method and use it if you want just go to
your<00:03:12.319> rendering<00:03:13.780> paint<00:03:14.780> effects<00:03:15.139> and<00:03:15.410> make

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
your rendering paint effects and make

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.740 
your rendering paint effects and make
this<00:03:15.680> object<00:03:15.920> paintable<00:03:16.430> I'm<00:03:17.329> just<00:03:17.480> gonna<00:03:17.569> go

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
this object paintable I'm just gonna go

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.250 
this object paintable I'm just gonna go
get<00:03:18.049> brush<00:03:18.380> and<00:03:19.569> I'm<00:03:20.569> gonna<00:03:20.720> use<00:03:20.900> one<00:03:21.079> of<00:03:21.109> the

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
get brush and I'm gonna use one of the

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.220 
get brush and I'm gonna use one of the
flesh<00:03:21.590> brushes<00:03:22.450> most<00:03:23.450> of<00:03:23.600> these<00:03:23.660> work<00:03:23.930> just

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
flesh brushes most of these work just

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.610 
flesh brushes most of these work just
selects<00:03:26.109> yes<00:03:27.109> smooth<00:03:27.440> skin<00:03:27.680> and<00:03:29.620> basically

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
selects yes smooth skin and basically

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:41.250 
selects yes smooth skin and basically
I'm<00:03:31.370> just<00:03:31.459> gonna<00:03:31.700> start<00:03:34.450> painting<00:03:38.200> however<00:03:39.200> so

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
I'm just gonna start painting however so

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:48.069 
I'm just gonna start painting however so
all<00:03:42.260> the<00:03:42.530> tubes<00:03:42.769> on<00:03:42.950> the<00:03:42.980> brain<00:03:46.720> you<00:03:47.720> can<00:03:47.900> do<00:03:47.989> it

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
all the tubes on the brain you can do it

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.080 
all the tubes on the brain you can do it
however<00:03:48.260> you<00:03:48.440> like<00:03:48.680> follow<00:03:49.519> a<00:03:49.670> reference

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
however you like follow a reference

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.370 
however you like follow a reference
image<00:03:50.359> perhaps<00:03:52.419> tubes<00:03:53.419> are<00:03:53.599> nice<00:03:53.750> acts<00:03:53.989> so

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
image perhaps tubes are nice acts so

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.530 
image perhaps tubes are nice acts so
just<00:03:55.250> keep<00:03:55.459> going<00:03:55.819> you<00:03:56.810> can<00:03:56.840> even<00:03:58.389> edit<00:03:59.389> the

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
just keep going you can even edit the

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.330 
just keep going you can even edit the
stroke<00:03:59.959> shape<00:04:00.260> if<00:04:00.620> you<00:04:00.680> don't<00:04:00.919> want<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:01.130> tube

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
stroke shape if you don't want the tube

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.940 
stroke shape if you don't want the tube
so<00:04:01.639> thick<00:04:04.720> maybe<00:04:05.720> come<00:04:06.019> around<00:04:06.230> here<00:04:06.650> if<00:04:06.799> you

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
so thick maybe come around here if you

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.920 
so thick maybe come around here if you
want<00:04:07.269> that

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
want that

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.869 
want that
I'm<00:04:10.930> just<00:04:11.230> giving<00:04:11.470> the<00:04:11.590> basic<00:04:12.069> ideas<00:04:12.459> you<00:04:12.700> can

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
I'm just giving the basic ideas you can

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:17.069 
I'm just giving the basic ideas you can
perfect<00:04:13.810> this<00:04:13.959> how<00:04:14.140> you<00:04:14.200> want<00:04:14.500> it<00:04:14.650> but<00:04:15.010> um<00:04:16.079> yeah

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
perfect this how you want it but um yeah

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.900 
perfect this how you want it but um yeah
this<00:04:17.199> is<00:04:17.350> basically<00:04:17.979> what<00:04:18.220> I<00:04:18.280> did<00:04:18.489> for<00:04:18.669> one<00:04:18.820> of

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
this is basically what I did for one of

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.529 
this is basically what I did for one of
my<00:04:18.970> compositing<00:04:19.600> exercises<00:04:22.919> keep<00:04:23.919> going

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
my compositing exercises keep going

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.879 
my compositing exercises keep going
don't<00:04:25.539> really<00:04:25.780> need<00:04:25.870> the<00:04:25.990> middle<00:04:26.229> half<00:04:26.410> of<00:04:26.710> us

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
don't really need the middle half of us

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:36.180 
don't really need the middle half of us
I<00:04:27.220> don't<00:04:28.060> know<00:04:28.180> you<00:04:28.330> want<00:04:28.570> it<00:04:28.979> but<00:04:29.979> um<00:04:35.160> yes<00:04:36.160> so

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
I don't know you want it but um yes so

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.879 
I don't know you want it but um yes so
most<00:04:36.580> of<00:04:36.639> the<00:04:36.729> tubes<00:04:37.000> are<00:04:37.120> in<00:04:37.210> place<00:04:37.830> I'm<00:04:38.830> just

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
most of the tubes are in place I'm just

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.570 
most of the tubes are in place I'm just
gonna<00:04:39.100> select<00:04:39.340> all<00:04:39.669> these<00:04:41.190> while<00:04:42.190> the<00:04:42.340> tubes

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
gonna select all these while the tubes

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.210 
gonna select all these while the tubes
are<00:04:42.760> selected<00:04:43.240> and<00:04:43.539> I'm<00:04:44.530> gonna<00:04:44.620> convert<00:04:45.039> these

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
are selected and I'm gonna convert these

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.219 
are selected and I'm gonna convert these
to<00:04:45.280> a<00:04:46.060> polygon<00:04:46.690> this<00:04:47.260> way<00:04:47.500> I<00:04:47.530> can<00:04:48.600> do<00:04:49.600> fade<00:04:49.960> them

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
to a polygon this way I can do fade them

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:55.050 
to a polygon this way I can do fade them
over<00:04:51.030> they're<00:04:52.030> gonna<00:04:52.150> be<00:04:52.449> a<00:04:52.590> paint<00:04:53.699> effects<00:04:54.699> to

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
over they're gonna be a paint effects to

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:03.719 
over they're gonna be a paint effects to
polygon<00:04:55.600> I<00:04:55.960> believe<00:05:02.039> you<00:05:03.039> can<00:05:03.190> check<00:05:03.430> out<00:05:03.580> how

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
polygon I believe you can check out how

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:05.370 
polygon I believe you can check out how
it<00:05:03.760> looks<00:05:04.030> rendered<00:05:04.389> out<00:05:04.539> it<00:05:04.930> actually<00:05:05.020> looks

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
it looks rendered out it actually looks

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.490 
it looks rendered out it actually looks
pretty<00:05:05.440> good<00:05:05.710> just<00:05:06.580> the<00:05:06.669> paint<00:05:06.910> effects<00:05:07.500> you

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
pretty good just the paint effects you

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.249 
pretty good just the paint effects you
can<00:05:08.650> even<00:05:08.860> add<00:05:08.979> your<00:05:09.009> own<00:05:09.190> material<00:05:09.759> to<00:05:09.910> it<00:05:10.259> so

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
can even add your own material to it so

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:16.920 
can even add your own material to it so
if<00:05:11.500> I<00:05:11.620> select<00:05:11.919> all<00:05:12.039> these<00:05:15.180> and<00:05:16.180> whatever<00:05:16.479> brain

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
if I select all these and whatever brain

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:26.129 
if I select all these and whatever brain
material<00:05:17.410> you<00:05:17.500> want<00:05:18.360> just<00:05:19.360> a<00:05:19.419> blend<00:05:19.780> and<00:05:25.139> so

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
material you want just a blend and so

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:33.270 
material you want just a blend and so
I'm<00:05:26.409> just<00:05:26.590> gonna<00:05:27.300> combine<00:05:28.300> all<00:05:28.510> these<00:05:28.870> by<00:05:32.280> hold

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
I'm just gonna combine all these by hold

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.520 
I'm just gonna combine all these by hold
up<00:05:33.490> polygons<00:05:34.590> mesh<00:05:35.849> combined<00:05:36.990> so<00:05:37.990> now<00:05:38.320> they're

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
up polygons mesh combined so now they're

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:42.000 
up polygons mesh combined so now they're
one<00:05:38.680> object<00:05:39.159> and<00:05:40.139> I'm<00:05:41.139> just<00:05:41.289> gonna<00:05:41.409> duplicate

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
one object and I'm just gonna duplicate

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.110 
one object and I'm just gonna duplicate
this<00:05:42.220> brain<00:05:42.460> and<00:05:43.860> translate<00:05:44.860> it<00:05:45.039> negative<00:05:45.880> one

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
this brain and translate it negative one

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:55.260 
this brain and translate it negative one
in<00:05:47.789> Z<00:05:51.150> that's<00:05:52.150> wrong<00:05:53.190> that's<00:05:54.190> sorry<00:05:55.060> not

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
in Z that's wrong that's sorry not

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.219 
in Z that's wrong that's sorry not
translate<00:05:55.840> scale<00:05:56.620> negative<00:05:57.010> one<00:05:57.159> a<00:05:57.190> doozie

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
translate scale negative one a doozie

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:00.930 
translate scale negative one a doozie
yeah<00:05:59.229> and<00:05:59.530> you<00:06:00.159> can<00:06:00.310> move<00:06:00.460> this<00:06:00.520> over<00:06:00.699> a<00:06:00.909> little

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
yeah and you can move this over a little

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.730 
yeah and you can move this over a little
bit<00:06:01.150> so<00:06:03.930> basically<00:06:04.930> there<00:06:05.169> you<00:06:05.320> have<00:06:05.530> it<00:06:05.710> a

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
bit so basically there you have it a

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.339 
bit so basically there you have it a
rough<00:06:06.240> model<00:06:07.240> of<00:06:07.449> the<00:06:07.539> brain<00:06:07.720> you<00:06:08.520> can<00:06:10.229> do<00:06:11.229> it

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:11.349 
rough model of the brain you can do it
