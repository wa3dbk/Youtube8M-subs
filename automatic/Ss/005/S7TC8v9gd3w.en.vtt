00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.340
 this Christmas season really they are 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.050
 very easy to do only because he plays 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.750
 have a few materials at hand 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.900
 who can get them in the corner 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.380
 of your house and therefore quite creative 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.710
 to make these dolls that will adorn 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.140

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.870

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.100
 more more beautiful my wife who is the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.780
 responsible for making these 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.100
 little dolls like the ones you see here 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.820
 muÃ±equitos are therefore quite easy to 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.190
 do enough 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.770
 how could we call love with 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.440
 quite practical to perform 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.260
 they have practically four 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.540
 materials that are what love to 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.129
 Porcel to micro calesitas 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.430
 porcelain heads 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.440
 they fell they are these heads of 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.280
 for s micrones they sell you the package 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:13.340
 sells the package a few hands that 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.140
 are these little hands and that I have to whom 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:20.100
 at this time 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.830
 and cloth lens and this is the palencia 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.290
 this is the palencia then 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.440
 this is the cloth with which they are 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:32.440
 made these dolls below 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.010
 let's see how my wife with her 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:38.170
 creativity she was the one who then 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.360
 he invented this and created these dolls and 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.040
 now we'll see how it works 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.890
 they make these little dolls step by step 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.870
 It is also important to have silicone from 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.030
 this silicone in bar with silicone 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.090
 hot that is called so that 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:56.050
 you then start to implement it 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:02:01.170
 well let's start here with him with 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.170
 the Spanish short doll more or less 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.450
 if I want it from the man then I'll 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.690
 I do so 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.810
 I turn them around 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.810
 then over here so that they remain 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.870
 as this one is here very well more than 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.630
 emails here 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:32.470
 2 model fall 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.470
 and the woman's I make a little tube 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:39.019
 but then how do I want it to be more 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.019
 delicate lo sierra frank like 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.400
 by the sides 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.239
 and from behind 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.230
 is going to be very useful for the 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.150
 you guys soon, they do not have the 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.160
 money to buy the dolls so 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.840
 expensive that today come out and what 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.080
 you can do as a family at home with your 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.080
 children 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.510
 We have combined the chick 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.780
 So the idea is that what 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.670
 that remains is the measure of the dress of the 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.670
 dolly 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.750
 around 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.490
 we have too many 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.950
 here too 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.490
 and here 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.560
 well we're going to leave it there this is the 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.300
 first the first part so that either 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.130
 the video is too long already we come with 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.979
 the second part where the 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.819
 buttons to end up being the magnetic 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:16.819
 the good doll
