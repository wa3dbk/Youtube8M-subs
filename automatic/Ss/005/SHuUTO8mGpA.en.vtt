 mediterranean cuisine and cool cat ii 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.939

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.460
 tomato sauce in german or like bolls 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:22.489

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.980

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.280

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.670
 something basil for the sauce and with the 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:59.090
 you also immediately in the warm breakdowns 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:01:02.560
 comes some olive oil rain 2 3 tablespoons 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:12.979
 and then we'll do onions soon 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:17.240
 Celery and carrots so that tumor 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:21.260
 a minute to wish you see her 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:25.430
 all very very finely cut and 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:28.390
 after minute tu me happened 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.390
 tomatoes agree 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.070
 the bottle I schwende with some 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.830
 water from about half a glass 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.500
 and pour it to the two 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.350
 bay leaves in now something 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.850
 basilica i just call with the 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:48.220
 hand small if he does not have a basil 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:53.680
 then doing just something purely oregano 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:57.280
 now some salt is up now 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.680
 small town setting and a lid 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.810
 simmer on it and to yourself 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.450
 I take as already said by bread 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.660
 I have now submitted this with cream 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:12.970
 you can take milk or water 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:18.070
 and that's what I'm doing well now 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:20.490
 toast bread now smaller here 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:24.540
 call 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:33.120
 next the 1 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:33.120
 season the parsley with pepper salt 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:46.590
 and some downforce of a district and 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.330
 now it does mix well 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.480
 You can of course be soaked instead 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.050
 Of course you can also have bread 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.720
 take breadcrumbs 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.570
 but I think that will be a lot 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.019
 looser with a calibrated bread 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:04.450
 bread can you milk water or how 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.150
 I was allowed to give away all the pay 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.900
 liberties and now really very much 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.580
 mix thoroughly 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.950
 that would all be well mixed up and now 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.080
 now let's cover it ten 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.750
 minutes to a quarter of an hour 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.989
 stand so that the flavors go well 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:27.430
 of course we can 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:29.950
 make us a small amount from the 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.950
 size should be really small as well 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.620
 ingolf bar or maybe even like one 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.370
 table tennis ball and just so in 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.650
 the hand roll where the 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.110
 press and then form automatically 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.879
 a ball skillful to mobile also humid 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.370
 but I think it is not necessary 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:49.950
 I'm more important that no rough 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.110
 Pieces of print are like onions because of that 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.849
 destroy the form a bit 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.390
 onion are already in the sauce 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:59.239
 that's how it is with the big mom 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.909
 you can even make it smaller 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:04.829
 here are our exploits now there are 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:07.379
 three ways to prepare it 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:10.349
 either sautÃ© in the pan or in the pan 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:12.510
 baking oven or I want the 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:15.450
 simplest possibility is the only way I know 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.359
 Just put it in the sauce and 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.220
 that's what we did now so our sauce was 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.310
 it really snuggled a nice way 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.010
 have some water refilled and now 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.340
 through which one has to go right 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.340
 to trick 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.590
 In this method we lose 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:40.080
 Of course no aroma wandering 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:43.050
 everything in the sauce and I also find out 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:47.340
 this reason, this possibility is the 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:50.910
 Best is now touching in no case 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.729
 Of course that would be good as well as everything 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:56.130
 just no buns anymore just the 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:58.830
 take a pan and shake a bit 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:03.200
 simply shake that I 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:05.669
 meatballs find their place here 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.280
 so they are all downstairs 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:10.770
 Now where do you cover it and leave it 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.720
 a quarter of an hour of the small town 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:17.550
 setting of earth-to himself 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:19.860
 simmer to think the quarter of an hour 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:24.050
 thrower at and statements we do 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.050
 still between basil on it 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:37.380
 also already out and through such a 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.810
 a little below so look our finished 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:45.060
 result from i think looks very delicious 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:46.620
 made as a side dish spaghetti or polenta 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.449
 you can choose 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.940
 now i can only do a lot of success 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:51.569
 want to cook and good 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.130
 appetite 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:55.130
 until the last video
