00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.939
 Hello 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:02.810
 have you ever thought 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.800
 does the spirit exist 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.340
 maybe right now you have 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.490

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.559
 your masks 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.029
 although it may be due to waves of houses 

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:13.899
 and today we talk about understand 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:15.199
 shamanic 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:17.460
 I ask, I need to say that they are mine 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.230
 long 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.470
 this attack is in place 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.589
 tons 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:21.689
 so the plot 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.109
 every 500 years a star sweeps through it 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.380
 destiny notifying shaman beginning 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.310
 tournament for the title of king of shamans 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.070
 and the other one arrives right behind her. 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.610
 star star houses destruction 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.610

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.540
 tournament winner qualifies 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.700
 unite with the king of spirits and destroy 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.450
 this star is all just a shaman 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.840
 your friends try to win 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.120
 tournament and naturally their path meets 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.900
 a lot of difficulties among them twin brother 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.960
 lung quite good hit 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.780
 who dreams of a world where there will be only 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.940
 the shaman because ordinary people are assholes 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.890
 little cheese 1 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.730
 in the series different from 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.280
 prague is just fine 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.640

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.190
 agencies so on 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.860
 Hungarians like more rub 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.590
 english tottenham 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.590
 to 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.540
 9 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.100
 so stop really in this father and so 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.080
 ideally I don't think so should be 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.630
 at least it seems I found it not 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.700
 made without him not so much that week 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.950
 salkin ovens and threw the name of passersby 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.660

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.870

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.360
 as told about the main parameters 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.580
 milestones is an indicator of about 100 thousand 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.630
 didn't catch 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.630
 then one more time 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.010
 the fact that the alliance will not do all the same 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.780
 and to secure 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.780
 in the present in the horse was 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:11.419
 so the question 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:13.129
 why change character voices 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.039
 mid season I don't know who can 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:17.079

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.119
 Yes, the Japanese version of the shaman characters 

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:21.189
 probabilities in a childish voice but it sounds 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:22.090
 naturally 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.470
 No, I donâ€™t even know google is at a loss 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.739

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:29.269

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:30.309
 it's all 

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:31.799

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.349
