but

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
but

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.480 
but
for<00:00:33.370> a<00:00:33.400> starter<00:00:34.030> it's<00:00:34.360> my<00:00:35.140> 250<00:00:35.770> I<00:00:35.800> had<00:00:36.070> a<00:00:36.100> ninja

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:36.490 
for a starter it's my 250 I had a ninja

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.240 
for a starter it's my 250 I had a ninja
250<00:00:36.970> never<00:00:37.210> it<00:00:37.510> didn't<00:00:37.840> had<00:00:38.050> a<00:00:38.080> guarantee<00:00:39.070> kill

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
250 never it didn't had a guarantee kill

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.760 
250 never it didn't had a guarantee kill
and<00:00:39.370> it<00:00:39.490> worked<00:00:39.700> fine<00:00:39.850> for<00:00:39.910> me<00:00:40.210> because<00:00:40.480> I<00:00:40.770> have

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
and it worked fine for me because I have

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.480 
and it worked fine for me because I have
a<00:00:42.220> bit<00:00:42.670> of<00:00:42.760> a<00:00:42.880> knowledge<00:00:43.330> of<00:00:43.630> how<00:00:44.050> a<00:00:44.620> manual

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:45.490 
a bit of a knowledge of how a manual

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.030 
a bit of a knowledge of how a manual
transmission<00:00:45.640> worked<00:00:46.350> because<00:00:47.350> all<00:00:47.590> my<00:00:47.740> cars

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
transmission worked because all my cars

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.800 
transmission worked because all my cars
ever<00:00:48.400> owned<00:00:48.550> was<00:00:48.580> a<00:00:48.760> manual<00:00:49.120> transmission<00:00:49.270> so

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
ever owned was a manual transmission so

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.530 
ever owned was a manual transmission so
I<00:00:49.870> know<00:00:49.960> when<00:00:50.260> a<00:00:50.290> car<00:00:50.790> needs<00:00:51.790> to<00:00:51.940> change<00:00:52.240> gear

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
I know when a car needs to change gear

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.940 
I know when a car needs to change gear
so<00:00:52.690> I<00:00:52.750> know<00:00:52.840> when<00:00:53.050> a<00:00:53.080> motorcycle<00:00:53.620> needs<00:00:53.800> to

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:53.950 
so I know when a motorcycle needs to

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.160 
so I know when a motorcycle needs to
change<00:00:54.220> gear<00:00:54.460> you<00:00:54.610> can<00:00:54.790> tell<00:00:55.060> by<00:00:55.270> the<00:00:55.330> break<00:00:55.720> in

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
change gear you can tell by the break in

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.710 
change gear you can tell by the break in
by<00:00:56.410> the<00:00:56.470> engine<00:00:56.860> brake<00:00:57.130> are<00:00:57.430> the<00:00:57.910> sound<00:00:58.480> of<00:00:58.600> the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
by the engine brake are the sound of the

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:05.830

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.530 

yeah<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.930> doesn't<00:01:07.080> have<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.350> gear<00:01:07.620> indicator

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540
