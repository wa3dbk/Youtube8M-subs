00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:06.530
IMITA: Hey, don't you get it? You're Nogami's final fortress!

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:14.330
I mean, I know how powerful you are... But he just defeated your teacher, you know!

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.730
If worst comes to worst, what will become of Nogami?!

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.460
What will become of all our efforts to bring gambling into the new era? Huh?!

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.000
KEN: Shut up.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.260
IMITA: Huh?

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.460
KEN: I don't care what happens to Nogami, or even Shinjuku.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.060
IMITA: You... Don't...?!

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.660
KEN: Me or Him... All I care about is knowing who's stronger.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.060
IMITA: D... Don't fuck with me...

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.930
What made Nogami this big wasn't just your power, alone...

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.600
Nogami is my town, too... I won't let you choose what to do with it!!

00:00:57.333 --> 00:01:00.660
Hey! If you don't say something...

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.400
KEN: Get lost, Imita. I don't need you anymore.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.130
IMITA: You're telling ME to get lost...?

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:14.260
You're a gambler... You haven't done a damn thing for the world... all you've done is steal from others...

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.460
Why don't you look at what you've done?! You don't have your Four Guardians, your teacher, or any allies at all!!

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.066
You have no one!! Are you really okay with just losing me like that?!

00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:31.333
I have no one, huh... That's why I became a gambler in the first place.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.200
You dirty swindler... You can go die alone!!

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:41.600
Alone...

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.130
Shinjuku and Nogami don't matter...

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.000
Gamblers are, in the end, alone.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.866
All that matters is who is stronger.

00:01:57.733 --> 00:02:00.860
Dosa Ken vs. Tetsuya! The battle for prosperity!

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.133
Which will be crowned supreme?

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.533
ALONE AT THE TOP!

00:02:15.733 --> 00:02:18.400
It's because I'm a gambler that I'm alone!

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.400
I have no one!

00:02:26.466 --> 00:02:28.333
That's why I'll win!

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.200
TETSUYA: The match will last for one session. We're starting right now.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.330
YUUJI: That Tetsu... He's planning on using the momentum from his win in a short, single-session match!

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.600
KEN: I don't like it.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.530
We're having an all-night vigil for Jinbo... we'll play until the sun comes up again.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.060
DANCHI: Until the sun comes up again?!

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.930
You're telling these two who just came out of a match to play for 20 more hours?! That's unfair!

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.860
KEN: Gamblers are all unfair.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.330
TETSUYA: All right.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.060
DANCHI: Tetsu?!

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.730
KEN: As expected of Kid Tetsu. It has to be this way.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.660
DANCHI: Kgh... Well, it'll be 3-on-1... There's no way we can lose...

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.200
Hell, Tetsu's already won!

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.400
KEN: It doesn't matter how many people I'm up against... I win by myself!

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.000
If someone goes below 0, the game will still go on. When the sun comes up, whoever has more points will win!

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.533
DANCHI: Here it is...

00:03:29.666 --> 00:03:31.660
YUUJI: It's finally starting...

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.660
TETSUYA: I've been waiting for this moment for a long time...

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.860
KEN: It was our fate to do this sooner or later...

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.600
This won't be a boring gamble like we had a bit ago...

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.000
I want to have the greatest gamble possible!!

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.266
Here we go, Kid Tetsu. The fateful match!

00:03:54.933 --> 00:03:57.400
You stacked the wall.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.200
Huhh?

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.600
I'm gonna take apart your wall.

00:04:06.066 --> 00:04:07.866
T-This is-!!

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.860
The Dai San Gen Bomb?!

00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:14.066
What were you planning? This is clearly cheating!

00:04:17.133 --> 00:04:21.133
What's with him? His trick was exposed, but he's laughing?

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.200
Then you're telling me...

00:04:25.466 --> 00:04:27.333
This ISN'T cheating?

00:04:27.666 --> 00:04:30.330
A Dai Sharin stacked in his wall!!

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.000
You were gonna use Tsubame Gaeshi?!

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:41.733
If they both stacked a Yakuman from the beginning, they weren't just messing around when they started... The battle had already begun!

00:04:42.333 --> 00:04:44.530
Now there won't be any wall-stacking...

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.400
Using signals is out, too.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.800
This game will be a true gamble with no cheating!
