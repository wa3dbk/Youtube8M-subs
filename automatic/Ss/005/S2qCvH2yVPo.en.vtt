00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
look at this figure here's the package

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:31.740 
look at this figure here's the package
in<00:00:17.670> this<00:00:17.880> one<00:00:18.060> comes<00:00:18.270> in

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.360 

I'm<00:00:32.750> a<00:00:32.810> little<00:00:32.930> bit<00:00:33.110> more<00:00:33.320> impressed<00:00:34.160> with

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
I'm a little bit more impressed with

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.390 
I'm a little bit more impressed with
this<00:00:34.760> figure<00:00:35.030> than<00:00:35.540> I<00:00:35.660> am<00:00:35.930> with<00:00:36.470> the<00:00:36.740> Anakin

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400 
this figure than I am with the Anakin

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.300 
this figure than I am with the Anakin
I've<00:00:37.640> just<00:00:37.790> reviewed<00:00:38.920> I<00:00:41.860> think<00:00:42.860> just<00:00:43.190> the

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.310 
I've just reviewed I think just the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.060 
I've just reviewed I think just the
overall<00:00:43.550> look<00:00:43.970> of<00:00:44.210> the<00:00:44.270> figure<00:00:44.750> and<00:00:45.050> also<00:00:45.860> the

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
overall look of the figure and also the

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.870 
overall look of the figure and also the
action<00:00:46.400> feature<00:00:47.739> a<00:00:48.739> little<00:00:49.160> bit<00:00:49.280> better<00:00:49.460> than

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
action feature a little bit better than

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.780 
action feature a little bit better than
the<00:00:50.030> Anakin<00:00:51.400> you've<00:00:52.400> probably<00:00:52.550> already

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
the Anakin you've probably already

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.400 
the Anakin you've probably already
guessed<00:00:53.059> this<00:00:53.330> figures<00:00:53.660> got<00:00:53.870> a<00:00:53.900> firing

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
guessed this figures got a firing

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.000 
guessed this figures got a firing
jetpack<00:00:55.030> you<00:00:56.030> just<00:00:56.300> give<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.170> missile<00:00:57.800> or

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
jetpack you just give the missile or

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.430 
jetpack you just give the missile or
tweak<00:00:58.370> at<00:00:58.489> the<00:00:58.580> end<00:00:58.700> and<00:00:59.180> that<00:00:59.210> should<00:01:00.200> fire

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
tweak at the end and that should fire

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:13.580 
tweak at the end and that should fire
out<00:01:02.560> uh-huh<00:01:04.869> the<00:01:05.869> jetpack<00:01:06.500> is<00:01:06.920> removable

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.450 

hmm<00:01:14.579> you<00:01:15.060> see<00:01:15.329> it<00:01:15.420> comes<00:01:15.570> with<00:01:15.659> lightsaber<00:01:16.460> and

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
hmm you see it comes with lightsaber and

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.760 
hmm you see it comes with lightsaber and
the<00:01:17.790> articulation<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.229> figure<00:01:19.590> is

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
the articulation and this figure is

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.700 
the articulation and this figure is
pretty<00:01:20.100> much<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:21.420> same<00:01:21.630> as<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.960> Anakin<00:01:22.380> he's

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
pretty much the same as the Anakin he's

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.649 
pretty much the same as the Anakin he's
got<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> ball<00:01:23.340> jointed<00:01:23.729> neck<00:01:23.970> bowling

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.710 
got a ball jointed neck bowling
shoulders<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.170> elbows<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:25.950> will<00:01:26.100> wrists

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
shoulders and elbows so will wrists

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.080 
shoulders and elbows so will wrists
swivel<00:01:27.720> waist<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.110> hips<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.860> an<00:01:29.100> again<00:01:29.520> not<00:01:30.060> a

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
swivel waist and hips is an again not a

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.169 
swivel waist and hips is an again not a
collision<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.810> knees<00:01:30.960> or<00:01:30.990> ankles<00:01:32.179> which

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
collision in the knees or ankles which

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:38.660 
collision in the knees or ankles which
is<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.390> little<00:01:33.720> bit<00:01:33.840> disappointing<00:01:37.670> this

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
is a little bit disappointing this

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.100 
is a little bit disappointing this
figure<00:01:39.060> also<00:01:39.179> comes<00:01:39.659> with<00:01:39.780> they're

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
figure also comes with they're

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:50.380 
figure also comes with they're
interchangeable<00:01:40.470> head

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.020 

is<00:01:51.140> that<00:01:51.350> of<00:01:51.440> a<00:01:51.590> clone<00:01:51.950> trooper<00:01:52.100> helmet<00:01:53.000> I

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
is that of a clone trooper helmet I

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.200 
is that of a clone trooper helmet I
heard<00:01:56.030> that<00:01:56.240> if<00:01:56.420> it<00:01:56.690> was<00:01:56.870> a<00:01:57.940> removable<00:01:58.940> helmet

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
heard that if it was a removable helmet

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.580 
heard that if it was a removable helmet
rather<00:01:59.600> than<00:01:59.750> Elton<00:02:00.110> a<00:02:00.200> head<00:02:00.409> but<00:02:01.119> you<00:02:02.119> know

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
rather than Elton a head but you know

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:09.270 
rather than Elton a head but you know
beggars<00:02:03.590> can't<00:02:03.800> be<00:02:03.860> choosers

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.560 

yeah<00:02:10.280> like<00:02:10.550> I<00:02:10.580> said<00:02:10.700> overall<00:02:11.180> I'm<00:02:11.330> pleased

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
yeah like I said overall I'm pleased

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.980 
yeah like I said overall I'm pleased
with<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:11.810> figure<00:02:12.170> but<00:02:12.380> I<00:02:12.590> just<00:02:12.830> think<00:02:13.100> that<00:02:13.990> as

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
with the figure but I just think that as

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.780 
with the figure but I just think that as
well<00:02:15.260> as<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.470> Anakin<00:02:15.860> this<00:02:16.010> could<00:02:16.280> have<00:02:16.400> just

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
well as the Anakin this could have just

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.240 
well as the Anakin this could have just
been<00:02:16.910> so<00:02:17.150> much<00:02:17.300> better<00:02:17.540> if<00:02:17.690> had<00:02:18.590> to<00:02:18.800> rate<00:02:18.980> this

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
been so much better if had to rate this

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.010 
been so much better if had to rate this
figure<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.030> Anakin<00:02:20.420> then<00:02:20.600> I<00:02:20.690> give<00:02:20.900> him

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
figure and the Anakin then I give him

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.070 
figure and the Anakin then I give him
both<00:02:21.319> about<00:02:21.739> any<00:02:22.700> out<00:02:22.880> of<00:02:23.030> 10<00:02:23.239> maybe<00:02:25.330> maybe<00:02:26.330> 7.5

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
both about any out of 10 maybe maybe 7.5

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.699 
both about any out of 10 maybe maybe 7.5
something<00:02:27.560> that<00:02:29.080> when<00:02:30.080> we<00:02:30.200> look<00:02:30.320> at<00:02:30.440> him<00:02:30.560> with

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
something that when we look at him with

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:36.940 
something that when we look at him with
the<00:02:30.920> normal<00:02:31.670> obi-wan<00:02:32.060> head<00:02:35.860> well<00:02:36.860> I'll

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
the normal obi-wan head well I'll

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.500 
the normal obi-wan head well I'll
probably<00:02:37.160> end<00:02:37.400> up<00:02:37.580> doing<00:02:37.640> is<00:02:38.030> putting<00:02:38.360> this

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
probably end up doing is putting this

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.820 
probably end up doing is putting this
