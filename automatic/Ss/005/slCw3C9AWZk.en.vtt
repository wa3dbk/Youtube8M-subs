00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
because I think they stopped it at 24

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.150 
because I think they stopped it at 24
but<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.209> 18<00:03:03.660> days<00:03:03.690> is<00:03:04.170> not<00:03:04.349> like<00:03:04.590> oh<00:03:04.769> let's<00:03:04.950> go

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.170 
to bed and go to sleep it's 18 24 hour
days<00:03:08.370> I<00:03:08.730> have<00:03:09.599> a<00:03:09.630> lot<00:03:10.110> of<00:03:10.140> time<00:03:10.650> invested<00:03:11.180> into

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
days I have a lot of time invested into

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.380 
days I have a lot of time invested into
this<00:03:12.209> game<00:03:12.750> like<00:03:13.739> more<00:03:14.670> that<00:03:15.000> I<00:03:15.030> probably

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
this game like more that I probably

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.530 
this game like more that I probably
should<00:03:16.250> but<00:03:17.250> I<00:03:17.310> think<00:03:17.760> it<00:03:17.880> reflects<00:03:18.269> on<00:03:18.510> the

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
should but I think it reflects on the

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.590 
should but I think it reflects on the
whole<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.620> gameplay<00:03:20.250> aspect<00:03:20.850> at<00:03:21.060> how<00:03:21.269> good<00:03:21.540> I

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
whole the gameplay aspect at how good I
