00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
uncle he died and then the place

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.899 
uncle he died and then the place
basically<00:01:58.890> stayed<00:01:59.579> vacant<00:02:00.149> for<00:02:00.869> like<00:02:01.170> 10-15

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
basically stayed vacant for like 10-15

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.679 
basically stayed vacant for like 10-15
probably<00:02:02.909> like<00:02:03.000> 20<00:02:03.360> years<00:02:04.729> 15<00:02:05.729> 15<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.360> 20<00:02:06.659> years

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
probably like 20 years 15 15 to 20 years

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.740 
probably like 20 years 15 15 to 20 years
and<00:02:07.399> in<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.429> time<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:09.090> fell<00:02:09.239> into<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.479> state<00:02:09.569> of

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
and in that time it fell into a state of

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.710 
and in that time it fell into a state of
disrepair<00:02:10.080> no<00:02:10.679> one<00:02:10.800> really<00:02:10.950> went<00:02:11.250> there<00:02:11.489> and

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
disrepair no one really went there and

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.830 
disrepair no one really went there and
so

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
so

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.290 
so
I<00:02:12.890> decided<00:02:13.890> I<00:02:14.220> would<00:02:14.280> take<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.760> over<00:02:15.120> and

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
I decided I would take it over and

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.699 
I decided I would take it over and
rebuild<00:02:16.290> it<00:02:17.030> lucky<00:02:18.030> charm<00:02:18.360> 6j<00:02:18.930> s<00:02:19.110> says<00:02:19.379> do<00:02:19.620> you
