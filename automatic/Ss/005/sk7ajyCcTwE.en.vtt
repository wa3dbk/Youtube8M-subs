 good afternoon dear friends in this 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.230
 I want to tell a video clip how 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:23.470
 set the rear view camera hooked up 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.470

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.309
 I showed such a little blue connector 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.020

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:39.309

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:52.370
 pin 19 is plus 16 this is minus where 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.540
 I'll probably start with 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.120
 software 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:02.950
 that is, the camera is not set to 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.950
 stitched standard firmware 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.680
 who doesn't want to bother him 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:13.180
 firmware to connect the camera as 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:17.620
 connects there is a program like it of 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:20.040

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.690
 software and then by the installation itself 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.690
 everything went loading 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:46.490

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:05.700
 We go to my device from them by disqus 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.700
 here is the program we have 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.880
 novels 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.380

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.830
 wire goes here 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.920
 and 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.560
 buy install we had to remove this 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.160
 plastic sheathing 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.160

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:39.279
 put away our do i'll just show there 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:45.849

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:45.849
 fill it 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:58.960
