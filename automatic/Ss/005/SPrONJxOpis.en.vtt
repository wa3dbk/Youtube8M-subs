00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 reese witherspoon in a biographical 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.450
 drama about a woman focusing on one 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:11.190
 there is a lot of walking 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:15.179
 see in the big tripwire if then 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.369
 I have to deny you concerns yours 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:28.740
 courage 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:31.980
 Emily Dickinson and year 1000 miles 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:36.110
 just has to run to complete the sentences 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.110
 why do I have to spend 1000 miles 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.360
 Do you want to be lonely in real life ? 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.360
 I feel lonely out here as 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.350
 without hard separation what separation is 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.370
 was a bit too short 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.370
 really love 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.470
 i miss you my mother was the one 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:07.470
 love of my life 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.590
 you take mr berlin and sleep 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.590
 was that with everyone 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.800
 they once thought of giving up 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.930
 only every two minutes or so I have 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.560
 already given up in my work at 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.990
 enter 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.710
 Do you regret anything I had 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.020
 no choice 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.020
 There was never a crotch on my way 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.540
 Here are a few questions I ask myself 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.250
 location 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.040
 what if I forgive myself 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.090
 what if I 'm sorry but myself 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.240
 if I travel in the past 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.040
 could 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.470
 I would not do a thing differently 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.670
 What if all that I did was me 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.670
 brought exactly here 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.140
 the big triple fetched and 16 minutes 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.730
 is the twelve years released and 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.670
 germany probably left 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.989
 15 january 2015 in german 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.430
 Cinemas tells the story of 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.299
 scherrer life played by reese 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.370
 witherspoon at it basically 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.110
 she is so happy again 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.790
 to see the main role in a movie 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.890
 and this woman is one the one 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.239
 own past one lost the 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.890
 mother died a whole 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.049
 she once had special ties with her 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.610
 and her life breaks at the latest 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.989
 then as the heroine addiction expires 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.480
 Eventually the point will come when she 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.860
 I have to start again I have to do everything 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.930
 new orders and that's why she goes 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.870
 on a big trip and hike too 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.310
 walk over a whole 2000 kilometers in the us 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.170
 but it is as good as not at all 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.640
 what is still relatively prepared at the moment 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.170
 funny , but also insane 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.970
 can be dangerous and on this 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.410
 It's just the big one all the time 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.879
 constant question under constant struggle 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.980
 against the against its own sake 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.450
 want to give up and at the same time new 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.890
 acquaintances she closes and 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.629
 doing a movie of much between the 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.129
 lines swinging and over life 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.989
 We will not give up the new beginning 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.940
 about new power over the over the 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.530
 say that is never too late is itself 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.299
 change yourself and somewhere new 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.430
 to set a goal and that's pretty 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.750
 noble motifs the big triple white 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.430
 ultimately remembered 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.260
 simply because it is one 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.970
 road trip in quotes movie too 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.400
 foot is a bit too into the wild 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.690
 or traces but it creates quality 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.069
 not quite serve up both to come 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.630
 especially not to the former 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.669
 But the big one was incredibly intense 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.470
 tripwire it's one of those 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:33.209
 Few films that this basic topic 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.160
 came and so into the wild or 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.480
 should feel the turn on the turn 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.680
 look if I admittedly 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.180
 you have to say you have to 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.590
 inevitably see in the cinema 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.720
 the feeling also transports well 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.400
 is on blu ray and dvd abbas is large 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.660
 the boat is a whole lot of soul 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.669
 stuck in the strip and him 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.019
 Finally very much worth seeing 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:50.639
 and all just yet really 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.280
 Happens as often when filming out of this 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:54.959
 Genre means the big one is private 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.430
 recommended but ultimately enough 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.650
 It's also home to look at 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.090
 gets from me as a biographical drama 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.739
 seven out of ten possible points 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.419
 Overall , more than acceptable 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.430
 six and a half out of ten possible points 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:07.109
 and thus me through 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.670
 like to let a perm this video 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:10.290
 let it stay if not 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:11.909
 otherwise you know that you give it again 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.579
 left around me and tomorrow 15 clock 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:16.109
 Of course, at the latest a new video and 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:20.720
 Until then, I hope you are again 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.720
 with of course on the 3rd
