00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
Pentagon fresh and yeah the the the

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:38.710 
Pentagon fresh and yeah the the the
crack<00:00:36.350> was<00:00:36.590> still<00:00:36.920> a<00:00:37.190> bit<00:00:37.370> yeah<00:00:37.970> that's<00:00:38.480> over

but I think this yeah this won't affect

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.380 
but I think this yeah this won't affect
