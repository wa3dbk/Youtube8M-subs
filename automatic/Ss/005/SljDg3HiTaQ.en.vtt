00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.509
 speaks guys welcome to another video 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.219
 channel here 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:13.749
 Today I'll introduce you to a pc 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.429
 It's very cool, what are you going to get? 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:15.909
 make for less than fifteen hundred 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:17.740
 real 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:19.689
 it will be the basic entry gamer pc 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.340
 but that will already run all the games 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.339
 current course you will not be able to 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.570
 run some with graphics at most but 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:28.300
 the ps will be able to rotate quietly 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.279
 at least with lower graphics for 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.259
 example you will be able to play gta5 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.350
 that will launch and that will manage to run 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.730
 also bear 444 and other games 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.469
 they are there now 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.160
 So stop talking and let's go to the 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:41.160
 components used 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.750
 so guys starting there with 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.070
 processor that will be a gp 3221 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.769
 dual core processor 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.750
 basically one and three without the rails o 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.610
 which makes it an excellent processor 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.879
 it has a touch of 3 ghz if you have one 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:04.059
 very low consumption of only 53 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.100
 watch lg socket at 50 that means 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.229
 that you will be able to make upgrades 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.140
 future processor and has three goals 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.460
 cash the same amount of e3 on the screen 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.860
 You can also see more 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.530
 processor information in the software 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.850
 called cpu z that shows more details 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.190
 about the characteristics 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:25.630
 the processor came out with a price of $ 180 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:28.479
 the card used is one gigabyte hp 81 m 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.369
 there is a basic board but it will support 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.030
 all configuration it supports memory 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:36.310
 ddr3 up to 1,600 megawatts at most 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.429
 16 gigs on the back we have a 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.380
 hdmi connector and 2 o sbt 6.0 and others 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:42.310
 inputs that are already standard in all 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.020
 mothers plates 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.789
 despite being a basic motherboard she 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.799
 will carry small upgrades 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.570
 Although it is not recommended, you will 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.610
 can put up to 17 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.979
 the ram memory for the configuration is a 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.290
 color is value this model works with 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.210
 clock of 1,600 megawatts actually I 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.579
 I only put a four-gigabyte comb 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.259
 Ideally, you should put at least 100 gb 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.969
 some games lose one 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.950
 bit more than 4 gb 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:07.750
 but since the budget was short I 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.369
 I put only one comb because 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.220
 increase a lot people would not 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.000
 able to reach a budget of up to 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.430
 1,500 reais 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.320
 the hd of our configuration to a standard 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.239
 the Seagate 500 gb 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.829
 actually that part that does not change much 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.079
 in performance then you can put 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.910
 any HD is sold on the market that does not 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:27.010
 will have no problem noting that 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.890
 I want to do it for the price of HD 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.989
 very high actually increased a lot and 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.690
 a simple 500 gb hd is costing 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.430
 $ 220 if you get my first 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.739
 videos you will see that I already put 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.030
 the same hd here with a price of 150 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.709
 real 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.450
 the video card which is the most 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.459
 important and that will make the 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.940
 work to run the games is a 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.920
 naughty etec r7 250 an alert that I 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.620
 I want to give to all of you and that 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.630
 the r 5 model and this makes all the 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.410
 difference in the final performance of the games 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.150
 We have r 7 250 ddr3 models and 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.459
 this makes her memory cheerleaders 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.470
 below and therefore the performance 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.810
 also the very low of this video card 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.540
 for you a great cost benefit and I think 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.489
 that for the price of it is a great option 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.580
 the source that will support the entire 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.680
 configuration is a pc and elektro series 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.440
 of 430 watts 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.569
 this fort was simply very good in 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.459
 all the tests that were even has 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.319
 a test of ronaldo anatec side and this 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.200
 source came out very well 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.870
 it is 80 plus bronze and has everything the 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.250
 People need our setup 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.590
 including will always bear future 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.900
 great quietly and that's why I chose 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.400
 because the price did not change much 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.090
 among the others we had in the 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.739
 Marketplace 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.110
 you should have noticed that you change the 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.630
 then order the components and now finally 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.120
 We are going to talk about the cabinet. 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.280
 The cabinet is a cougar. 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.900
 me this is the best option on the market that 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.910
 We have to make sense and a way to 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.310
 entrance is simply a great 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.290
 Cabinet Housekeeping It's pretty cool to 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.120
 people already have the hds format part of 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.250
 drawer which facilitates quite what 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.620
 humanly and I think for that price 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.840
 you can not find any other cabinet 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.329
 that is best and that it brings all 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.980
 specifications of this one of the strong 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:14.109
 it is that it is very easy to 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.510
 dismantle for us to do maintenance and 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:18.340
 and this was certainly one of the 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.470
 which made me choose and which 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.800
 admits because for those who do not know I use 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.110
 one on the front panel it has a 3.0 sb 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.010
 plus 1 displays 2.0 and standard inputs 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.020
 audio 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.760
 good people this utility shows the 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.650
 brief configuration for us to have 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.400
 a broader view of what has been 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.380
 chosen 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.580
 we can see that the configuration is fine 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.130
 balanced people do not have any 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.789
 component that is much higher than 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.860
 others 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:43.840
 the most expensive component of the configuration is 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.789
 the video card I think she fell 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.220
 like a glove in this configuration that 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:50.320
 was a final price of one thousand four hundred 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.850
 eighty reais and it will certainly be 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.410
 a great option for those with the 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.820
 shorter budget 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.950
 Good people, I hope you have 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.030
 liked the video if you liked click the 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.130
 jewelry 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.710
 cries because it helps a lot here 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.670
 channel thank you for attending leave 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.350
 in the comments 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.790
 the next releases you want 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.920
 see why this is very important 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.320
 suggestions are always welcome 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:14.310
 a hug to everyone until the next video and
