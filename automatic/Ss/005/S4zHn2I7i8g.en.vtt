00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.369
 welcome friends but above all friends 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.980
 of the truths of the animus for this 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.060
 fantastic preview here is your ios 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.919
 who speaks to you 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.390
 today we received from ubisoft italia 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:25.119
 preview for games events 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.349
 week in milan and lucca comics 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.269
 the highly anticipated phantom blade 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.159
 honestly I never understood and vip of 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.840
 unboxing so I 'll show you already 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:34.310
 open and don't tell me if one 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.010
 box the packaging that you decide if 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.430
 with speak so much does not believe the first 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.110
 impact 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.460
 we immediately notice a remarkable care of the 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.860
 details much more accurate and detailed 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.510
 than that of the release of Edward and Ezio 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.340
 the resignation is obviously a bit 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.870
 greater given the overall dimensions of the arms e 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.880
 of the crossbow and the whole weighs 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.430
 approximately 200 grams abundant with the 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.620
 go door we go over the whole 300 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.780
 plastic as we had already used to like 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.750
 the previous ones to the hidden including one 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.150
 rubbery blade that pops out and dart 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.129
 also gummy, unfortunately, for the 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.229
 security also important ie to tar 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.689
 noteworthy when the night ezio blade 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.060
 rigid plastic air risked of 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.880
 to draw eyes to the right is missing 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.460
 children especially if there is any 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.350
 child listening he wants 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.090
 denounce me for making it look like that 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.200
 let me be so much a bum 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.899
 nots 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.020
 oh fuck maybe this was nice to say in 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.640
 room or fuck I said luckily 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.700
 has not blasphemed can lele me 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.439
 it would be natural to dude separately 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.240
 let's look at the details already well 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.070
 visible in these images and strap 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.549
 they are in Velcro or easy to open and 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.920
 close and be fixed to the coast 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.569
 what is crap a wristband of 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.850
 rubbery plastic that should remember 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:49.640
 the leather 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.890
 ok ok sometimes it's too fussy 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.360
 sorry more than anything else is very different 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.679
 from the version that we will see later in the game 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.299
 as you see this image is 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.689
 slightly different from that view 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:02.149
 while we also pass it to the mechanism 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:05.149
 we have three mechanisms with one button 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.310
 to launch the dart a button for 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.259
 open the arms of the crossbow and a 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.290
 other activates the dear and the old la 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.360
 macerata here it is the dart can be 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.980
 inserted in both directions but only in 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.630
 a sense gets stuck so you need to 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.940
 pay attention to us 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.290
 in conclusion the phantom blade results 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.819
 well built to be a toy 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.150
 but still remains a toy for 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.799
 adults can be as dangerous as it is 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.150
 it can be a very sharp spoon 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.440
 so small children maybe 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.090
 should pay attention to it in 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.680
 handle it better if with the presence of 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.780
 I know what a parent is to me 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.420
 asking you're wondering if i 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.760
 spoons can be entrusted I do not know 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.799
 maybe next chapter of assassin's yes 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.190
 will play in the kitchen and we'll find out about it 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:48.950
 sure they won't make feudal japan 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.870
 damn ok with this is all yours 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.150
 to xvi greets and hopes to see the ve 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.230
 ubisoft stand at gamesweek here in milan 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.849
 it's in the villa for a long time 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:03.140
 and remember nothing and real everything but 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.140
