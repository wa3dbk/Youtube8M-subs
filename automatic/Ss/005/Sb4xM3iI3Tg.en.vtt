00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
today about the zvex fuzz factory it's a

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.590 
today about the zvex fuzz factory it's a
great<00:00:05.190> fuzz<00:00:05.430> pedal<00:00:05.790> a<00:00:05.879> lot<00:00:06.060> of<00:00:06.210> fun<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.480> play

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.000 
great fuzz pedal a lot of fun to play
with<00:00:06.870> but<00:00:07.080> sometimes<00:00:07.500> it's<00:00:07.649> hard<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:07.859> find

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
with but sometimes it's hard to find

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.490 
with but sometimes it's hard to find

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
practical uses for it so I'm gonna talk

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.620 
practical uses for it so I'm gonna talk
real<00:00:10.740> quickly<00:00:10.920> about<00:00:11.070> how<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.400> kind<00:00:12.389> of<00:00:12.480> get

real quickly about how to kind of get
those<00:00:12.780> crazy<00:00:13.110> squeals<00:00:13.620> without<00:00:13.980> it<00:00:14.130> just

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
those crazy squeals without it just

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.640 
those crazy squeals without it just
going<00:00:14.400> out<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:14.639> control<00:00:15.199> first<00:00:16.199> thing<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.529> like

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
going out of control first thing I like

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.870 
going out of control first thing I like
to<00:00:16.710> do<00:00:16.949> there's<00:00:17.190> all<00:00:17.340> kinds<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.670> different

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
to do there's all kinds of different

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.340 
to do there's all kinds of different
places<00:00:17.940> to<00:00:18.270> kind<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.480> meet<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:18.750> balance<00:00:19.170> but

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
places to kind of meet this balance but

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.710 
places to kind of meet this balance but
you<00:00:19.439> want<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.680> get<00:00:19.770> your<00:00:19.949> gait<00:00:20.189> comp<00:00:20.789> Drive<00:00:21.449> and

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
you want to get your gait comp Drive and

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.840 
you want to get your gait comp Drive and
stab<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.500> where<00:00:22.619> you're<00:00:22.769> just<00:00:23.130> below<00:00:23.550> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
stab to where you're just below the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.929 
stab to where you're just below the
threshold<00:00:24.060> that<00:00:24.420> goes<00:00:25.609> you<00:00:26.609> know<00:00:26.699> making

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
threshold that goes you know making

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.519 
threshold that goes you know making
those<00:00:27.119> crazy<00:00:29.510> sounds<00:00:30.510> it'll<00:00:30.630> happen<00:00:30.869> there<00:00:31.260> so

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
those crazy sounds it'll happen there so

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.370 
those crazy sounds it'll happen there so
right<00:00:32.070> now<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.279> have<00:00:32.550> my<00:00:32.579> gait<00:00:33.170> about<00:00:34.170> one

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
right now I have my gait about one

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.470 
right now I have my gait about one
o'clock<00:00:34.530> comp<00:00:35.250> three<00:00:35.550> o'clock<00:00:35.820> Drive<00:00:36.239> all<00:00:36.450> the

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
o'clock comp three o'clock Drive all the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.020 
o'clock comp three o'clock Drive all the
way<00:00:36.600> up<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.050> stab<00:00:37.290> all<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.590> way<00:00:37.680> down<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.160> like

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
way up and stab all the way down I like

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.760 
way up and stab all the way down I like
using<00:00:39.660> setting<00:00:40.079> right<00:00:40.230> around<00:00:40.379> there<00:00:40.620> because

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
using setting right around there because

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.979 
using setting right around there because
you<00:00:41.190> can<00:00:41.399> play<00:00:41.670> kind<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.059> practical<00:00:42.629> chords

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
you can play kind of practical chords

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.600 
you can play kind of practical chords
but<00:00:43.770> if<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:43.980> want<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.190> do<00:00:44.280> kind<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
but if you want to do kind of the

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.880 
but if you want to do kind of the
Hendrix<00:00:44.969> type<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.270> thing<00:00:45.620> it's<00:00:46.620> gonna<00:00:46.739> be

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
Hendrix type of thing it's gonna be

00:00:46.890 --> 00:01:02.270 
Hendrix type of thing it's gonna be
quiet<00:00:49.910> crazy<00:00:50.910> sound<00:00:51.239> start<00:00:51.449> right<00:00:51.629> away

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.890 

it's<00:01:02.790> pretty<00:01:03.000> money<00:01:03.210> if<00:01:03.360> you're<00:01:03.540> on<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.750> neck

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
it's pretty money if you're on the neck

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.270 
it's pretty money if you're on the neck
pickup<00:01:04.080> which<00:01:04.410> is<00:01:04.530> how<00:01:04.620> you<00:01:04.680> kind<00:01:04.860> of<00:01:04.949> keep<00:01:05.129> it

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
pickup which is how you kind of keep it

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.710 
pickup which is how you kind of keep it
from<00:01:05.400> breaking<00:01:05.580> up<00:01:05.880> too<00:01:06.180> much<00:01:06.330> from<00:01:06.540> pitch

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
from breaking up too much from pitch

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:15.590 
from breaking up too much from pitch
shifting<00:01:07.140> if<00:01:07.560> you're<00:01:07.800> on<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.480> bridge

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.900 

can<00:01:16.600> work<00:01:16.750> there<00:01:16.960> as<00:01:17.080> well<00:01:17.520> once<00:01:18.520> you<00:01:18.670> get<00:01:18.790> up

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
can work there as well once you get up

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.010 
can work there as well once you get up
the<00:01:19.030> neck<00:01:19.210> a<00:01:19.240> little<00:01:19.390> bit<00:01:19.510> it's<00:01:19.690> gonna<00:01:19.780> start

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
the neck a little bit it's gonna start

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:41.420 
the neck a little bit it's gonna start
to<00:01:20.080> give<00:01:20.230> you<00:01:20.320> this<00:01:20.440> crazy

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.350 

and<00:01:42.430> one<00:01:42.610> of<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:42.760> things<00:01:42.970> that<00:01:43.120> I<00:01:43.150> do<00:01:43.240> to

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
and one of the things that I do to

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.000 
and one of the things that I do to
really<00:01:43.660> get<00:01:43.840> some<00:01:44.050> extra<00:01:44.260> sounds<00:01:44.740> out<00:01:44.830> of<00:01:44.860> it

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
really get some extra sounds out of it

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.440 
really get some extra sounds out of it
if<00:01:45.160> you<00:01:45.280> hold<00:01:45.490> in<00:01:45.640> there<00:01:45.760> a<00:01:45.790> long<00:01:46.030> time<00:01:46.270> it's

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
if you hold in there a long time it's

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:53.190 
if you hold in there a long time it's
gonna<00:01:46.570> eventually<00:01:47.220> start<00:01:48.220> going<00:01:48.820> crazy<00:01:52.200> but

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
gonna eventually start going crazy but

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.600 
gonna eventually start going crazy but
if<00:01:53.320> you<00:01:53.440> throw<00:01:53.590> in<00:01:53.710> a<00:01:53.770> pinch<00:01:54.010> harmonic<00:01:54.460> it's

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
if you throw in a pinch harmonic it's

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.540 
if you throw in a pinch harmonic it's
gonna<00:01:54.730> really<00:01:55.480> start<00:01:56.040> just<00:01:57.040> doing<00:01:57.250> that<00:01:57.340> pitch

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
gonna really start just doing that pitch

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:10.290 
gonna really start just doing that pitch
shifting<00:01:57.910> real<00:01:58.090> quickly<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.729> I<00:02:09.760> like<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.119> throw

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
shifting real quickly so I like to throw

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.760 
shifting real quickly so I like to throw
those<00:02:10.479> in<00:02:10.630> when<00:02:10.750> I'm<00:02:10.840> soloing<00:02:11.230> and<00:02:11.470> just<00:02:11.590> let

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
those in when I'm soloing and just let

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:37.490 
those in when I'm soloing and just let
it<00:02:11.890> go

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.350 

so<00:02:38.500> I<00:02:38.530> wouldn't<00:02:38.980> advise<00:02:39.220> using<00:02:39.610> a<00:02:39.790> fuzz

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
so I wouldn't advise using a fuzz

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.550 
so I wouldn't advise using a fuzz
factory<00:02:40.569> all<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.019> time<00:02:41.200> as<00:02:41.319> your<00:02:41.409> go-to

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
factory all the time as your go-to

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.080 
factory all the time as your go-to
distortion<00:02:42.250> but<00:02:42.310> if<00:02:42.430> you<00:02:42.489> have<00:02:42.670> one<00:02:42.909> you're

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
distortion but if you have one you're

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.729 
distortion but if you have one you're
playing<00:02:43.330> with<00:02:43.450> it<00:02:43.629> there<00:02:44.019> are<00:02:44.049> ways<00:02:44.200> to<00:02:44.440> use<00:02:44.709> it

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
playing with it there are ways to use it

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:45.960 
playing with it there are ways to use it
live<00:02:45.040> if<00:02:45.280> you're<00:02:45.400> not<00:02:45.489> afraid<00:02:45.700> of<00:02:45.849> a<00:02:45.940> little

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
live if you're not afraid of a little

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.690 
live if you're not afraid of a little
bit<00:02:46.239> of<00:02:46.330> noise<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:47.010> because<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.159> gate<00:02:48.370> it's

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
bit of noise and because the gate it's

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.430 
bit of noise and because the gate it's
great<00:02:49.000> that<00:02:49.150> it<00:02:49.239> can<00:02:49.330> be<00:02:49.450> quiet<00:02:52.140> those<00:02:53.140> kinds

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440
