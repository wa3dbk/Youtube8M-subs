 of makeup that I have is a 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.000
 dark purple makeup that on my channel 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.830
 I do not have any purple makeup 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.840
 dark and I love how you look at the 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.820
 purple when you go out at night 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.590
 I hope you like my proposal 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.369
 make-up and well let's go with the tutorial 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.200
 see you soon, dad, I'm going to 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.820
 apply an eye test so that 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.820
 the makeup lasts all night 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.030
 I'm going to apply this prebase in all my 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.899
 mobile eyelid distributing it to the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.899
 bone of the eyebrows 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.230
 now I'm going to paint a purple base for 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:42.810
 that the shade grabs a much more color 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:44.610
 intense this base I will apply it in 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.230
 the first two thirds of my eyelid 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.230
 mobile ending in the fold 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.450
 now covers the entire base with a shadow 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.450
 dwelling 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.329
 I'll take this brown color in half to 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.780
 help with the transition of colors 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.780
 after 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.630
 I will blur this color 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.630
 fold up 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.030
 now use the black color of this palette 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.590
 and with a brush canceled I will draw one of 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.590
 on the outside of my mobile eyelid 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.690
 and then cover the bird with the same 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.690
 shadow 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.170
 but blurring the color little by little 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:05.099
 gift plus black shadow until you reach 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.099
 the desired intensity 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.590
 add the black color little by little 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.870
 it is always better to add the black color 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.200
 of less than more so as not to struggle so much 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.200
 in blur 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:41.000
 with this black pencil I will delegate my 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.000
 upper and lower lashes 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.120
 I'm going to apply the same purple shadow on 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:11.100
 half of my lower lashes and in 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.100
 the other half apply this black man 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.610
 this will help balance the shadow 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.610
 intense we did on the mobile eyelid 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.960
 now I'm going to use this hard pecan of chufa 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.960
 to apply a bit of purple frost 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.689
 I apply the bumps to patitos with much 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.080
 careful to avoid that it falls 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:44.080
 my cheeks 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.800
 now I'm going to put false eyelashes 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:07.139
 of what the gluing of the eyelashes 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.139
 dry I will eliminate and dry bone 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.820
 Now I'm going to put on some mascara to 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.120
 adjust my natural lashes with the 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.120
 false 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.550
 finally I will put a little shadow 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.550
 silver on the lacrimal to illuminate 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:35.389
