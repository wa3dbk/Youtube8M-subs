00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
back of your hand so that you're not

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
covering your eye completely if you find

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.810 
covering your eye completely if you find
that<00:00:46.700> more<00:00:46.940> comfortable<00:00:47.860> but<00:00:48.860> most<00:00:49.460> people

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
that more comfortable but most people

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.910 
that more comfortable but most people
find<00:00:50.149> it<00:00:50.329> too<00:00:50.719> much<00:00:50.870> of<00:00:51.050> a<00:00:51.110> contrast<00:00:51.320> and<00:00:51.800> it

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
find it too much of a contrast and it

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.369 
find it too much of a contrast and it
generates<00:00:52.340> tension<00:00:52.879> if<00:00:53.629> you<00:00:53.809> use<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.140> back<00:00:54.260> of

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
generates tension if you use the back of

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:55.690 
generates tension if you use the back of
your<00:00:54.469> hand<00:00:54.710> you<00:00:54.829> still<00:00:55.070> get<00:00:55.190> a<00:00:55.219> bit<00:00:55.370> of<00:00:55.489> light

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
your hand you still get a bit of light

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.840 
your hand you still get a bit of light
getting<00:00:56.149> into<00:00:56.390> that<00:00:56.510> eye<00:00:56.920> so<00:00:57.920> it<00:00:58.070> still<00:00:58.820> has

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
getting into that eye so it still has

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.010 
getting into that eye so it still has
something<00:00:59.210> to<00:00:59.420> do<00:01:01.149> so<00:01:02.149> you<00:01:02.210> shade<00:01:02.510> first<00:01:02.809> one

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.020 
something to do so you shade first one

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.770 
something to do so you shade first one
eye<00:01:03.640> then<00:01:04.640> you<00:01:04.699> do<00:01:04.939> your<00:01:05.119> technique<00:01:05.479> again

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
eye then you do your technique again

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.499 
eye then you do your technique again
with<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:06.079> other<00:01:06.200> eye<00:01:06.639> always<00:01:07.639> remembering<00:01:08.420> to

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
with the other eye always remembering to

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:11.469 
with the other eye always remembering to
close<00:01:08.810> your<00:01:08.990> eyes<00:01:09.170> at<00:01:09.409> regular<00:01:09.740> intervals<00:01:10.479> to

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
close your eyes at regular intervals to

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.120 
close your eyes at regular intervals to
bring<00:01:11.689> in<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:11.990> memory<00:01:12.259> in<00:01:12.380> the<00:01:12.469> imagination

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
bring in the memory in the imagination

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.789 
bring in the memory in the imagination
and<00:01:14.319> to<00:01:15.319> allow<00:01:15.649> your<00:01:15.829> eyes<00:01:15.859> to<00:01:16.159> rest<00:01:17.499> how<00:01:18.499> do<00:01:18.560> we

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
and to allow your eyes to rest how do we

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.010 
and to allow your eyes to rest how do we

number two in number three let's think

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:03.489 
number two in number three let's think
about<00:02:00.679> what<00:02:00.979> the<00:02:01.099> right<00:02:01.279> eyeball<00:02:01.700> sees<00:02:02.499> number

about what the right eyeball sees number

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:04.839 
about what the right eyeball sees number
one<00:02:03.709> is<00:02:03.889> a<00:02:03.950> bit<00:02:04.069> to<00:02:04.189> the<00:02:04.279> left

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:04.849 
one is a bit to the left

you can't superimpose them the answer is

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.610 
you can't superimpose them the answer is
that<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.880> eyes<00:03:14.030> can<00:03:14.450> only<00:03:14.510> converge<00:03:15.080> on<00:03:15.410> one

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
that the eyes can only converge on one

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.460 
that the eyes can only converge on one
point<00:03:15.950> at<00:03:16.160> a<00:03:16.190> time<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:16.820> the<00:03:17.780> brain<00:03:18.019> can<00:03:18.320> only

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
point at a time and the brain can only

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.199 
point at a time and the brain can only
make<00:03:18.739> proper<00:03:19.070> sense<00:03:19.310> of<00:03:19.459> the<00:03:19.550> image<00:03:19.790> at<00:03:19.940> that

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
make proper sense of the image at that

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.920 
make proper sense of the image at that
point<00:03:20.600> where<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.019> eyes<00:03:21.140> are<00:03:21.350> converging<00:03:22.930> when

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
and two green beads in front and the

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.620 
and two green beads in front and the
strings<00:03:59.660> cross<00:04:00.260> over<00:04:00.560> at<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:00.769> purple<00:04:01.130> bleed

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
strings cross over at the purple bleed

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.300 
strings cross over at the purple bleed
that's<00:04:02.630> the<00:04:02.780> theory<00:04:03.320> that's<00:04:03.920> what's<00:04:04.160> your

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
that's the theory that's what's your

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.280 
that's the theory that's what's your
experience<00:04:04.790> if<00:04:05.150> your<00:04:05.299> eyesight<00:04:05.630> is<00:04:05.780> good<00:04:06.079> and

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
experience if your eyesight is good and

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.199 
experience if your eyesight is good and
your<00:04:06.650> brain<00:04:06.890> is<00:04:06.920> managing<00:04:07.519> to<00:04:07.549> coordinate

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
your brain is managing to coordinate

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:09.610 
your brain is managing to coordinate
both<00:04:08.420> our<00:04:08.630> eyes<00:04:08.750> and<00:04:08.959> combine<00:04:09.320> the<00:04:09.470> images

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
both our eyes and combine the images

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.789 
both our eyes and combine the images
easily<00:04:10.480> you<00:04:11.480> can<00:04:11.630> practice<00:04:12.079> looking<00:04:12.410> from<00:04:12.590> one

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
easily you can practice looking from one

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.560 
easily you can practice looking from one
bead<00:04:13.070> to<00:04:13.220> the<00:04:13.250> next<00:04:13.670> and<00:04:13.850> observing<00:04:14.420> the

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
bead to the next and observing the

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.810 
bead to the next and observing the
crossover<00:04:15.140> first<00:04:15.980> at<00:04:16.160> the<00:04:16.250> distance<00:04:16.640> where

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
crossover first at the distance where

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.699 
crossover first at the distance where
you<00:04:16.910> see<00:04:17.090> it<00:04:17.180> best<00:04:17.479> and<00:04:17.810> then<00:04:18.169> gradually

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
you see it best and then gradually

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.460 
you see it best and then gradually
moving<00:04:18.950> to<00:04:19.190> other<00:04:19.340> distances<00:04:20.169> always<00:04:21.169> letting

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
moving to other distances always letting

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.940 
moving to other distances always letting
your<00:04:21.590> eyes<00:04:21.799> feel<00:04:22.160> soft<00:04:22.550> and<00:04:22.850> easy<00:04:23.740> touch<00:04:24.740> each

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
your eyes feel soft and easy touch each

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.860 
your eyes feel soft and easy touch each
bead<00:04:25.250> as<00:04:25.370> you<00:04:25.490> look<00:04:25.640> at<00:04:25.760> it<00:04:25.910> to<00:04:26.419> help<00:04:26.630> get<00:04:26.840> a

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
bead as you look at it to help get a

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.270 
bead as you look at it to help get a
sense<00:04:27.169> of<00:04:27.320> movement

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
sense of movement

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.619 
sense of movement
what<00:04:30.280> can<00:04:30.460> you<00:04:30.580> do<00:04:30.849> if<00:04:30.999> you<00:04:31.150> only<00:04:31.300> see<00:04:31.599> one

00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:31.629 
what can you do if you only see one

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:34.439 
what can you do if you only see one
string<00:04:32.469> or<00:04:32.770> if<00:04:33.129> one<00:04:33.370> string<00:04:33.819> appears<00:04:34.150> much

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
string or if one string appears much

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.640 
string or if one string appears much
fainter<00:04:34.990> than<00:04:35.020> the<00:04:35.319> other<00:04:36.900> shade<00:04:37.900> one<00:04:38.169> eye<00:04:38.199> and

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
fainter than the other shade one eye and

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.159 
fainter than the other shade one eye and
look<00:04:38.710> along<00:04:39.129> the<00:04:39.159> string<00:04:39.870> get<00:04:40.870> a<00:04:40.900> good

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
look along the string get a good

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.830 
look along the string get a good
impression<00:04:41.469> of<00:04:41.800> how<00:04:41.949> it<00:04:42.069> looks<00:04:42.310> to<00:04:42.490> you<00:04:42.840> find

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
impression of how it looks to you find

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.390 
impression of how it looks to you find
the<00:04:43.960> point<00:04:44.169> where<00:04:44.259> it<00:04:44.469> looks<00:04:44.650> clearest<00:04:45.159> and

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
the point where it looks clearest and

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.610 
the point where it looks clearest and
place<00:04:45.939> your<00:04:46.180> middle<00:04:46.300> bead<00:04:46.719> there<00:04:47.169> with

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
point where it looks clearest and if

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.510 
point where it looks clearest and if
it's<00:05:11.199> different<00:05:11.590> for<00:05:11.800> this<00:05:11.889> eye<00:05:12.099> place<00:05:12.490> a

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
it's different for this eye place a

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.689 
it's different for this eye place a

different bead at this point close your
eyes<00:05:15.819> again<00:05:16.000> and<00:05:16.629> think<00:05:16.840> about<00:05:17.080> what<00:05:17.289> this

00:05:17.459 --> 00:05:17.469 
eyes again and think about what this

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:20.100 
eyes again and think about what this
looks<00:05:17.740> like<00:05:18.210> have<00:05:19.210> another<00:05:19.479> look<00:05:19.659> and<00:05:19.900> close

looks like have another look and close
your<00:05:20.259> eyes<00:05:20.409> again<00:05:21.000> if<00:05:22.000> you<00:05:22.240> work<00:05:22.479> at<00:05:22.629> this

your eyes again if you work at this

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.140 
your eyes again if you work at this
slowly<00:05:23.169> and<00:05:23.349> patiently<00:05:23.710> you'll<00:05:24.699> end<00:05:24.879> up<00:05:24.969> with

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
slowly and patiently you'll end up with

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.790 
slowly and patiently you'll end up with
two<00:05:25.360> different<00:05:25.569> ideas<00:05:26.139> of<00:05:26.289> what<00:05:26.409> the<00:05:26.560> string

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
two different ideas of what the string

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.629 
two different ideas of what the string
looks<00:05:26.949> like<00:05:27.249> one<00:05:28.029> for<00:05:28.240> each<00:05:28.389> eye<00:05:28.919> now<00:05:29.919> with

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
looks like one for each eye now with

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:33.029 
looks like one for each eye now with
your<00:05:30.789> eyes<00:05:30.969> closed<00:05:31.419> see<00:05:32.229> if<00:05:32.319> you<00:05:32.469> can<00:05:32.650> switch

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 
your eyes closed see if you can switch

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:34.980 
your eyes closed see if you can switch
in<00:05:33.279> your<00:05:33.400> imagination<00:05:33.969> between<00:05:34.569> these<00:05:34.750> two

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
in your imagination between these two

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.730 
in your imagination between these two
ideas<00:05:36.750> see<00:05:37.750> if<00:05:37.810> you<00:05:37.930> can<00:05:38.110> build<00:05:38.349> up<00:05:38.560> an

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
ideas see if you can build up an

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.499 
ideas see if you can build up an
imagination<00:05:39.430> of<00:05:39.550> what<00:05:39.580> it<00:05:39.849> would<00:05:39.969> be<00:05:40.029> like<00:05:40.330> to

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:40.509 
imagination of what it would be like to

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:43.469 
imagination of what it would be like to
see<00:05:40.689> both<00:05:40.960> images<00:05:41.110> at<00:05:41.500> once<00:05:42.330> describe<00:05:43.330> to

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
see both images at once describe to

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:45.029 
see both images at once describe to
yourself<00:05:43.870> the<00:05:44.050> sort<00:05:44.319> of<00:05:44.379> picture<00:05:44.649> you<00:05:44.889> would

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 
yourself the sort of picture you would

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:47.010 
yourself the sort of picture you would
get<00:05:45.279> if<00:05:45.550> you<00:05:46.089> were<00:05:46.210> to<00:05:46.240> look<00:05:46.539> at<00:05:46.659> the<00:05:46.750> middle

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
get if you were to look at the middle

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.740 
get if you were to look at the middle
bead<00:05:47.229> or<00:05:47.740> one<00:05:48.339> of<00:05:48.430> the<00:05:48.550> other<00:05:48.699> beads<00:05:51.449> the<00:05:52.449> next

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
bead or one of the other beads the next
