00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.840 
I'm wondering if that's the case because
now<00:02:03.689> it's<00:02:04.049> broke<00:02:04.290> off<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.770> you'll<00:02:05.340> be<00:02:05.490> able<00:02:05.610> to

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
now it's broke off and you'll be able to

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.690 
now it's broke off and you'll be able to
see<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.180> will<00:02:06.329> show<00:02:06.540> in<00:02:06.659> here<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.020> his

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
see it will show in here this is his

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.280 
see it will show in here this is his
left<00:02:08.700> front

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.390 

see<00:02:12.010> here's<00:02:12.400> some<00:02:12.640> of<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.970> old<00:02:13.439> soul<00:02:14.439> that<00:02:15.310> was

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
see here's some of the old soul that was

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.750 
see here's some of the old soul that was
here<00:02:15.730> again<00:02:16.150> he<00:02:16.329> was<00:02:16.480> trimmed<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:16.959> week<00:02:17.140> ago

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
here again he was trimmed a week ago

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.490 
here again he was trimmed a week ago
again<00:02:18.760> he<00:02:18.970> had<00:02:19.060> had<00:02:19.239> separation<00:02:19.930> really<00:02:20.349> bad

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
again he had had separation really bad

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.140 
again he had had separation really bad
over<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.400> winter<00:02:22.680> I<00:02:23.680> think<00:02:24.579> that's<00:02:24.760> what<00:02:25.000> they

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
over the winter I think that's what they

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.979 
over the winter I think that's what they
call<00:02:25.360> separation<00:02:25.989> in<00:02:26.170> here

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
call separation in here

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.100 
call separation in here
here's<00:02:28.989> his<00:02:29.290> hoof<00:02:29.739> walls<00:02:30.069> I<00:02:31.060> put<00:02:31.810> a<00:02:31.840> roll<00:02:32.079> on

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
here's his hoof walls I put a roll on

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:40.349 
here's his hoof walls I put a roll on
them<00:02:32.590> his<00:02:33.310> frog<00:02:37.019> again<00:02:38.019> he<00:02:38.590> had<00:02:38.799> a<00:02:38.829> huge<00:02:39.359> hole

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:40.359 
them his frog again he had a huge hole

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:44.009 
them his frog again he had a huge hole
in<00:02:40.780> here<00:02:41.109> huge<00:02:41.530> hole<00:02:42.000> this<00:02:43.000> winter<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:43.780> I

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
trimmed it and opened it up I tried to

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.059 
trimmed it and opened it up I tried to

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
open up the V on all of them because

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:49.860 
open up the V on all of them because
there<00:02:48.250> was<00:02:48.370> just<00:02:48.400> like<00:02:49.090> this<00:02:49.150> hole<00:02:49.510> this<00:02:49.810> deep

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
there was just like this hole this deep

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.619 
there was just like this hole this deep
down<00:02:50.739> in<00:02:52.530> his<00:02:53.530> frog<00:02:53.950> after<00:02:54.790> I<00:02:54.819> went<00:02:55.090> riding<00:02:55.540> up

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.559 
all about
but<00:03:24.250> that<00:03:24.370> happens<00:03:24.730> quite<00:03:24.879> often<00:03:25.150> with<00:03:25.449> my

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
but that happens quite often with my

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.809 
but that happens quite often with my
horses<00:03:25.870> they<00:03:26.109> get<00:03:26.290> these<00:03:26.470> big<00:03:26.680> frogs<00:03:27.010> they

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
horses they get these big frogs they

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.000 
horses they get these big frogs they
they<00:03:28.299> walk<00:03:28.690> on<00:03:28.959> them<00:03:29.109> they<00:03:29.260> go<00:03:29.410> over<00:03:29.680> sideways

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
they walk on them they go over sideways

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.369 
they walk on them they go over sideways
and<00:03:30.699> I<00:03:31.120> try<00:03:31.419> and<00:03:31.449> keep<00:03:31.660> them<00:03:31.840> trimmed<00:03:32.079> so<00:03:32.290> they

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379 
and I try and keep them trimmed so they

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:33.720 
and I try and keep them trimmed so they
don't<00:03:32.530> get<00:03:32.620> gunk<00:03:32.919> underneath<00:03:33.340> here<00:03:33.519> and<00:03:33.639> then

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
don't get gunk underneath here and then

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.099 
don't get gunk underneath here and then
all<00:03:33.819> of<00:03:33.849> a<00:03:33.970> sudden<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.359> whole<00:03:34.599> thing<00:03:34.870> just
