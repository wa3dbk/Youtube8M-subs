00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello hello hello hello what tal friends 

00:00:02.539 --> 00:00:08.030
 we are here with a new video tutorial 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.030
 for the channel 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.289
 and for all those who are 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:20.289
 bored of the default tone of the 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.619
 iphone this video tutorial is for 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.619
 your 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:40.230
 and very well continuing with this video 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.949
 tutorial to make our ring tone what 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.250
 we're going to do with the itunes program that 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:49.850
 previously 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:53.060
 teach how to download and run it 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.990
 alright then let's open our 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.740
 Program 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:01.080
 remember that to use the itunes of 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:05.580
 same way they have to have installed 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:08.310
 the iTunes and then here tells us that 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.420
 it's detecting the device we're going 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.420
 to connect then 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:32.000
 and I repeat it without problems 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.920
 I'm using an ipad as you can see 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.340
 only because it looks better in the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.470
 camera and comes out better is not appreciated better 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.970
 in the thumbnail image 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:48.510
 then to be able to create our corner 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.080
 The first thing we have to do is go to 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.080
 half 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:58.310
 here are all our songs that 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:01.399
 are in our device to be able 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.759
 create our corner you need to copy 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:07.909
 the song if they do not know how to copy 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.619
 music to your device in the video that 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:14.470
 I went up earlier 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.470
 come out how to do it and we look for the song 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:26.820
 is this we select it 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.820
 and we go where it says here make ringtone 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.200
 Well I chose this topic only I know 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.459
 that is not a big issue I chose it 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.390
 only because he has no right to 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.310
 Author 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.310
 then let me put it here 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:54.730
 on the internet and good to do in the 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:58.470
 ring with us here we are going to cut 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.470
 we can do it like this in this way 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:05.800
 we want you to calculate where 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:10.680
 is for example if it is 25 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.680
 24 sorry and one for example play 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.480
 and we see if it was good in court was what 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.480
 what of morante 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.579
 this example I'm just going to do the 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.579
 cut here at 30 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.970
 yes we can do 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.290
 of how the ringtone will be now 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:48.490
 to calculate also better here is the 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:50.380
 starting point and determined that we 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.800
 we can choose for example 7 that 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.390
 we would like in 15 seconds and you do not 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.150
 we aim 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:01.620
 that is 15 for example we can put 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.620
 here 15 followed by italy 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.430
 obviously we are going to hear a view 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.430
 previous guys 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.810
 this also applies to modify the 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:26.139
 message lanes as you can see here 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.880
 obviously the message tones are more 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:31.470
 shorts 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:35.370
 and when we see we are finished 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:38.460
 We were in 6 imported 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.990
 and what does this makes it short 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:45.290
 and it matters to the device 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.930
 as you can see it is already active in 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.430
 our 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.850
 ipad 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.850
 Let's say 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.400
 we can see that we can choose 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.139
 when they call them 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.139
 the service 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.890
 good and if for some reason they are wrong 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.600
 and they want to eliminate a ringtone that 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:22.090
 they created 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:25.100
 for example I have when you want 4 if 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:29.860
 we would like to eliminate s 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.860
 let's go here to file system 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:39.840
 the system 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:48.050
 let's go where it says itunes control to diego 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:50.360
 high and it comes out ringtones and there it appears 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:54.400
 we eliminate it so that's why 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.400
 only one appears as you see there 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.080
 do not punch millan de led 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:08.110
 if the events that 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:08.110
 you created him I made you appear 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:16.200
 only this please nothing more nothing 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.689
 more because here they can spoil their 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.300
 team 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:23.849
 sparkly 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.849
 this m 4 r the lead 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:31.400
 you can see that it disappears from there 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.400
 device 

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:48.000
 as always if this video tutorial I 

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:52.350
 liked them served the little hand for 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.220
 up subscribe be commented see you 

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.220
