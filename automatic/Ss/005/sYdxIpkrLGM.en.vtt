00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.480
 epping this time with the chip that's one 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.200
 knife in credit card format comes from 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.330
 onlineshop gifts punkt.de goes 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.680
 Look at it all the different 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.050
 gadgets and products 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.870
 and now to the following products said 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.740
 he credit cards better that's what he looks like 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:45.840
 Here's just got out again but 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:47.970
 now for the first time to see the instructions 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.880
 It is also normal as you are then 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:54.330
 so far after so he then from the 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.880
 credit card to the knife becomes the only one 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.860
 Manko the instructions are unfortunately not 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.370
 in German but only in English 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.560
 language 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.409
 but actually the pictures should be yes 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.510
 had explained himself 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:14.280
 and now I'll show you how to do that 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:18.540
 field but that's what it looks like here 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.950
 The top is flat and secure take 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.859
 may be the do not sound goes out to 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.890
 he just expresses so daily now 

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:30.600
 It just makes you go upstairs outside 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:35.399
 so then you make the small receiver 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:39.689
 right the big one to the left and those are 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:44.729
 so that the small 1 latch holes pressure 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:47.479
 on it and the knife is complete 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.649
 finished and of course it's great too 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.700
 transport 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.469
 just when you just take that one 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.219
 You always have a wallet 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:59.490
 a very nice knife, so to speak 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:05.359
 Good sounds very well processed 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.359
 has been completely water 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:11.790
 waterproof exactly does not cost anything 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.600
 the materials have been used as materials 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:19.700
 do not rust and now I'll show you 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.700
 so just a quick test 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.500
 Now I show you as I said the 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.959
 Try cutting times with the credit cards 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:33.069
 better we just cut here now 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:38.819
 sometimes a piece of apple really cuts 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:44.050
 very good and as I said is great 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:46.959
 to take along like just 13 grams and 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.150
 you have a sound length of 65 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.840
 centimeters 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.870
 So that's all right 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.630
 Neatly you have to say 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.680
 Of course you have to pay attention 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.019
 age recommendation on is from 18 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.810
 I am not a toy for children 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.760
 just a real knife but straight 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.430
 when you are on the road and you said 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.620

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.560

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.959
 Can he get these credit cards better 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.620
 just take a wallet 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.390
 packed and you always have it with you 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.739

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:27.010
