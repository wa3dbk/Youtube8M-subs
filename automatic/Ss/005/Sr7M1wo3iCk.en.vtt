00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.210
 part of 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.499
 you stay a little quiet for 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.299
 the goal of the hike is to 

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:52.219
 relax too so that's important 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.609
 to have a horse listened to then 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:54.609
 quiet 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.270
 balance sheet of the day a few thousand 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.730
 liters of water a rainbow is a 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.620
 walk in the rain that night there is 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.590
 had this particular tiredness of the 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.360
 rainy days and a hope 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.899
 the weather has announced a great sun for 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.899
 the next day 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.280
 second day the sun is present 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.060
 hidden behind an opaque cover 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.060
 from bruno 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.560
 then there is a lot of fog so 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.950
 we will avoid the rags the points 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.909
 dangerous 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.069
 so we're going from 2 so had to make 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:41.079
 that are here and have spun in 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.549
 a combi is worth the blues 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:46.000
 and there it is totally totally 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:48.340
 wild we can evolve a paradise of 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.220
 the claw as we say between the 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.450
 yellow and shine the pines and we 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.450
 completely sounded
