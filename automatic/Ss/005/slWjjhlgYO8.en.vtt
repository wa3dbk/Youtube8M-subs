clock face and let's draw in some

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.769 
clock face and let's draw in some
numbers<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.010> number<00:00:29.220> 12<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.730> indeed<00:00:30.090> XIII

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
numbers so the number 12 is indeed XIII

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.610 
numbers so the number 12 is indeed XIII

and the number 9 is I X that using

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.410 
and the number 9 is I X that using
subtraction<00:00:37.890> principle<00:00:38.219> right<00:00:38.579> there<00:00:38.790> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
subtraction principle right there the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.780 
subtraction principle right there the
other<00:00:39.540> numbers<00:00:39.870> are<00:00:40.050> 1<00:00:40.559> &amp;<00:00:40.829> 2

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
other numbers are 1 &amp; 2

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.920 
other numbers are 1 &amp; 2
there's<00:00:42.480> 11<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.200> there's<00:00:43.950> 10<00:00:44.340> there's<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.270> 7

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
there's 11 and there's 10 there's a 7

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.500 
there's 11 and there's 10 there's a 7
and<00:00:46.170> there's<00:00:46.980> 8<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:48.440> there's<00:00:49.440> 5<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.760> then

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
and there's 8 and there's 5 and then

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.779 
and there's 8 and there's 5 and then
there's<00:00:51.750> 4<00:00:52.129> now<00:00:53.129> we<00:00:53.190> use<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.610> subtraction

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
there's 4 now we use the subtraction

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.970 
there's 4 now we use the subtraction
principle<00:00:54.149> for<00:00:54.539> 9<00:00:54.750> but<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.379> amazing<00:00:55.770> thing<00:00:55.949> is

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
principle for 9 but the amazing thing is

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.250 
principle for 9 but the amazing thing is
if<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.280> look<00:00:56.460> at<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.610> clock<00:00:56.870> either<00:00:57.870> your<00:00:58.109> wrist

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
watch or a clock tower they've done it

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.609 
watch or a clock tower they've done it
right<00:00:59.879> it's<00:01:00.600> gonna<00:01:00.899> be<00:01:00.989> for<00:01:01.770> once<00:01:02.399> not<00:01:03.030> IV<00:01:03.809> this

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
right it's gonna be for once not IV this

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.770 
right it's gonna be for once not IV this

is a very strange or very surprised much
a<00:01:06.810> surprise<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:08.159> do<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.430> it's<00:01:08.549> consistent<00:01:09.060> as

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
a surprise so do it it's consistent as

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.910 
a surprise so do it it's consistent as
absolutely<00:01:09.600> consistent<00:01:10.049> every<00:01:10.439> single<00:01:10.770> clock

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
absolutely consistent every single clock

there is the occasion some clock maker
got<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.030> wrong<00:01:15.240> now<00:01:16.229> why<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.590> change<00:01:17.189> why<00:01:17.790> why

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
got it wrong now why the change why why

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.789 
got it wrong now why the change why why
not<00:01:18.630> if<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:18.990> use<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.259> subtraction<00:01:19.680> principle

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
not if you use the subtraction principle

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.289 
not if you use the subtraction principle
for<00:01:20.130> nine<00:01:20.280> why'd<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.729> using<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:20.970> for<00:01:21.090> number

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
for nine why'd you using it for number

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.660 
for nine why'd you using it for number
four<00:01:21.680> turns<00:01:22.680> out<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.009> history<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.490> is

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
clue is I've looked at books I looked at

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.450 
clue is I've looked at books I looked at
the<00:01:28.200> internet<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.680> do<00:01:28.740> not<00:01:28.950> learn<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.250> true

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
the internet I do not learn the true

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.679 
the internet I do not learn the true

answer no one seemed to know the true
answer<00:01:31.280> my<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.670> best<00:01:32.850> thing<00:01:33.090> I've<00:01:33.299> seen<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.930> a

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
answer my the best thing I've seen is a

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.230 
answer my the best thing I've seen is a
convention<00:01:34.829> amongst<00:01:35.040> clock<00:01:35.310> makers<00:01:35.700> they're

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
convention amongst clock makers they're

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.969 
convention amongst clock makers they're
actually<00:01:36.720> prosthetic<00:01:37.079> reasons<00:01:37.619> it's<00:01:37.770> kind<00:01:37.920> of

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
actually prosthetic reasons it's kind of

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.130 
actually prosthetic reasons it's kind of
nice<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.220> have<00:01:38.430> four<00:01:38.700> ones<00:01:39.000> here<00:01:39.329> because<00:01:39.990> if

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
nice to have four ones here because if

iiiii for the number 4 really look at it
once<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:41.370> start<00:02:41.609> seeing<00:02:41.790> it<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.209> won't<00:02:42.359> be
