00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello i find their due for to the 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.180
 tag remained in my phone because 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.010
 the business before with my senses 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.380
 phone and more than I've had 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.450
 the other for my birthday you me 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.480
 have all wanting more and so suddenly I 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.279
 will update it with the 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.480
 first question which is what is the 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.140
 brand of your mobile 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.600
 so I have an iphone like these it is 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.580
 white because I prefer it in white 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.990
 your second question is what is 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.490
 your wallpaper on screen 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.920
 lock is not too much it's called 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:37.110
 like that it's my boyfriend and I'm here 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.700
 and the bath house fund finally games 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.230
 not too greedy on appeal either and 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.379
 baskets so to remind a little 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.700
 the summer atmosphere caliente then to which 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.579
 old are you you first notebook 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.039
 I read it seems to me when I was in 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.840
 sixth we something like 11 12 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.399
 years of barons are kind of you 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.230
 between collage I give you a laptop 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.399
 to call me when I have a problem I 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.410
 What is your mobile? 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.390
 then not necessarily end I 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.850
 always on me that anyway but 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.010
 I'm not crazy 24 I can see 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.840
 not to join texting framework this kind 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.810
 of someone who sends text messages to all 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.790
 which emerges at 24h 24 which answer all 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.950
 the time all the time the virtues the 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.180
 sms was talking directly I think that 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.740
 a lot of people just like me and 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.710
 prefer to speak directly with people 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.930
 of his family because often they 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.490
 not understand when texting must 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.680
 really call to be clear with 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.860
 them and I prefer sent text messages to 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.720
 my friends because 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.970
 here and then when you cellphone 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.520
 actual me it's been since my 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.890
 birthday so on May 9th but I had 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.950
 May 10th so it can since May 10th 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.950
 about a month and ten days 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.610
 have you ever been caught in class with your 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.190
 phone never it has already rang or 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.870
 fibers and cost but my teachers have 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.600
 not heard that I've ever done 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.000
 take anything am complaining 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.520
 have not already broken by the week 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.310
 never have what tff laptop 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.740
 frankly I think that with this one I 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.850
 am or a message the iphone 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.440
 frankly is it really 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.790
 super like phone and I do not say that 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.590
 because it's a fashion effect or 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.239
 couach that frankly the interface is 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.940
 cool and what we can do with 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.410
 it's downright frankly cool so 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.239
 the iphone samba like laptops of the same 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.760
 what are the applications that you 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.440
 used more I'm not going to do in 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.150
 originality because it's really 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.380
 the basic apps that I use 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.750
 a lot a lot so I'm going to you 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.790
 show must know that I have very very 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.930
 very very few applications in the 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.220
 people when they have an iphone there 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.610
 download ten thousand applications me I 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.860
 do not really have twitter because 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.360
 that I am agent 24 on twitter 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.620
 the one who follow me on twitter sees 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.519
 that I am really very much 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.900
 a lot a lot 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.360
 then another thing that I use 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.650
 a lot moved g I also think that 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.000
 everyone knows pretty much so 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.739
 that you need to do this you post some 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.030
 pictures of you and so be careful I you 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.130
 put the link of my instagram and my 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.900
 tutor and that in info bar if you 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.680
 want to go see then used also 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.360
 a lot of applications that's called my 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.450
 showtime chemistry 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.030
 so in fact there is a big list of 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.640
 series that has so there you have a 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.260
 big list of series and you can 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.320

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.209
 he tells you every week what episode 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.040
 you have to see and then when you 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.360
 have seen it you can check it hard 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.860
 how was that? 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.930

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.280
