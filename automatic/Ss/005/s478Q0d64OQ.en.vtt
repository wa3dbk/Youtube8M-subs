00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:16.320
 it will be better like these than like 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.590
 this is it 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.910
 from there your work plug in 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.910
 you send a signal 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.560
 that's you 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.560
 right here 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.870
 gerald is that you did a 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.440
 fixation 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:45.329
 alex tallon here ok he's going to move 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.730
 during the climb ie to the 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.590
 morizet lists the talent to power while 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.239
 just to have here by the league that 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.370
 worth something and who will we 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:58.680
 allow when going up any board get 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.149
 declare ok here to the end and there 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.739
 you see when fred what is 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.890
 pass when I pass my hand over his 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.479
 slips and the weight here when I pose 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.670
 in the other direction it does not slip so this 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.670
 which allows for at least two pardeza 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.390
 no 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.870
 while blowing a sitting live 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.850
 a shot we will enjoy to see a little 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.360
 technical advice to the rise of the 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.360
 conversion 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.980
 so how the conversion is operated 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.170
 to ride the conversion to ride I 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.650
 let's go here so I'll go back on 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.490
 my right 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.170
 so I'm going to change course to 180 degrees 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.590
 the goal is going to be when I arrive 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.000
 if the tracks done well when I arrive 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.229
 at the level of conversion it would 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.780
 that I liked what they are almost 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.110
 perpendicular to the slope if the skis 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.690
 are like that is that the trace is not 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.060
 very well of this fact okay so I 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.040
 will put my skis like this I'm going 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:26.080
 to arrive I will change course 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:29.370
 I have sticks lalime a stick hamon I 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:33.340
 bring him here at the end of the skis lover 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:37.480
 okay then for everyone and here 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:40.510
 I'm going to swing my ski sail batting 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.280
 the best is first of all skiing that at 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.840
 it's a bit difficult but it's 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.230
 to have virtually parallel skiing at 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.330
 the other opposite ok this boat there I 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.209
 I'll be able to support you a bit 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.780
 I'm going to be able to bring back that stick not there 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.940
 here to support me too and there 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.150
 what am I going to do a leaven barely 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.230
 a little skiing the pull back I 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.200
 will come to taste 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.340
 dago road for others what for in 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.420
