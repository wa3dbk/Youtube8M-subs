00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
you'll love having them but the way you

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.820 
you'll love having them but the way you
can<00:05:52.450> tell<00:05:52.600> if<00:05:52.720> something<00:05:53.020> is<00:05:53.080> polarized<00:05:53.650> when

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
can tell if something is polarized when

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.440 
can tell if something is polarized when
the<00:05:53.920> way<00:05:54.040> it<00:05:54.100> cuts<00:05:54.400> it<00:05:54.520> out<00:05:54.640> on<00:05:54.910> a<00:05:54.940> horizontal

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 
the way it cuts it out on a horizontal

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.810 
the way it cuts it out on a horizontal
plane<00:05:55.810> is<00:05:56.800> that<00:05:57.010> if<00:05:57.130> you've<00:05:57.250> ever<00:05:57.400> crossed

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
plane is that if you've ever crossed

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.850 
plane is that if you've ever crossed
these<00:05:58.090> lenses<00:05:58.570> you<00:05:58.720> hear<00:05:58.900> polar<00:05:59.170> opposites

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
these lenses you hear polar opposites

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.010 
these lenses you hear polar opposites
this<00:06:00.340> now<00:06:00.580> blocks<00:06:01.000> all<00:06:01.240> light<00:06:01.480> from<00:06:01.690> coming

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
this now blocks all light from coming

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.390 
this now blocks all light from coming
through<00:06:02.050> I'm<00:06:02.470> going<00:06:02.590> to<00:06:02.650> stand<00:06:02.860> up<00:06:02.980> and<00:06:03.100> go<00:06:03.250> to

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.330 

light<00:06:10.780> passes<00:06:11.230> through<00:06:11.440> both<00:06:11.500> of<00:06:11.710> these<00:06:12.010> now

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.340 
light passes through both of these now

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.910 
light passes through both of these now

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:14.920 
as I bring them together they still do

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.400 
as I bring them together they still do
as<00:06:15.280> I<00:06:15.430> rotate<00:06:15.880> them<00:06:16.060> when<00:06:16.510> we<00:06:16.750> block<00:06:16.930> my<00:06:17.170> hand

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.410 
as I rotate them when we block my hand

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.800 
as I rotate them when we block my hand
at<00:06:18.010> 45<00:06:18.610> degree<00:06:18.910> angles<00:06:19.330> they<00:06:19.480> are<00:06:19.630> now

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:24.850 
you can test whether your lenses are

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.170 
you can test whether your lenses are
polarized<00:06:24.880> or<00:06:25.720> not<00:06:26.040> thank<00:06:27.040> you<00:06:27.130> very<00:06:27.340> much<00:06:27.610> all
