the<00:01:58.799> attacking<00:01:59.189> midfielder<00:01:59.759> so<00:01:59.909> I<00:01:59.939> if<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.390> could

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
the attacking midfielder so I if I could

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.149 
the attacking midfielder so I if I could
have<00:02:00.600> played<00:02:00.689> this<00:02:00.899> one<00:02:01.079> here<00:02:01.200> for<00:02:01.439> 12<00:02:01.680> 12<00:02:02.130> I

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
have played this one here for 12 12 I

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.679 
have played this one here for 12 12 I
would've<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.850> would<00:02:02.969> have<00:02:03.060> been<00:02:03.119> perfect

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
would've that would have been perfect

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.090 
would've that would have been perfect
because<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:03.869> have<00:02:03.990> an<00:02:04.079> attacking<00:02:04.409> defensive

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
because I have an attacking defensive

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.830 
because I have an attacking defensive
but<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.610> don't<00:02:05.820> really<00:02:06.090> because<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.600> their<00:02:06.810> own

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840
