00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 Today we are behind today on cross country and 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.670
 we are back in minecraft in this 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.130
 I am going to show you how to create a 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.510
 Obvious bow this noticed that has 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.280
 called attention to this whole subject of 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.500
 the curiosities previously with the 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.870
 video of the open chests how to leave 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.190
 an open chest this note that calls them 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.960
 the whole attention this issue of the 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.760
 curiosities and I said well I'm going to 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.949
 show another one that I have here that 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.800
 they had never been shown to be how 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.840
 create a bow bent the buggy arch this one 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.510
 we only occupy this command that 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.730
 we have here we give this command 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.920
 and as you can see it gives us a buggy arch 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.420
 This way, it does not work like 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.390
 any bow this one only 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.790
 likewise this one we charge we shoot is 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.010
 everything he does is like any bow 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.170
 ordinary and the only thing that changes is 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.910
 which has the different texture and is that 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.280
 as you can notice the texture changes and 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.530
 appears with a bow already loaded as not 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.590
 loaded almost to the top is equally if 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.870
 we put on five cds of the 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.309
 arrow there like that thing is loaded 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.260
 that looks pretty better seems like a 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.390
 kind of cross bobo does not look pretty 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.830
 more but this also I tell them to me 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.700
 liked more as it looks likewise here in 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.439
 him in feed 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.200
 pretty good how the arrow looks and 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.170
 charged and I tell them it works exactly 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.119
 just like any arch thing that is of 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.520
 It is not expected either that I am 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.320
 advance fire and that is going to launch is that 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.539
 I know a lot of bullshit at the same time 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.460
 I will be and only tell them 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:26.100
 we occupy this command that we have for 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.200
 here that we use the command gif this 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.549
 we put our name in this case then 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.439
 I put even in mx 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.240
 in your case you just put your 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.610
 name with capital letters and all good 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.709
 obviously we put the bow and only 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.319
 we are going to put this feature that 

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:42.240
 it is the unbreakable one not in one because 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:45.119
 because it's activated it's not like putting on 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.799
 or put on or put it on if it's 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.299
 here we only put the one and already 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.090
 It will seem like it is unbreakable 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.459
 and it's going to look for its texture of this 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.720
 way which will remain this way 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:56.579
 not as you can see it says it's 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.099
 unbreakable because we just finished 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.349
 activate the moments here this one if you 

00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:03.979
 we remove the unbreakable let's put 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:03.979
 here a zero 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.020
 we are as you can see right now 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.820
 it seems with nothing not what it does here 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.040
 only if we put it back one 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.900
 will appear with the east bow with the 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.490
 arrow better said there we are 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.900
 ok before I finish I want to show you 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.940
 another little trick they have for 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.680
 there I did not know when to show them 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.420
 this good as this video is something short 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.490
 I wanted to add it here so as not to 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.350
 do it so short and add something new 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.300
 this here as you can see we are in a 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.640
 we're going to summon a few zombies 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.070
 in this way about three four we are 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.950
 and now we are diagonally game 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.630
 survival and they will notice that this boat 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.110
 it works as a kind of barrier 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.060
 anti anti zombies this one they already knew 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.700
 a few days that showed you a bug 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.920
 anti to my god is hitting me not me 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.480
 hit the truth we are we are states 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.580
 as you can see here no longer 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.470
 absolutely nothing you just have to 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.690
 like looking for your distance 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.459
 once you find this distance and 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.900
 zombies do not move as you can see 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.060
 they are stupid and do not deserve 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.490
 absolutely nothing obviously if I 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.500
 direct drive to them there yes that I 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.360
 they are going to hit but if I took the turn 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.220
 therefore no longer absolutely nothing and 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.430
 also if I stay stopped 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.080
 absolutely nothing we are not going to approach 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.230
 here to see if these zombies are already 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.150
 they approach zombies solís solís or not you 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.830
 break bar west club or detour I thought 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.210
 that was going to break the ship this 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.590
 as you can see the zombies do not even 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.780
 I peel I do not know, they do not even pay attention to me 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.220
 only this but I think it is right now already 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.780
 it's going to stop 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.660
 for something stupid and went on the other hand 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.490
 because it serves for there 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.550
 as I have no idea but how can you see 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.470
 look at these and see this not 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.080
 they make me absolutely nothing I do not know by 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.420
 what are you seeing and down 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.950
 They are alive but well I think this is 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.020
 practically everything I most wanted 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.280
 show them something extra since the video is 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.990
 It makes me a bit short and I wanted to 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.730
 show them something useful I already know that this 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.230
 It can serve a lot already since it 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.300
 good if they are following you somewhere 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.460
 Well, if you have a boat at hand, this will 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.020
 can save life not this but good 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.360
 this is practically everything so 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.470
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.470
 until next time
