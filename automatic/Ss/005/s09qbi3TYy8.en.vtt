do with their getting enough straighten

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.250 
do with their getting enough straighten
and<00:00:14.730> hopefully<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:15.690> know<00:00:15.780> this<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.170> way

and hopefully you know this is the way
it<00:00:16.379> goes<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.619> if<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.010> future<00:00:17.310> this<00:00:17.400> is<00:00:17.460> what

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
it goes and if the future this is what

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.230 
it goes and if the future this is what
we<00:00:17.789> want<00:00:18.289> it's<00:00:19.289> normal<00:00:19.710> here<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.580> air<00:00:20.850> or<00:00:21.029> try

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
things great I certainly do because I

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.260 
things great I certainly do because I
think<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:59.520> certainly<00:00:59.910> can't<00:01:00.149> be<00:01:00.210> a

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
think that it certainly can't be a

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.790 
think that it certainly can't be a
decision<00:01:00.660> because<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.079> about<00:01:01.530> football

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
decision because of about football

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.340 
decision because of about football
because<00:01:02.460> mark<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.850> done<00:01:03.090> done<00:01:03.930> everything

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
because mark is done done everything

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.960 
because mark is done done everything
connect<00:01:04.680> with<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.920> football<00:01:05.100> team<00:01:05.460> he's

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
connect with a football team he's

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.940 
connect with a football team he's
prepared<00:01:06.360> them<00:01:06.510> right<00:01:06.689> he's<00:01:07.409> got<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.710> men<00:01:07.830> in

prepared them right he's got the men in

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.070 
prepared them right he's got the men in
the<00:01:08.010> Premier<00:01:08.340> League<00:01:08.479> he's<00:01:09.479> got<00:01:09.689> them<00:01:09.810> really

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
the Premier League he's got them really

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.590 
the Premier League he's got them really
competitive<00:01:10.760> he's<00:01:11.760> got<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.939> stadium<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.540> I

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
competitive he's got a stadium and I

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.969 
competitive he's got a stadium and I
crowd<00:01:12.810> which<00:01:12.990> are<00:01:13.140> right<00:01:13.260> behind<00:01:13.470> him<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
crowd which are right behind him in the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.999 
crowd which are right behind him in the
team<00:01:14.659> and<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:15.780> think<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.140> what<00:01:16.290> any<00:01:16.530> manager

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
team and I think that what any manager

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.469 
team and I think that what any manager
wants<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.310> do<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.460> continually<00:01:17.939> improve<00:01:18.299> that

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
wants to do is continually improve that

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.960 
wants to do is continually improve that
and<00:01:18.689> he<00:01:18.960> recognizes<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.710> if<00:01:20.400> he<00:01:20.610> doesn't

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
and he recognizes that if he doesn't

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.820 
and he recognizes that if he doesn't
continue<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.689> improve<00:01:21.930> cardiff<00:01:22.409> city<00:01:22.650> then

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
continue to improve cardiff city then

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.230 
continue to improve cardiff city then
you<00:01:22.979> know<00:01:23.070> he<00:01:23.159> could<00:01:23.310> find<00:01:23.520> himself<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:24.060> it

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
you know he could find himself that it

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.080 
you know he could find himself that it
could<00:01:24.570> be<00:01:24.600> tough<00:01:25.580> so<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.610> don't<00:01:26.790> know<00:01:26.850> what<00:01:27.000> goes

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
could be tough so I don't know what goes

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.429 
could be tough so I don't know what goes
on<00:01:27.210> behind<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.570> scenes<00:01:27.810> there<00:01:27.960> but<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.140> could

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
on behind the scenes there but I could

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.410 
on behind the scenes there but I could
tell<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.740> as<00:01:28.829> if<00:01:29.220> it's<00:01:29.400> nothing<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.180> do<00:01:30.270> with

certainly<00:01:53.009> do<00:01:53.250> as<00:01:53.369> well<00:01:53.520> we<00:01:53.790> ask<00:01:54.000> that

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
certainly do as well we ask that

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.789 
certainly do as well we ask that
question<00:01:54.600> every<00:01:54.840> year<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.140> went<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.409> break<00:01:55.590> and

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
question every year it went a break and

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.760 
question every year it went a break and
I<00:01:56.159> don't<00:01:56.670> really<00:01:57.030> know<00:01:57.180> how<00:01:57.450> much<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.619> matters

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
I don't really know how much it matters

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.609 
I don't really know how much it matters
now<00:01:59.189> because<00:01:59.579> we<00:01:59.729> give<00:02:00.149> an<00:02:00.270> answer<00:02:00.619> I've

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
now because we give an answer I've

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.959 
now because we give an answer I've
always<00:02:01.890> thought<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.430> first<00:02:02.610> week<00:02:02.790> after

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
always thought that the first week after

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.730 
always thought that the first week after
Jan<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.540> at<00:02:03.659> least<00:02:03.840> off<00:02:04.049> for<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.320> players<00:02:04.710> and

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
Jan you at least off for the players and

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.170 
Jan you at least off for the players and
maybe<00:02:05.040> we<00:02:05.189> could<00:02:05.340> start<00:02:05.549> by<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.790> following

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
maybe we could start by the following

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.880 
maybe we could start by the following
week<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.630> think<00:02:06.990> by<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.110> time<00:02:07.259> you<00:02:07.590> know<00:02:07.619> what

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
week I think by that time you know what

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.949 
week I think by that time you know what
people<00:02:08.190> have<00:02:08.280> been<00:02:08.310> out<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:09.420> Christmas<00:02:09.780> games

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
people have been out the Christmas games

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.240 
people have been out the Christmas games
are<00:02:10.140> traditional<00:02:10.590> over<00:02:10.770> here<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:10.979> think<00:02:11.069> it'd

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
are traditional over here I think it'd

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.010 
are traditional over here I think it'd
be<00:02:11.340> very<00:02:11.370> difficult<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:12.030> change<00:02:12.239> that

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
be very difficult to change that

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.580 
be very difficult to change that
I<00:02:13.080> think<00:02:13.410> as<00:02:14.100> parents<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.880> their<00:02:15.350> people<00:02:16.350> who

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
I think as parents and their people who

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.290 
I think as parents and their people who
have<00:02:16.680> farmers<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.490> I<00:02:17.520> think<00:02:17.730> we<00:02:17.820> would<00:02:18.120> like

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
have farmers and I think we would like

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.970 
have farmers and I think we would like
to<00:02:18.330> be<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.570> home<00:02:18.720> at<00:02:18.810> Christmas<00:02:19.140> but<00:02:19.170> you've

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
to be a home at Christmas but you've

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.260 
to be a home at Christmas but you've
been<00:02:20.010> involved<00:02:20.370> in<00:02:20.550> football<00:02:20.730> you<00:02:20.940> know<00:02:21.060> that

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
been involved in football you know that

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.240 
been involved in football you know that
you<00:02:21.360> have<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:21.630> work<00:02:21.780> at<00:02:21.930> Christmastime<00:02:22.470> I<00:02:22.680> do

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
you have to work at Christmastime I do

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.980 
you have to work at Christmastime I do
think<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:23.670> week<00:02:23.940> off<00:02:24.060> after<00:02:24.300> Joe<00:02:24.630> knew<00:02:24.690> it

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
think that week off after Joe knew it

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.260 
think that week off after Joe knew it
would<00:02:25.560> be<00:02:25.680> good<00:02:25.830> for<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.130> players<00:02:26.460> and<00:02:26.490> and<00:02:26.820> I

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
would be good for the players and and I

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.940

Bolton<00:03:34.320> and<00:03:34.440> I<00:03:35.340> think<00:03:36.300> when<00:03:36.480> Sam's<00:03:36.810> team<00:03:37.080> went

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
Bolton and I think when Sam's team went

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.900 
Bolton and I think when Sam's team went
up<00:03:37.350> i<00:03:37.470> think<00:03:37.500> that<00:03:37.800> bought<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.070> team<00:03:38.400> Sam<00:03:38.700> had

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
up i think that bought the team Sam had

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.970 
up i think that bought the team Sam had
went<00:03:39.120> on<00:03:39.240> he<00:03:39.360> be<00:03:39.480> in<00:03:39.600> Europe<00:03:40.020> I<00:03:40.230> think<00:03:40.890> the

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
went on he be in Europe I think the

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.680 
went on he be in Europe I think the
probably<00:03:41.400> had<00:03:41.520> something<00:03:41.730> like<00:03:41.880> 10<00:03:42.209> years<00:03:42.540> in

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
probably had something like 10 years in

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.180 
probably had something like 10 years in
the<00:03:42.750> Premier<00:03:43.170> League<00:03:43.200> it<00:03:43.500> was<00:03:43.560> an<00:03:43.680> incredible

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
the Premier League it was an incredible

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.970 
the Premier League it was an incredible
greca<00:03:44.400> in<00:03:44.640> fact<00:03:45.000> that<00:03:45.209> that<00:03:45.480> year<00:03:45.810> film<00:03:46.650> went

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
greca in fact that that year film went

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.490 
greca in fact that that year film went
up<00:03:47.130> bought<00:03:47.730> went<00:03:48.030> up<00:03:48.150> black<00:03:48.480> bun<00:03:48.690> went<00:03:48.870> up<00:03:48.959> and

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
up bought went up black bun went up and

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.780 
up bought went up black bun went up and
I<00:03:49.590> think<00:03:49.800> all<00:03:49.950> those<00:03:50.130> team<00:03:50.400> stayed<00:03:50.640> in<00:03:50.730> the

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
I think all those team stayed in the

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.970 
I think all those team stayed in the
Premier<00:03:51.120> League<00:03:51.150> for<00:03:51.360> nearly<00:03:51.510> 10<00:03:51.780> years<00:03:51.810> so<00:03:52.230> it

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
Premier League for nearly 10 years so it

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.710 
Premier League for nearly 10 years so it
just<00:03:53.220> give<00:03:53.370> you<00:03:53.490> an<00:03:53.580> idea<00:03:53.700> that<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.240> quality

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
just give you an idea that the quality

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.120 
just give you an idea that the quality
of<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.840> championship<00:03:55.410> at<00:03:55.530> that<00:03:55.650> timing<00:03:55.950> the

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
of the championship at that timing the

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.699 
of the championship at that timing the
teams<00:03:56.340> with<00:03:56.520> a<00:03:56.550> hard<00:03:56.760> and<00:03:57.360> also<00:03:57.600> I<00:03:58.470> think

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
teams with a hard and also I think

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.260 
teams with a hard and also I think

big son was a manager to Bolton so there

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.360 
big son was a manager to Bolton so there
