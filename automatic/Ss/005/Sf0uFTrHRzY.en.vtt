niglet<00:01:18.630> broken<00:01:18.930> tech<00:01:19.110> was<00:01:19.320> like<00:01:19.409> if<00:01:19.500> it's<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.650> 21

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
niglet broken tech was like if it's a 21

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.910 
niglet broken tech was like if it's a 21
it<00:01:20.430> makes<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.729> huge<00:01:20.970> difference<00:01:21.659> at<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.439> 20<00:01:22.770> or
