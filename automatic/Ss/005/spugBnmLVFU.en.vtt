from<00:02:10.269> from<00:02:11.410> over<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.500> years<00:02:12.650> I've<00:02:12.799> found

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
from from over the years I've found

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.990 
from from over the years I've found
myself<00:02:13.780> and<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.840> lot<00:02:15.019> of<00:02:15.110> different<00:02:15.440> Seidman

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
myself and a lot of different Seidman

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.930 
myself and a lot of different Seidman
gigs<00:02:17.000> were<00:02:17.959> I<00:02:18.349> was<00:02:18.829> the<00:02:18.950> only<00:02:19.129> choral

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
gigs were I was the only choral

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.490 
gigs were I was the only choral
instrument<00:02:20.450> in<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.780> group<00:02:20.989> and<00:02:21.290> therefore

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
instrument in the group and therefore

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.150 
instrument in the group and therefore
had<00:02:21.769> to<00:02:22.269> provide<00:02:23.269> all<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.950> sort<00:02:24.950> of<00:02:25.010> harmonic

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
had to provide all the sort of harmonic

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.979 
had to provide all the sort of harmonic
information<00:02:28.160> on<00:02:28.310> harmonic<00:02:28.700> activity<00:02:29.239> in<00:02:29.420> that

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
information on harmonic activity in that

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.650 
information on harmonic activity in that
group<00:02:30.200> and<00:02:30.410> and<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:31.069> I<00:02:31.970> found<00:02:32.599> myself<00:02:32.810> very

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
group and and and I found myself very

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.420 
group and and and I found myself very
frustrated<00:02:35.660> with<00:02:36.079> with<00:02:36.500> my<00:02:36.650> ability<00:02:37.099> to<00:02:37.250> do

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
frustrated with with my ability to do

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.819 
frustrated with with my ability to do
that<00:02:37.579> and<00:02:37.849> and<00:02:38.630> I<00:02:38.780> had<00:02:38.989> a<00:02:39.019> hard<00:02:39.290> time<00:02:39.349> viewing

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
that and and I had a hard time viewing

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.270 
that and and I had a hard time viewing
how<00:02:40.010> to<00:02:40.069> really<00:02:40.430> do<00:02:40.639> that<00:02:40.790> on<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.060> guitar<00:02:41.389> and

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
how to really do that on the guitar and

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.789 
how to really do that on the guitar and
and<00:02:43.480> so<00:02:44.480> from<00:02:44.780> from<00:02:45.049> spending<00:02:45.380> a<00:02:45.530> lot<00:02:45.650> of<00:02:45.680> time

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
and so from from spending a lot of time

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.750 
and so from from spending a lot of time
on<00:02:46.069> this<00:02:46.190> and<00:02:46.400> then<00:02:46.519> practicing<00:02:47.030> it<00:02:47.739> I<00:02:48.760> found

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
on this and then practicing it I found

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.789 
on this and then practicing it I found
certain<00:02:50.209> certain<00:02:51.079> ways<00:02:51.200> of<00:02:51.349> practicing<00:02:51.470> it

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
certain certain ways of practicing it

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:54.129 
certain certain ways of practicing it
that<00:02:52.190> I<00:02:52.220> think<00:02:52.310> can<00:02:52.579> be<00:02:52.609> really<00:02:52.730> helpful<00:02:53.150> to

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:54.139 
that I think can be really helpful to

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:58.569 
that I think can be really helpful to
you<00:02:54.290> and<00:02:55.160> I<00:02:55.669> can<00:02:55.880> really<00:02:57.459> expand<00:02:58.459> your

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
you and I can really expand your

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.199 
you and I can really expand your
horizons<00:02:59.120> as<00:02:59.329> as<00:03:00.200> far<00:03:00.500> as<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:01.579> sort<00:03:02.180> of

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
horizons as as far as the sort of

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.240 
horizons as as far as the sort of
harmonic<00:03:02.630> palette<00:03:03.019> that<00:03:03.260> you<00:03:03.530> have<00:03:04.069> in<00:03:04.160> your

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
harmonic palette that you have in your

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.319 
harmonic palette that you have in your
playing<00:03:04.549> and<00:03:04.880> and<00:03:05.419> the<00:03:05.599> kind<00:03:06.139> of<00:03:06.230> sort<00:03:07.069> of

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
playing and and the kind of sort of

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.530 
playing and and the kind of sort of
sensitivity<00:03:08.329> to<00:03:08.750> to<00:03:09.109> how<00:03:09.290> to<00:03:09.349> best<00:03:10.209> be<00:03:11.209> a<00:03:11.239> part

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
sensitivity to to how to best be a part

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.339 
sensitivity to to how to best be a part
of<00:03:11.660> a<00:03:12.019> situation<00:03:12.260> whether<00:03:12.709> it's<00:03:12.980> a<00:03:13.040> group

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
of a situation whether it's a group

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:16.710 
of a situation whether it's a group
group<00:03:15.349> sound<00:03:15.650> or<00:03:15.919> you're<00:03:16.280> trying<00:03:16.609> to

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
group sound or you're trying to

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.629 
group sound or you're trying to
accompany<00:03:17.720> someone<00:03:17.959> solo<00:03:18.530> they're<00:03:19.190> sort<00:03:19.579> of

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:19.639 
accompany someone solo they're sort of

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:21.309 
accompany someone solo they're sort of
two<00:03:19.849> two<00:03:20.299> different<00:03:20.450> ways<00:03:20.750> I<00:03:20.900> go<00:03:21.079> about<00:03:21.260> doing

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
two two different ways I go about doing

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.559 
two two different ways I go about doing
this<00:03:21.769> and<00:03:22.069> the<00:03:23.200> one<00:03:24.200> part<00:03:24.470> is<00:03:24.620> more<00:03:25.280> about

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
this and the one part is more about

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.720 
this and the one part is more about
expanding<00:03:26.569> the<00:03:26.689> actual<00:03:27.129> harmonic<00:03:28.129> I<00:03:28.340> mean<00:03:28.610> the

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
expanding the actual harmonic I mean the

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.370 
expanding the actual harmonic I mean the
quarter<00:03:29.000> of<00:03:29.090> vocabulary<00:03:29.390> that<00:03:29.870> you

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
quarter of vocabulary that you

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.520 
quarter of vocabulary that you
have<00:03:30.760> and<00:03:31.760> finding<00:03:32.180> a<00:03:32.240> good<00:03:32.960> way<00:03:33.110> of<00:03:33.140> doing

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
have and finding a good way of doing

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.180 
have and finding a good way of doing
that<00:03:33.650> that's<00:03:34.000> you<00:03:35.000> know<00:03:35.590> that<00:03:36.590> can<00:03:36.800> sort<00:03:37.160> of<00:03:37.250> be

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
that that's you know that can sort of be

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.290 
that that's you know that can sort of be
that<00:03:40.190> you<00:03:40.280> can<00:03:40.430> incorporate<00:03:40.670> in<00:03:41.000> your<00:03:41.150> own

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
that you can incorporate in your own

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.050 
that you can incorporate in your own
playing<00:03:41.630> pretty<00:03:42.410> much<00:03:42.590> right<00:03:42.800> away<00:03:42.950> and<00:03:43.370> have

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
playing pretty much right away and have

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.430 
playing pretty much right away and have
it<00:03:45.100> be<00:03:46.100> a<00:03:46.130> part<00:03:46.430> of<00:03:46.490> your<00:03:47.080> your<00:03:48.080> your<00:03:48.110> own

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
it be a part of your your your own

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.440 
it be a part of your your your own
playing<00:03:48.710> in<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:49.010> natural<00:03:49.370> way<00:03:49.550> the<00:03:50.330> other

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
playing in the natural way the other

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.710 
playing in the natural way the other
part<00:03:50.720> is<00:03:51.020> more<00:03:51.710> dealing<00:03:52.520> with<00:03:52.700> how<00:03:53.420> to<00:03:53.450> make

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
part is more dealing with how to make

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.200 
part is more dealing with how to make
the<00:03:53.960> harmony<00:03:54.260> move<00:03:54.440> how<00:03:54.620> to<00:03:54.680> make<00:03:54.920> how<00:03:55.910> to<00:03:55.970> make

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.210 
the harmony move how to make how to make

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.810 
the harmony move how to make how to make
the<00:03:56.480> think<00:03:56.960> of<00:03:57.110> harmony<00:03:57.470> as<00:03:57.590> not<00:03:58.040> these<00:03:58.340> you

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
the think of harmony as not these you
