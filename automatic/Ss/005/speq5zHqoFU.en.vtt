00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
and breaking because that is a problem

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.660 
and breaking because that is a problem
that<00:00:12.750> i<00:00:12.960> ran<00:00:13.230> across<00:00:13.380> this<00:00:13.920> week<00:00:14.690> um<00:00:16.609> I'm<00:00:17.609> a

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
that i ran across this week um I'm a

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.040 
that i ran across this week um I'm a
little<00:00:17.760> confused<00:00:18.330> because<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.779> don't<00:00:18.930> know

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
little confused because I don't know

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.240 
little confused because I don't know
exactly<00:00:19.560> what<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.890> difference<00:00:20.160> between

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
exactly what the difference between

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.540 
exactly what the difference between
breaking<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.320> shading<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.619> but<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.220> would<00:00:23.519> like

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
breaking and shading is but I would like

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.170 
breaking and shading is but I would like
to<00:00:24.029> think<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:25.099> shedding<00:00:26.099> is<00:00:26.340> when<00:00:26.699> your

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
to think that shedding is when your

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.919 
to think that shedding is when your
entire<00:00:27.750> strand<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:28.980> hair<00:00:29.279> comes<00:00:29.760> out<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.689> like

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
entire strand of hair comes out so like

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.139 
entire strand of hair comes out so like
if<00:00:31.230> you're<00:00:31.560> transitioning<00:00:31.920> like<00:00:32.309> me<00:00:32.520> looks

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
if you're transitioning like me looks

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.790 
if you're transitioning like me looks
like<00:00:33.270> you're<00:00:33.420> straight<00:00:33.660> hair<00:00:34.079> then<00:00:34.620> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
like you're straight hair then the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.889 
like you're straight hair then the
squiggles<00:00:35.250> from<00:00:35.670> your<00:00:35.820> new<00:00:35.969> growth<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.600> like

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
squiggles from your new growth and like

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.160 
squiggles from your new growth and like
that<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.530> an<00:00:37.680> entire<00:00:37.980> strand<00:00:38.309> of<00:00:38.430> hair<00:00:38.640> and

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
that is an entire strand of hair and

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.900 
that is an entire strand of hair and
then<00:00:40.170> breaking<00:00:40.530> would<00:00:40.950> be<00:00:41.100> more<00:00:41.370> along<00:00:41.879> the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
then breaking would be more along the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.660 
then breaking would be more along the
lines<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.420> little<00:00:42.960> choppy<00:00:43.320> bits<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.980> your<00:00:44.190> hair

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
lines of little choppy bits of your hair

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.940 
lines of little choppy bits of your hair
coming<00:00:45.420> out<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.640> what<00:00:47.640> I'm<00:00:47.940> experienced

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
experiencing now is an entire strand of

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.119 
experiencing now is an entire strand of
hair<00:00:52.590> coming<00:00:53.340> out<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:54.320> I<00:00:55.320> would<00:00:55.500> like<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.710> say

to keep these in for like two weeks but

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.940 
to keep these in for like two weeks but
um<00:01:23.450> my<00:01:24.450> hair<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.810> really<00:01:25.020> shading<00:01:25.530> y'all<00:01:25.710> and

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
um my hair is really shading y'all and

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.830 
um my hair is really shading y'all and
I'm<00:01:26.040> starting<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.400> get<00:01:26.549> worried<00:01:27.060> like<00:01:27.450> why<00:01:27.780> is

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
I'm starting to get worried like why is

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.780 
I'm starting to get worried like why is
my<00:01:27.960> hair<00:01:28.259> shedding<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:28.770> much<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.610> don't

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
my hair shedding so much and I don't

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.100 
my hair shedding so much and I don't
think<00:01:29.939> it's<00:01:30.150> because<00:01:30.299> our<00:01:30.479> over<00:01:30.869> style

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
think it's because our over style

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.240 
think it's because our over style
because<00:01:32.150> more<00:01:33.150> than<00:01:33.180> likely<00:01:33.329> i<00:01:33.990> don't<00:01:34.829> i<00:01:35.159> don't

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
because more than likely i don't i don't

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.380 
because more than likely i don't i don't
really<00:01:35.640> do<00:01:35.880> my<00:01:36.030> hair<00:01:36.270> as<00:01:36.600> often<00:01:37.700> if<00:01:38.700> maybe<00:01:39.270> I

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
really do my hair as often if maybe I

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.600 
really do my hair as often if maybe I
could<00:01:39.509> but<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.650> don't<00:01:40.799> want<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.159> do<00:01:41.250> my<00:01:41.369> hair<00:01:41.579> a

my hair live like you know like that
like<00:02:09.619> this<00:02:09.649> week<00:02:10.099> or<00:02:10.340> I<00:02:10.399> don't<00:02:11.120> really<00:02:11.450> do<00:02:11.629> much

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
like this week or I don't really do much

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.100 
like this week or I don't really do much
to<00:02:12.800> it<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.250> I<00:02:13.580> probably<00:02:13.819> probably<00:02:14.450> don't

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
to it and I probably probably don't

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.670 
to it and I probably probably don't
moisturize<00:02:15.860> it<00:02:16.190> as<00:02:16.430> much<00:02:16.640> as<00:02:16.670> I<00:02:16.879> could<00:02:16.940> um<00:02:17.840> I

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
moisturize it as much as I could um I

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.220 
moisturize it as much as I could um I
don't<00:02:18.800> know<00:02:19.040> if<00:02:19.220> that's<00:02:19.580> why<00:02:19.910> but<00:02:20.420> I've

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
don't know if that's why but I've

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.530 
don't know if that's why but I've
moisturize<00:02:22.190> it<00:02:22.220> more<00:02:22.849> than<00:02:23.090> I<00:02:23.209> don't

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
moisturize it more than I don't

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.229 
moisturize it more than I don't
moisturize<00:02:23.900> it<00:02:24.230> and<00:02:24.830> I<00:02:25.550> guess<00:02:25.760> I<00:02:25.849> just<00:02:25.880> need<00:02:26.180> to

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
moisturize it and I guess I just need to

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.910 
moisturize it and I guess I just need to
find<00:02:26.390> a<00:02:26.569> balance<00:02:26.780> because<00:02:27.440> my<00:02:27.590> hair<00:02:27.769> gets

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
find a balance because my hair gets

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.370 
find a balance because my hair gets
really<00:02:28.250> dry<00:02:28.459> it<00:02:28.819> soaks<00:02:29.180> up<00:02:29.390> moisture<00:02:29.870> like

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
really dry it soaks up moisture like

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
crazy my hair is very thirsty and I just

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.280 
crazy my hair is very thirsty and I just
need<00:02:34.970> to<00:02:35.060> find<00:02:35.209> the<00:02:35.360> balance<00:02:35.510> with<00:02:35.810> my<00:02:35.959> hair

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
need to find the balance with my hair

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.140 
need to find the balance with my hair
