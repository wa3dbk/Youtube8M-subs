doing dance competitions and dance

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.340 
doing dance competitions and dance
recitals<00:00:20.630> because<00:00:21.630> they<00:00:21.750> feel<00:00:21.990> like<00:00:22.020> they

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
recitals because they feel like they

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.740 
recitals because they feel like they
have<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.710> have<00:00:22.890> staged<00:00:23.670> type<00:00:24.000> makeup<00:00:24.449> and

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
have to have staged type makeup and

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.509 
have to have staged type makeup and
although<00:00:25.080> they<00:00:25.350> do<00:00:25.410> have<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:26.099> have<00:00:26.220> stage

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
although they do have to have stage

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.679 
although they do have to have stage
makeup<00:00:26.849> I<00:00:26.970> think<00:00:27.210> there's<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.480> lot<00:00:27.660> of

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
makeup I think there's a lot of

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.900 
makeup I think there's a lot of
different<00:00:28.170> tips<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.619> they<00:00:28.740> can<00:00:29.010> use<00:00:29.310> that

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
different tips that they can use that

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.880 
different tips that they can use that
maybe<00:00:30.449> can<00:00:30.929> keep<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.380> little<00:00:31.410> bit<00:00:31.740> more

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
maybe can keep it a little bit more

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.889 
maybe can keep it a little bit more
inexpensive<00:00:32.610> for<00:00:32.759> themselves<00:00:33.210> right<00:00:33.600> and

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
inexpensive for themselves right and

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.500 
inexpensive for themselves right and
impossibly<00:00:34.860> even<00:00:35.399> have<00:00:35.579> stuff<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:35.880> they<00:00:36.120> may

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
impossibly even have stuff that they may

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.940 
impossibly even have stuff that they may
already<00:00:36.660> have<00:00:36.840> in<00:00:37.079> their<00:00:37.230> own<00:00:37.350> makeup<00:00:37.620> bag

already have in their own makeup bag

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.630 
already have in their own makeup bag

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
yeah my biggest question when I think of

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.299 
yeah my biggest question when I think of
dance<00:00:42.329> competitions<00:00:42.899> for<00:00:43.050> kids<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.440> big

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
ila a because it's actually probably

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.310 
ila a because it's actually probably
easier<00:00:50.789> than<00:00:51.000> using<00:00:51.180> Clemson<00:00:51.719> Clemson<00:00:52.110> clips

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
easier than using Clemson Clemson clips

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.260 
easier than using Clemson Clemson clips
of<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.590> scare<00:00:52.920> oh<00:00:53.100> yeah<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:53.699> we're<00:00:54.059> going<00:00:54.180> to
