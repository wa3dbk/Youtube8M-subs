an<00:01:37.100> issue<00:01:37.219> in<00:01:37.369> pendant<00:01:37.819> stones<00:01:38.149> on<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:38.810> other

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
an issue in pendant stones on the other

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.260 
an issue in pendant stones on the other
films<00:01:39.350> I<00:01:39.619> think<00:01:40.069> you<00:01:40.729> know<00:01:40.819> it<00:01:40.850> may<00:01:41.149> have

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:49.080 
films I think you know it may have
gotten<00:01:41.450> in<00:01:41.600> a<00:01:41.659> way<00:01:41.780> of<00:01:41.899> the<00:01:41.959> storytelling<00:01:44.229> oh
