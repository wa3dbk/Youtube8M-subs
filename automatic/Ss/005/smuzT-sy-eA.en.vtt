00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
now I'm kidding but I really like this

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.330 
now I'm kidding but I really like this
map<00:00:09.960> and<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.200> tend<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.469> do<00:00:10.590> very<00:00:10.830> well<00:00:10.920> on<00:00:11.099> this

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
map and I tend to do very well on this

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.690 
map and I tend to do very well on this
map<00:00:11.580> so<00:00:11.780> that's<00:00:12.780> why<00:00:13.049> I'm<00:00:13.290> posting<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.160> lot<00:00:14.309> of<00:00:14.370> a

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
map so that's why I'm posting a lot of a

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.939 
map so that's why I'm posting a lot of a
lot<00:00:14.880> of<00:00:14.910> terminal<00:00:15.389> gameplays<00:00:15.780> so<00:00:16.410> yesterday

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
lot of terminal gameplays so yesterday

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.150 
lot of terminal gameplays so yesterday
after<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.369> got<00:00:17.640> my<00:00:17.820> MK<00:00:18.240> 14<00:00:18.840> Moab<00:00:19.199> I<00:00:19.439> decided<00:00:19.920> I

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
after I got my MK 14 Moab I decided I

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.090 
after I got my MK 14 Moab I decided I
would<00:00:20.369> switch<00:00:20.609> up<00:00:20.789> my<00:00:20.820> MK<00:00:21.210> 14<00:00:21.660> class<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.320> stop

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
would switch up my MK 14 class and stop

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.500 
would switch up my MK 14 class and stop
using<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.519> on<00:00:23.640> terminal<00:00:24.029> which<00:00:24.150> for<00:00:24.359> some

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
using that on terminal which for some

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.300 
using that on terminal which for some
reason<00:00:24.539> comes<00:00:25.050> up<00:00:25.199> like<00:00:25.380> every<00:00:25.680> other<00:00:25.800> game<00:00:26.099> on

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
reason comes up like every other game on

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.160 
reason comes up like every other game on
modern<00:00:26.550> warfare<00:00:26.699> 3<00:00:26.880> they<00:00:27.840> said<00:00:28.019> something

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
modern warfare 3 they said something

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.470 
modern warfare 3 they said something
about<00:00:28.260> like<00:00:28.529> reducing<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.550> map<00:00:29.760> rotation<00:00:29.970> for

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
about like reducing the map rotation for

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.319 
about like reducing the map rotation for
terminal<00:00:30.900> but<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.500> honestly<00:00:32.430> there's<00:00:33.180> like<00:00:33.300> a

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
terminal but I honestly there's like a

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.990 
terminal but I honestly there's like a
50%<00:00:33.750> chance<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.739> map<00:00:34.950> that<00:00:35.579> comes<00:00:35.760> up

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
50% chance that the map that comes up

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.280 
50% chance that the map that comes up
will<00:00:36.149> be<00:00:36.270> terminal<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.809> everyone<00:00:37.140> obviously

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
will be terminal and everyone obviously

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.410 
will be terminal and everyone obviously
votes<00:00:37.829> for<00:00:38.040> terminal<00:00:38.370> because<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:38.850> amazing

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
votes for terminal because it is amazing

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.630 
votes for terminal because it is amazing
and<00:00:39.620> yeah<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:40.890> I've<00:00:40.980> been<00:00:41.010> playing<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.370> lot<00:00:41.579> of

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
and yeah so I've been playing a lot of

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.720 
and yeah so I've been playing a lot of
terminal<00:00:42.270> as<00:00:42.420> I've<00:00:42.960> probably<00:00:43.530> already<00:00:43.800> stated

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
terminal as I've probably already stated

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.000 
terminal as I've probably already stated
but<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.899> this<00:00:46.050> gameplay<00:00:46.530> was<00:00:46.739> pretty

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
but that this gameplay was pretty

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.740 
but that this gameplay was pretty
exciting<00:00:47.489> because<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:48.030> was<00:00:48.360> playing<00:00:48.539> against

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
exciting because I was playing against

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.060 
exciting because I was playing against
the<00:00:48.840> party<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.260> maybe<00:00:49.410> like<00:00:49.680> three<00:00:49.920> or<00:00:50.039> four

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
the party of maybe like three or four

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.459 
the party of maybe like three or four
people<00:00:50.430> you'll<00:00:50.760> notice<00:00:51.059> they<00:00:51.210> all<00:00:51.329> have<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.539> big

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
people you'll notice they all have a big

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.069 
people you'll notice they all have a big
capital<00:00:53.010> X<00:00:53.250> at<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.670> end<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.910> their<00:00:54.000> name<00:00:54.210> so

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
capital X at the end of their name so

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.360 
capital X at the end of their name so
there's<00:00:55.199> some<00:00:55.379> sort<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.590> clan<00:00:55.829> or<00:00:56.039> whatever<00:00:56.309> I

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
there's some sort of clan or whatever I

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.700 
there's some sort of clan or whatever I
don't<00:00:56.550> really<00:00:56.730> like<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:57.059> term<00:00:57.300> but<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:58.410> seems

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
don't really like that term but it seems

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.560 
don't really like that term but it seems
to<00:00:58.859> be<00:00:58.949> what<00:00:59.129> most<00:00:59.309> people<00:00:59.699> refer<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.090> these

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
to be what most people refer to these

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.590 
to be what most people refer to these
these<00:01:00.989> parties<00:01:01.440> as<00:01:01.649> but<00:01:02.250> yeah<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.359> I'm<00:01:03.449> playing

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
these parties as but yeah so I'm playing

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.420 
these parties as but yeah so I'm playing
against<00:01:03.960> three<00:01:04.140> or<00:01:04.229> four<00:01:04.409> people<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.949> they're

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
against three or four people and they're

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.050 
against three or four people and they're
going<00:01:05.700> for<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.970> win<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:07.049> played<00:01:07.619> like

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
going for the win and I played like

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.660 
going for the win and I played like
maybe<00:01:09.060> thirty<00:01:09.570> seconds<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.409> game<00:01:10.799> before

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
maybe thirty seconds of the game before

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.000 
maybe thirty seconds of the game before
this<00:01:11.850> or<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.540> lobby<00:01:12.720> before<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.530> my

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
this or in the lobby before this and my

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.149 
this or in the lobby before this and my
team<00:01:14.220> lost<00:01:14.400> like<00:01:14.869> 50<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.020> 200<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.799> decided

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
team lost like 50 to 200 so I decided

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.160 
team lost like 50 to 200 so I decided
I'd<00:01:17.340> actually<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:18.150> know<00:01:18.270> go<00:01:18.479> for<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.750> win

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
I'd actually you know go for a win

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.260 
I'd actually you know go for a win
so<00:01:19.830> I'm<00:01:19.950> actually<00:01:20.159> capturing<00:01:20.850> some<00:01:21.030> flags

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
so I'm actually capturing some flags

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.969 
so I'm actually capturing some flags
here<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.780> I'm<00:01:21.840> defending<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.350> flags<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.920> I'm

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
here and I'm defending the flags and I'm

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.350 
here and I'm defending the flags and I'm
getting<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.250> lot<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.430> kills<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.060> end<00:01:24.240> up

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
getting a lot of kills and I end up

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.600 
getting a lot of kills and I end up
getting<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.720> Moab<00:01:25.140> against<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.189> party

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
getting a Moab against this this party

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.870 
getting a Moab against this this party
and<00:01:26.790> that's<00:01:27.780> pretty<00:01:28.020> cool<00:01:28.229> I'm<00:01:28.409> using<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
and that's pretty cool I'm using the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.910 
and that's pretty cool I'm using the
scar<00:01:29.880> l<00:01:30.119> with<00:01:30.329> extended<00:01:30.810> mags<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.320> silencer

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
scar l with extended mags and silencer

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.999 
scar l with extended mags and silencer
and<00:01:32.150> usually<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.180> use<00:01:33.270> kick<00:01:33.720> but<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.320> figured<00:01:34.860> I'd

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
and usually I use kick but I figured I'd

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.580 
and usually I use kick but I figured I'd
use<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.579> extended<00:01:36.390> mags<00:01:36.630> silencer<00:01:37.140> combo

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
use the extended mags silencer combo

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.770 
use the extended mags silencer combo
because<00:01:38.369> once<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.790> get<00:01:38.939> specialist<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.540> get<00:01:39.689> all

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
because once I get specialist I get all

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.319 
because once I get specialist I get all
the<00:01:39.869> proficiencies<00:01:40.439> anyways<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:42.000> know

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329

compared to the MK 14 a scar without
kick<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.350> still<00:01:46.890> pretty<00:01:47.130> good<00:01:47.280> because<00:01:47.549> you

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
kick is still pretty good because you

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.940 
kick is still pretty good because you
know<00:01:48.329> not<00:01:48.720> not<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.110> biggest<00:01:49.350> fan<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.710> MK

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
know not not the biggest fan of the MK

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.280 
know not not the biggest fan of the MK
14<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.850> I'm<00:01:51.479> doing<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.780> lot<00:01:51.899> better<00:01:52.079> with

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
14 and and I'm doing a lot better with

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.380 
14 and and I'm doing a lot better with
this<00:01:52.470> I'm<00:01:53.220> using<00:01:53.340> stalker<00:01:53.820> pro<00:01:54.119> which<00:01:54.360> is

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
this I'm using stalker pro which is

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.300 
this I'm using stalker pro which is
something<00:01:54.689> I've<00:01:55.140> decided<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.770> use<00:01:56.009> I'm<00:01:56.189> like

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
something I've decided to use I'm like

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.490 
something I've decided to use I'm like
all<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.700> my<00:01:56.850> assault<00:01:57.149> rifle<00:01:57.450> classes<00:01:57.869> on<00:01:58.350> May

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
all of my assault rifle classes on May

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.740 
all of my assault rifle classes on May
SMGs<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.040> usually<00:01:59.460> tend<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.790> use<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.000> steady<00:02:00.600> aim

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
SMGs I usually tend to use a steady aim

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.139 
SMGs I usually tend to use a steady aim
because<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.140> helps<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.469> stop<00:02:02.280> more<00:02:02.700> quickly

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
because it helps you stop more quickly

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.350 
because it helps you stop more quickly
when<00:02:03.420> you're<00:02:03.570> running<00:02:03.750> around<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:04.200> lot<00:02:04.229> and

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
when you're running around a lot and

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.150 
when you're running around a lot and
on<00:02:05.600> my<00:02:06.050> assault<00:02:06.260> rifles<00:02:06.590> I<00:02:06.680> use<00:02:06.800> stalker

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
on my assault rifles I use stalker

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.330 
on my assault rifles I use stalker
because<00:02:07.430> it's<00:02:07.910> really<00:02:08.600> crazy<00:02:08.870> good<00:02:09.229> for<00:02:09.530> for

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
because it's really crazy good for for

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.890 
because it's really crazy good for for
strafing<00:02:10.760> and<00:02:10.880> dodging<00:02:11.270> bullets<00:02:11.390> you<00:02:11.660> can<00:02:11.810> go

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
strafing and dodging bullets you can go

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.540 
strafing and dodging bullets you can go
up<00:02:12.020> against<00:02:12.380> like<00:02:12.530> four<00:02:12.770> or<00:02:12.860> five<00:02:12.920> people<00:02:13.430> and

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
up against like four or five people and

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.960 
up against like four or five people and
just<00:02:13.760> strafe<00:02:14.540> your<00:02:14.720> way<00:02:15.010> away<00:02:16.010> from<00:02:16.250> them<00:02:16.610> away

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
just strafe your way away from them away

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.870 
just strafe your way away from them away
from<00:02:17.210> their<00:02:17.360> bullets<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:17.900> I<00:02:18.830> find<00:02:19.790> that

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
from their bullets and I find that

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.120 
from their bullets and I find that
really<00:02:20.000> helped<00:02:20.270> so<00:02:20.570> just<00:02:21.320> just<00:02:21.590> a<00:02:21.650> tip<00:02:21.890> there

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
really helped so just just a tip there

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.800 
really helped so just just a tip there
you<00:02:22.280> should<00:02:22.340> just<00:02:22.700> try<00:02:23.000> putting<00:02:23.180> stock<00:02:23.600> around

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
you should just try putting stock around

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.960 
you should just try putting stock around
you're<00:02:24.350> on<00:02:24.680> your<00:02:24.950> assault<00:02:25.190> rifle<00:02:25.250> classes<00:02:25.850> I

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
you're on your assault rifle classes I

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.230 
you're on your assault rifle classes I
find<00:02:26.390> it's<00:02:26.570> a<00:02:26.870> really<00:02:27.590> big<00:02:27.740> advantage<00:02:28.240> now

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
find it's a really big advantage now

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.310 
find it's a really big advantage now
another<00:02:29.510> thing<00:02:29.690> I<00:02:29.750> should<00:02:29.780> probably<00:02:30.080> address

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
another thing I should probably address

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.080 
another thing I should probably address

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
really good game but yeah for that to

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.550 
really good game but yeah for that to
work<00:03:08.270> you<00:03:08.510> have<00:03:08.570> to<00:03:08.660> get<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:08.900> right<00:03:09.050> map<00:03:09.260> you

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
work you have to get the right map you

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.840 
work you have to get the right map you
know<00:03:09.680> I<00:03:09.709> can't<00:03:10.190> really<00:03:10.280> do<00:03:10.489> that<00:03:10.640> unlike

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
know I can't really do that unlike

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.970 
know I can't really do that unlike
wasteland<00:03:11.450> so<00:03:12.080> that<00:03:12.440> would<00:03:12.530> be<00:03:12.620> kind<00:03:12.890> of

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
wasteland so that would be kind of

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.890 
wasteland so that would be kind of
difficult<00:03:13.190> so<00:03:13.970> I<00:03:14.000> have<00:03:14.300> to<00:03:14.420> get<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.600> right<00:03:14.750> map

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
difficult so I have to get the right map
