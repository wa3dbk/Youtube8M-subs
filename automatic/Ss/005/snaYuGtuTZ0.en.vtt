00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
supposed to go and it might say go ten

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.179 
supposed to go and it might say go ten
blocks<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.359> turn<00:00:24.480> left<00:00:24.769> and<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:25.859> go<00:00:25.980> ten

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
blocks and turn left and you go ten

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.279 
blocks and turn left and you go ten
blocks<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.609> turn<00:00:26.699> right

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
blocks and turn right

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.390 
blocks and turn right
well<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.410> doesn't<00:00:28.560> abandon<00:00:29.099> what<00:00:29.250> you're

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
well it doesn't abandon what you're

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.630 
well it doesn't abandon what you're
supposed<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.699> do<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.650> recalculates<00:00:31.650> what<00:00:32.520> you

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
supposed to do it recalculates what you

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.340 
supposed to do it recalculates what you
need<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.940> do<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.840> get<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.110> where<00:00:34.140> you're

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
need to do to get to where you're

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.440 
need to do to get to where you're
supposed<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.649> be<00:00:34.739> based<00:00:35.670> upon<00:00:36.000> where<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.329> are

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
supposed to be based upon where you are

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.940 
supposed to be based upon where you are
but<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.570> problem<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.230> we<00:00:40.379> keep<00:00:40.530> making<00:00:40.860> the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
but the problem is is we keep making the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.880 
but the problem is is we keep making the
wrong<00:00:41.129> turns<00:00:41.899> the<00:00:42.899> role<00:00:43.140> conditions<00:00:43.770> are

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
wrong turns the role conditions are

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.310 
wrong turns the role conditions are
going<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.129> be<00:00:44.190> different<00:00:44.930> and<00:00:45.930> we're<00:00:46.230> running

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
going to be different and we're running

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.920 
going to be different and we're running
out<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.590> time<00:00:47.210> the<00:00:48.210> road<00:00:48.420> conditions<00:00:48.840> are

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
out of time the road conditions are

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.420 
out of time the road conditions are
gonna<00:00:49.020> be<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> lot<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.469> rougher<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:49.950> we<00:00:50.070> have<00:00:50.250> to

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
gonna be a lot of rougher so we have to

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.170 
gonna be a lot of rougher so we have to
