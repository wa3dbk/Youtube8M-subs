00:00:01.119 --> 00:00:04.080
 but we will play so that I will explain to you how to put an end to embarrassment 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.480
 warns that a ping pong ball is really not that complicated 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.249
 it takes percent and pacs were there so 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:13.249
 in the format or is a bit like a sheet of A4 paper 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:17.050
 elected but first two fumigants she has a ping-pong ball 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.339
 pass 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.970
 we can pass but for 100 m it is not necessary that it is too in not for it 

00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:27.069
 either just as a result has brought very seriously it takes no title 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:29.890
 example what is expected of the gas in to smother the fire so that it 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.149
 make smoke 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:33.270
 and yesterday a pencil 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.740
 like that to do to get out of the gas 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.170
 so the euro starts 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.040
 why take 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.320
 informal to the sheet a4 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.740
 the aluminum paper 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.180
 a veil in public 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.680
 we agree and go to the ball in 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.940
 and lead some kind of wick with that but it's not there but I believe that 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:52.980
 Yes a bit 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.560
 so 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.190
 4 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.190
 we'll see after 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.900
 in that sense what is it 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.110
 normally 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.200
 arbitration thing like that 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.620
 Why 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.750
 in our Tunisian island 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.750
 and near paris then district of trieux 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.300
 like that vanessa the form 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.870
 in background 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.960
 why in this case 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.000
 once in the room 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 a pot and michaele like that 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.530
 afp 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:18.279
 and yes the thing so it can take a while 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.989
 first it works 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.679
 it works very well 

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:32.619
 for three prices a little high 

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:35.619
 it works very well 

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:37.969
 rochus but not very long mayor 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:40.969
 cl it gives good results 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.569
 the time to flee during part of his prey 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:45.359
 we will see again
