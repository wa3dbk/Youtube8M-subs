00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:03.600
 immediately we go with Angie Camacho instead of the facts directly to 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.840
 Colombia to see the situation is now not only at the airport but 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.090
 fundamentally the state of health of the wounded is a large number 131 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.540
 injured in the wake of this plane crash before the information stage 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.759
 welcome 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:18.830
 with the card just for you in pirate effect 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.350
 I want to tell you that they exercised Arctic and the camera confirms that it is not

 121 crew as originally indicated quinino 125 is playing 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.100
 bad roll 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.600
 pinillos vázquez would have traveled from the area says it is not viable accounted 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.670
 Mayor

 port ordaz continue efe 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.380
 health centers because their health condition is a little more complicated than the 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.660
 rest because they had to be operated on surgically 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.360
 some injuries to your face and your body and fruit is a little more complicated 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.290
 same as the minor who is in health until then because the 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.310
 fado site so be it recently the civil aeronautics came out two 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.240
 aircraft 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.740
 to which part of providence 1 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.940
 that was transporting medical help personnel that reaches here that 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.640
 remember that the island of san andrés does not have enough conditions in 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.820
 regarding care centers to attend to this number of people 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.410
 and all the aircraft came out with surgical help to care for people 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.100
 that are found 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.310
 The minister of transport has just left the room in San Andrés 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.940
 the director of civil aeronautics they said that this morning at 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:27.960
 six in the morning 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.799
 will not be possible mr ancares 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:31.850
 airport 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.270
 then note that on the track a little 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.509
 p ending it would have been the causes of the accident a little picking up the 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.790
 pieces of the plane and they say that this can serve as a clue a bit to 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.229
 determine when they do not trust definitively that lightning can fall 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.260
 although of course it is not fought 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.630
 allow me to be absolutely sure that there has not been another situation 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.510
 that caused percent 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.300
 the sinister matera 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.920
 It is impressive to see the photos of the plane and how it was divided into three parts 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.210
 We also know that the authorities have urged dozens of parliamentarians 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.460
 they sent nationals I want to ask you about the action plan of who apple tree 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.220
 just to conclude this investigation that you are starting now 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.360
 but also by the transfer of the wounded and the tension who is in charge 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.850
 there is a being 800 telephone working for this as all the 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.210
 issue of the reception of the so-called who so far who know the 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.120
 health status to the best of your family or friends antic target 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.560
 and target to kira kira kira airport although it will be closed for flights 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.500
 extradited commercial 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.319
 for military flights that is to say people will start 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.109
 in a few minutes to be moved from the island san andrés makes the capital 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:43.189
 Colombian of course, this way, do not have health complications. 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:44.459
 to get here to bogota 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.500
 there is already a commission of experts 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.600
 of the air force to be a little investigating the causes as I tell you the 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.999
 track at this time is closed because they are 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:57.699
 determining what could have happened there is a very large commission the doctor who 

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:01.599
 they went out to dry nurses is a person with the capacity to 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:02.659
 and pretended 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.379
 because remember that although not all this one hundred and twenty-one people 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:08.319
 find let's say that stable 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.849
 ip heredia the order that you have to do medically evaluated before 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.949
 leave the island of san andres also remember that there are six people in 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:19.569
 care centers with a little complication or little very much 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.479
 more serious and those people can not jump apple and moved to Bogota 

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:27.819
 unless the conditions are given then of course already the minister 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.419
 a very large commission went to Calle Pelai to begin the transfer of 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:35.199
 the injured to that the equity of Bogota together thing because here that as far as 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:38.569
 the conditions given to be able to intervene surgically with 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.699
 much more complexity than what can be done in the first leg will be in three 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:42.639
 parcels 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.909
 came the information we closely follow the facts we are also attentive to a 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:49.259
 new communication issued by the authorities with information or details 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:50.509
 about what happened
