00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.560 

the<00:00:13.010> fluid<00:00:13.370> dynamics<00:00:13.820> is<00:00:13.970> a<00:00:14.000> very<00:00:14.240> special

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
the fluid dynamics is a very special

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.380 
the fluid dynamics is a very special
feel<00:00:14.780> but<00:00:15.020> when<00:00:15.110> as<00:00:15.320> soon<00:00:15.470> as<00:00:15.590> you<00:00:15.680> introduce

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390 
feel but when as soon as you introduce

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.720 
feel but when as soon as you introduce
twisting<00:00:17.390> vortices<00:00:17.990> it<00:00:18.830> becomes<00:00:19.190> a<00:00:19.369> very

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
twisting vortices it becomes a very

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.760 
twisting vortices it becomes a very
complex<00:00:20.150> field<00:00:20.450> and<00:00:20.720> then<00:00:21.140> then<00:00:21.560> you've<00:00:21.680> got

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
complex field and then then you've got

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.170 
complex field and then then you've got
to<00:00:21.830> place<00:00:22.010> that<00:00:22.220> surfboard<00:00:22.640> at<00:00:22.730> so<00:00:23.000> many

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
to place that surfboard at so many

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.810 
to place that surfboard at so many
complex<00:00:23.570> angles<00:00:24.110> within<00:00:24.410> that<00:00:24.740> and<00:00:25.460> plus

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
complex angles within that and plus

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.460 
complex angles within that and plus
you're<00:00:26.000> using<00:00:26.210> power<00:00:26.630> generating<00:00:27.230> things

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
you're using power generating things

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.650 
you're using power generating things
along<00:00:27.980> with<00:00:28.160> it<00:00:28.340> so<00:00:28.820> here's<00:00:29.060> a<00:00:29.119> complicated

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
along with it so here's a complicated

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.120 
along with it so here's a complicated
field<00:00:29.930> and<00:00:30.199> that's<00:00:30.320> why<00:00:30.440> it's<00:00:30.619> fascinating

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
field and that's why it's fascinating

but the true designers can take take it

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.850 
but the true designers can take take it
some<00:01:02.030> new<00:01:02.180> elements<00:01:02.660> and<00:01:02.870> put<00:01:03.200> it<00:01:03.320> into<00:01:03.710> the

some new elements and put it into the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.770 
some new elements and put it into the

wave some new out into a surfboard into
a<00:01:05.810> life<00:01:06.080> and<00:01:06.530> that's<00:01:06.800> that's<00:01:07.580> where<00:01:07.759> the<00:01:07.850> true

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
a life and that's that's where the true

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.770 
a life and that's that's where the true
bunny's<00:01:09.340> your<00:01:10.340> control<00:01:10.640> surfaces<00:01:11.210> in<00:01:11.630> a

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289 
surfboard not between your feet so you

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.150 
surfboard not between your feet so you
can't<00:01:16.100> put<00:01:16.670> pressure<00:01:16.970> in<00:01:17.750> front<00:01:17.929> of<00:01:18.140> your<00:01:19.009> foot

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
can't put pressure in front of your foot

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.590 
can't put pressure in front of your foot
if<00:01:19.280> it's<00:01:19.429> not<00:01:19.520> very<00:01:19.789> pressured<00:01:20.179> be<00:01:20.390> how<00:01:20.479> much

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
if it's not very pressured be how much

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.960 
if it's not very pressured be how much
your<00:01:20.750> foot<00:01:20.899> it's<00:01:21.080> between<00:01:21.259> your<00:01:21.619> feet<00:01:21.970> so

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
your foot it's between your feet so

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.020 
your foot it's between your feet so
that's<00:01:23.630> where<00:01:23.990> you<00:01:24.440> have<00:01:24.590> to<00:01:24.619> have<00:01:24.890> your<00:01:25.340> speed

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
that's where you have to have your speed

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.859 
that's where you have to have your speed
zone<00:01:26.300> and<00:01:27.310> your<00:01:28.310> control<00:01:28.819> all<00:01:29.179> built<00:01:29.539> in<00:01:29.690> that

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
zone and your control all built in that

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.969 
zone and your control all built in that
one<00:01:30.440> focused<00:01:30.979> area<00:01:31.599> so<00:01:32.599> and<00:01:33.170> your<00:01:33.530> back<00:01:33.709> foot

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
one focused area so and your back foot

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.730 
one focused area so and your back foot
is<00:01:34.700> actually<00:01:35.240> on<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:35.810> most<00:01:36.020> powerful<00:01:36.470> part<00:01:36.679> of

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
is actually on the most powerful part of

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.240 
is actually on the most powerful part of
your<00:01:36.860> board<00:01:37.039> and<00:01:37.630> it<00:01:38.630> should<00:01:38.899> be<00:01:38.990> in<00:01:39.110> every

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
your board and it should be in every

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.029 
your board and it should be in every
every<00:01:40.250> world<00:01:40.490> as<00:01:40.670> on<00:01:40.819> surf<00:01:41.119> board<00:01:41.800> so<00:01:42.800> that's

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
every world as on surf board so that's

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:45.630 
every world as on surf board so that's
where<00:01:43.250> you<00:01:43.459> you<00:01:43.940> build<00:01:44.209> your<00:01:44.630> Stratos<00:01:45.080> rocker

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
where you you build your Stratos rocker

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.580 
where you you build your Stratos rocker
can<00:01:46.640> you<00:01:46.700> generates<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.179> most<00:01:47.330> bit<00:01:47.599> it's

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
can you generates the most bit it's

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.219 
can you generates the most bit it's
where<00:01:48.740> you<00:01:48.860> put<00:01:49.160> your<00:01:49.280> double<00:01:49.520> concave<00:01:50.229> or

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
where you put your double concave or

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.800 
where you put your double concave or
single<00:01:51.740> concave<00:01:51.950> it<00:01:52.610> definitely<00:01:53.090> doubles<00:01:53.420> and

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
single concave it definitely doubles and

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.389 
single concave it definitely doubles and
they<00:01:53.959> that<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:54.500> deepest<00:01:54.860> point<00:01:55.009> under<00:01:55.280> your

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
they that the deepest point under your

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.779 
they that the deepest point under your
back<00:01:55.520> foot<00:01:55.789> so<00:01:56.500> those<00:01:57.500> two<00:01:57.709> elements<00:01:58.099> build

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
back foot so those two elements build

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.979 
back foot so those two elements build
the<00:01:59.569> build<00:01:59.750> you<00:01:59.869> lift<00:02:00.110> off<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:00.860> wave<00:02:01.039> and<00:02:01.989> they

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:02.989 
the build you lift off the wave and they

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:05.469 
the build you lift off the wave and they
get<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.259> board<00:02:03.440> up<00:02:03.590> and<00:02:03.739> flying<00:02:04.330> but<00:02:05.330> they

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
get the board up and flying but they

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.109 
get the board up and flying but they
also<00:02:05.690> you<00:02:05.899> control<00:02:06.500> areas<00:02:06.950> so<00:02:07.459> your<00:02:07.610> back<00:02:07.819> foot

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
also you control areas so your back foot

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.040 
also you control areas so your back foot
has<00:02:08.450> to<00:02:08.630> have<00:02:09.190> enough<00:02:10.190> curve<00:02:10.459> around<00:02:11.050> that

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
has to have enough curve around that

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.220 
has to have enough curve around that
around<00:02:12.680> your<00:02:12.830> toe<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:13.220> heel<00:02:13.580> or<00:02:13.940> a<00:02:14.120> wing<00:02:15.020> or

next<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.450> your<00:02:36.540> front<00:02:36.720> foot<00:02:36.960> and<00:02:37.740> all<00:02:37.920> that

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
next to your front foot and all that

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.240 
next to your front foot and all that
combines<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.360> make<00:02:39.540> your<00:02:39.960> engine<00:02:40.170> off<00:02:40.920> the

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
combines to make your engine off the

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.480 
combines to make your engine off the
fence<00:02:41.490> of<00:02:41.820> course<00:02:42.350> your<00:02:43.350> back<00:02:43.620> foot<00:02:43.860> has<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.310> be

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
fence of course your back foot has to be

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.890 
fence of course your back foot has to be
able<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:45.060> get<00:02:46.020> Drive<00:02:46.350> by<00:02:47.130> burying<00:02:47.910> your<00:02:48.570> things

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
able to get Drive by burying your things

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.070 
able to get Drive by burying your things
so<00:02:49.890> your<00:02:50.280> fins<00:02:50.520> are<00:02:50.700> pretty<00:02:51.420> much<00:02:51.540> located

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
so your fins are pretty much located

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.290 
so your fins are pretty much located
next<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.380> it<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.710> when<00:02:53.220> your<00:02:53.340> back<00:02:53.550> foot<00:02:53.940> is

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
next to it you when your back foot is

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.060 
next to it you when your back foot is
going<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.540> be<00:02:54.600> position<00:02:55.140> or<00:02:55.740> that<00:02:55.890> together

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
going to be position or that together

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.250 
going to be position or that together
makes<00:02:56.490> the<00:02:56.640> engine<00:02:56.940> now<00:02:57.660> assemble<00:02:57.990> time<00:02:58.140> I've

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
makes the engine now assemble time I've

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.860 
makes the engine now assemble time I've
got<00:02:58.440> that<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:59.600> like<00:03:00.600> for<00:03:00.780> instance

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
got that and like for instance

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.060 
got that and like for instance
displacement<00:03:01.770> boards<00:03:02.070> like<00:03:02.220> Malibu's<00:03:02.730> they

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
displacement boards like Malibu's they

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.320 
displacement boards like Malibu's they
they<00:03:05.070> might<00:03:05.190> have<00:03:05.340> one<00:03:05.520> element<00:03:05.640> like<00:03:06.090> that's

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
they might have one element like that's

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.180 
they might have one element like that's
that's<00:03:06.540> for<00:03:06.660> a<00:03:06.720> curvy<00:03:07.050> temple<00:03:07.440> at<00:03:07.740> that<00:03:07.920> point

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
that's for a curvy temple at that point

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.310 
that's for a curvy temple at that point
and<00:03:09.120> they<00:03:09.300> but<00:03:09.510> they<00:03:09.600> might<00:03:09.780> gain<00:03:10.020> their

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
and they but they might gain their

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.530 
and they but they might gain their
engine<00:03:10.740> could<00:03:10.980> be<00:03:11.010> a<00:03:11.130> very<00:03:11.400> long<00:03:11.640> soft<00:03:12.150> version

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
engine could be a very long soft version

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.730 
engine could be a very long soft version
of<00:03:12.900> that<00:03:13.220> but<00:03:14.270> therefore<00:03:15.270> it's<00:03:15.360> like<00:03:15.540> a<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:16.080> very

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
of that but therefore it's like a a very

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.810 
of that but therefore it's like a a very
badly<00:03:17.010> designed

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
badly designed

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.190 
badly designed
o<00:03:18.800> straight-6<00:03:19.800> engine<00:03:20.450> but<00:03:21.450> then<00:03:21.600> again<00:03:21.720> you

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
o straight-6 engine but then again you

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.770 
o straight-6 engine but then again you
can<00:03:22.380> get<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:22.560> modern<00:03:23.010> longer<00:03:23.940> board<00:03:24.180> and<00:03:24.390> then

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
can get a modern longer board and then

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.210 
can get a modern longer board and then
you<00:03:24.810> can<00:03:25.080> build<00:03:25.350> that<00:03:25.530> up<00:03:25.590> so<00:03:25.860> much<00:03:26.010> of<00:03:26.070> this

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
you can build that up so much of this

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.030 
you can build that up so much of this
like<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.400> zippered<00:03:27.330> powered<00:03:27.660> VA<00:03:28.170> you<00:03:28.770> know<00:03:28.890> you

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
like a zippered powered VA you know you

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.500 
like a zippered powered VA you know you
can<00:03:29.190> get<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.370> lot<00:03:29.610> of<00:03:29.730> horsepower<00:03:30.000> out<00:03:30.300> of<00:03:30.360> it

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
can get a lot of horsepower out of it

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.090 
can get a lot of horsepower out of it
board

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
board

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.130 
board
and<00:03:32.100> then<00:03:32.310> there's<00:03:32.520> other<00:03:32.690> other<00:03:33.690> words<00:03:33.959> like

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
and then there's other other words like

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.360 
and then there's other other words like
the<00:03:34.470> standard<00:03:34.830> six<00:03:35.580> footer<00:03:35.930> it's<00:03:36.930> it<00:03:37.200> is<00:03:37.470> it<00:03:38.190> is

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
the standard six footer it's it is it is

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.870 
the standard six footer it's it is it is
all<00:03:38.930> the<00:03:39.930> way<00:03:40.080> feet<00:03:40.800> work<00:03:41.040> on<00:03:41.250> that<00:03:41.430> thing<00:03:41.640> it's

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
all the way feet work on that thing it's

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.420 
all the way feet work on that thing it's
three<00:03:42.600> three<00:03:42.900> quarters<00:03:43.320> engine<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:44.250> rest

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
three three quarters engine and the rest

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.130 
three three quarters engine and the rest
are<00:03:44.610> just<00:03:44.640> some<00:03:44.970> softening<00:03:45.420> elements<00:03:45.900> around

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
are just some softening elements around

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.930 
are just some softening elements around
it<00:03:47.810> engine<00:03:48.810> is
