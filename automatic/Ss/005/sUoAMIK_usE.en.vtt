00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
video game swindle so I we can hear it's

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.220 
video game swindle so I we can hear it's
the<00:00:14.030> section<00:00:15.030> figure<00:00:15.330> swindle<00:00:17.720> he<00:00:18.720> has<00:00:18.869> here<00:00:19.199> a

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
the section figure swindle he has here a

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.730 
the section figure swindle he has here a
vehicle<00:00:19.859> mode<00:00:20.449> are<00:00:21.449> not<00:00:21.630> quite<00:00:21.869> sure<00:00:21.930> which

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
vehicle mode are not quite sure which

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.660 
vehicle mode are not quite sure which
model<00:00:23.490> car<00:00:23.730> is<00:00:23.939> this<00:00:24.650> but<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.680> believe<00:00:25.800> some<00:00:26.460> of

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
model car is this but I believe some of

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.560 
model car is this but I believe some of
the<00:00:26.760> general<00:00:27.420> motors<00:00:28.519> so<00:00:29.519> what<00:00:30.090> we<00:00:30.240> see<00:00:30.539> here

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
the general motors so what we see here

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.810 
the general motors so what we see here
is<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.880> swindle<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.090> primary<00:00:33.570> color<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:34.079> red

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
is that swindle the primary color is red

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.350 
is that swindle the primary color is red
that's<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.030> color<00:00:36.239> scheme<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:37.550> his<00:00:38.550> vehicle

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
that's the color scheme and his vehicle

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.830 
that's the color scheme and his vehicle
mode<00:00:39.770> and<00:00:40.770> we<00:00:40.980> can<00:00:41.129> see<00:00:41.280> here<00:00:41.579> there<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.510> very

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
mode and we can see here there is very

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.690 
mode and we can see here there is very
detailed<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:45.350> in<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.530> figure<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:47.070> really<00:00:47.430> like
