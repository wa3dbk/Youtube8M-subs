00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.840
 hello here is again steffen of area 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.730
 mobile and I want you guys today 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.530
 show a tablet again this week 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.920
 but we have no Android device or 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.680
 no ipad for you but a device with 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.500
 windows and the asus transformer 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:25.680
 book t110 sommerburg why the book 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.519
 hot tablet is not clear because you 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.580
 can we with such a small one 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.219
 Keyboard to the small laptop netbook 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.870
 wants to be but we look 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.730
 now first the tablet a bit 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.160
 Outside 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:41.510
 the asus transformer book t100 is in 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.030
 Core a 10.1 inch tablet with windows 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.170
 8.1 windows 8.1 not windows nt that 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.070
 means we have an intel processor here 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.110
 in it 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.480
 this is a quad core processor from the 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.870
 new trailer series of the 13 gigahertz 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.059
 clock frequency and 2 gb RAM 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.100
 that just the work speaker sounds 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.719
 but not so much is in everyday life 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.820
 that's enough for everything I do 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.729
 usually with the tablet do that 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.170
 runs super fluid and I can too 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.430
 I work with the pictures 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.049
 can surf the net i can hd videos 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.979
 all this is not a problem 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.509
 that fits so far as here if we 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.470
 First, the pure outward appearances us 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.869
 watch already see 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.790
 this is a plastic case and no 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.710
 especially good honest spoiled 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.960
 pretty fast that it's a shiny one 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.970
 The surface she is very vulnerable to 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.409
 fingerprints shows she is not 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.200
 you can do that very well 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.810
 in the middle press everywhere 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.520
 it does not sound so high quality though 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.640
 Well, you can just for a price that 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.950
 costs just 300 euros 350 euros each 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.610
 After all, where to buy it, not everything 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.439
 expect 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.180
 it was also on interfaces 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:50.189
 There is a little frugal 3g variant 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.140
 we do not see a button next to it 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.540
 I still like that makes one equal 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.149
 volume rocker the power button with 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.060
 a small led life microphone 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.759
 hiding the little hole 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.409
 memory card slot and a small usb 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.229
 output small hdmi-port 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.399
 headphone output and below there 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.349
 look at us right now will be the 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.459
 keyboard plastered 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.349
 what is this little button doing here 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.420
 besides in comparison to borrow windows 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.739
 we do not see what we actually do 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.319
 see and here somehow one 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.849
 homebutton windows symbol where to go if 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.030
 For example, in desktop mode 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.349
 works quickly in the vote again 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.430
 tile surface pure and it can 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.139
 Of course they do that 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.340
 but you always get down here too 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:33.310
 if somehow a tile app 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.989
 you can always open here 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.530
 but you can get back to the desktop 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.510
 not there is a kind here as well 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.340
 Windows button with which you always the 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.389
 last application you had open 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.349
 can jump back 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:49.000
 this is less convenient than once 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.400
 but to have her central button 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.150
 everything has just decided 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.069
 we can not do anything 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:58.540
 here we require a front camera 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.919
 with 12 megapixels on the back there 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.629
 there is no camera, I think it's at now 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:04.450
 a tablet not so bad, especially 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.530
 with such a big tablet because who goes 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.549
 Go on and do it somehow 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.680
 photo the webcam is actually only 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.049
 for a snapshot or here and there 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.479
 Skype phone suitable with 12 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.760
 megapixel and without any one 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:19.859
 Photolight or something you can not do that 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.269
 to start so much 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:25.449
 the display what you put in it 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:28.419
 diagonal of 10.1 inches is an ips 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:29.829
 display but like for an ips display 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:31.930
 me the viewing angle stability now 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:34.209
 not so good you can get away from it relatively quickly 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.519
 the side looks to the gray veil on it 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.949
 the colors take off you have the feeling 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.840
 it's relatively low in the display 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:42.159
 Housing in it , the picture is not so 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.000
 It's a bit high up here 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:47.349
 darker than it could possibly be 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.349
 But for the price really is 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:53.829
 ok the resolution is 1366 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:55.870
 x 768 pixels so no full hd resolution 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.180
 but really great for the price 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.400
 Can you live with it in the tablet 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.509
 stuck depending on the variant you buy 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.889
 32 or 64 GB ssd memory as I said 

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:06.609
 Memory card slot is available for 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:08.379
 extension 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:09.819
 You have to remember, though 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:12.669
 fall the small variants buy 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.500
 the operating system already needs 15 gb 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:17.169
 that is actually already the 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.430
 half of it off the store if 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.900
 So I in the large memory at the 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.000
 I should actually think about color 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.090
 if I want it or if I want it 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.680
 do not invest and the 4 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.479
 Buy, of course, is also a battery 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.320
 your third tray has two 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:33.520
 cells and 31 watt - hours capacity like 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.259
 it takes a long time to get through it 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.970
 strongly dependent on what you do so if you are 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:38.139
 just actually surfing anyway 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.940
 and use some e-mails 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.350
 maybe every once in a while 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.000
 round solitaire or something is playing 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.860
 Can you do that somehow ten 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.229
 hours persevere when he sees the display 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.900
 not quite turned on but if it is 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.560
 Now that's about you really 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.150
 More demanding things might do 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.400
 one image processing somehow 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.479
 hd-video peeks or something then can too 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.570
 ever after the half be closed 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.860
 you can just flat-rate 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.530
 You can run with such a term 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.820
 Specify windows computer hard 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.860
 I would say it because q is good 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.169
 but has another average 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.970
 problem and although the power supply is what 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:12.400
 asus hereby delivers a bit too 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.060
 weak full output of 2 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.430
 amp 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.340
 it is all about the micro usb port 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.900
 and if I'm in the desktop right now 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.449
 Mode I find a lot of applications 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.220
 on colored offer no idea just 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:27.039
 because of photoshop or a browser 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.500
 it can happen with 30 tabs or something like that 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:31.389
 that the battery is decreasing though that 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.889
 charger is connected and so 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:34.570
 actually that would be a bit 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:36.880
 Maybe many do not even notice 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.830
 if I just that as a pure tablet 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.150
 users for surfing or other things 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.620
 then you probably fall 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.060
 not like that but if I did 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.070
 make more demanding work with it 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.110
 is that a bit annoying 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:49.449
 especially since the weak charger is also called 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.680
 that's when the battery is completely empty times 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.630
 It takes a long time to get busy again 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.720
 is already five hours in the country or 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.370
 You just have to know four 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.669
 maybe a stronger charger 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:03.090
 can settle by other asus 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:05.889
 transformer models already known 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.099
 that tablet with such a keyboard 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:10.479
 docking station is delivered 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:13.240
 this is really just about it 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:15.039
 a plastic plastic 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.740
 keyboard here with a stable 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:18.720
 hinge where we once the tablet 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.090
 reinsetzen 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:24.159
 the advantage one has here 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.919
 full keyboard in netbook size 

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:28.930
 would still remembers dinger 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:32.030
 So you can safely type better 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.620
 screen keyboard but 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.900
 you can tell that already pretty much 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.580
 is also determined by yes what is left 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.460
 end for a conclusion from the asus 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.840
 Transform t 101 times the positive ones 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.310
 it's pretty cheap anymore 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.680
 Gets for a little over 300 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:47.690
 euro has a lot of power for it 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.640
 with the intel bay trail quad core 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:52.340
 Processor in there is two gigabytes of RAM 

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.640
 are the minimum what you need for windows 8.1 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.180
 should have 

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.650
 In terms of performance we can somehow 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.630
 It does not say it's great 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.910
 problems makes that you can handle it a lot 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:02.630
 work well somehow 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.550
 Bildbearbeitung and that's how it works 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.840
 everything is pretty fluent games 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.460
 of course with such a graphics card with 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.850
 the integrated chip of not the 

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.280
 bringer 

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.660
 but you can do a lot with it 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.520
 especially if you are traveling 

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.320
 that is already working 

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.330
 quite well 

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:19.970
 We did not like the display that much 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:22.280
 is really more middle class displays 

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.120
 does not have a full hd resolution is not 

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:27.830
 so bright does not have such a good one 

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:29.390
 viewing angle fits perfectly with the 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.800
 Price range but of course would be nice 

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.900
 if it were not a bit better 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.790
 I liked that cheap 

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:37.160
 material and processing earlier 

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:38.690
 at the keyboard part and the problems with 

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.520
 the battery or too weak 

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:43.160
 charger and anyway no 

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.790
 especially great out of perseverance 

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.590
 the outlet 

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:48.260
 that would have really done better 

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:50.390
 But you must always remember that 

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:52.340
 ding maybe costs 300 350 euro 

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:56.090
 But you get a lot for that 

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:57.170
 Not everything is good for that anymore 

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:59.960
 device you experience in the complete 

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:01.070
 review on areamobile DE and her 

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.360
 you can not even in the channel 

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:04.430
 our other videos are watching me 

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.640
 There's something to see and see you next 

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:06.640
 times
