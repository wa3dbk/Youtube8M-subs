00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
the rocket engine and so I still have

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.810 
the rocket engine and so I still have
the<00:00:19.199> box<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:21.320> what<00:00:22.320> looks<00:00:22.439> like<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.980> this<00:00:23.010> is

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
horse which I don't use often and it's

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.840 
horse which I don't use often and it's
based<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.690> king<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.170> railway<00:00:34.850> Thomas

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
let's review Stephen the rocket first

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.640 
let's review Stephen the rocket first
this<00:00:55.090> is<00:00:55.330> face<00:00:56.550> it's<00:00:57.550> an<00:00:57.970> okay<00:00:58.360> face<00:00:58.660> and<00:00:59.080> only

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650 
this is face it's an okay face and only

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.790 
this is face it's an okay face and only
has<00:00:59.830> one<00:01:00.100> lamp<00:01:00.340> the<00:01:01.300> prototype<00:01:01.630> version<00:01:02.260> has

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
has one lamp the prototype version has

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.820 
has one lamp the prototype version has
two<00:01:03.370> lamps<00:01:03.790> I<00:01:04.830> wonder<00:01:05.830> why<00:01:07.440> has<00:01:08.440> a<00:01:08.470> black

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
two lamps I wonder why has a black

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.170 
two lamps I wonder why has a black
coupling<00:01:09.510> buffers<00:01:11.010> he<00:01:12.010> is<00:01:12.130> the<00:01:12.280> second<00:01:12.729> engine

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
coupling buffers he is the second engine

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.550 
coupling buffers he is the second engine
to<00:01:13.540> have<00:01:13.900> this<00:01:14.650> irods<00:01:15.810> move<00:01:16.810> on<00:01:17.050> the<00:01:17.229> front<00:01:17.470> of

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
to have this irods move on the front of

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.410 
to have this irods move on the front of
crunch<00:01:18.369> of<00:01:18.550> wheels<00:01:18.790> the<00:01:19.780> first<00:01:20.050> is<00:01:20.290> all<00:01:20.530> over

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
crunch of wheels the first is all over

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.080 
crunch of wheels the first is all over
so<00:01:22.680> that's<00:01:23.680> what<00:01:23.920> my<00:01:24.460> favorite<00:01:24.640> part<00:01:24.850> about

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
so that's what my favorite part about

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:37.399 
so that's what my favorite part about
this<00:01:25.800> toy<00:01:29.610> see<00:01:30.610> you<00:01:31.950> looks<00:01:32.950> nice<00:01:33.190> and

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.620 

and<00:01:37.890> here's<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.640> back

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.550 

has<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.439> gold<00:01:42.710> dome<00:01:43.250> and<00:01:43.579> the<00:01:44.020> funnel<00:01:45.020> well

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
has the gold dome and the funnel well

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.560 
has the gold dome and the funnel well
it's<00:01:46.520> short<00:01:46.909> I<00:01:47.180> understand<00:01:47.840> because<00:01:48.369> well<00:01:49.570> if

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
it's short I understand because well if

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.450 
it's short I understand because well if
it's<00:01:50.869> too<00:01:50.960> tall<00:01:51.350> it<00:01:51.649> won't<00:01:51.829> fit<00:01:52.039> under<00:01:52.220> the

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
it's too tall it won't fit under the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:00.210 
it's too tall it won't fit under the
tunnels<00:01:53.409> but<00:01:54.409> I<00:01:56.979> made<00:01:57.979> a<00:01:58.009> funnel<00:01:58.429> just<00:01:58.700> for<00:01:58.939> him

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
tunnels but I made a funnel just for him

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.059 
tunnels but I made a funnel just for him
so<00:02:01.220> he<00:02:01.250> looks<00:02:01.640> better<00:02:02.119> with<00:02:02.509> that<00:02:03.110> thing<00:02:03.380> but<00:02:03.799> I

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
so he looks better with that thing but I

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:07.210 
so he looks better with that thing but I
still<00:02:04.670> understand<00:02:05.240> that<00:02:05.450> if<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.740> funnel<00:02:07.130> is

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
still understand that if the funnel is

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.859 
still understand that if the funnel is
too<00:02:07.340> tall<00:02:07.579> then<00:02:08.030> we<00:02:08.209> won't<00:02:08.420> fit<00:02:08.569> under<00:02:08.599> the

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
too tall then we won't fit under the

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.470 
too tall then we won't fit under the
tunnels<00:02:09.670> but<00:02:10.670> it's<00:02:10.819> my<00:02:11.000> toys<00:02:11.239> so<00:02:11.690> I<00:02:12.019> just<00:02:13.480> still

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
tunnels but it's my toys so I just still

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.229 
tunnels but it's my toys so I just still
use<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.410> funnel<00:02:15.830> on<00:02:16.069> Stephen<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.150> rocket<00:02:17.299> and

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
use the funnel on Stephen the rocket and

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:26.440 
use the funnel on Stephen the rocket and
now<00:02:20.239> we<00:02:20.930> check<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.470> tender<00:02:22.220> guess<00:02:25.060> so<00:02:26.060> it<00:02:26.269> has

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
now we check the tender guess so it has

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.770 
now we check the tender guess so it has
to<00:02:26.480> call<00:02:27.019> here<00:02:27.440> in<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:29.780> barrel<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:32.090> has

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
to call here in the barrel and has

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.949 
to call here in the barrel and has
plastic<00:02:33.500> axles<00:02:34.130> instead<00:02:34.760> of<00:02:35.230> metal<00:02:36.230> once<00:02:37.959> i'm

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
plastic axles instead of metal once i'm

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.819 
plastic axles instead of metal once i'm
not<00:02:39.200> sure<00:02:39.380> why<00:02:39.769> they<00:02:39.980> use<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.340> plastic<00:02:40.640> axles

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
not sure why they use the plastic axles

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.490 
not sure why they use the plastic axles
probably<00:02:42.829> because<00:02:43.190> well<00:02:43.610> if<00:02:44.599> the<00:02:44.840> metal<00:02:45.260> thing

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
probably because well if the metal thing

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.550 
probably because well if the metal thing
comes<00:02:46.040> out<00:02:46.660> but<00:02:47.660> what<00:02:47.840> did<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.079> plastic

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
comes out but what did the plastic

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.210 
comes out but what did the plastic
breaks<00:02:48.850> i'm<00:02:49.850> not<00:02:50.060> sure<00:02:50.600> i<00:02:50.630> mean<00:02:50.989> i<00:02:51.200> think<00:02:51.950> the

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
breaks i'm not sure i mean i think the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.229 
breaks i'm not sure i mean i think the
plastic<00:02:52.670> wood<00:02:52.790> easy<00:02:53.060> easily<00:02:53.930> break<00:02:54.140> and<00:02:55.239> could

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
plastic wood easy easily break and could

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.100 
plastic wood easy easily break and could
see<00:02:56.450> through<00:02:56.720> that<00:02:57.319> tender<00:02:58.010> thing

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
see through that tender thing

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.270 
see through that tender thing
so

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.320 

okay<00:03:03.910> nothing<00:03:04.600> else<00:03:04.720> to<00:03:04.900> say<00:03:05.110> about<00:03:05.170> this<00:03:06.330> this

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
okay nothing else to say about this this

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.420 
okay nothing else to say about this this
looks<00:03:07.569> cool<00:03:07.810> as<00:03:07.959> well<00:03:09.300> and<00:03:10.300> now<00:03:11.069> onto<00:03:12.069> the

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
looks cool as well and now onto the

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.030 
looks cool as well and now onto the
flatbed<00:03:12.790> um<00:03:13.240> I'm<00:03:13.870> wondering<00:03:14.380> why<00:03:14.680> it's

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
flatbed um I'm wondering why it's

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.030 
flatbed um I'm wondering why it's
flapping<00:03:15.760> its<00:03:16.180> blue<00:03:16.620> I'm<00:03:17.620> not<00:03:17.860> sure<00:03:19.830> it's<00:03:20.830> a

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
flapping its blue I'm not sure it's a

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.630 
flapping its blue I'm not sure it's a
long<00:03:21.280> flat<00:03:21.730> bed<00:03:22.560> and<00:03:23.560> I<00:03:23.680> don't<00:03:23.709> use<00:03:24.130> it<00:03:24.340> that

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
long flat bed and I don't use it that

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.059 
long flat bed and I don't use it that
much<00:03:25.090> often<00:03:25.780> this<00:03:26.140> it'll<00:03:26.380> take<00:03:26.560> off<00:03:26.739> my<00:03:26.890> whole

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
much often this it'll take off my whole

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.720 
much often this it'll take off my whole
space<00:03:27.400> and<00:03:28.500> this<00:03:29.500> statue<00:03:29.800> of<00:03:30.010> a<00:03:30.130> horse<00:03:30.310> is

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
space and this statue of a horse is

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.150 
space and this statue of a horse is
bronze<00:03:31.209> I<00:03:32.220> think

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
bronze I think

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.330 
bronze I think
so

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.270 

not<00:03:40.330> really<00:03:40.629> I'm<00:03:41.230> the<00:03:41.500> best<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:42.069> rolling

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
not really I'm the best the rolling

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:51.199 
not really I'm the best the rolling
stock<00:03:43.140> but<00:03:44.140> the<00:03:44.500> flatbed<00:03:45.010> is<00:03:46.110> good<00:03:48.870> so<00:03:49.870> yeah

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
rocket okay Steven knee may not stop

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.080 
rocket okay Steven knee may not stop
into<00:05:38.990> this<00:05:39.140> kind<00:05:39.440> of<00:05:39.560> track<00:05:39.880> but<00:05:40.880> there's

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090
