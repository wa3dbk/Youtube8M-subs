00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
just one one piece of styrofoam which

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.790 
just one one piece of styrofoam which
got<00:00:56.940> caught<00:00:57.210> way<00:00:57.539> up<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:57.960> tree<00:00:58.260> here<00:00:58.469> see

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
got caught way up in this tree here see

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.529 
got caught way up in this tree here see
that<00:01:00.469> it's<00:01:01.469> really<00:01:01.680> tangled<00:01:02.129> up<00:01:02.250> there<00:01:02.390> and<00:01:03.390> it

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
that it's really tangled up there and it

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.359 
that it's really tangled up there and it
stayed<00:01:03.780> up<00:01:03.930> there<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.290> whole<00:01:04.470> winter<00:01:05.010> you

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
stayed up there the whole winter you

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.800 
stayed up there the whole winter you
know<00:01:05.489> through<00:01:05.729> all<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.000> snow<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.299> ice<00:01:06.600> and

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
know through all the snow and ice and

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.760 
know through all the snow and ice and
everything<00:01:09.049> so<00:01:10.049> it's<00:01:10.170> trying<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.439> think<00:01:10.650> about

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
everything so it's trying to think about

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.620 
everything so it's trying to think about
how<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.159> can<00:01:11.640> get<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.090> down<00:01:14.210> now<00:01:15.210> my<00:01:15.360> first

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
how I can get that down now my first

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.380 
how I can get that down now my first
thought<00:01:15.950> was<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.479> get<00:01:18.479> out<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.630> stepladder

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
thought was to get out a stepladder

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.670 
thought was to get out a stepladder
which<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.479> have<00:01:21.659> right<00:01:21.900> here<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.170> have<00:01:22.380> one<00:01:22.590> of

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
which I have right here I have one of

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.560 
which I have right here I have one of
these<00:01:22.770> things<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.610> would<00:01:24.000> probably<00:01:24.180> get<00:01:24.450> me

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
these things that would probably get me

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.100 
these things that would probably get me
about<00:01:24.780> five<00:01:24.990> feet<00:01:25.229> off<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.380> ground<00:01:27.020> then<00:01:28.020> I

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
about five feet off the ground then I

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.140 
about five feet off the ground then I
could<00:01:28.259> get<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.439> rake<00:01:28.680> out<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.189> climb<00:01:29.759> up<00:01:29.939> there

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
could get a rake out and climb up there

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.300 
could get a rake out and climb up there
and<00:01:30.180> try<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.750> reach<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.200> maybe<00:01:31.650> snag<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.189> and

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
and try and reach it maybe snag it and

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.030 
and try and reach it maybe snag it and
pull<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.460> down

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.820 

this<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.790> my<00:01:35.940> first<00:01:36.240> thought<00:01:36.510> but<00:01:36.830> probably

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
this is my first thought but probably

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.460 
this is my first thought but probably
isn't<00:01:38.010> too<00:01:38.100> wise<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.580> know<00:01:38.640> I'd<00:01:38.790> probably

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
isn't too wise you know I'd probably

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.360 
isn't too wise you know I'd probably
fall<00:01:40.470> off<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.860> ladder<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.370> break<00:01:41.760> something

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
fall off that ladder and break something

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
fall off that ladder and break something
which<00:01:44.370> might<00:01:44.550> beg<00:01:44.760> for<00:01:45.030> it

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
which might beg for it

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.890 
which might beg for it
it<00:01:46.020> might<00:01:46.200> make<00:01:46.380> for<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.650> better<00:01:46.830> video<00:01:47.060> but<00:01:48.060> I'd

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
it might make for a better video but I'd

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.600 
it might make for a better video but I'd
rather<00:01:49.050> be<00:01:49.350> safe<00:01:50.180> my<00:01:51.180> next<00:01:51.480> idea<00:01:51.630> was<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.650> drive

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
rather be safe my next idea was to drive

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
rather be safe my next idea was to drive
my<00:01:53.850> my<00:01:54.240> Jeep<00:01:54.510> here<00:01:56.510> underneath<00:01:57.510> the

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
my my Jeep here underneath the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.219 
my my Jeep here underneath the
underneath<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.780> branch<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:02.780> then<00:02:03.780> climb<00:02:04.200> up

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
underneath that branch and then climb up

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.080 
underneath that branch and then climb up
on<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.650> top<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.100> Jeep<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.520> try<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:05.940> reach

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
on the top of the Jeep and try and reach

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.090 
on the top of the Jeep and try and reach
it<00:02:06.210> from<00:02:06.300> there<00:02:07.910> my<00:02:08.910> next<00:02:09.179> idea<00:02:09.330> was<00:02:10.040> you<00:02:11.040> know

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
it from there my next idea was you know

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.000 
it from there my next idea was you know
we<00:02:11.250> have<00:02:11.370> this<00:02:11.550> roof<00:02:12.540> rake<00:02:12.840> which<00:02:13.470> is<00:02:13.680> sort<00:02:13.920> of

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
we have this roof rake which is sort of

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.080 
we have this roof rake which is sort of
which<00:02:14.160> if<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.459> don't<00:02:14.610> know<00:02:14.670> what<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:14.790> is

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
which if you don't know what that is

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.260 
which if you don't know what that is
it's<00:02:15.330> sort<00:02:15.450> of<00:02:15.540> like<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:15.780> snow<00:02:16.770> shovel<00:02:17.120> on<00:02:18.120> the

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
it's sort of like a snow shovel on the

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.810 
it's sort of like a snow shovel on the
end<00:02:18.390> of<00:02:18.480> a<00:02:18.570> really<00:02:18.930> long<00:02:19.110> pole<00:02:19.500> which<00:02:20.459> you<00:02:20.640> can

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
end of a really long pole which you can

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.800 
end of a really long pole which you can
use<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.360> shovel<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.670> snow<00:02:23.670> off<00:02:24.209> of<00:02:24.240> your<00:02:24.630> roof

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
use to shovel the snow off of your roof

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.630 
use to shovel the snow off of your roof
in<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.140> winter<00:02:25.350> time<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:26.130> know<00:02:26.370> down

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
in the winter time and you know down

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.160 
in the winter time and you know down
onto<00:02:26.970> yourself<00:02:28.100> and<00:02:29.100> this<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.489> that<00:02:29.989> this<00:02:30.989> is

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
onto yourself and this is that this is

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.229 
onto yourself and this is that this is
that<00:02:31.320> roof<00:02:31.590> shovel<00:02:32.270> we've<00:02:33.270> got<00:02:33.510> here<00:02:33.840> as<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:35.239> few

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
that roof shovel we've got here as a few

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.030 
that roof shovel we've got here as a few
poles<00:02:36.540> I'm<00:02:37.170> sure<00:02:37.380> I<00:02:37.440> could<00:02:37.620> reach<00:02:37.770> it<00:02:37.920> with

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
poles I'm sure I could reach it with

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.850 
poles I'm sure I could reach it with
that<00:02:38.330> but<00:02:39.330> I<00:02:39.360> don't<00:02:39.420> think<00:02:39.630> I<00:02:39.840> can<00:02:39.900> grab<00:02:40.380> on<00:02:40.620> to

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
that but I don't think I can grab on to

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.310 
that but I don't think I can grab on to
it<00:02:40.890> with<00:02:41.190> this<00:02:43.130> you<00:02:44.130> know<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:45.170> piece<00:02:46.170> of

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
it with this you know the piece of

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.810 
it with this you know the piece of
styrofoam<00:02:46.500> it's<00:02:46.950> really<00:02:47.190> wrapped<00:02:47.430> around<00:02:47.610> the

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
styrofoam it's really wrapped around the

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.240 
styrofoam it's really wrapped around the
tree<00:02:47.970> up<00:02:48.180> there<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.650> you<00:02:49.650> might<00:02:49.830> have<00:02:49.950> to<00:02:50.100> grab

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
tree up there and you might have to grab

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.100 
tree up there and you might have to grab
onto<00:02:50.610> it<00:02:50.730> somehow<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.150> not<00:02:51.450> just<00:02:51.720> knock<00:02:51.930> it

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
onto it somehow and not just knock it

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.630 
onto it somehow and not just knock it
loose<00:02:52.140> with<00:02:52.470> a<00:02:52.530> shovel<00:02:52.769> so<00:02:55.489> those<00:02:56.489> are<00:02:56.549> my

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
loose with a shovel so those are my

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.720 
loose with a shovel so those are my
first<00:02:56.880> three<00:02:57.120> ideas<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:59.160> one<00:02:59.310> I<00:02:59.340> just<00:02:59.400> had

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
first three ideas the one I just had

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.820 
first three ideas the one I just had
today<00:02:59.940> was<00:03:00.630> that<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:00.840> noticed<00:03:01.110> that<00:03:01.260> branch<00:03:01.590> is

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
today was that I noticed that branch is

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.460 
today was that I noticed that branch is
actually<00:03:02.160> pretty<00:03:02.370> long<00:03:03.140> so<00:03:04.140> maybe<00:03:04.290> I<00:03:04.380> could

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
actually pretty long so maybe I could

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.539 
actually pretty long so maybe I could
throw<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.220> rope<00:03:05.549> up<00:03:05.760> over<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.150> end<00:03:06.269> of<00:03:06.390> it<00:03:06.510> and

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
throw a rope up over the end of it and

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.670 
throw a rope up over the end of it and
pull<00:03:08.549> it<00:03:08.700> down<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:09.180> just<00:03:09.209> bend<00:03:09.630> it<00:03:09.870> bend<00:03:10.500> the

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
pull it down and just bend it bend the

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.100 
pull it down and just bend it bend the
whole<00:03:10.860> branch<00:03:11.360> enough<00:03:12.360> so<00:03:12.540> that<00:03:12.660> I<00:03:12.690> can<00:03:12.930> reach

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
whole branch enough so that I can reach

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.009 
whole branch enough so that I can reach
it<00:03:13.230> with<00:03:13.260> my<00:03:13.470> hand<00:03:13.709> I<00:03:14.690> don't<00:03:15.690> know<00:03:15.810> if<00:03:15.900> that

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
it with my hand I don't know if that

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:23.630 
it with my hand I don't know if that
would<00:03:16.110> work<00:03:16.140> though

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.940 

so<00:03:24.210> what<00:03:24.360> do<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.540> think<00:03:24.870> viewers<00:03:25.560> what<00:03:25.830> would

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
so what do you think viewers what would

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.210 
so what do you think viewers what would
you<00:03:26.070> do<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.370> get<00:03:26.460> that<00:03:26.640> out<00:03:26.820> of<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:26.970> tree
