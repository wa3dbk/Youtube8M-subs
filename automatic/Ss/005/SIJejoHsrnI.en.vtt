00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
instead of having to cut a piece of wood

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.580 
instead of having to cut a piece of wood
to<00:02:11.430> insert<00:02:12.209> in<00:02:12.390> here<00:02:12.420> or

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
with me now worst case scenario that

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.530 
with me now worst case scenario that
were<00:02:25.860> ever<00:02:26.040> break<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.700> can<00:02:26.790> always<00:02:27.180> improvise

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
were ever break I can always improvise
