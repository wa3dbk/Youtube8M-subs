so refreshing before I do any work

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.640 
so refreshing before I do any work
whatsoever<00:01:27.940> I<00:01:28.210> got<00:01:28.630> it<00:01:28.780> out<00:01:29.110> of<00:01:29.170> my<00:01:29.320> school

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
clothes into something more comfortable

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.190

like<00:01:31.750> pajamas<00:01:32.470> or<00:01:32.800> sweats<00:01:33.340> because<00:01:33.700> I<00:01:34.450> just

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
like pajamas or sweats because I just

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.140 
like pajamas or sweats because I just
can't<00:01:35.680> do<00:01:35.920> it<00:01:35.950> work<00:01:36.250> if<00:01:36.490> I<00:01:36.610> feel<00:01:36.850> like<00:01:37.000> I'm

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
can't do it work if I feel like I'm

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.530 
can't do it work if I feel like I'm
trapped<00:01:37.360> in<00:01:37.570> jeans<00:01:37.810> or<00:01:38.020> something<00:01:39.450> then<00:01:40.450> I

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
trapped in jeans or something then I

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.790 
trapped in jeans or something then I
think<00:01:40.720> it's<00:01:40.869> good<00:01:41.110> to<00:01:41.260> take<00:01:41.380> a<00:01:41.440> few<00:01:41.650> moments

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
think it's good to take a few moments

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.820 
think it's good to take a few moments
just<00:01:42.070> to<00:01:42.250> chill<00:01:42.490> out<00:01:42.700> eat<00:01:42.970> your<00:01:43.240> snack<00:01:43.630> and<00:01:44.050> you

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
just to chill out eat your snack and you

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.140 
just to chill out eat your snack and you
know<00:01:44.950> maybe<00:01:45.130> check<00:01:45.400> your<00:01:45.550> social<00:01:45.880> media

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
know maybe check your social media

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.480 
know maybe check your social media
before<00:01:46.390> you<00:01:46.750> get<00:01:46.960> into<00:01:47.140> the<00:01:47.350> work<00:01:47.560> but<00:01:48.220> don't

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
before you get into the work but don't

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.550 
before you get into the work but don't
do<00:01:48.670> this<00:01:48.790> for<00:01:49.030> too<00:01:49.150> long<00:01:49.420> because<00:01:49.750> you<00:01:50.320> could

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
do this for too long because you could

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.230 
do this for too long because you could
end<00:01:50.590> up<00:01:50.770> procrastinating<00:01:51.760> and<00:01:51.910> that's<00:01:52.030> not

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
end up procrastinating and that's not

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.660 
end up procrastinating and that's not
good<00:01:52.510> so<00:01:52.690> just<00:01:53.170> throw<00:01:53.410> your<00:01:53.530> hair<00:01:53.680> up<00:01:53.830> and<00:01:54.040> get

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
good so just throw your hair up and get

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.490 
good so just throw your hair up and get
to<00:01:54.820> work<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:58.479> I<00:01:58.510> think<00:01:58.660> it's<00:01:58.930> really<00:01:59.200> helpful

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
to work so I think it's really helpful

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.050 
to work so I think it's really helpful
when<00:01:59.920> you're<00:02:00.100> at<00:02:00.220> school<00:02:00.550> if<00:02:00.640> you<00:02:00.700> get<00:02:00.850> like<00:02:01.000> a

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
break or something to make it to do list

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.719 
break or something to make it to do list
of<00:02:02.800> things<00:02:02.950> you<00:02:03.160> got<00:02:03.280> to<00:02:03.310> do<00:02:03.460> when<00:02:03.550> you<00:02:03.640> get

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
of things you got to do when you get

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.999 
of things you got to do when you get
home<00:02:03.970> or<00:02:04.210> if<00:02:04.810> you<00:02:05.020> can't<00:02:05.259> do<00:02:05.410> it<00:02:05.500> at<00:02:05.560> school

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
home or if you can't do it at school

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.590 
home or if you can't do it at school
like<00:02:06.310> right<00:02:06.520> when<00:02:06.670> you<00:02:06.729> get<00:02:06.850> home<00:02:07.060> to<00:02:07.270> spread

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
like right when you get home to spread

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.540 
like right when you get home to spread
everything<00:02:07.720> you<00:02:08.080> got<00:02:08.229> to<00:02:08.380> do<00:02:08.470> down<00:02:08.679> so<00:02:09.399> then

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
everything you got to do down so then

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.370 
everything you got to do down so then
you<00:02:09.670> can<00:02:09.789> check<00:02:10.000> it<00:02:10.149> off<00:02:10.270> as<00:02:10.300> you<00:02:10.600> go<00:02:10.810> and<00:02:11.050> feel

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
you can check it off as you go and feel

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.980 
you can check it off as you go and feel
like<00:02:11.680> you're<00:02:12.040> actually<00:02:12.430> being<00:02:12.580> productive

outfit there and I can just throw it on
so<00:05:14.430> this<00:05:14.610> isn't<00:05:14.790> really<00:05:15.000> a<00:05:15.120> problem<00:05:15.150> for<00:05:15.540> me

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
so this isn't really a problem for me

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.060 
so this isn't really a problem for me
but<00:05:15.930> I<00:05:16.020> know<00:05:16.080> it's<00:05:16.350> a<00:05:16.410> problem<00:05:16.650> for<00:05:16.920> most

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
but I know it's a problem for most

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.890 
but I know it's a problem for most
people<00:05:17.490> and<00:05:17.640> that<00:05:17.820> is<00:05:18.090> waking<00:05:18.480> up<00:05:18.750> in<00:05:18.870> the

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
people and that is waking up in the

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.150 
people and that is waking up in the
mornings<00:05:19.290> and<00:05:19.410> sleeping<00:05:19.800> through<00:05:19.950> your<00:05:20.070> alarm

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
mornings and sleeping through your alarm

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.950 
mornings and sleeping through your alarm
so<00:05:20.580> if<00:05:20.670> you're<00:05:20.850> that<00:05:21.000> type<00:05:21.150> of<00:05:21.180> person<00:05:21.300> set

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
so if you're that type of person set

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.390 
so if you're that type of person set
multiple<00:05:22.350> alarms<00:05:22.410> so<00:05:22.860> if<00:05:22.950> you<00:05:23.010> sleep<00:05:23.130> through

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
multiple alarms so if you sleep through

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.370 
multiple alarms so if you sleep through
one<00:05:23.430> you'll<00:05:23.790> wake<00:05:23.940> up<00:05:23.970> for<00:05:24.210> the<00:05:24.300> next<00:05:24.480> and<00:05:24.900> then

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
one you'll wake up for the next and then

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.810 
one you'll wake up for the next and then
once<00:05:25.740> you're<00:05:25.860> done<00:05:25.890> all<00:05:26.130> that<00:05:26.280> you<00:05:26.550> can<00:05:26.669> just

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
once you're done all that you can just

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.790 
once you're done all that you can just
check<00:05:27.060> everything<00:05:27.180> off<00:05:27.480> your<00:05:27.690> list<00:05:27.870> and<00:05:28.140> be

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
check everything off your list and be

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.040 
check everything off your list and be
done<00:05:28.980> okay<00:05:29.880> so<00:05:29.940> it's<00:05:30.150> obvious<00:05:30.510> video<00:05:30.780> and

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
done okay so it's obvious video and

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.900
