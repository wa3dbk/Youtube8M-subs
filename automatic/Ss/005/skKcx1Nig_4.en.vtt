something i should point out i did not
test<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.479> rear<00:01:21.750> view<00:01:21.810> camera<00:01:22.290> monitor<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.130> you

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
test the rear view camera monitor so you

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.440 
test the rear view camera monitor so you
can<00:01:23.280> set<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.430> up<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.610> when<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.000> switch<00:01:24.210> into

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
can set it up that when you switch into

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.300 
can set it up that when you switch into
reverse<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:25.020> will<00:01:25.140> activate<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.680> video<00:01:25.920> input

the<00:03:21.230> iphone<00:03:21.680> since<00:03:22.190> there's<00:03:22.370> no<00:03:22.489> back<00:03:22.730> button

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
the iphone since there's no back button

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.640 
the iphone since there's no back button
in<00:03:23.239> the<00:03:23.329> app<00:03:23.359> on<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:23.810> screen<00:03:24.109> and<00:03:24.290> hopefully

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
in the app on the screen and hopefully

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.319 
in the app on the screen and hopefully
it<00:03:24.799> make<00:03:25.099> any<00:03:25.250> sense<00:03:25.310> it<00:03:25.760> doesn't<00:03:25.970> make<00:03:26.090> any

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
it make any sense it doesn't make any

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:27.849 
it make any sense it doesn't make any
sense<00:03:26.569> but<00:03:26.989> hopefully<00:03:27.530> there's<00:03:27.650> going<00:03:27.769> to<00:03:27.829> be

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
sense but hopefully there's going to be

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:29.319 
sense but hopefully there's going to be
a<00:03:27.919> firmware<00:03:28.190> update<00:03:28.519> that's<00:03:28.819> going<00:03:28.940> to<00:03:29.000> repair

this<00:04:09.709> is<00:04:09.889> a<00:04:09.919> really<00:04:10.250> interesting<00:04:10.280> concept<00:04:11.180> or

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
this is a really interesting concept or

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:12.369 
this is a really interesting concept or
