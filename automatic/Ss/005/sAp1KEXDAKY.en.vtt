00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 Hello, two weeks have passed 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:08.970
 from the application of the permanent seed of 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.590
 I made the video of nail 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.570
 on the application if you don't want to see 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.580
 They'll put the veil and box lincoln 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.870
 information 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.810
 this is precisely the result after two 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.990
 weeks you see there is obviously there is a 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.150
 bit of regrowth however the enamel is 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.949
 perfect there are not especially there 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.170
 we are lifting we take this away 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.170
 very first disturbing picture 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:35.780
 I have to do the review today because 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.090
 I'll take it off tomorrow at the latest the day after tomorrow 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.280
 because on weekends or events 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.500
 up in Milan so I don't want to go 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.110
 with regrowth I think I take it off 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.180
 there is the intention to remove it and to do 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.829
 also a nail art of the next because 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.539
 now there are in short are twice that 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.579
 text of permanent seeds so I'm in 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.350
 that enamel so without nail art 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.030
 I really miss it so I want to do 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.399
 a nail art video i want to bring one 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.469
 of slabs especially today I can 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.010
 tell you that it remained shiny it is not even 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:09.510
 so scratched there are no lifts 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.570
 there are no cow minds that is perfect 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.000
 perfect almost certainly not 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.380
 as shiny as the first days but 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.180
 that one is normal because of course a 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.009
 strength to waste indeed I must tell you that 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.470
 to me it seems already quite enough 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.909
 bright is not yellowed then there are 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.610
 some permanent seeds also that 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.400
 they turn yellow with the application I have 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:35.750
 found good except for this color 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:37.770
 the 280 which is beautiful but hardly more 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.630
 just a little more attention for 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.060
 apply it because it contains ie it is not 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.610
 only it has no lacquered color because 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.899
 inside a micro glitter in ima 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.369
 its own micro micro micro that 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.340
 give a crazy light in 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.079
 indeed it is very very nice indeed 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.270
 these micro glitter make it 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.399
 slightly grainy but it's one thing 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.079
 just not harmful is a word that 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.579
 maybe he really thought of something 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.579
 which 6 in mars for example there is 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.240
 something ramos is not at those levels 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.920
 obviously not at the levels of a 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.239
 a smooth lacquered but own enamel 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.910
 because just inside there are 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.760
 these particles also because I have 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.860
 seen so I had to take the brush 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.160
 so with the other colors I have lacquered 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.720
 and they are a little more fluid than 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.709
 this color here so I guess it is 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.660
 It was just one thing 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.099
 characteristic of this color 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.930
 as I said then to apply it mi 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:30.310
 I am well found, however, below 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:34.120
 I didn't even put the premier 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:37.099
 because here we return to a speech 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.530
 long ago where in a video I said that 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.720
 the primer is not essential except in 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.120
 certain situations I the primer does not 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.440
 I use it practically never use it 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.019
 I just don't know for example 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.890
 in the galaxy application I had put 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:53.600
 the primer because I was on antibiotics 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.790
 the antibiotic can lift the gel 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.430
 so I preferred to put the primer 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.680
 for not having to find me with nails 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.049
 unplug since he was testing it if 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.360
 if it came off it could depend on 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.580
 t bionic that I was taking this time 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.130
 I was out of antibiotic so I got it 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.130
 applied quietly without without 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.480
 primer as you can see well now on long 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.329
 obviously there is no minimum 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.810
 so obviously lifting on me 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:22.940
 because I have normal nails but there are 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.280
 a little more greasy nails 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.609
 maybe people who suffer from 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.109
 hyperhidrosis and then in that case yes 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.739
 we must act with a clan and also 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.750
 powerful 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.209
 however in my opinion it is always necessary 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.739
 distinguish from person to person why 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.930
 precisely we are all different 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:42.049
 so it depends on the person 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.630
 so here nothing is promoted for me and 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:46.700
 you know that I am semi-permanent there 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.819
 however, I remove with the file tomorrow 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.170
 when not to remove your own finger 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.239
 even to melt it 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.680
 and when I put this video up, I'll tell you if 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:59.260
 If you are loose or not here this 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.790
 semi-permanent melts 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.980
 quietly almost equal to one 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.750
 shellac really becomes very soft 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.940
 so that's why it removes it by rising 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.799
 so I recommend it to me this 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.410
 it is absolutely valid semi permanent 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:15.390
 seeing the current conditions I believe 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.430
 if I had left another one 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.290
 week I don't think two more weeks 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.560
 would have given me problems from 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:25.710
 the more I will find it maybe some 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:29.840
 other color lunch but it shows that he has a 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.840
 good semi-permanent goodbye
