00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.509
 would naer and today i want to tell what 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.670
 need to do immediately after reinstalling 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.509
 Windows 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:15.750
 first we need a program 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:19.350
 which is called driverpack solution and 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:23.430
 and it is advisable to pre-download it 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.640
 weighs quite a lot more than seven 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.590
 gigabyte about 8 that is a flash drive for 8 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.500
 gigabytes won't help you right away 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:37.079
 take on 16 that is before you 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.969
 going to install Windows and you like 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.480
 would not about becoming a install 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.030
 lunge that scheme and which we discussed in 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.530
 past video lessons a long time ago when i 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.809
 talked about how to reinstall 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.110
 windows without a disk so here if you 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.059
 use this method and you have after 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.320
 reinstalling windows is having problems 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.090
 then you are missing such a program 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.870
 when you download the reference to 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.610
 the download will be under this video 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.680
 you will be 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.090
 zip format well yes you 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.720
 unzip and 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.049
 and it will be iso format that is it 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.990
 disk image to open for you 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.090
 daimon thuls will also be required 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.509
 Well, this moment is the same mouth previously 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.869
 Download the link with this program 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:31.140
 on downloading it will also give a description and 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.820
 Throw on the media on a USB flash drive or 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.369
 removable drive 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.200
 Here you download this program 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.729
 reinstall windows 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.909
 having thrown the programs on 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.229
 flash drive reinstall windows with 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:50.470
 the way that is explained 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:52.670
 The previous video, that is, 4 months is necessary 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.290
 run this program after 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.240
 how to reinstall windows like all 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.070
 installation ended you threw and 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.780
 back to computer using a flash drive 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.610
 mount the disk image I think everyone can 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.440
 do it if anyone can not 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.110
 see my past lessons there somewhere 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.950
 I will do this operation in the same way 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.540
 in that video where the staff pour windows 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.480
 but now this is not about you 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.630
 reinstall windows you have a new Windows 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.890
 and most likely you can't 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.810
 connect to the internet if you haven't 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.350
 direct connection to computer that is 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.720
 wired or same 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:36.140
 Wi-Fi router that is, the router is straight 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.170
 computer is not connected ie anyone 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.600
 so it is directly intonation days 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.170
 computer connection then the problem is not 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.940
 will arise 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:49.430
 and if you do not have a direct connection 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:53.049
 let's say some wifi on another 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:56.570
 computer you catch from him or 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:58.610
 such a portable Wi fi then you 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.130
 need a network card driver 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.630
 network card and and initially you haven't 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.440
 will be as soon as you reinstall 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.140
 windows using the way i 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.430
 describe for the sake of 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:14.120
 so that we have it we must 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.549
 launch run this program this 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.150
 the program is very useful for good reason 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:22.660
 weighs 8 gigabytes it is downloaded from us 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.660
 little by little 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.860
 sorry for the fact that I have filled this well 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:35.380
 topic very much i just tried 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:37.870
 get the message across as clearly as possible 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.690
 problems so here after you 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.190
 launched this program on a new 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.490
 Windows which just installed in 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.290
 here you will be written the driver requires 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.570
 installation so much as something I 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.300
 let's say 3 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:55.330
 but you will be big enough 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.510
 amount more than three push 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.940
 install here also offered with 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:05.170
 go install any necessary 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:07.570
 programs that will help further 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.760
 I also recommend computer operations 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:13.720
 put what is forever here forever 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:16.329
 that is, this is also necessary if you 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.859
 it is not of course and so on if you 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.590
 only need drivers at the moment 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:24.580
 time to install then you are this 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.830
 take off apologize just push your 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.050
 driver program is left alone and 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.979
 here you will have let 's let's march in 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:37.530
 cards and so on will still be 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:40.900
 written in what I'm confused will be 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:43.030
 driver called network card 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.020
 You can remove all other drivers and 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.200
 to establish 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.810
 network card if you will 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:52.870
 additional drivers to install they 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:57.100
 you will advise you to create a control 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.900
 point before you start the installation 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.000
 selected what you need start 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.720
 installation await some time 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.830
 accordingly, it is desirable not to interrupt 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.479
 this process after you 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.830
 set 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:14.530
 network card that is to do it for you 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.229
 program you will be able 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.320
 connect to the internet 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:22.430
 let's get a look 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:25.880
 go to the network control center after 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.410
 the way you installed the drivers on 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.430
 network card you squeeze change 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:34.130
 adapter settings 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:35.660
 you have if not over no direct connection 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.400
 to the internet 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.990
 that is, I have a direct connection, I 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.770
 even the drivers on the network card and not 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.790
 I installed it, but I updated it 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:48.050
 there was enough driver 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:50.530
 that is, I had no problems with you here 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.520
 other windows will appear i.e. 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.230
 wireless connection is something 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.330
 well, the computer itself will determine 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:59.600
 what kind of connection do you have 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:03.170
 connect without problems to the Internet 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:08.270
 scoring password also with username 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:11.120
 Well, as usual, why I recorded this video 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:15.200
 because there were some complaints 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.700
 even presenting because you told us 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:20.120
 like this reinstall Windows 

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:23.030
 I have the Internet and connects to 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:25.540
 what I don't understand about myself 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.980
 there was no problem then I am with this 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.640
 figured out more and understand what 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.390
 problem 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:34.160
 Well, I installed windows one 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.710
 familiar same problem arose 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.330
 then I had to understand the good cause 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:41.860
 figure out now trying to bring you 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:44.030
 the crux of the problem on this dear friends all 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:47.210
 use this program download 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:50.150
 and there are a lot of things installed on it 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.620
 that is a very bunch of programs that are 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.660
 will be useful in the future user 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.240
