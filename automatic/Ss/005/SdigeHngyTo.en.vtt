00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
think you can put short notes into a

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.979 
think you can put short notes into a
category<00:00:58.010> it's<00:00:58.430> it's<00:00:58.790> it's<00:00:59.420> kind<00:00:59.750> of<00:00:59.810> a

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
category it's it's it's kind of a

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.340 
category it's it's it's kind of a
provide<00:01:00.770> showcase<00:01:01.340> so<00:01:01.640> and<00:01:02.110> you<00:01:03.110> could<00:01:03.230> have

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.200 
provide showcase so and you could have
paid<00:01:03.649> use<00:01:03.860> leads<00:01:04.399> basis<00:01:05.300> pets<00:01:06.160> effects

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
paid use leads basis pets effects

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.480 
paid use leads basis pets effects
ambient<00:01:08.210> textures<00:01:08.570> in<00:01:08.720> and<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.140> like<00:01:09.290> and<00:01:09.560> yes

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490

ambient textures in and the like and yes
and<00:01:10.700> these<00:01:11.030> are<00:01:11.290> personally<00:01:12.290> I<00:01:12.350> think<00:01:12.590> these

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
and these are personally I think these

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.380 
and these are personally I think these
are<00:01:12.740> no<00:01:12.950> ordinary<00:01:13.190> songs<00:01:13.640> I'd<00:01:13.940> say<00:01:14.149> yeah

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:27.870 
there's there's life there's life in
these<00:01:16.100> sounds

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.029 

when<00:01:28.880> I<00:01:28.909> started<00:01:29.390> designing<00:01:29.960> short<00:01:30.560> noise<00:01:30.740> and

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
when I started designing short noise and

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:32.529 
when I started designing short noise and
this<00:01:31.189> sounds<00:01:31.549> an<00:01:31.640> instrument<00:01:32.090> for<00:01:32.240> it<00:01:32.359> I

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
this sounds an instrument for it I

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.190 
this sounds an instrument for it I
thought<00:01:33.409> given<00:01:34.189> it<00:01:34.399> a<00:01:34.520> different<00:01:34.969> approach<00:01:35.780> I

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
thought given it a different approach I

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.919 
thought given it a different approach I
mean<00:01:36.590> I<00:01:36.829> mean<00:01:37.549> we<00:01:37.700> all<00:01:37.880> do<00:01:38.119> love<00:01:38.329> sounds<00:01:38.780> we're

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
mean I mean we all do love sounds we're

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:41.319 
mean I mean we all do love sounds we're
making<00:01:39.229> music<00:01:39.500> so<00:01:39.710> what<00:01:39.950> would<00:01:40.039> really<00:01:40.329> help

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
making music so what would really help

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.260 
making music so what would really help
in<00:01:41.539> developing<00:01:42.319> musical<00:01:42.710> ideas<00:01:43.399> what<00:01:44.090> would

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
in developing musical ideas what would

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.230 
in developing musical ideas what would
truly<00:01:44.600> inspire<00:01:45.490> so<00:01:46.490> I<00:01:46.520> thought<00:01:46.880> why<00:01:47.209> don't

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
truly inspire so I thought why don't

00:01:47.240 --> 00:02:03.280 
truly inspire so I thought why don't
make<00:01:47.509> the<00:01:47.630> sounds<00:01:47.990> kind<00:01:48.500> of<00:01:48.590> different

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:12.760 

I<00:02:09.640> think<00:02:10.640> we're<00:02:11.360> short<00:02:11.930> nice<00:02:12.080> really<00:02:12.470> shines

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
I think we're short nice really shines

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.940 
I think we're short nice really shines
is<00:02:13.130> that<00:02:13.780> all<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.960> instruments<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:15.770> of

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
is that all the instruments and of

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.490 
is that all the instruments and of
course<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.490> multi<00:02:16.820> performances<00:02:17.360> have<00:02:18.290> a<00:02:18.320> lot

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
course the multi performances have a lot

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.670 
course the multi performances have a lot
of<00:02:18.730> hidden<00:02:19.730> ambience<00:02:20.320> effects<00:02:21.320> in<00:02:21.410> between

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
of hidden ambience effects in between

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.500 
of hidden ambience effects in between
you<00:02:21.860> know<00:02:21.950> that<00:02:22.130> kind<00:02:22.340> of<00:02:22.400> blurry<00:02:22.670> thing<00:02:23.030> on

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
you know that kind of blurry thing on

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.660 
you know that kind of blurry thing on
the<00:02:23.600> background<00:02:23.900> and<00:02:24.130> of<00:02:25.130> course<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:25.460> have<00:02:25.550> to

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
the background and of course you have to

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.550 
the background and of course you have to
then<00:02:25.850> the<00:02:26.030> possibility<00:02:26.780> to<00:02:26.810> treat<00:02:27.200> everything

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
then the possibility to treat everything

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.810 
then the possibility to treat everything
like<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.340> desire<00:02:28.660> so<00:02:29.660> I<00:02:30.050> think<00:02:31.010> yeah<00:02:31.520> almost

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
like you desire so I think yeah almost

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.550 
like you desire so I think yeah almost
any<00:02:32.060> sandwich<00:02:32.420> office<00:02:32.780> makes<00:02:33.230> use<00:02:33.530> of

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
any sandwich office makes use of

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.190 
any sandwich office makes use of
velocity<00:02:34.220> model<00:02:34.970> a<00:02:35.210> should<00:02:35.390> we<00:02:35.510> a<00:02:35.540> pitchman<00:02:36.020> or

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
velocity model a should we a pitchman or

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.510 
velocity model a should we a pitchman or
so<00:02:36.350> I<00:02:36.590> can<00:02:36.860> only<00:02:37.010> advise<00:02:37.430> it<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:37.640> check<00:02:38.270> it<00:02:38.390> out
