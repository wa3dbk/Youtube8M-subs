00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
the marketed as a reference headphone a

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.670 
the marketed as a reference headphone a
monitor<00:01:11.820> headphones<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:13.080> should<00:01:13.260> be<00:01:13.290> flat

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
monitor headphones so it should be flat

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.050 
monitor headphones so it should be flat
all<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:13.979> way<00:01:14.130> around<00:01:14.369> but<00:01:16.490> we're<00:01:17.490> at<00:01:17.610> Lex<00:01:17.820> and

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
all the way around but we're at Lex and

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.990 
all the way around but we're at Lex and
base<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:19.080> doesn't<00:01:19.140> make<00:01:19.680> up<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.189> clarity<00:01:20.790> at

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
base it doesn't make up and clarity at

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.330 
base it doesn't make up and clarity at
all<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.390> sent<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.290> highs<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.799> mids<00:01:22.860> seem

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
all it sent the highs and mids seem

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.960 
all it sent the highs and mids seem
really<00:01:23.640> muddy<00:01:24.710> base<00:01:25.710> even<00:01:26.100> when<00:01:26.280> amped<00:01:26.670> up<00:01:26.759> is

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
really muddy base even when amped up is

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.359 
really muddy base even when amped up is
just<00:01:27.150> non-existent<00:01:27.509> um<00:01:28.229> which<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:29.009> strange

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
just non-existent um which is strange

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.679 
just non-existent um which is strange
because<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.759> believe<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.240> they<00:01:30.329> use<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.659> same

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
because I believe that they use the same

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.050 
because I believe that they use the same
drivers<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.500> thus<00:01:31.680> as<00:01:31.890> they<00:01:32.159> do<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.729> high

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
drivers and thus as they do in the high

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.240 
drivers and thus as they do in the high
to<00:01:33.119> low<00:01:33.329> 50s<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.930> i'm<00:01:34.020> getting<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.439> awesome

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
to low 50s and i'm getting a awesome

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.640 
to low 50s and i'm getting a awesome
based<00:01:35.460> response<00:01:35.880> out<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.420> headphone<00:01:36.780> as

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
based response out of that headphone as

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.080 
based response out of that headphone as
i<00:01:37.829> said<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.100> my<00:01:38.130> previous<00:01:38.369> review<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.060> that

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
i said in my previous review of that

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.420 
i said in my previous review of that
headphone<00:01:39.479> it's<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.810> super<00:01:40.500> fun<00:01:40.619> headphone<00:01:40.979> so

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
headphone it's a super fun headphone so

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.800 
headphone it's a super fun headphone so
I<00:01:41.460> was<00:01:41.549> kind<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:41.790> expecting<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.329> same<00:01:42.509> out<00:01:42.780> of

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
I was kind of expecting the same out of

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.499 
I was kind of expecting the same out of
this<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.229> bit<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.070> little<00:01:44.130> bit<00:01:44.430> like<00:01:44.759> lower<00:01:45.210> base

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
this a bit a little bit like lower base

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.690 
this a bit a little bit like lower base
frequency<00:01:46.079> but<00:01:46.290> no<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:49.100> don't<00:01:50.100> think<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.369> can<00:01:50.520> use

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
frequency but no I don't think I can use

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.130 
frequency but no I don't think I can use
this<00:01:50.850> as<00:01:51.030> my<00:01:51.149> daily<00:01:51.450> driver<00:01:51.570> headphone

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
this as my daily driver headphone

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.590 
this as my daily driver headphone
because<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.770> their<00:01:53.430> issue<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:54.000> things<00:01:54.450> like
