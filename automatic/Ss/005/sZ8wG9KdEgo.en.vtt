00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.280
 Hello dear friends and welcome 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.690
 to the new review of minecraft mods 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.609
 right now we will see a mod which 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.500
 will make you feel real 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.480
 tourists because you can breed 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.000
 tourist bonfires and let's 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.189
 We will understand how this is done to begin with. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.980
 you need to craft a hammer hammer and 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.679
 There are 5 types of wooden stone 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.600
 gold iron and diamond in order 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.390
 hut crafted to you is two 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.940
 sticks and 5 resources of which will be 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.200
 Make your hammer case is diamond 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.719
 of course diamonds 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.210
 next we have to take either a stone or 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.940
 cobblestone if we take a stone then when 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.860
 the help of one hammer and stone we will 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.660
 receive four fragments if we 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.850
 take a skier we'll get two 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.340
 also our hammer will be wasted 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.379
 diamond hammer strength and and very 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.520
 so much on the scale is not even visible 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.379
 special changes 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.870
 if we take the wood then immediately 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.280
 you can see how it is spent here we spent 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.950
 half of our hammer 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.080
 I would not recommend you to make a diamond 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.260
 hammer because fragments you have a lot 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.860
 will not be a maximum of two if you are very 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.960
 awkwardness 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.240
 I always have one because I 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.939
 already got the hand and immediately realized how 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.430
 kindling ethics stren also hammers very 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.920
 beautiful texture so if they are you 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.170
 like both by texture and you want 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.299
 use them instead of a sword then you have everything 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.369
 it will turn out because the hammers are very 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.200
 great damage to my hands the most 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.479
 like the fireplace and because it looks 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.939
 how is it more realistic? 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.340
 golden is not like a hammer but stone is 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.409
 yes real sledgehammer well let 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.930
 hit the pig get some meat 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.090
 because at the stake we can fry it like this 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.470
 kill this pig I had them here 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.290
 specially on my shore 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.479
 yes let's finally make a fire 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.009
 now we have fragments and we can 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.890
 make such a firestarter 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.350
 this is a lighter but firestarter is 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.390
 something like start or campfire yes 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.880
 Strangely translated I agree but on 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.099
 in fact it's just a piece of stone next 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.640
 with silicon with them we will 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.459
 knock out 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.090
 a spark and make a fire we take three sticks 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.640
 and throw them that way 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.629
 It is exactly three you remember further we clamp 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.879
 right mouse button 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.860
 so for some reason not clamped here we clamp 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.170
 and are on our wands 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.180
 I get a bonfire I think you don't even 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.400
 managed to enjoy his appearance 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.489
 so let's throw three more sticks and 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.910
 do it again so we pinpoint 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:36.340
 and everything is ready we are ready with one 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.040
 firestarter and two fires already lit 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.410
 and both successful so let's see 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.690
 what we have inside is enough 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.760
 beautiful such wooden interface here 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.220
 we can put coal let's get it 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.230
 find so put coal and we 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.930
 fill the red scale now we have 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.680
 there is heat in our campfire and we can 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.680
 fry meat 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.930
 put here 2 myasko and he starts our 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.019
 cook meat as we can of course 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.250
 melt in it various ores though it 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.769
 It seems to me wrong 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.440
 it needs to be corrected since in the fire 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.510
 melt the ore is it somehow cheater us all 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.180
 our fire also melt the ore if we're on 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.519
 we will get him we will wait for the whole mod more 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.310
 doing nothing and now I was burning my 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.299
 bonfires meat before roasted so I'm with 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.400
 you say goodbye 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.620
 forced to say goodbye I would even say 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.389
