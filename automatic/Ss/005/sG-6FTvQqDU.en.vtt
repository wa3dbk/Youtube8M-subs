00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 Let's start with a reverse raindrop 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 How many eyes? 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
 I like ... 5 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 5 eyes? OK. 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.500
 Does a monster need so many eyes? 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.000
 This one is probably looking for food all the time. 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 You may even need 3 more up here. 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 And it needs a big mouth - yes, BIG! 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 And maybe a single tooth down? 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 The tentacles are probably moving like that ... 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.500
 ... octopus-like 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.000
 He looks like he does 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 would do well under water 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.800
 That's great. 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.000
 Very monstrous. I like the many eyes! 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
 How does the monster get into their apartment now? 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 This is a good example of what we do here in the Story Department 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.500
 We have exactly such problems 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.000
 "He is breathing underwater, how can we get him to do it now?" 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 "that he can hang out on land?" 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.500
 My first instinct would be for him to come in a suit 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.200
 but exactly the opposite, like a diving suit 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.200
 which is actually filled with water. 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 Or maybe ... he's in a giant water globe 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
 and has such a little guy caring around him. 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
 That would be one of hundreds of drawings now 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
 which I would create to design a character 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
 ... and then you could put spikes on top of everything. 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:32.000
 I make insect-like monsters tremble. 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.500
 I think clowns are pretty scary 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.500
 I do not know if there will ever be a clown monster 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.500
 Or a monster wearing clown makeup. 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.000
 That would be worse!
