00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:11.770 
let's begin by entering the numbers on

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:17.910 
let's begin by entering the numbers on
the<00:00:12.280> stack<00:00:13.500> 9<00:00:14.500> enter<00:00:15.430> 7<00:00:16.119> enter<00:00:16.360> 5<00:00:16.960> enter<00:00:17.320> 3

now<00:00:25.630> we<00:00:25.689> have<00:00:26.110> the<00:00:26.320> numbers<00:00:26.739> in<00:00:26.919> the<00:00:27.009> stack<00:00:27.250> the

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
now we have the numbers in the stack the

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.319 
now we have the numbers in the stack the
way<00:00:28.000> we<00:00:28.210> have<00:00:28.419> seen<00:00:28.689> them<00:00:28.899> before<00:00:30.029> but<00:00:31.029> instead

33 22 and 11 that way we can see more

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.730 
33 22 and 11 that way we can see more
easily<00:01:32.490> which<00:01:33.490> number<00:01:34.000> is<00:01:34.150> in<00:01:34.330> what<00:01:34.600> level<00:01:34.870> we

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
easily which number is in what level we

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.539 
easily which number is in what level we
see<00:01:36.010> that<00:01:36.250> the<00:01:36.820> number<00:01:37.150> 44<00:01:37.720> is<00:01:38.049> in<00:01:38.470> level<00:01:38.830> 4<00:01:39.190> and

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
see that the number 44 is in level 4 and

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.160 
see that the number 44 is in level 4 and
we<00:01:40.420> are<00:01:40.450> about<00:01:40.810> to<00:01:40.869> start<00:01:41.500> reorganizing<00:01:42.369> them

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
we are about to start reorganizing them

we are about to start reorganizing them
the<00:01:44.170> next<00:01:44.380> thing<00:01:44.710> to<00:01:44.950> do<00:01:45.159> is<00:01:45.520> to<00:01:46.299> swap<00:01:46.930> the<00:01:47.680> two

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
the next thing to do is to swap the two

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.250 
the next thing to do is to swap the two

role<00:03:49.330> right<00:03:49.720> now<00:03:49.930> is<00:03:50.080> defined<00:03:50.500> by<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.739> little

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
role right now is defined by the little

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.340 
role right now is defined by the little
triangle<00:03:51.610> that<00:03:52.320> value<00:03:53.320> when<00:03:53.830> of<00:03:54.100> that<00:03:54.700> rolled

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
triangle that value when of that rolled

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.610 
triangle that value when of that rolled
stack<00:03:56.350> again<00:03:57.280> continue<00:03:57.820> to<00:03:58.000> roll<00:03:58.209> on<00:03:58.620> yeah

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
stack again continue to roll on yeah

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.250 
stack again continue to roll on yeah
absolutely

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
absolutely

eventually<00:04:02.260> I'll<00:04:02.680> have<00:04:02.920> my<00:04:03.070> stack<00:04:03.340> in<00:04:03.519> the

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
eventually I'll have my stack in the

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.570 
eventually I'll have my stack in the
same<00:04:03.850> order<00:04:04.150> it<00:04:04.570> was<00:04:04.810> before<00:04:05.050> so<00:04:06.040> I<00:04:06.070> know<00:04:06.220> how

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
same order it was before so I know how

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.000 
same order it was before so I know how
to<00:04:06.640> swap<00:04:07.030> I<00:04:07.269> know<00:04:07.600> how<00:04:07.900> to<00:04:07.959> roll<00:04:08.290> down<00:04:08.500> I<00:04:08.769> know

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
to swap I know how to roll down I know

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.540 
to swap I know how to roll down I know
how<00:04:09.280> to<00:04:09.340> roll<00:04:09.730> up<00:04:10.260> remember<00:04:11.260> you<00:04:11.830> roll<00:04:12.100> as<00:04:12.280> many

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
how to roll up remember you roll as many

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.600 
how to roll up remember you roll as many
elements<00:04:12.970> as<00:04:13.180> you<00:04:13.390> defined<00:04:13.810> with<00:04:14.800> this<00:04:15.040> little
