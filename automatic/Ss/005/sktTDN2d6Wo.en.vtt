00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
theme but it's completely different from

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.110 
theme but it's completely different from
the<00:00:29.929> other<00:00:30.109> one<00:00:30.670> you<00:00:31.670> have<00:00:31.880> actual<00:00:32.599> live<00:00:32.810> tiles

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:36.560 
the weather changes there were wipers on

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.590 
the weather changes there were wipers on
the<00:00:36.590> last<00:00:36.830> night<00:00:37.040> you<00:00:37.520> can<00:00:37.730> pin<00:00:38.030> whatever<00:00:38.480> you

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
the last night you can pin whatever you

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.970 
the last night you can pin whatever you
want<00:00:38.810> and<00:00:38.990> it'll<00:00:39.200> make<00:00:39.350> it<00:00:39.470> large<00:00:40.570> um<00:00:41.980> it's

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
want and it'll make it large um it's

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.590 
want and it'll make it large um it's
still<00:00:43.280> in<00:00:43.400> beta<00:00:43.550> right<00:00:43.700> now<00:00:43.970> so<00:00:44.240> everything

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
still in beta right now so everything

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.680 
still in beta right now so everything
isn't<00:00:44.900> exactly<00:00:45.260> a<00:00:46.130> tip-top<00:00:47.090> for<00:00:48.080> example<00:00:49.690> this

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
isn't exactly a tip-top for example this

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.580 
isn't exactly a tip-top for example this
says<00:00:50.930> camera<00:00:51.320> but<00:00:51.500> when<00:00:51.620> you<00:00:51.710> touch<00:00:51.860> it<00:00:53.590> so

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
says camera but when you touch it so

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:55.960 
says camera but when you touch it so
every<00:00:54.860> time<00:00:54.890> you<00:00:55.040> open<00:00:55.130> an<00:00:55.430> app<00:00:55.550> it<00:00:55.700> tells<00:00:55.850> you

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
every time you open an app it tells you

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.530 
every time you open an app it tells you
the<00:00:56.150> beta<00:00:56.300> version<00:00:56.390> to<00:00:56.780> donate<00:00:57.200> but<00:00:58.540> whether

00:00:59.530 --> 00:00:59.540 
the beta version to donate but whether

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.480 
the beta version to donate but whether
you<00:00:59.600> touch<00:00:59.780> camera<00:01:00.260> or<00:01:00.470> photos<00:01:00.950> it<00:01:01.220> brings<00:01:01.430> you

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:01.490 
you touch camera or photos it brings you

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.910 
you touch camera or photos it brings you
to<00:01:01.640> this<00:01:01.960> just<00:01:02.960> your<00:01:03.080> just<00:01:03.470> your<00:01:03.500> camera<00:01:03.800> roll

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
to this just your just your camera roll

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.960 
to this just your just your camera roll
so<00:01:04.070> you<00:01:04.129> can't<00:01:04.309> really<00:01:04.339> take<00:01:04.610> a<00:01:04.640> picture

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
so you can't really take a picture

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.550 
so you can't really take a picture
unless<00:01:05.570> you<00:01:05.750> have<00:01:05.840> another<00:01:05.900> appt<00:01:06.350> like

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
unless you have another appt like

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.010 
unless you have another appt like
hipstamatic<00:01:07.310> or<00:01:07.509> camera<00:01:08.509> playoffs<00:01:08.810> or<00:01:08.960> you

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
hipstamatic or camera playoffs or you

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.359 
hipstamatic or camera playoffs or you
know<00:01:09.140> something<00:01:09.320> like<00:01:09.439> that<00:01:09.679> here's<00:01:10.189> what

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
know something like that here's what

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.940 
know something like that here's what
else<00:01:10.490> is<00:01:10.640> cool<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:10.939> little<00:01:11.149> button<00:01:11.390> I<00:01:11.679> can<00:01:12.679> hit

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
else is cool the little button I can hit

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.130 
else is cool the little button I can hit
it<00:01:14.409> actually<00:01:15.409> slides<00:01:15.710> things<00:01:15.979> over<00:01:16.960> which<00:01:17.960> is

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
it actually slides things over which is

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.389 
it actually slides things over which is
really<00:01:18.679> freaking<00:01:19.100> cool<00:01:20.020> um<00:01:21.020> it<00:01:21.920> lists<00:01:22.249> all

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
really freaking cool um it lists all

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:24.300 
really freaking cool um it lists all
your<00:01:22.579> apps<00:01:22.759> and<00:01:22.969> one<00:01:23.119> big<00:01:23.270> thing<00:01:23.299> right<00:01:23.810> here

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
your apps and one big thing right here

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.139 
your apps and one big thing right here
so<00:01:25.310> i<00:01:25.700> guess<00:01:26.509> for<00:01:26.719> example<00:01:27.350> we<00:01:27.530> can<00:01:27.880> pin<00:01:28.880> this

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
so i guess for example we can pin this

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:36.660 
so i guess for example we can pin this
pin<00:01:29.990> to<00:01:30.109> start<00:01:30.170> menu<00:01:30.560> and<00:01:32.890> there<00:01:33.890> it<00:01:33.979> is<00:01:35.170> right

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
pin to start menu and there it is right

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.550 
pin to start menu and there it is right
now<00:01:37.670> you<00:01:37.729> it's<00:01:38.329> free<00:01:38.600> the<00:01:38.810> beta<00:01:38.990> is<00:01:39.200> public

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
now you it's free the beta is public

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.599 
now you it's free the beta is public
it's<00:01:39.710> open<00:01:40.039> you<00:01:40.460> can<00:01:40.640> get<00:01:40.819> it<00:01:40.969> there<00:01:42.399> still<00:01:43.399> a

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:43.609 
it's open you can get it there still a

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:45.010 
it's open you can get it there still a
little<00:01:43.759> boats<00:01:43.999> but<00:01:44.270> that<00:01:44.450> he's<00:01:44.569> working<00:01:44.899> on

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
little boats but that he's working on

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.849 
little boats but that he's working on
home<00:01:45.229> certainly<00:01:46.600> this<00:01:47.600> is<00:01:47.810> really<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.350> most

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:48.859 
home certainly this is really the most

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:52.149 
home certainly this is really the most
intuitive<00:01:49.609> theme<00:01:49.999> i've<00:01:50.210> seen<00:01:50.450> in<00:01:50.689> a<00:01:51.619> very<00:01:51.859> very

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159

very<00:01:52.280> very<00:01:52.369> very<00:01:52.639> long<00:01:52.850> time<00:01:52.880> it<00:01:53.240> takes

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359 
very very very long time it takes

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:55.539 
very very very long time it takes
absolutely<00:01:53.569> no<00:01:54.109> setup<00:01:54.469> nothing<00:01:55.249> required

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
absolutely no setup nothing required

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.800 
absolutely no setup nothing required
