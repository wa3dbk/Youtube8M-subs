uses<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.630> custom<00:01:09.960> crafted<00:01:10.260> base<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:11.010> we're

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
uses the custom crafted base so we're

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.380 
uses the custom crafted base so we're
going<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.250> start<00:01:11.490> with<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.670> custom<00:01:11.970> crafter

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
going to start with the custom crafter

going to start with the custom crafter
so<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.689> gonna<00:01:12.780> put<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.049> down<00:01:13.110> like<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.680> this

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
so you gonna put this down like so this

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.530 
so you gonna put this down like so this
is<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.189> dropper<00:01:14.580> but<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.090> piece<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.360> redstone

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
is a dropper but a piece of redstone

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.219 
is a dropper but a piece of redstone
dust<00:01:15.930> like<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.470> with<00:01:17.450> this<00:01:18.450> recipe<00:01:18.869> like<00:01:18.990> so

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
and then you throw a crafting table on

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.800 
and then you throw a crafting table on
top<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:23.310> create<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.700> custom<00:01:24.000> crafter<00:01:24.390> now<00:01:24.750> you

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
top to create a custom crafter now you

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.289 
top to create a custom crafter now you
can<00:01:24.900> put<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:25.200> recipe<00:01:25.439> here<00:01:25.890> inside<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:27.180> it's

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
can put this recipe here inside so it's

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.030 
can put this recipe here inside so it's

a<00:01:35.960> blast<00:01:36.960> furnace<00:01:37.229> output<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.909> now<00:01:39.030> we<00:01:39.090> need

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
a blast furnace output and now we need

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.910 
a blast furnace output and now we need
to<00:01:39.360> build<00:01:39.540> our<00:01:39.840> blast<00:01:40.259> furnace<00:01:40.560> custom

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
to build our blast furnace custom

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.679 
to build our blast furnace custom
structure<00:01:41.220> around<00:01:41.430> this<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.700> first<00:01:42.000> multi

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
structure around this is the first multi

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.870 
structure around this is the first multi
block<00:01:42.899> structure<00:01:43.530> in<00:01:43.740> game-mode<00:01:44.369> 4<00:01:44.579> so<00:01:44.790> it's

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
block structure in game-mode 4 so it's

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.030 
block structure in game-mode 4 so it's
pretty<00:01:45.030> cool<00:01:45.270> blue<00:01:45.720> if<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.869> did<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.079> great<00:01:46.229> job<00:01:46.290> so

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
pretty cool blue if I did a great job so

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.800 
pretty cool blue if I did a great job so
this<00:01:47.369> works<00:01:47.610> in<00:01:47.729> any<00:01:47.820> orientation<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.780> can

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
this works in any orientation you can

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.050 
this works in any orientation you can
I'll<00:01:49.170> just<00:01:49.439> -<00:01:49.590> I'll<00:01:49.829> put<00:01:50.040> this<00:01:50.189> one<00:01:50.250> facing<00:01:50.939> in

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
I'll just - I'll put this one facing in

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.810 
I'll just - I'll put this one facing in
this<00:01:51.659> direction<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.229> guess<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.649> you're<00:01:53.640> going

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
this direction I guess and you're going

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.840 
this direction I guess and you're going
to<00:01:53.939> want<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.149> put<00:01:54.500> this<00:01:55.500> takes<00:01:55.680> 14<00:01:56.189> iron<00:01:56.610> blocks

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
to want to put this takes 14 iron blocks

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.609 
to want to put this takes 14 iron blocks
total<00:01:57.270> you're<00:01:57.420> gonna<00:01:57.509> put<00:01:57.719> this<00:01:57.899> little<00:01:58.439> shape

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
total you're gonna put this little shape

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.399 
total you're gonna put this little shape
here<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.270> you<00:02:00.270> want<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.509> put<00:02:00.659> another<00:02:01.110> layer

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
here and you want to put another layer

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.929 
here and you want to put another layer
of<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.770> on<00:02:01.920> top<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.490> it's<00:02:02.610> all<00:02:02.700> made<00:02:02.820> out<00:02:02.850> of

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
of that on top so it's all made out of

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.330 
of that on top so it's all made out of
iron<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:03.390> it<00:02:03.479> can<00:02:03.600> get<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:03.899> those<00:02:04.890> all's<00:02:05.159> up

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
iron so it can get that those all's up

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.130 
iron so it can get that those all's up
to<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.520> higher<00:02:05.790> temperature<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.420> then<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.869> glass

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
to a higher temperature and then a glass

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.990 
to a higher temperature and then a glass
block<00:02:07.409> goes<00:02:07.740> on<00:02:07.950> top<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.369> furnace<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:08.879> now

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
block goes on top of the furnace so now

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.540 
block goes on top of the furnace so now
we've<00:02:09.149> got<00:02:09.270> our<00:02:09.300> custom<00:02:10.370> multi<00:02:11.370> block

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
we've got our custom multi block

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.940 
we've got our custom multi block
structure<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.150> we<00:02:13.140> can<00:02:13.349> take

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
structure and we can take

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.970 
structure and we can take
our<00:02:14.069> selves<00:02:14.520> some<00:02:15.240> fuel<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:16.260> piece<00:02:16.620> of<00:02:16.740> iron

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
our selves some fuel and a piece of iron

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.350 
our selves some fuel and a piece of iron
and<00:02:17.250> you'll<00:02:17.400> see<00:02:17.580> that<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.819> iron<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.239> now

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
and you'll see that the iron is now

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.350 
and you'll see that the iron is now
appearing<00:02:18.690> in<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.590> blast<00:02:20.580> furnace<00:02:20.819> output

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
appearing in the blast furnace output

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.070 
appearing in the blast furnace output
here<00:02:21.630> so<00:02:22.170> once<00:02:22.349> this<00:02:22.470> finish<00:02:22.770> is<00:02:22.830> smelting

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
here so once this finish is smelting

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.440 
here so once this finish is smelting
you'll<00:02:25.080> see<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.280> iron<00:02:26.640> disappears

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
you'll see that the iron disappears

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.850 
you'll see that the iron disappears
turns<00:02:27.750> into<00:02:27.870> an<00:02:27.989> ingot<00:02:28.170> we've<00:02:28.260> got<00:02:28.380> one<00:02:28.590> ingot

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
turns into an ingot we've got one ingot

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.890 
turns into an ingot we've got one ingot
in<00:02:28.950> here<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.400> one<00:02:30.030> in<00:02:30.209> get<00:02:30.330> in<00:02:30.450> here<00:02:30.690> now<00:02:30.720> due

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
in here and one in get in here now due

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.720 
in here and one in get in here now due
to<00:02:31.050> limitations<00:02:31.739> with<00:02:31.860> Minecraft<00:02:32.310> we<00:02:32.459> can't

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
to limitations with Minecraft we can't

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.970 
to limitations with Minecraft we can't
get<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.540> extra<00:02:33.900> piece<00:02:34.020> of<00:02:34.050> iron<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:34.500> appear<00:02:34.830> in

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
get the extra piece of iron to appear in

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.160 
get the extra piece of iron to appear in
this<00:02:35.459> furnace<00:02:35.700> we<00:02:36.270> can<00:02:36.510> do<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.750> same<00:02:36.900> thing

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
this furnace we can do the same thing

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.260 
this furnace we can do the same thing
with<00:02:37.680> gold<00:02:38.010> oh<00:02:38.280> let's<00:02:38.670> put<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:38.880> in<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.090> top

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
with gold oh let's put that in the top

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.640 
with gold oh let's put that in the top
slot<00:02:39.480> there<00:02:39.660> we<00:02:39.750> go<00:02:39.870> so<00:02:40.260> you<00:02:40.319> can<00:02:40.350> see<00:02:40.500> there's

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
slot there we go so you can see there's

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.670 
slot there we go so you can see there's
a<00:02:40.680> piece<00:02:40.800> of<00:02:40.860> gold<00:02:41.130> ore<00:02:41.489> in<00:02:41.910> this<00:02:42.330> hopper<00:02:43.319> at

the moment now and once that finishes

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.160 
the moment now and once that finishes
smelting<00:02:46.610> we<00:02:47.610> will<00:02:47.760> have<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.269> piece<00:02:48.900> of<00:02:49.019> iron

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
smelting we will have a piece of iron

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.509 
smelting we will have a piece of iron
and<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.769> piece<00:02:49.950> of<00:02:49.980> gold

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
oops in in this blast furnace output now

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.539 
oops in in this blast furnace output now
if<00:02:54.330> we<00:02:54.540> had<00:02:54.810> say<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.290> piece<00:02:55.650> of<00:02:55.769> iron<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.250> here

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
if we had say a piece of iron in here

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:01.039 
if we had say a piece of iron in here
and<00:02:56.730> we<00:02:57.480> got<00:02:57.780> rid<00:02:58.530> of<00:02:58.590> this<00:02:58.980> glass<00:02:59.549> block<00:03:00.049> the

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
and we got rid of this glass block the

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.530 
and we got rid of this glass block the
structure<00:03:01.500> will<00:03:01.620> fall<00:03:01.830> apart<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:02.400> this<00:03:03.209> won't

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
structure will fall apart and this won't

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.789 
structure will fall apart and this won't
give<00:03:03.810> us<00:03:03.989> a<00:03:05.870> second<00:03:06.870> piece<00:03:07.019> of<00:03:07.140> iron<00:03:07.470> so<00:03:07.709> you

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
give us a second piece of iron so you

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.250 
give us a second piece of iron so you
can<00:03:07.920> see<00:03:08.069> that<00:03:08.250> it's<00:03:08.370> just<00:03:08.840> not<00:03:09.840> put<00:03:10.049> anything

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
can see that it's just not put anything

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.930 
can see that it's just not put anything
out<00:03:10.470> at<00:03:10.650> all<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:11.100> you<00:03:11.220> can't<00:03:11.430> pick<00:03:11.580> this<00:03:11.730> piece

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
out at all and you can't pick this piece

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:12.920 
out at all and you can't pick this piece
of<00:03:12.060> iron<00:03:12.180> up<00:03:12.330> with<00:03:12.480> your<00:03:12.569> hand<00:03:12.780> or<00:03:12.870> anything

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
of iron up with your hand or anything

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.620 
of iron up with your hand or anything
like<00:03:13.290> that<00:03:13.350> so<00:03:14.280> you'll<00:03:14.970> need<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.239> have<00:03:15.390> that

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
like that so you'll need to have that

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.420 
like that so you'll need to have that
structure<00:03:16.230> completely<00:03:16.799> intact

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
structure completely intact

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.349 
structure completely intact
for<00:03:18.359> for<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.079> blast<00:03:19.290> furnace<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:19.829> work<00:03:20.359> so

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
for for the blast furnace to work so

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.030 
for for the blast furnace to work so
what<00:03:21.840> because<00:03:22.260> these<00:03:22.440> don't<00:03:22.709> come<00:03:22.859> together

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
what because these don't come together

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.220 
what because these don't come together
by<00:03:23.459> the<00:03:23.489> way<00:03:23.730> it's<00:03:24.180> something<00:03:24.390> you<00:03:24.480> can<00:03:24.660> do<00:03:24.840> to

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
by the way it's something you can do to

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.009 
by the way it's something you can do to
just<00:03:25.430> combine<00:03:26.430> your<00:03:26.820> outputs<00:03:27.239> is<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.870> go

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
just combine your outputs is to go

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:32.240 
just combine your outputs is to go
underneath<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:29.310> put<00:03:29.549> a<00:03:29.730> chest<00:03:31.040> here<00:03:32.040> in

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.770 
underneath and to put a chest here in
front<00:03:32.579> of<00:03:32.730> your<00:03:32.880> blast<00:03:33.239> furnace<00:03:33.570> and<00:03:33.690> then

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
front of your blast furnace and then

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.319 
front of your blast furnace and then
just<00:03:33.989> put<00:03:34.170> three<00:03:34.859> hoppers<00:03:35.250> like<00:03:35.400> so<00:03:35.670> to

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
just put three hoppers like so to

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.210 
just put three hoppers like so to
hoppers<00:03:36.510> even<00:03:36.870> so<00:03:37.410> this<00:03:37.500> will<00:03:37.680> actually<00:03:37.920> pull

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
hoppers even so this will actually pull

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.810 
hoppers even so this will actually pull
the<00:03:39.079> material<00:03:40.079> out<00:03:40.560> of<00:03:40.799> the<00:03:40.920> furnace<00:03:41.100> and<00:03:41.459> out

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
the material out of the furnace and out

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.220 
the material out of the furnace and out
of<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.090> output<00:03:42.239> here<00:03:42.630> and<00:03:42.780> put<00:03:42.900> them<00:03:43.019> in<00:03:43.109> one

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
of the output here and put them in one

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.920 
of the output here and put them in one
place<00:03:43.260> so<00:03:43.709> if<00:03:43.799> we<00:03:43.980> just<00:03:44.820> smelt<00:03:45.120> one<00:03:45.630> more<00:03:45.780> piece

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
place so if we just smelt one more piece

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.830 
place so if we just smelt one more piece
of<00:03:45.959> iron<00:03:46.290> here<00:03:46.910> you<00:03:47.910> should<00:03:48.120> see<00:03:48.329> that<00:03:48.570> we'll

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
of iron here you should see that we'll

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.509 
of iron here you should see that we'll
end<00:03:48.959> up<00:03:49.019> with<00:03:49.079> two<00:03:49.170> ingots<00:03:49.650> in<00:03:49.920> this<00:03:50.190> chest<00:03:50.430> I

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
end up with two ingots in this chest I

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:51.740 
end up with two ingots in this chest I
think<00:03:50.640> that<00:03:50.730> was<00:03:50.820> a<00:03:50.850> leftover<00:03:51.180> ingot<00:03:51.600> from

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
think that was a leftover ingot from

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.280 
think that was a leftover ingot from
before<00:03:52.079> so<00:03:53.750> wait<00:03:54.750> for<00:03:54.989> it<00:03:56.690> we<00:03:57.690> go<00:03:57.870> and<00:03:58.140> we'll

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
before so wait for it we go and we'll

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.630 
before so wait for it we go and we'll
end<00:03:58.410> up<00:03:58.440> with<00:03:58.500> two<00:03:58.620> ingots<00:03:59.100> in<00:03:59.190> this<00:03:59.310> chest<00:03:59.519> so

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
end up with two ingots in this chest so

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.099 
end up with two ingots in this chest so
that's<00:03:59.790> the<00:03:59.880> best<00:04:00.060> way<00:04:00.209> to<00:04:00.239> to<00:04:00.840> get<00:04:00.959> your

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
that's the best way to to get your

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:02.720 
that's the best way to to get your
outputs<00:04:01.500> connected<00:04:02.100> up<00:04:02.220> with<00:04:02.250> this<00:04:02.489> blast

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
outputs connected up with this blast

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.500 
outputs connected up with this blast
furnace<00:04:03.180> and<00:04:03.359> that's<00:04:03.930> basically<00:04:04.350> it<00:04:05.510> thank

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
furnace and that's basically it thank

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.220
