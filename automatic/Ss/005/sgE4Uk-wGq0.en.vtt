00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:20.429

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:26.310
 we go crystals i first 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:29.509
 shake chase advertising here click 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:34.670

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:39.829
 click on download archive there will be 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.829
 config all players here we go Edward 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:49.500
 so then to set the tip well 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.380
 there are two kinds of how to say and two ways 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.390
 tip installations each do 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.659
 in its own way 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:01.890
 ie personally I do like that we take for example 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:09.619
 markelov config and mouse mouse 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:13.160
 Mouse key take the mark of the brand la creme 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.160
 rename it to 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.220
 here we go in the folder where we have 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.769
 your counter-strike 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:29.310
 cstrike here we scroll through the list themselves 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:32.910
 We set ourselves see here there is such 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.819
 file cafe format tip that is possible 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.970
 open it see this here personally my 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:41.639
 config with which I just drag on 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:46.910
 shooting at low fps if anyone needs 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:55.620
 there will be me and that is not all of course but this one 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:58.799
 here and throw here this circuit 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:04.430
 on her to do it because he is such a shit 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:04.430
 my best here is the same 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:16.890
 you can also just take this tip and 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:22.670
 move folder with counter strike after 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:25.739
 then run the counter strike itself and 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.250
 run your counter-strike you must 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:34.349
 will write 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:39.540
 here so as juice and the name of the file that is 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:48.680
 as if edward was like a steel 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:55.049
 Well, in general, and prescribe markels . 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:57.569
 Here we write these markers . 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:00.900
 it immediately changes all camera settings 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:05.840
 that is, the sound of the sight sleeve that you 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:09.239
 hold the weapon that is left right here 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.269
 everything would change if so how 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:14.720
 becomes candy intercom white or 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:18.769
 or as to whom you would like 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.880
 put the config on it all 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.310
