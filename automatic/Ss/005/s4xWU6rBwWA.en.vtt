platform<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:05.100> want<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.340> use<00:02:05.550> you<00:02:05.820> can<00:02:06.000> use

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
platform you want to use you can use

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:20.790 
platform you want to use you can use
Google<00:02:06.780> Maps<00:02:08.030> and<00:02:09.030> there<00:02:09.929> we<00:02:10.020> go

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.820
