 how he went to querétaro he returned what 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.870
 they threw me out of Mexico so fast we were 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:13.420
 a couple of weeks working very hard on 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.510
 pro tennis my beloved's academy 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.070
 friend gregorio hidalgo chicken and good 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.710
 we had to go back we have to do 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.080
 things here yet and we said we're not going 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.300
 to go from Miami without making another video 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.039
 thank you very much to Andrew for your help and 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.619
 your time 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.480
 I really appreciate it from the heart all 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.110
 We appreciate a great greeting for the 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.910
 professor joaquin de murcia I think that the 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.890
 club is called pacheco tower children 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.140
 who asked us to send greetings 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.530
 many of them and all the people 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.680
 who writes us week by week 3 tips 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.920
 to improve your tennis and to continue 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:54.190
 evolving now that we are in this 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.020
 amazing australian open where I make a 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.390
 reflection we do not have tennis players 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.030
 Latin American South Americans 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.590
 even the juniors ok then good 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.969
 We are obviously spending a period 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.310
 of transition there are very good players 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.570
 in Latin America but obviously 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.780
 we are staying 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.390
 back with regard to europe and tennis 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.640
 female American is enjoying 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:20.850
 very good health let's go to the tips 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.450
 tip number 1 open stands position 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.310
 open legs care coaches is 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.350
 you really have to play in open these 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.740
 many times even the setbacks I'm 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.160
 totally agree but tennis but the 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.030
 theme is this you do not have to teach it 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.479
 deliberately to a little boy a little girl 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.070
 stick to open position that's not going to be 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.900
 a need according to the speed 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.840
 of the ball and the depth of the shot 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.240
 or to the position of the court if the camera 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.190
 It obviously follows me if I'm close in 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.539
 a very open ball of the line of 5 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.030
 this doubles and I have to get in 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.100
 open position is going to be very uncomfortable and 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.410
 unnatural to get like that then 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.130
 obviously the boy the girl are going to 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:05.460
 adapt and adjust to that subject then I 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.399
 personally I teach good supports and 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.229
 side with body transfer and 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.100
 passages of the back leg in both 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.100
 hold right 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.800
 but beware of allowing excess 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.880
 the open to open position 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.190
 especially when they come but so 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.910
 easy children do this 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:30.000
 Teach them to pass the foot and they will move 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.790
 much better and they are really going to improve their 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.560
 tennis and put it on another level tip number 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.450
 two 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.630
 teach three strokes that should never 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.510
 be forgotten in the list of 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.420
 shots to show the shot if the 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.190
 director follows me from behind to be able 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.650
 follow that is the loop shot and bolt the 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.930
 semi balloon we say that is the shot that the 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:58.590
 ball and the camera follows the trajectory of 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:03:00.690
 the ball the ball travels a height 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.000
 over the network very sure that obviously 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.910
 will allow the player to exit 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.830
 difficult situations and play a 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.160
 high and complicated ball upside down 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.530
 especially sorry to play a ball 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.360
 complicated on the reverse especially 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.240
 it causes a lot of damage 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.760
 high on the reverse especially in 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:24.030
 slow courts but they are shots there 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.820
 that show the other shots the slide does not 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.730
 let's forget that the camera follows me 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:33.390
 backhand slice does a lot of damage already 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.910
 we've made likes videos teach it and 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.410
 in the short angles 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.410
 looking at the shorts 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.290
 they are three shots three different shots 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.409
 blows that we have to teach from 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.120
 early ages and number three what is 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.890
 one of the best tactics that can be 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.590
 incorporate the players when 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.829
 we form the cross pattern from children 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.349
 reverse because if the Headmaster me 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:02.510
 follow and imagine we imagine that 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:06.109
 I'm competing with a player and I 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.730
 I'm sticking crossed to your corner ok me 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:10.639
 what he achieved here is to have it in the 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.819
 corner of your back will not allow you to use 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:15.789
 your right true and force it maybe 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.959
 throw some tougher shots of tennis 

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:21.949
 grab a couple of balls that is the reverse 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:24.680
 parallel makes complicated shots very 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:26.300
 difficult to perform under pressure now 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.550
 I got it right because I do not have pressure and 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.830
 the ball stops me with my hand but it's 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.650
 a very complicated shot then it 's easy 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.169
 with crossed backhand helps to study 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.020
 the weaknesses and strengths of the rival and 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:42.320
 forces him to make a parallel change very 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.030
 risky ok in addition if the rival us 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.100
 throws the ball the central area 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.540
 does not achieve very good precision we can 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.270
 use our right to attack 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.160
 work on that tactical pattern from 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.500
 initial ages and their players are going to 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.560
 win many more games we're going to 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.260
 dismiss for a while I hope they have 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.780
 enjoyed these three tips that we have 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.790
 presented today and to tell you 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.740
