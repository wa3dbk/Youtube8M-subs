tiara it's just a series of swirlies so
I<00:01:06.570> start<00:01:07.130> about<00:01:08.130> right<00:01:08.430> here

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
I start about right here

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.490 
I start about right here
and<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.680> do

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.980 

and<00:01:14.590> then<00:01:15.280> I<00:01:15.400> do<00:01:15.460> one<00:01:15.910> going<00:01:16.300> the<00:01:16.420> opposite<00:01:16.930> way

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.800 
and then I do one going the opposite way
going<00:01:19.990> down<00:01:20.730> and<00:01:21.730> add<00:01:21.820> a<00:01:21.970> little<00:01:22.360> one<00:01:22.570> down
