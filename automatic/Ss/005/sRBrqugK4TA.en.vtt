that<00:03:58.290> is<00:03:58.530> at<00:03:58.829> 500<00:03:59.519> subscribers<00:04:00.060> I<00:04:00.299> think<00:04:01.140> as<00:04:01.799> of

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
that is at 500 subscribers I think as of

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.300 
that is at 500 subscribers I think as of
the<00:04:02.280> time<00:04:02.459> of<00:04:02.519> recording<00:04:03.090> this<00:04:03.269> I<00:04:03.540> am<00:04:03.810> at<00:04:04.280> but<00:04:05.280> i

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
the time of recording this I am at but i

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.259 
the time of recording this I am at but i
want<00:04:05.670> to<00:04:05.730> say<00:04:05.790> 129<00:04:06.590> so<00:04:07.590> 500<00:04:08.310> seems<00:04:08.610> pretty<00:04:09.030> far

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
want to say 129 so 500 seems pretty far

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:10.970 
want to say 129 so 500 seems pretty far
off<00:04:09.299> and<00:04:09.780> in<00:04:09.870> terms<00:04:10.110> of<00:04:10.200> percentages<00:04:10.739> it's

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
off and in terms of percentages it's

off and in terms of percentages it's
pretty<00:04:11.489> far<00:04:11.700> off<00:04:11.760> but<00:04:12.329> I<00:04:13.049> i<00:04:13.410> think<00:04:14.010> i<00:04:14.100> can<00:04:14.250> get

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340
