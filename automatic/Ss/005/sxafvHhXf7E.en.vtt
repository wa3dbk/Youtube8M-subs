00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.940 
was a state mobilization fire a type
three<00:03:03.819> fire<00:03:04.090> which<00:03:04.510> is<00:03:04.690> not<00:03:04.840> usually<00:03:05.620> a<00:03:05.650> real

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
three fire which is not usually a real

three fire which is not usually a real
not<00:03:06.489> typically<00:03:06.819> a<00:03:06.910> real<00:03:07.090> big<00:03:07.360> one<00:03:07.569> as<00:03:07.810> far<00:03:07.959> as

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
not typically a real big one as far as

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.770 
not typically a real big one as far as
command<00:03:08.410> structure<00:03:08.849> but<00:03:09.849> I<00:03:09.910> have<00:03:10.120> never<00:03:10.360> seen

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
command structure but I have never seen

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.809 
command structure but I have never seen
so<00:03:11.019> many<00:03:11.200> air<00:03:11.500> resources<00:03:12.099> I<00:03:12.250> mean<00:03:12.430> there<00:03:12.640> was

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
so many air resources I mean there was

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.270 
so many air resources I mean there was
jet<00:03:13.480> drop<00:03:13.780> after<00:03:13.959> drop<00:03:14.140> after<00:03:14.470> dropping<00:03:15.040> that

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
jet drop after drop after dropping that

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.330 
jet drop after drop after dropping that
viel<00:03:15.580> at<00:03:15.760> that<00:03:15.970> big<00:03:16.180> tanker<00:03:16.599> I<00:03:16.950> saw<00:03:17.950> that<00:03:18.130> thing

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
viel at that big tanker I saw that thing

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.699 
viel at that big tanker I saw that thing
dropped<00:03:19.180> no<00:03:19.329> less<00:03:19.540> than<00:03:19.780> probably<00:03:20.290> seven

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
dropped no less than probably seven

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.960 
dropped no less than probably seven
times<00:03:20.980> I<00:03:21.340> think<00:03:22.120> that's<00:03:22.299> close<00:03:23.019> to<00:03:23.970> $70,000

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
times I think that's close to $70,000

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.120 
times I think that's close to $70,000
each<00:03:25.090> time<00:03:25.329> it<00:03:25.480> drops<00:03:25.599> if<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.620> main<00:03:26.799> I<00:03:26.950> guess

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
each time it drops if the main I guess

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.990 
each time it drops if the main I guess
the<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:28.060> checkbook<00:03:28.510> was<00:03:28.660> open<00:03:29.079> yesterday<00:03:30.000> but
