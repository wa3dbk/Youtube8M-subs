Lightroom as being kind of the best or
the<00:00:17.500> most<00:00:17.680> important<00:00:18.130> part<00:00:18.310> of<00:00:18.370> bridge<00:00:18.670> but

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
the most important part of bridge but

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.640 
the most important part of bridge but
really<00:00:19.630> all<00:00:19.750> just<00:00:20.200> combined<00:00:20.470> with<00:00:20.619> a

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
really all just combined with a

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.350 
really all just combined with a
stripped-down<00:00:21.160> version<00:00:21.640> of<00:00:21.760> Photoshop<00:00:22.330> and

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
stripped-down version of Photoshop and

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.780 
stripped-down version of Photoshop and
kind<00:00:23.020> of<00:00:23.110> more<00:00:23.290> like<00:00:23.680> an<00:00:23.860> enhanced<00:00:24.430> version<00:00:24.490> of

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:24.790 
kind of more like an enhanced version of

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.300 
kind of more like an enhanced version of
Photoshop<00:00:25.240> Camera<00:00:25.600> Raw<00:00:25.860> the<00:00:26.860> problem<00:00:27.220> with

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
Photoshop Camera Raw the problem with

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.920 
Photoshop Camera Raw the problem with
thinking<00:00:27.700> of<00:00:27.880> it<00:00:28.000> that<00:00:28.029> way<00:00:28.180> is<00:00:28.540> that<00:00:28.689> it<00:00:28.840> kind

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:28.930 
thinking of it that way is that it kind

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.950 
thinking of it that way is that it kind
of<00:00:29.050> lends<00:00:29.470> it<00:00:29.680> itself<00:00:30.369> to<00:00:30.520> the<00:00:30.610> idea<00:00:30.640> that

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
of lends it itself to the idea that

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.240 
of lends it itself to the idea that
Lightroom<00:00:31.960> in<00:00:32.110> and<00:00:32.230> of<00:00:32.290> itself<00:00:32.590> isn't<00:00:32.860> a<00:00:33.070> very

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
Lightroom in and of itself isn't a very

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.549 
Lightroom in and of itself isn't a very
powerful<00:00:33.489> editor<00:00:34.140> well<00:00:35.140> that<00:00:35.260> couldn't<00:00:35.500> be

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
powerful editor well that couldn't be

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.619 
powerful editor well that couldn't be
more<00:00:35.770> untrue<00:00:36.210> Lightroom<00:00:37.210> is<00:00:37.330> actually

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
more untrue Lightroom is actually

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:39.630 
more untrue Lightroom is actually
extremely<00:00:38.020> powerful<00:00:38.620> and<00:00:38.890> like<00:00:39.370> I<00:00:39.460> said

go from that to our next image this is

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.460 
go from that to our next image this is
the<00:02:15.760> first<00:02:16.060> virtual<00:02:16.390> copy<00:02:16.629> which<00:02:16.900> is<00:02:17.019> just<00:02:17.230> a

the first virtual copy which is just a

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.290 
the first virtual copy which is just a

image this is what our studio would

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:22.259 
image this is what our studio would
consider<00:02:21.489> color<00:02:21.790> correct

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
consider color correct

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.429 
consider color correct
everybody's<00:02:22.659> gonna<00:02:22.810> be<00:02:22.900> different<00:02:23.079> and<00:02:23.319> have

and<00:03:13.050> then<00:03:14.050> I've<00:03:14.170> dropped<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.620> shadows<00:03:15.010> I've

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
and then I've dropped the shadows I've

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.610 
and then I've dropped the shadows I've
dropped<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.580> saturation<00:03:16.060> and<00:03:16.959> kind<00:03:17.590> of

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
dropped the saturation and kind of

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.140 
dropped the saturation and kind of
deepened<00:03:17.980> the<00:03:18.040> blacks<00:03:18.280> quite<00:03:18.580> a<00:03:18.610> bit<00:03:18.820> to<00:03:18.970> make

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
deepened the blacks quite a bit to make

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.270 
deepened the blacks quite a bit to make
it<00:03:19.180> into<00:03:19.720> a<00:03:19.750> nice<00:03:20.110> little<00:03:20.350> vintage<00:03:20.650> looking

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
it into a nice little vintage looking

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.660 
it into a nice little vintage looking
shot<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:24.070> next<00:03:24.280> one<00:03:24.370> it<00:03:24.459> might<00:03:24.520> be<00:03:24.610> a

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
shot and the next one it might be a

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.040 
shot and the next one it might be a
little<00:03:24.820> bit<00:03:24.910> hard<00:03:25.060> to<00:03:25.120> see<00:03:25.209> with<00:03:25.510> this<00:03:25.660> one<00:03:25.810> but

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
little bit hard to see with this one but

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.500 
little bit hard to see with this one but
this<00:03:26.590> next<00:03:26.860> one<00:03:26.980> is<00:03:27.010> a<00:03:27.250> tilt<00:03:27.880> shift<00:03:27.940> or<00:03:28.270> a<00:03:28.330> lens

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.260 
this next one is a tilt shift or a lens
baby<00:03:28.780> kind<00:03:29.050> of<00:03:29.140> imitation<00:03:29.709> so<00:03:30.700> if<00:03:30.820> you<00:03:30.910> go<00:03:31.060> back

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
baby kind of imitation so if you go back

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.990 
baby kind of imitation so if you go back
and<00:03:31.420> you<00:03:31.510> look<00:03:31.630> at<00:03:31.780> our<00:03:31.840> original<00:03:32.380> one<00:03:32.890> you<00:03:33.850> can

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.880 
and you look at our original one you can
see<00:03:34.150> that<00:03:34.180> how<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:34.720> detail<00:03:35.260> here<00:03:35.290> drops<00:03:35.709> off
