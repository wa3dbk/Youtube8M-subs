stick<00:02:30.110> it<00:02:30.230> out<00:02:30.350> so<00:02:30.590> that<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.890> Fed<00:02:31.130> wrap

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
stick it out so that the Fed wrap

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.670 
stick it out so that the Fed wrap
doesn't<00:02:31.490> cut<00:02:31.820> into<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.150> skin<00:02:32.380> but<00:02:33.380> you<00:02:33.470> see

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
doesn't cut into the skin but you see

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.320 
doesn't cut into the skin but you see
that<00:02:33.890> this<00:02:34.460> is<00:02:34.670> going<00:02:34.820> to<00:02:34.940> slide<00:02:35.120> down<00:02:35.240> a

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
that this is going to slide down a

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.020 
that this is going to slide down a
little<00:02:35.600> because<00:02:36.320> of<00:02:36.710> you<00:02:36.890> know<00:02:37.010> gravity<00:02:37.340> but

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
little because of you know gravity but

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.630 
little because of you know gravity but
that<00:02:38.390> stirrup<00:02:39.200> is<00:02:39.650> gonna<00:02:39.890> hold<00:02:40.130> it<00:02:40.250> from

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
that stirrup is gonna hold it from

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.510 
that stirrup is gonna hold it from
falling<00:02:40.820> off<00:02:41.090> so<00:02:42.080> you<00:02:42.140> have<00:02:42.380> it<00:02:43.130> works<00:02:43.340> really

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
falling off so you have it works really

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.670 
falling off so you have it works really
good<00:02:43.760> and<00:02:43.910> that<00:02:44.090> is<00:02:44.270> like<00:02:44.510> you<00:02:45.440> know<00:02:45.470> and

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
good and that is like you know and

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.170 
good and that is like you know and
that's<00:02:45.800> only<00:02:45.950> one<00:02:46.220> little<00:02:46.670> piece<00:02:46.850> of<00:02:47.030> cotton

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
that's only one little piece of cotton

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.970 
that's only one little piece of cotton
so<00:02:47.540> if<00:02:47.630> you<00:02:47.720> need<00:02:47.900> to<00:02:48.020> splint<00:02:48.350> you<00:02:48.500> can<00:02:48.650> see<00:02:48.830> how

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
so if you need to splint you can see how

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.730 
so if you need to splint you can see how
could<00:02:49.220> you<00:02:49.400> make<00:02:49.670> that<00:02:50.200> if<00:02:51.200> I<00:02:51.320> was<00:02:51.500> going<00:02:51.650> to

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
could you make that if I was going to

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.000 
could you make that if I was going to
make<00:02:51.890> a<00:02:51.920> splint<00:02:52.460> that<00:02:52.610> I<00:02:52.790> really<00:02:53.270> needed<00:02:53.300> it

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
make a splint that I really needed it

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.850 
make a splint that I really needed it
secure<00:02:55.010> I<00:02:55.840> probably<00:02:56.840> would<00:02:57.140> not<00:02:57.260> use<00:02:57.440> the<00:02:57.620> tape

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
secure I probably would not use the tape

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.560 
secure I probably would not use the tape
obviously<00:02:58.790> because<00:02:58.910> I<00:02:59.150> don't<00:02:59.300> want<00:02:59.330> to<00:02:59.510> be

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
obviously because I don't want to be

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:06.370 
obviously because I don't want to be
messing<00:02:59.750> with<00:02:59.930> the<00:03:00.110> leg<00:03:02.050> pepper<00:03:03.910> okay<00:03:05.380> yeah

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
messing with the leg pepper okay yeah

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.600 
messing with the leg pepper okay yeah
pizza<00:03:06.920> did<00:03:07.070> me<00:03:07.220> ok<00:03:07.630> let's<00:03:08.630> go<00:03:08.930> fer<00:03:09.290> de<00:03:09.740> on<00:03:10.010> for<00:03:10.580> a

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
pizza did me ok let's go fer de on for a

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.460 
pizza did me ok let's go fer de on for a
longer<00:03:10.850> time<00:03:11.000> to<00:03:11.180> what<00:03:11.570> are<00:03:11.630> you<00:03:11.720> really<00:03:11.930> I

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
longer time to what are you really I

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.040 
longer time to what are you really I
usually<00:03:13.250> didn't<00:03:13.850> take<00:03:14.000> them<00:03:14.180> off<00:03:14.360> if<00:03:14.660> I<00:03:14.840> was

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
usually didn't take them off if I was

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.490 
usually didn't take them off if I was
just<00:03:15.200> changing<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:15.650> bandage<00:03:17.050> still<00:03:18.050> on<00:03:18.230> there

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
just changing the bandage still on there

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.800 
just changing the bandage still on there
and<00:03:19.310> that's<00:03:19.459> what<00:03:19.670> I<00:03:19.700> started<00:03:20.390> knowing<00:03:20.510> toward

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
and that's what I started knowing toward

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.410 
and that's what I started knowing toward
the<00:03:20.900> end<00:03:21.050> but<00:03:21.550> when<00:03:22.550> I<00:03:22.580> was<00:03:22.760> doing<00:03:22.880> but<00:03:23.270> he's

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
the end but when I was doing but he's

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.270 
the end but when I was doing but he's
physical<00:03:23.870> therapy<00:03:24.290> I<00:03:24.440> had<00:03:24.620> to<00:03:24.709> get<00:03:24.830> the<00:03:24.950> van<00:03:25.100> at

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
physical therapy I had to get the van at

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.630 
physical therapy I had to get the van at
the<00:03:25.489> tape<00:03:25.700> off<00:03:25.880> it<00:03:26.300> was<00:03:26.510> keeping<00:03:27.140> is<00:03:27.640> it

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
the tape off it was keeping is it

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.120 
the tape off it was keeping is it
wouldn't<00:03:28.910> look<00:03:28.970> like<00:03:29.290> yeah<00:03:30.290> but<00:03:30.770> yeah<00:03:30.890> toward

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
wouldn't look like yeah but yeah toward

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.260 
wouldn't look like yeah but yeah toward
the<00:03:31.220> end<00:03:31.370> I<00:03:31.489> was<00:03:31.610> starting<00:03:31.880> to<00:03:31.910> leave<00:03:32.090> it<00:03:32.209> on

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
the end I was starting to leave it on

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.229 
the end I was starting to leave it on
because<00:03:32.810> it<00:03:33.380> really<00:03:33.590> was<00:03:34.160> getting<00:03:34.310> I<00:03:34.730> was

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
because it really was getting I was

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:42.820 
because it really was getting I was
getting<00:03:35.390> buddy<00:03:35.840> Boyle<00:03:41.530> jumping<00:03:42.530> up<00:03:42.650> and<00:03:42.739> down

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
getting buddy Boyle jumping up and down

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.310 
getting buddy Boyle jumping up and down
the<00:03:43.090> end<00:03:45.580> so<00:03:46.580> that<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:47.510> outer<00:03:47.720> part<00:03:48.080> of<00:03:48.260> the

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
the end so that the outer part of the

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.090 
the end so that the outer part of the
toenails<00:03:48.800> coming<00:03:49.130> off<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:49.459> yeah

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
toenails coming off and yeah

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.890 
toenails coming off and yeah
there<00:03:50.430> yeah<00:03:50.730> if<00:03:51.000> you<00:03:51.180> can<00:03:51.390> get<00:03:51.480> that<00:03:51.540> outer

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
there yeah if you can get that outer

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.170 
there yeah if you can get that outer
shell<00:03:52.260> off<00:03:52.500> without<00:03:53.100> too<00:03:53.400> much<00:03:53.520> pain<00:03:53.790> just

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
shell off without too much pain just

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.690 
shell off without too much pain just
pull<00:03:54.420> it<00:03:54.510> off<00:03:55.220> sometimes<00:03:56.220> you<00:03:56.340> need<00:03:56.460> to<00:03:56.520> get

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
pull it off sometimes you need to get

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.600 
pull it off sometimes you need to get
those<00:03:56.850> the<00:03:57.030> data<00:03:57.240> to<00:03:57.480> do<00:03:57.600> that<00:03:58.310> but<00:03:59.310> then<00:03:59.490> you

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
those the data to do that but then you

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.220 
those the data to do that but then you
can<00:03:59.790> you<00:04:00.000> can<00:04:00.150> use<00:04:00.300> this<00:04:00.450> put<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:00.840> gauze<00:04:01.020> over

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
can you can use this put the gauze over

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.350 
can you can use this put the gauze over
you<00:04:02.160> can<00:04:02.310> even<00:04:02.400> put<00:04:02.520> a<00:04:02.640> little<00:04:02.790> way<00:04:02.970> to<00:04:03.030> biotic

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
you can even put a little way to biotic

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.960 
you can even put a little way to biotic
ointment<00:04:03.600> on<00:04:03.870> there<00:04:04.140> and<00:04:04.290> put<00:04:04.410> in<00:04:04.530> 1<00:04:04.820> and<00:04:05.820> use

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
ointment on there and put in 1 and use

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.990 
ointment on there and put in 1 and use
this<00:04:06.050> but<00:04:07.050> if<00:04:07.170> you're<00:04:07.260> splinting<00:04:07.950> this<00:04:08.820> is<00:04:08.970> a

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
this but if you're splinting this is a

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.450 
this but if you're splinting this is a
nice<00:04:09.210> stretchy<00:04:09.600> cost<00:04:10.010> so<00:04:11.010> it<00:04:11.070> doesn't<00:04:11.340> get<00:04:11.400> too

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:11.460 
nice stretchy cost so it doesn't get too

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.120 
nice stretchy cost so it doesn't get too
tight<00:04:11.820> if<00:04:12.420> you<00:04:12.570> can<00:04:12.750> have<00:04:12.900> some<00:04:13.110> of<00:04:13.140> that<00:04:13.230> and

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
tight if you can have some of that and

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.860 
tight if you can have some of that and
for<00:04:14.400> splinting<00:04:14.850> when<00:04:14.970> I<00:04:15.000> need<00:04:15.240> lots<00:04:15.450> of<00:04:15.690> thick

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
for splinting when I need lots of thick

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.410 
for splinting when I need lots of thick
layers<00:04:16.140> I<00:04:17.690> would<00:04:18.690> just<00:04:18.720> use<00:04:19.050> this<00:04:19.730> in<00:04:20.730> between

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:21.420 
layers I would just use this in between

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.610 
layers I would just use this in between
to<00:04:22.410> hold<00:04:22.710> it<00:04:23.000> and<00:04:24.000> you<00:04:24.030> pull<00:04:24.300> pretty<00:04:24.570> snug<00:04:24.870> and

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
to hold it and you pull pretty snug and

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.060 
to hold it and you pull pretty snug and
then<00:04:26.280> you<00:04:26.370> do<00:04:26.490> another<00:04:26.760> layer<00:04:27.000> and<00:04:27.890> you<00:04:28.890> can

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
then you do another layer and you can

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.050 
then you do another layer and you can
get<00:04:29.250> it<00:04:29.370> so<00:04:30.050> so<00:04:31.050> secure<00:04:31.650> but<00:04:32.340> that<00:04:32.490> leg<00:04:32.700> is<00:04:32.880> not

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
get it so so secure but that leg is not

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.620 
get it so so secure but that leg is not
going<00:04:33.270> to<00:04:33.360> move<00:04:34.640> but<00:04:35.640> for<00:04:35.850> basic<00:04:36.180> first<00:04:36.420> day

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
going to move but for basic first day

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.420 
going to move but for basic first day
and<00:04:36.810> if<00:04:36.900> you<00:04:36.990> just<00:04:37.230> use<00:04:37.290> one<00:04:37.710> layer<00:04:37.950> and<00:04:38.280> your

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
and if you just use one layer and your

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.740 
and if you just use one layer and your
background<00:04:38.850> you<00:04:39.030> don't<00:04:39.210> even<00:04:39.330> need<00:04:39.570> this

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
background you don't even need this

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.640 
background you don't even need this
cause<00:04:41.360> you<00:04:42.360> know<00:04:42.480> that's<00:04:42.780> died<00:04:43.050> really<00:04:43.500> you're

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
cause you know that's died really you're

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.340 
cause you know that's died really you're
headed<00:04:43.980> for<00:04:44.010> the<00:04:44.250> vet<00:04:44.430> ideally<00:04:44.970> yes<00:04:45.300> but<00:04:46.170> for

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
headed for the vet ideally yes but for

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.650 
headed for the vet ideally yes but for
the<00:04:46.470> Tonio<00:04:46.830> problem<00:04:47.340> or<00:04:47.580> you<00:04:47.940> know<00:04:48.030> they<00:04:48.180> step

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
the Tonio problem or you know they step

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.150 
the Tonio problem or you know they step
on<00:04:48.780> a<00:04:48.810> piece<00:04:49.050> of<00:04:49.080> glass<00:04:49.230> or<00:04:49.710> something<00:04:49.800> cut

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
on a piece of glass or something cut

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.630 
on a piece of glass or something cut
their<00:04:50.310> total<00:04:50.730> pepper<00:04:51.060> their<00:04:51.390> pad<00:04:52.580> you<00:04:53.580> know

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
their total pepper their pad you know

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.090 
their total pepper their pad you know
this<00:04:53.790> works<00:04:54.000> really<00:04:54.240> good<00:04:54.510> put<00:04:54.810> this<00:04:54.990> so<00:04:55.740> if

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
this works really good put this so if

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.730 
this works really good put this so if
something<00:04:56.610> like<00:04:56.760> that<00:04:56.820> did<00:04:57.330> happen<00:04:57.600> and<00:04:58.140> and

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
something like that did happen and and

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.100 
something like that did happen and and
you<00:04:58.890> were<00:04:59.010> just<00:04:59.220> trying<00:04:59.460> to<00:04:59.850> let<00:05:00.660> the<00:05:00.840> healing

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
you were just trying to let the healing

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.410 
you were just trying to let the healing
process<00:05:01.470> start<00:05:02.040> keep<00:05:02.340> the<00:05:02.460> dirt<00:05:02.670> out<00:05:02.880> how<00:05:03.210> long

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
process start keep the dirt out how long

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.230 
process start keep the dirt out how long
would<00:05:03.660> you<00:05:03.810> leave<00:05:04.020> that<00:05:04.230> on<00:05:04.610> well<00:05:05.610> I<00:05:05.910> like<00:05:06.120> to

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
would you leave that on well I like to

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.450 
would you leave that on well I like to
change<00:05:06.450> advantage<00:05:06.960> every<00:05:07.110> day<00:05:07.380> or<00:05:07.560> two<00:05:07.590> okay

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
change advantage every day or two okay

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.160 
change advantage every day or two okay
so<00:05:08.520> then<00:05:08.850> let's<00:05:09.060> put<00:05:09.240> it<00:05:09.360> this<00:05:09.390> way<00:05:09.660> how<00:05:09.900> long

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.170 
so then let's put it this way how long

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:11.900 
so then let's put it this way how long
do<00:05:10.470> you<00:05:10.560> think<00:05:10.620> you<00:05:10.920> would<00:05:11.070> need<00:05:11.280> to<00:05:11.460> bandage

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
do you think you would need to bandage

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.360 
do you think you would need to bandage
before<00:05:12.390> you<00:05:12.510> had<00:05:12.690> enough<00:05:12.990> healing<00:05:13.320> to<00:05:14.160> just

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
before you had enough healing to just

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.670 
before you had enough healing to just
let<00:05:14.550> it<00:05:14.700> go<00:05:14.810> well<00:05:15.810> it<00:05:15.870> depends<00:05:16.140> how<00:05:16.200> deep<00:05:16.410> it<00:05:16.560> is

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
let it go well it depends how deep it is

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.910 
let it go well it depends how deep it is
depends<00:05:17.610> if<00:05:17.670> it's<00:05:17.790> infected<00:05:18.380> you<00:05:19.380> know<00:05:19.530> I<00:05:19.770> mean

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 
depends if it's infected you know I mean

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.160 
depends if it's infected you know I mean
