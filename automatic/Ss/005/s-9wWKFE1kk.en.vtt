00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.500
 then we will prepare a crumble of 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.140
 sardines here is a little recipe from 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.940
 cupboard has only two ingredients you have 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.000
 normally at home or you can 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.080
 have in your closets 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.510
 so what is it doing to achieve this 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.240
 phone then we need three 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.220
 boxes of sardines a little handle 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.100
 fresh herbs or dried herbs 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.460
 according to what you have a handful 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.289
 of pitted black olives 400 g 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.600
 peeled tomatoes or fresh tomatoes 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:42.879
 according to the season a little salt a little bit 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.909
 pepper and an onion then to realize 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:48.999
 the crispy crumble we need 60 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:51.190
 g grated Parmesan 70 g soft butter it 

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:53.710
 the 100 g of flour and a spoon 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.569
 mustard coffee so what begins 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.190
 we feed we start a little 

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:58.659
 everywhere we want because it's 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.449
 pretty easy everything will be done at the same 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:03.159
 time so we will prepare on one side the 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.670
 garnish and then on the other the crumble 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:09.010
 classically us for the garnish 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.840
 it's very simple we will crush 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.500
 roughly our sardines at the 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.600
 fork 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.909
 we will mix them with the rest of the 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.799
 ingredients and so the sardines one 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.640
 installs inside a dish where one 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.680
 will have put some olive oil 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.060
 before quite so I crush 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.539
 the sardines while you realize the 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.909
 crumble 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.380
 so here to realize the crumble 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.730
 it's very tiring but the challenge 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.830
 flour does not allow to see 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.790
 the butter that I'm going to crumble between 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:38.080
 I will add mustard fingers all at 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:40.240
 end if needed as solange if 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.680
 the sting of sardines worth a little 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:48.330
 big wanted to remove otherwise there is a 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.330
 Super thing is also Saturday parade 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.940
 we can also make it look like 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.980
 unlikely we want it 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.760
 because there is already the salt of parmesan 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.530
 and that of services 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.530
 there will be what he determines 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.510
 in the crumble dough do not hesitate 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.280
 according to your inspiration or desire in 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:41.580
 also add abysses where the herbs 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.580
 directly from dance to perfumery 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:49.120
 then the crumble dough is made 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:52.670
 now we are going to finalize the filling 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.269
 and so we will add the tomatoes in 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.769
 sardines 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.150
 so here we used tomatoes in 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.849
 little trick box for skills 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.319
 he lies ben yeah arm you a little 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:06.560
 chisel and hop we go cheerfully like this 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.730
 and now need to sense was 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.569
 anyway very much to put in a 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.180
 crumble scissors it's very convenient for 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.659
 think about it in cooking because sometimes 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.389
 we bored well with the knives 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:21.379
 want to do a little bit like the chefs 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:30.680
 otherwise you can also take the 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:31.159
 peeled tomatoes had also added 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.949
 black olives 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:37.010
 we have the same principle but the apparatus to 

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:40.480
 you do not bother heard cut in four 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.480
 and that's it 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.920
 Cairo as the nuclei 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:55.130
 add the onions also so the 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:57.350
 worth of an onion yes home is over or 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.780
 least following i have stone niot me 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.360
 planted 6 feet 2 crushed garlic cloves 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:08.600
 or go through a shallot if we like that 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:09.470
 here is luc melenchon but six of them 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.110
 stocks 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.970
 if you do not have fresh water bah 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.380
 you also take me a little what you 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.169
 have in the closet or to put some 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:22.130
 provencal herbs for example where the 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:24.500
 dried herbs or disapprove of them 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.890
 trees we do is not bad it's 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.890
 a good alternative 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.300
 so we add some pepper too 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.300
 to season 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:49.930
 a pinch of salt 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.510
 on the amount of salt it will depend 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.750
 really Vaud sardine is what they 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.760
 are very salty or not for that that the 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.350
 bouquets we will dispose the dough to 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.910
 crumble on the filling 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.030
 so we hone them roughly her senses 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:06.250
 and there we can leave pieces of 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.910
 different size of the words of the little ones 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.310
 bits of butter that goes chips and in 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.620
 orange in bed coloring 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:17.550
 then there after heating the oven to 210 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.550
 at 220 degrees 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:25.370
 and that's the only fit for a 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.370
 thirty minutes 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:35.260
 bust the loans all came out of the 

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:37.160
 oven 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.200
 all you have to do is wait a few 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:43.150
 minutes just so they're not 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.150
 too hot to serve and feast
