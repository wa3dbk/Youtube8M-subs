the lodge of being taken up into a

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.230 
the lodge of being taken up into a
chariot<00:02:28.130> of<00:02:28.190> fire<00:02:28.220> is<00:02:28.700> an<00:02:28.910> abduction

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
chariot of fire is an abduction

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.930 
chariot of fire is an abduction
certainly<00:02:30.020> modern<00:02:30.380> UFOs<00:02:30.830> are<00:02:31.190> reported<00:02:31.910> to

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
certainly modern UFOs are reported to

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.140 
certainly modern UFOs are reported to
take<00:02:32.510> humans<00:02:32.870> on<00:02:33.020> board<00:02:33.050> and<00:02:33.500> take<00:02:33.650> them<00:02:33.830> away

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.910 

so<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.180> think<00:02:38.330> we've<00:02:38.660> got<00:02:38.930> in<00:02:39.350> modern<00:02:39.800> UFO

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
so I think we've got in modern UFO

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.000 
so I think we've got in modern UFO
reports<00:02:41.560> something<00:02:42.560> that<00:02:42.710> could<00:02:42.920> have

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
reports something that could have

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.340 
reports something that could have
functioned<00:02:43.430> very<00:02:43.640> well<00:02:43.910> to<00:02:44.780> carry<00:02:45.020> Elijah

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
functioned very well to carry Elijah

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.509 
functioned very well to carry Elijah
into<00:02:45.740> the<00:02:45.830> sky

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.170 

if<00:02:51.519> we<00:02:51.819> were<00:02:51.940> to<00:02:52.030> take<00:02:53.400> what<00:02:54.400> Alicia<00:02:54.940> was

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
if we were to take what Alicia was

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
that perhaps they aren't so different
