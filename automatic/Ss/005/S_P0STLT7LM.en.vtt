00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:31.480
 the guys went a bit special fluffy 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:37.750
 in the tank are they 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:42.100
 I had to use nÃ© is the famous pilot band 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:58.329
 the flash player 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:01:08.440
 it was good that I would dominate what I give is superb 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:13.740
 the paranÃ¡ currently occupies the post will 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.740
 make the pylon control twice 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.810
 powder 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.759
 If you want, that's it, you're going to jump. 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.990
 if it is in the air it will fail then 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:28.990
 served at the end the bid and speech stayed in 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:33.090
 because when you touch the ground good and 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.090
 will run on the floor 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.820
 and this was super rock 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.410
 now I'll show you another one with which the last one 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.770
 I'm already very good 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:55.170
 the same way of solving the painting I 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.920
 I am roberto price 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.920
 just tighten it 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.940
 in another with 12 that is made to siberia 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.940
 breeze 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:23.880
 and it amazes 12 that the same thing 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:28.250
 that use photo snippets or be r 2 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.250
 but the country is already on the air 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.500
 Who is this guy you 're playing for? 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.030
 with daniel you have to know what you 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:53.220
 have to stay the closest 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.080
 because he is the character away 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.110
 short the closer we are 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.290
 the rocket but chan 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.820
 That's why all the attacks on the river 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.820
 is to approach your enemy 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:21.520
 the will to use this blow 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.860
 besides achieving its 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.860
 you can dodge the project 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:37.610
 if you use the same tactic with that is 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.620
 three punches and kicks 11 and 12 will be 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.390
 much stronger but will spend a 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.390
 steel bar by 14 base 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.510
 today 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.709
 but it stands out from an enormous advantage 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.980
 Can you talk about who your 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.980
 opponent 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.430
 ae 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:21.280
 another very important attack of 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:24.430
 any rebel fighters to warm up and 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.520
 When you jump tight the work of 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:30.210
 help may not just be lacking postage 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.210
 This is what you're going to do. 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:40.530
 you press to support this male 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:46.340
 the jury that will reach and why 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:46.340
 area proves that you are like this 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.509
 ae 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.130
 the interesting thing is coming pro bag 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.930
 You jump in the first aid we go. 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.320
 have to hold on to defend 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.320
 this blow 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:28.300
 and you can cancel a weak kick 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:31.440
 lowered with variables comes to tighten the end 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:37.020
 so catch a weak ax kick 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:37.020
 varying grip the voters 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:51.599
 ae 

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:18.849
 so that's it folks have not had 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:18.849
 liked the river until
