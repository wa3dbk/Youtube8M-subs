00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
pet we use a set of calipers and we

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.279 
pet we use a set of calipers and we
start<00:00:14.009> out<00:00:14.160> by<00:00:14.370> going<00:00:15.059> here<00:00:15.420> here<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:15.960> pushing

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
start out by going here here and pushing

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.230 
start out by going here here and pushing
the<00:00:16.379> hair<00:00:16.650> slightly<00:00:17.279> towards<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.820> head<00:00:18.060> the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
the hair slightly towards the head the

the hair slightly towards the head the
way<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.690> inside<00:00:19.080> padding<00:00:19.560> of<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.710> helmet

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
way the inside padding of the helmet

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.540 
way the inside padding of the helmet
would<00:00:20.130> be<00:00:20.689> and<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:21.720> get<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.930> dimension<00:00:22.550> spent

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
would be and you get a dimension spent

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.939 
would be and you get a dimension spent
you're<00:00:23.730> straight<00:00:23.939> across<00:00:25.130> and<00:00:26.180> you<00:00:27.180> repeat

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
you're straight across and you repeat

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.030 
you're straight across and you repeat
for<00:00:28.949> head<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.250> back<00:00:29.400> up<00:00:29.609> head<00:00:30.619> and<00:00:31.619> then<00:00:31.859> you're

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
for head to back up head and then you're

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.920 
for head to back up head and then you're
straight<00:00:32.309> across<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.940> calipers<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.390> way

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
straight across the calipers that way

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.340 
straight across the calipers that way
and<00:00:34.079> then<00:00:34.460> top<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.640> head<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.969> shoulder<00:00:36.390> those

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
and then top of head to shoulder those

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.810 
and then top of head to shoulder those
are<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.620> three<00:00:37.829> measurements<00:00:38.129> we<00:00:38.399> need<00:00:38.430> I

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
are the three measurements we need I

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.880 
are the three measurements we need I
understand<00:00:39.690> most<00:00:39.870> people<00:00:40.230> don't<00:00:40.350> have<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.739> set

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
understand most people don't have it set

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.250 
understand most people don't have it set
of<00:00:41.010> calipers<00:00:41.250> at<00:00:41.489> home<00:00:41.719> so<00:00:42.719> an<00:00:42.870> easy<00:00:43.050> method

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
of calipers at home so an easy method

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.810 
of calipers at home so an easy method
we've<00:00:46.260> come<00:00:46.469> up<00:00:46.559> with<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.430> cardboard

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
we've come up with is the cardboard

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.660 
we've come up with is the cardboard
method<00:00:48.620> take<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.649> big<00:00:49.829> piece<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.039> cardboard<00:00:50.520> out

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
method take a big piece of cardboard out

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.330 
method take a big piece of cardboard out
of<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.820> cardboard<00:00:51.059> box<00:00:51.360> make<00:00:51.960> two<00:00:52.170> marks<00:00:52.350> about

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
of a cardboard box make two marks about

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.209 
of a cardboard box make two marks about
six<00:00:53.610> inches<00:00:53.940> across<00:00:54.629> which<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.800> average

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
six inches across which is the average

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.330 
six inches across which is the average
small<00:00:57.149> head<00:00:57.449> size<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.199> then<00:00:58.949> we're<00:00:59.129> going<00:00:59.219> to

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
small head size and then we're going to

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:12.440 
small head size and then we're going to
cut<00:00:59.579> a<00:01:00.500> semicircle<00:01:01.500> out<00:01:10.850> we<00:01:11.850> try<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.119> put<00:01:12.330> that

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
cut a semicircle out we try to put that

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.740 
cut a semicircle out we try to put that
on<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.720> head<00:01:12.900> it's<00:01:13.380> too<00:01:13.560> small<00:01:14.600> so<00:01:15.600> we

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
on the head it's too small so we

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:23.420 
on the head it's too small so we
gradually<00:01:16.820> widen<00:01:18.799> the<00:01:19.799> circle<00:01:21.560> until<00:01:22.560> we<00:01:23.280> can

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
gradually widen the circle until we can

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:34.319 
gradually widen the circle until we can
get<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.570> it's<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.869> right<00:01:25.049> size

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:36.690 

they're<00:01:34.899> just<00:01:35.320> pushing<00:01:35.530> his<00:01:35.799> ear<00:01:36.100> slightly<00:01:36.549> to

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
they're just pushing his ear slightly to

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:45.359 
they're just pushing his ear slightly to
a<00:01:36.729> tune<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.729> we<00:01:42.850> take<00:01:43.030> that<00:01:43.710> cardboard<00:01:44.710> caliper

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
a tune so we take that cardboard caliper

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:51.090 
a tune so we take that cardboard caliper
and<00:01:45.640> we<00:01:45.729> measure<00:01:45.939> across<00:01:47.759> get<00:01:48.759> 63<00:01:49.270> course<00:01:50.100> you

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
and we measure across get 63 course you

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.999 
and we measure across get 63 course you
can<00:01:51.189> take<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.460> same<00:01:51.670> cut<00:01:51.939> out<00:01:52.469> and<00:01:53.469> go<00:01:53.740> for

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
can take the same cut out and go for

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.559 
can take the same cut out and go for
half<00:01:54.189> the<00:01:54.369> back<00:01:54.549> of<00:01:54.729> head<00:01:56.850> by<00:01:57.850> just<00:01:58.060> enlarging

00:01:58.559 --> 00:01:58.569 
half the back of head by just enlarging

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:01.859 
half the back of head by just enlarging
in<00:01:58.659> little<00:01:59.259> increments<00:02:00.119> until<00:02:01.119> you<00:02:01.390> get<00:02:01.600> close

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
in little increments until you get close

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.559 
in little increments until you get close
and<00:02:05.399> then<00:02:06.399> you<00:02:06.489> measure<00:02:06.670> across<00:02:07.090> that<00:02:07.329> way

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569 
and then you measure across that way

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:09.749 
and then you measure across that way
that's<00:02:08.530> your<00:02:08.709> forehead<00:02:09.099> to<00:02:09.280> back<00:02:09.459> of<00:02:09.610> head

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
that's your forehead to back of head

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.350 
that's your forehead to back of head
measurement<00:02:10.329> we<00:02:10.899> take<00:02:11.170> those<00:02:11.410> two<00:02:11.709> and<00:02:12.360> form

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
measurement we take those two and form

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.170 
measurement we take those two and form
the<00:02:13.540> helmet<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:14.560> this<00:02:14.709> these<00:02:15.069> dimensions<00:02:15.760> so

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
the helmet to this these dimensions so

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.809 
the helmet to this these dimensions so
that<00:02:16.390> it's<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:16.810> step<00:02:17.530> up<00:02:17.709> from<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.130> circumference

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
that it's a step up from a circumference

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.390 
that it's a step up from a circumference
which<00:02:19.180> is<00:02:19.390> just<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.870> distance<00:02:20.829> around<00:02:21.160> the

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
which is just the distance around the

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.460 
which is just the distance around the
outside<00:02:21.489> of<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.030> head<00:02:22.209> this<00:02:22.630> way<00:02:22.900> you<00:02:22.959> get<00:02:23.349> an

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
outside of the head this way you get an

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.380 
outside of the head this way you get an
actual<00:02:25.739> helmet<00:02:26.739> size<00:02:27.130> that<00:02:27.519> is<00:02:27.640> act<00:02:27.880> that<00:02:28.209> is

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
actual helmet size that is act that is

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.440 
actual helmet size that is act that is
based<00:02:28.630> on<00:02:28.959> your<00:02:29.319> helmet<00:02:29.680> your<00:02:30.010> head<00:02:30.340> size<00:02:30.610> so

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
based on your helmet your head size so

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.140 
based on your helmet your head size so
it's<00:02:32.049> pretty<00:02:32.230> accurate<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:33.700> can<00:02:33.760> take<00:02:34.030> the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
it's pretty accurate you can take the

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.360 
it's pretty accurate you can take the
cardboard<00:02:34.420> across<00:02:35.379> the<00:02:35.500> top<00:02:35.709> of<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:35.860> head<00:02:36.040> and

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
cardboard across the top of the head and

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.069 
cardboard across the top of the head and
go<00:02:36.640> down<00:02:36.819> to<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.030> shoulder<00:02:37.420> that<00:02:37.780> gives<00:02:37.989> you

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
go down to the shoulder that gives you
