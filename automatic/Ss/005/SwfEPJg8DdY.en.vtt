00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.210
 towards the end of 2015 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.539

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.260
 very natural look and that is 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.520
 what you end up with this kind 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.060
 like to have hairstyles and 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.060

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.970

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.340
 effect with glasses and now I will leave you 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.890
 see how you actually start from this hairstyle 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.890
 can make another haircut very quickly 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.020
 little bit of rub on your hands 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.650
 for a bit more business look 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:59.310
 workout the ring actually like that the 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:03.540
 many people know it that way you can 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:07.340
 great to the office without glasses and 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.340
 same look with trip 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.150
 now i'm going for a business look 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.340
 to what sporty look I still love 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.739
 always say the same 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.870
 styling product in it to show 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:27.720
 that it is in a natural way 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:30.410
 set code is still 2015 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.410
 i carry it forward 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.040
 now a little more up which gives them a lot 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.040
 is sportier 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.620
 He and sunglasses are of course with glasses 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.220
 now I switch to another product 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.180
 it was hair because I want it in the end 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.180
 more shine ring 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:07.830
 I grab the green giant around the green house 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.900
 was on him and fats based on one 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.180
 oil base which makes you so 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.720
 also more shiny hair a natural 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.720
 look disappears 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:46.650
 still no can used throw you 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:49.590
 hands and different product in it and 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.629
 otherwise it is a bit higher 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.310
 you can make this as high as you 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.310
 the higher your sportier 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.359
 ankle with glasses 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:10.049
 so you can see again from the head again soon 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:13.459
 bonke also that is still too 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.459
 make from the same haircut 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.799
 now I use a can 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:31.440
 and I am going to do that injustice I do not want him yet 

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:33.479
 too high to show you 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.840
 that also a pompadour 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:38.280
 can be reasonable business anyway 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.410
 reasonable business I actually think it is 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.610
 just very neat hairstyle 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.050
 You can tell that they make the difference 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.150
 see the front now with the hairstyles 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:49.590
 just more styling products 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:51.630
 sunglasses and with glasses 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.729
 the effect of glasses is present 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.680
 but ultimately 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.870
 there are people who doubt whether he is 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:02.509
 any style hair can wear with any 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.509
 glasses you see it no problem 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:12.349
 for the greater effect 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:12.349
 I add a little bit of noise and add 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:24.470
 and now I'm going to set the corners more 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:37.259
 that means combing and eventually 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:40.289
 say this side well said too 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:43.639
 good combing first that's important 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:43.639
 thus you get informed it 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:51.000
 was not to worry about the dots 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:53.300
 that stick up that lay with you 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.300
 hands on 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:09.090
 for real pulled mini effect 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:12.000
 you actually start almost halfway 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.380
 catch your forehead backwards 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.660
 which causes you to blow the 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:22.139
 good at getting a nice back 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:24.560
 i do drunk indoors without glasses and 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:24.560
 with glasses 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:28.770
 This time I have a number of styles for it 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.729
 show you with different 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.770
