00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.760 

okay<00:00:01.260> so<00:00:01.319> this<00:00:01.680> is<00:00:01.860> our<00:00:02.010> analog<00:00:02.580> setup<00:00:03.770> pretty

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
okay so this is our analog setup pretty

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:05.869 
okay so this is our analog setup pretty
much<00:00:04.980> a<00:00:05.009> straightforward

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
much a straightforward

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.690 
much a straightforward
it's<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.450> Kaito<00:00:06.810> Eric<00:00:07.470> Otto<00:00:07.649> power<00:00:07.980> pack<00:00:08.370> with

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
it's a Kaito Eric Otto power pack with

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.120 
it's a Kaito Eric Otto power pack with
nine<00:00:08.910> switches<00:00:09.450> for<00:00:10.170> all<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.620> switches<00:00:10.980> on

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
nine switches for all the switches on

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.749 
nine switches for all the switches on
the<00:00:11.160> track<00:00:12.290> this<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.500> just<00:00:13.830> temporary<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.580> make

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
the track this is just temporary to make

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.700 
the track this is just temporary to make
sure<00:00:14.940> everything<00:00:15.360> works<00:00:15.630> got<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.350> be<00:00:16.440> really

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
sure everything works got to be really

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.920 
sure everything works got to be really
careful<00:00:17.130> about<00:00:17.190> placing<00:00:17.910> your<00:00:18.060> power<00:00:18.270> output

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
careful about placing your power output

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.189 
careful about placing your power output
because<00:00:19.710> of<00:00:20.070> power<00:00:20.880> routing<00:00:21.420> switches<00:00:21.960> which

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
because of power routing switches which

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.720 
because of power routing switches which
this<00:00:22.439> has<00:00:23.960> well<00:00:24.960> other<00:00:25.500> than<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.980> crossovers

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
this has well other than the crossovers

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.479 
this has well other than the crossovers
they're<00:00:27.449> all<00:00:27.599> power<00:00:27.900> routing<00:00:29.900> so<00:00:31.489> because

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
they're all power routing so because

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.549 
they're all power routing so because
this<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.850> going<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.090> be<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.210> DCC<00:00:33.780> track<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.320> to

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
this is going to be a DCC track I to

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.010 
this is going to be a DCC track I to
make<00:00:34.829> sure<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.430> all<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.450> sections<00:00:36.840> were

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
make sure that all the sections were

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.020 
make sure that all the sections were
powered<00:00:37.380> all<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.739> time<00:00:38.010> or<00:00:38.340> we'd<00:00:38.850> have<00:00:38.879> a

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
powered all the time or we'd have a

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.060 
powered all the time or we'd have a
short<00:00:40.700> so<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:42.420> only<00:00:42.600> sections<00:00:43.140> that's<00:00:43.379> not

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
short so the only sections that's not

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.889 
short so the only sections that's not
powered<00:00:44.460> all<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.730> time<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.210> siding<00:00:45.660> and

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
powered all the time is the siding and

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.690 
powered all the time is the siding and
that's<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:46.469> purpose<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.039> can<00:00:47.190> park<00:00:47.399> tracks

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
that's on purpose so I can park tracks

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.430 
that's on purpose so I can park tracks
trains<00:00:48.450> there<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:50.600> when<00:00:51.600> I'm<00:00:51.719> not<00:00:51.750> using<00:00:52.110> them

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
trains there and when I'm not using them

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.740 
trains there and when I'm not using them
they<00:00:52.590> won't<00:00:52.800> have<00:00:52.980> power<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:54.120> here<00:00:54.449> we<00:00:54.570> have

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
they won't have power so here we have

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.770 
they won't have power so here we have
like<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:56.219> said<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.690> standard<00:00:57.690> tato<00:00:58.680> power<00:00:59.100> pack

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
like I said the standard tato power pack

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.319 
like I said the standard tato power pack
this<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.960> an<00:01:01.079> analogue<00:01:01.530> has<00:01:02.190> nine<00:01:02.579> switches

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
this is an analogue has nine switches

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.600 
this is an analogue has nine switches
they<00:01:03.989> they<00:01:04.470> hook<00:01:04.650> into<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.040> side<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
they they hook into the side of the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.399 
they they hook into the side of the
power<00:01:05.790> pack<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.299> get<00:01:06.420> power<00:01:06.630> from<00:01:06.990> them<00:01:07.229> and

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
power pack to get power from them and

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.500 
power pack to get power from them and
then<00:01:07.799> they<00:01:07.950> all<00:01:08.100> clip<00:01:08.369> together

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
then they all clip together

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.219 
then they all clip together
the<00:01:10.290> wires<00:01:10.860> are<00:01:11.189> just<00:01:11.600> underneath<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.810> table

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
the wires are just underneath the table

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.039 
the wires are just underneath the table
right<00:01:13.409> now<00:01:13.820> later<00:01:14.820> on<00:01:14.909> when<00:01:15.390> everything's

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
right now later on when everything's

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.179 
right now later on when everything's
figured<00:01:16.830> out<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:17.369> have<00:01:17.570> designed<00:01:18.570> all<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
figured out and I have designed all the

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.179 
figured out and I have designed all the
control<00:01:20.189> box<00:01:20.460> for<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.970> DCC<00:01:21.830> switches<00:01:22.830> for<00:01:23.130> the

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
control box for the DCC switches for the

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.429 
control box for the DCC switches for the
the<00:01:23.909> DCC<00:01:24.330> controllers<00:01:24.780> for<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.020> switches

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
the DCC controllers for the switches

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.590 
the DCC controllers for the switches
then<00:01:25.920> both<00:01:26.220> wires<00:01:26.490> will<00:01:26.759> all<00:01:26.909> be<00:01:27.119> tacked<00:01:27.390> up

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
then both wires will all be tacked up

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.130 
then both wires will all be tacked up
into<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.680> frame<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.159> then<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:30.140> movable

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
into the frame and then this is movable

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.469 
into the frame and then this is movable
in<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.290> pickup<00:01:31.470> truck<00:01:31.619> if<00:01:31.979> need<00:01:32.159> be<00:01:32.479> alright

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
in a pickup truck if need be alright

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.899 
in a pickup truck if need be alright
well<00:01:33.630> that's<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.930> for<00:01:34.140> today<00:01:34.640> again<00:01:35.640> if<00:01:35.790> you
