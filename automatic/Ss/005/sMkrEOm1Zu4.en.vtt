hello and welcome to my third set up a
hot<00:00:05.250> lap<00:00:05.430> video<00:00:05.790> for<00:00:06.060> F<00:00:06.180> 1<00:00:06.359> 2015<00:00:07.010> this<00:00:08.010> time

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
hot lap video for F 1 2015 this time

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.100 
hot lap video for F 1 2015 this time
we're<00:00:08.639> driving<00:00:09.090> as<00:00:09.210> you<00:00:09.300> can<00:00:09.450> see<00:00:09.599> around

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
we're driving as you can see around

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.950 
we're driving as you can see around
Malaysia<00:00:10.769> one<00:00:11.460> of<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.849> tracks<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.330> Herman<00:00:12.780> to

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
Malaysia one of the tracks of Herman to

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.039 
Malaysia one of the tracks of Herman to
occur<00:00:13.259> I<00:00:13.549> don't<00:00:14.549> use<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:15.120> usually<00:00:15.599> don't<00:00:15.750> like

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
occur I don't use I usually don't like

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.010 
occur I don't use I usually don't like
them<00:00:16.379> but<00:00:16.590> yeah<00:00:17.220> I<00:00:17.520> think<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:18.600> middle<00:00:18.810> sector

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
them but yeah I think the middle sector

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.470 
them but yeah I think the middle sector
and<00:00:19.350> Malaysia<00:00:19.619> has<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:19.949> good<00:00:20.220> flow<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:21.029> we<00:00:21.270> try

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
and Malaysia has a good flow so we try

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.380 
and Malaysia has a good flow so we try
to<00:00:21.510> take<00:00:21.810> as<00:00:22.020> much<00:00:22.439> speed<00:00:22.949> as<00:00:23.010> we<00:00:23.310> can<00:00:23.550> on<00:00:23.760> to

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
to take as much speed as we can on to

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.320 
to take as much speed as we can on to
the<00:00:24.539> start/finish<00:00:24.869> straight<00:00:25.550> so<00:00:26.550> take

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
the start/finish straight so take

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.660 
the start/finish straight so take
everything<00:00:27.900> from<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.320> tech<00:00:28.529> that's<00:00:28.800> given<00:00:29.640> to

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
everything from the tech that's given to

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.510 
everything from the tech that's given to
you<00:00:29.880> now<00:00:30.779> we're<00:00:31.109> driving<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.710> looking<00:00:32.340> for

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
you now we're driving and looking for

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.370 
you now we're driving and looking for
the<00:00:32.610> 100<00:00:33.120> meter<00:00:33.329> word<00:00:33.540> just<00:00:33.809> before<00:00:34.170> that

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
the 100 meter word just before that

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.389 
the 100 meter word just before that
that's<00:00:35.340> our<00:00:35.579> breaking<00:00:35.969> point<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.480> yeah<00:00:37.399> you

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
that's our breaking point and yeah you

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.790 
that's our breaking point and yeah you
have<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.670> take<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.000> light<00:00:39.450> apex<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.110> order<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.530> be

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
have to take a light apex in order to be

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.940 
have to take a light apex in order to be
right<00:00:41.219> for<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.000> corner<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:43.649> order<00:00:43.800> to

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
right for this corner and in order to

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.130 
right for this corner and in order to
take<00:00:44.280> as<00:00:44.430> much<00:00:44.640> speed<00:00:45.000> as<00:00:45.059> possible<00:00:45.660> onto<00:00:45.809> this

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
take as much speed as possible onto this

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.979 
take as much speed as possible onto this
and<00:00:47.030> straight<00:00:48.030> which<00:00:48.300> isn't<00:00:48.690> really<00:00:48.750> a

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
and straight which isn't really a

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.709 
and straight which isn't really a
straight<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.969> now<00:00:50.969> we're<00:00:51.180> looking<00:00:51.300> for<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
straight and now we're looking for the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.369 
straight and now we're looking for the
100<00:00:52.170> meter<00:00:52.350> ball<00:00:52.530> again<00:00:52.829> down<00:00:53.539> to<00:00:54.539> second<00:00:55.199> gear

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
100 meter ball again down to second gear

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.920 
100 meter ball again down to second gear
and<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.920> can<00:00:56.250> take<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.730> lot<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.239> curb<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.809> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
and you can take a lot of curb in the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.869 
and you can take a lot of curb in the
inside<00:00:58.320> be<00:00:58.710> patient<00:00:59.100> with<00:00:59.250> your<00:00:59.370> throttle

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
inside be patient with your throttle

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.090 
inside be patient with your throttle
maybe<00:01:00.420> there's<00:01:01.020> some<00:01:01.289> wheel<00:01:01.469> spin<00:01:01.710> at<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
maybe there's some wheel spin at the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.520 
maybe there's some wheel spin at the
exit<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.579> now<00:01:02.789> this<00:01:03.390> left<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.930> right<00:01:04.170> full

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
exit and now this left to right full

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.310 
exit and now this left to right full
throttle<00:01:05.010> for<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.400> left<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.000> one<00:01:06.140> gear<00:01:07.140> down

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
throttle for the left and one gear down

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.640 
throttle for the left and one gear down
for<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.740> right<00:01:07.979> now<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.420> 50-meter<00:01:10.049> balls<00:01:10.350> are

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
for the right now the 50-meter balls are

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.590 
for the right now the 50-meter balls are
bright<00:01:10.890> point<00:01:11.189> down<00:01:11.850> tube<00:01:12.180> years<00:01:14.180> usually<00:01:15.180> you

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
bright point down tube years usually you

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.260 
bright point down tube years usually you
have<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:16.110> take<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.009> second<00:01:17.400> curb<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.820> missed<00:01:18.119> it

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
have to take the second curb I missed it

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.600 
have to take the second curb I missed it
a<00:01:18.450> little<00:01:18.689> bit<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.140> that's<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.799> small<00:01:20.310> mistake

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
a little bit so that's a small mistake

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.109 
a little bit so that's a small mistake
by<00:01:20.970> myself<00:01:21.390> now<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.619> tight<00:01:23.040> left-hander<00:01:23.909> and

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
by myself now this tight left-hander and

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.679 
by myself now this tight left-hander and
you<00:01:25.020> really<00:01:25.770> need<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.070> be<00:01:26.280> patient<00:01:26.520> on<00:01:26.970> on<00:01:27.240> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
you really need to be patient on on the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.390 
you really need to be patient on on the
exit<00:01:28.049> there's<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.409> lot<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.619> ways<00:01:28.890> but<00:01:28.920> because

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
exit there's a lot of ways but because

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.120 
exit there's a lot of ways but because
you're<00:01:29.579> driving<00:01:30.000> uphill<00:01:30.180> then<00:01:31.140> this<00:01:31.560> tricky

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
you're driving uphill then this tricky

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.850 
you're driving uphill then this tricky
right-hander<00:01:32.450> bit<00:01:33.450> blind<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.229> can<00:01:34.470> grease

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
right-hander bit blind you can grease

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.310 
right-hander bit blind you can grease
you<00:01:35.040> when<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.310> have<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.579> turn<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.259> now<00:01:37.259> the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
you when you have to turn in and now the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.350 
you when you have to turn in and now the
really<00:01:37.829> difficult<00:01:38.119> right-hander<00:01:41.150> there's<00:01:42.150> no

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
really difficult right-hander there's no

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.499 
really difficult right-hander there's no
really<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:43.250> bright<00:01:44.250> marker<00:01:44.850> for<00:01:45.060> me<00:01:45.210> where<00:01:45.479> I

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
really a bright marker for me where I

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.560 
really a bright marker for me where I
look<00:01:46.170> at<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.530> break<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.189> it's<00:01:47.460> just<00:01:47.909> the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
look at to break that it's just the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.560 
look at to break that it's just the
feeling<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.320> have<00:01:49.619> when<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.850> break<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.420> I

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
feeling that I have when to break and I

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.230 
feeling that I have when to break and I
don't<00:01:51.780> know<00:01:51.930> there's<00:01:52.380> no<00:01:52.560> really<00:01:53.119> point<00:01:54.119> to

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
don't know there's no really point to

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.209 
don't know there's no really point to
break<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.049> hairpin<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.619> last<00:01:55.829> con<00:01:56.040> on

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
break and the hairpin the last con on

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.320 
break and the hairpin the last con on
the<00:01:56.340> track

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.210 

late<00:02:00.330> apex<00:02:00.720> is<00:02:00.990> important<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.650> get<00:02:01.770> as<00:02:01.920> much

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
late apex is important to get as much

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.090 
late apex is important to get as much
speed<00:02:02.430> into<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:03.030> start<00:02:03.930> first<00:02:04.380> rate<00:02:04.680> because

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
speed into this start first rate because

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.710 
speed into this start first rate because
it's<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.460> little<00:02:05.729> bit<00:02:05.850> longer<00:02:06.000> than<00:02:06.330> the<00:02:06.360> first

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
it's a little bit longer than the first

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.620 
it's a little bit longer than the first
and<00:02:07.140> that's<00:02:08.009> a<00:02:08.160> one-minute<00:02:09.349> 35.5<00:02:10.640> 53<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:12.300> a

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
and that's a one-minute 35.5 53 so a

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.050 
and that's a one-minute 35.5 53 so a
pretty<00:02:13.200> decent<00:02:13.709> time<00:02:13.920> which<00:02:14.130> puts<00:02:14.489> me<00:02:14.580> up<00:02:14.790> into

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
pretty decent time which puts me up into

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.600 
pretty decent time which puts me up into
second<00:02:15.450> place<00:02:15.540> on<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.959> leaderboard<00:02:16.610> just

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
second place on the leaderboard just

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.440 
second place on the leaderboard just
behind<00:02:17.940> Michael<00:02:18.830> Smigiel<00:02:19.830> again<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.940> again

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
behind Michael Smigiel again and again

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.870 
behind Michael Smigiel again and again
just<00:02:21.840> for<00:02:21.930> four<00:02:22.560> hundredths<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.100> a<00:02:23.250> second<00:02:23.670> now

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
just for four hundredths of a second now

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.590 
just for four hundredths of a second now
we<00:02:23.940> have<00:02:24.209> a<00:02:24.239> quick<00:02:24.720> look<00:02:24.750> on<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.470> setup

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
we have a quick look on to the setup

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.650 
we have a quick look on to the setup
which<00:02:27.600> is<00:02:27.930> quite<00:02:28.680> similar<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.519> in<00:02:29.790> Bahrain

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
which is quite similar to the in Bahrain

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.050 
which is quite similar to the in Bahrain
to<00:02:31.170> two<00:02:31.350> wings<00:02:31.650> because<00:02:32.010> it's<00:02:32.730> really

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
to two wings because it's really

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.280 
to two wings because it's really
important<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.480> have<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.720> good<00:02:33.810> straight-line

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
important to have a good straight-line

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.820 
important to have a good straight-line
speed<00:02:34.590> on<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.370> two<00:02:35.640> long<00:02:35.940> straights<00:02:36.440> then<00:02:37.440> as

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
speed on the two long straights then as

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.610 
speed on the two long straights then as
usual<00:02:38.489> for<00:02:38.549> the<00:02:38.880> transmission<00:02:39.380> always<00:02:40.380> one

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
usual for the transmission always one

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.430 
usual for the transmission always one
hundred<00:02:40.799> percent<00:02:41.040> for<00:02:41.940> me<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.360> don't<00:02:43.319> think

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
hundred percent for me I don't think

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.830 
hundred percent for me I don't think
that<00:02:43.860> will<00:02:43.980> change<00:02:44.360> something<00:02:45.360> in<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:45.600> future

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
that will change something in the future

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.710 
that will change something in the future
just<00:02:46.620> like<00:02:46.860> with<00:02:47.130> this<00:02:47.370> full<00:02:47.940> camber<00:02:48.420> and

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
just like with this full camber and

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.880 
just like with this full camber and
photo<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.470> like<00:02:50.130> in<00:02:50.430> Orion<00:02:51.299> I<00:02:51.480> think<00:02:51.810> I<00:02:52.140> take

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
photo and like in Orion I think I take

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.880 
photo and like in Orion I think I take
11<00:02:53.459> 11<00:02:53.940> right<00:02:54.180> here<00:02:54.590> despite<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:55.739> having

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
11 11 right here despite of having

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.309 
11 11 right here despite of having
pretty<00:02:56.819> fast<00:02:57.120> corners<00:02:57.600> in<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.870> middle<00:02:58.110> sector

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
pretty fast corners in the middle sector

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.800 
pretty fast corners in the middle sector
I<00:02:58.709> think<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.519> game<00:02:59.730> gives<00:02:59.970> you<00:03:00.120> enough<00:03:00.480> grip

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
I think the game gives you enough grip

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.890 
I think the game gives you enough grip
for<00:03:01.400> fast<00:03:02.400> corners<00:03:02.850> so<00:03:03.090> you<00:03:03.150> concentrate<00:03:03.870> on

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
for fast corners so you concentrate on

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.550 
for fast corners so you concentrate on
the<00:03:04.739> low<00:03:05.640> ones<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.720> tire<00:03:06.989> pressure<00:03:07.320> is

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
the low ones and the tire pressure is

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.060 
the low ones and the tire pressure is
default<00:03:08.190> just<00:03:08.489> like<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:09.329> the<00:03:10.320> weight<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:10.680> can

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
default just like and the weight you can

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.110 
default just like and the weight you can
put<00:03:11.430> in<00:03:11.609> your<00:03:11.640> car<00:03:12.000> too<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:13.430> yeah<00:03:14.430> not<00:03:14.910> to

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
put in your car too and yeah not to

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.449 
put in your car too and yeah not to
oversteer<00:03:15.720> or<00:03:15.959> unjust<00:03:16.470> year<00:03:16.650> we<00:03:16.950> put<00:03:17.130> it<00:03:17.280> right

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
oversteer or unjust year we put it right

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.949 
oversteer or unjust year we put it right
at<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.790> middle<00:03:17.940> so<00:03:18.359> at<00:03:18.510> six<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:19.489> now<00:03:20.489> we<00:03:21.450> can

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
at the middle so at six and now we can

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.960 
at the middle so at six and now we can
take<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.290> quick<00:03:22.650> look<00:03:22.829> under<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.310> sector<00:03:23.700> times

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
take a quick look under the sector times

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.199 
take a quick look under the sector times
as<00:03:24.329> you<00:03:24.510> can<00:03:24.630> see<00:03:24.750> I<00:03:24.780> lose<00:03:25.200> three<00:03:25.769> and<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:26.010> half

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
as you can see I lose three and a half

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.150 
as you can see I lose three and a half
tenths<00:03:27.209> in<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.660> second<00:03:28.079> sector<00:03:28.290> but<00:03:28.890> I<00:03:28.950> gained

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
tenths in the second sector but I gained

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.509 
tenths in the second sector but I gained
2<00:03:29.609> in<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:29.940> 2nd<00:03:30.930> in<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.350> 3rd<00:03:31.380> and<00:03:31.890> 1<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.370> the

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
2 in the 2nd in the 3rd and 1 and the

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.180 
2 in the 2nd in the 3rd and 1 and the
first<00:03:32.940> so<00:03:33.780> it's<00:03:34.230> really<00:03:34.410> fast<00:03:34.890> on<00:03:35.070> the

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
first so it's really fast on the

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.220 
first so it's really fast on the
straights<00:03:35.489> but<00:03:35.640> not<00:03:36.000> as<00:03:36.209> fast<00:03:36.239> in<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:36.810> corners

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
straights but not as fast in the corners

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.880 
straights but not as fast in the corners
and<00:03:38.450> on<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.840> official<00:03:40.230> leaderboard<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.739> can

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
and on the official leaderboard you can

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.610 
and on the official leaderboard you can
see<00:03:41.100> I<00:03:41.130> didn't<00:03:41.880> drive<00:03:42.090> with<00:03:42.359> any<00:03:42.630> assists<00:03:43.350> and

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
see I didn't drive with any assists and

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.039 
see I didn't drive with any assists and
and<00:03:44.130> that's<00:03:44.730> it<00:03:44.940> for<00:03:45.120> today<00:03:45.450> I<00:03:45.480> hope<00:03:45.720> you
