Android and iOS the number one reason
that<00:00:17.039> I<00:00:17.460> think<00:00:17.520> so<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.330> because<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.290> has<00:00:19.410> the

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
that I think so is because it has the

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.940 
that I think so is because it has the
ability<00:00:19.620> to<00:00:20.900> simultaneously<00:00:21.900> up<00:00:22.170> tout<00:00:22.440> update

bot I use Tweetbot sometimes

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.860 
bot I use Tweetbot sometimes
but<00:02:14.880> it's<00:02:15.880> because<00:02:16.240> of<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:18.610> NEET<00:02:19.420> theme<00:02:19.690> that

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
but it's because of the NEET theme that

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.750 
but it's because of the NEET theme that
it<00:02:19.960> has<00:02:20.050> going<00:02:20.230> on<00:02:20.410> but<00:02:20.770> I<00:02:21.070> always<00:02:21.430> come<00:02:21.700> back
