00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
okay so what we're gonna do is I have

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.470 
okay so what we're gonna do is I have
poured<00:00:37.350> some<00:00:37.890> milk<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.640> could<00:00:38.790> use<00:00:39.000> skim<00:00:39.239> milk

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.900 
poured some milk you could use skim milk
but<00:00:39.899> then<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.920> sort<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.219> defeat<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.550> harvest

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
but then you sort of defeat the harvest

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.930 
but then you sort of defeat the harvest
because<00:00:42.120> videos<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.200> deep<00:00:43.379> fried<00:00:43.590> noodles<00:00:43.980> so

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
because videos and deep fried noodles so

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.810 
because videos and deep fried noodles so
we're<00:00:45.750> using<00:00:45.989> regular<00:00:46.350> milk<00:00:46.579> and<00:00:47.579> what<00:00:47.700> we're

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
we're using regular milk and what we're

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.510 
we're using regular milk and what we're
going<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:47.969> do<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.239> heat<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.410> put<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.489> a

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
going to do is heat it and put it to a

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.760 
going to do is heat it and put it to a
point<00:00:50.850> where<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.390> absorbs<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.199> water<00:00:52.230> that

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
point where it absorbs the water that

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.670 
point where it absorbs the water that
has<00:00:53.070> been<00:00:53.219> extracted<00:00:53.579> from<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.559> now

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
has been extracted from it so it is now

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:03.630 
has been extracted from it so it is now
edible<00:00:56.100> again<00:00:56.370> or<00:00:57.300> process<00:00:58.170> this

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.490 

these<00:01:04.360> are<00:01:04.510> for<00:01:04.750> egg<00:01:04.930> yolks

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.070 

pick<00:01:09.500> that<00:01:09.650> up<00:01:09.710> at<00:01:10.010> Jamba<00:01:10.250> Juice<00:01:10.780> so<00:01:11.780> we<00:01:11.960> now

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
pick that up at Jamba Juice so we now

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.370 
pick that up at Jamba Juice so we now
have<00:01:12.320> this<00:01:12.470> floppy<00:01:12.920> floppy<00:01:13.430> consistency

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
have this floppy floppy consistency

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.290 
have this floppy floppy consistency
we're<00:01:15.380> just<00:01:15.740> putting<00:01:16.400> this<00:01:16.640> in<00:01:16.790> a<00:01:16.910> pastry<00:01:17.240> bag

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
we're just putting this in a pastry bag

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.630 
we're just putting this in a pastry bag
if<00:01:17.900> you<00:01:17.990> don't<00:01:18.020> have<00:01:18.320> a<00:01:18.380> pastry<00:01:18.590> bag<00:01:18.950> you<00:01:19.400> can

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
if you don't have a pastry bag you can

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.030 
if you don't have a pastry bag you can
use<00:01:19.670> the<00:01:20.390> ziplock<00:01:20.720> bag<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:21.020> just<00:01:21.410> cut<00:01:21.740> off<00:01:21.860> the

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
use the ziplock bag and just cut off the

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.670 
use the ziplock bag and just cut off the
tip<00:01:22.280> when<00:01:23.120> that<00:01:23.270> mixture<00:01:23.810> cools<00:01:24.110> down<00:01:24.170> you<00:01:24.470> get

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
tip when that mixture cools down you get

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.530 
tip when that mixture cools down you get
this<00:01:26.080> so<00:01:27.080> over<00:01:27.440> boiling<00:01:27.830> water<00:01:28.040> we're

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
this so over boiling water we're

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.600 
this so over boiling water we're
squeezing<00:01:29.540> at<00:01:29.870> the<00:01:30.050> end<00:01:30.230> and<00:01:30.560> cutting<00:01:31.460> out

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
squeezing at the end and cutting out

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.070 
squeezing at the end and cutting out
with<00:01:31.820> anything<00:01:32.330> that<00:01:32.480> gets<00:01:32.720> you<00:01:32.870> straight

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
edge as it comes out of water we're just

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.240 
edge as it comes out of water we're just
going<00:01:37.760> to<00:01:37.820> roll<00:01:37.970> it<00:01:38.000> in<00:01:38.300> some<00:01:38.540> olive<00:01:38.660> oil<00:01:39.250> we're
