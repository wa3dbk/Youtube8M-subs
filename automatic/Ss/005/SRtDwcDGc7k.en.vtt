00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.780
 Here in my hands I have the new Nokia X this is the smaller version of a series 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.270
 new smartphones that include the Xokia X + and the Nokia XL, as I said. 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:23.270
 This is the smallest and therefore also the cheapest that is already available from the small price of € 89. 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:34.100
 As you can see there is a lot of interest about these new smartphones and 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.500
 you may wonder why, I think the answer is partly that he is 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:49.000
 is cheap, and the new Android-like operating system. it is Android, but 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 it has a Nokia skin over it. therefore you only have access to the Nokia appstore 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:09.220
 and therefore not the Google play store. but it doesn't feel like a normal Android phone, 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:16.220
 it looks more like a Windows Phone with the metro-style tile design you can tile 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.070
 drag, change and organize how you want it, so that you have your interface 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.000
 can personalize. it also has the look and feel of the Nokia Lumia with its colorful 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 rear end. so there are 3 new phones in the Nokia Family, the little X for € 89 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 then you have his bigger brother the X + which is 99 euros, and then you have the XL for € 109 euros 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 it is a 5 inch screen and it also has a 5 megapixel camera. have the phones 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.800
 all 2 SIM card slots, so you have your home phone and your work phone in 1. 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.459
 therefore you do not have to carry 2 smartphones around. as you can see it is basic 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.389
 phone that does have all the smartphone functionality that you want. and that from as little as € 89, 

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:27.060
 we expect to see a lot of these phones on the streets.
