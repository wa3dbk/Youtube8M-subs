so I can see where it is and all we're

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:32.720 
so I can see where it is and all we're
going<00:01:24.049> to<00:01:24.140> do<00:01:24.229> that<00:01:24.380> is<00:01:24.560> wrap<00:01:24.770> this<00:01:24.920> around

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:32.730 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.300 

first<00:01:33.730> you<00:01:33.850> can't<00:01:34.060> see<00:01:34.300> none<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.920> here's<00:01:36.130> our

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
first you can't see none so here's our

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.290 
first you can't see none so here's our
simple<00:01:37.380> sandcastle<00:01:38.380> and<00:01:38.700> real<00:01:39.700> quick<00:01:40.000> it's

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
simple sandcastle and real quick it's

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.660 
simple sandcastle and real quick it's
like<00:01:40.510> it<00:01:40.690> you<00:01:41.170> know<00:01:41.320> what<00:01:41.440> it<00:01:41.530> is<00:01:41.680> and<00:01:42.520> you're

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
like it you know what it is and you're

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.450 
like it you know what it is and you're
on<00:01:42.790> your<00:01:42.940> way<00:01:42.970> to<00:01:43.060> the<00:01:43.150> next<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.840> next<00:01:43.870> table

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
okay so I think we should probably add

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.290 
okay so I think we should probably add
something<00:01:47.590> else<00:01:47.800> to<00:01:47.920> this<00:01:48.160> hat<00:01:48.370> it<00:01:48.940> is<00:01:49.060> pretty

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
something else to this hat it is pretty
