the best way in my opinion to do this is

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.929 
the best way in my opinion to do this is

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
to pickpocket the gun you can simply

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:27.910 
to pickpocket the gun you can simply
save<00:01:26.179> the<00:01:26.420> game<00:01:26.539> before<00:01:26.959> attempting<00:01:27.530> and<00:01:27.709> then

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
save the game before attempting and then

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.609 
save the game before attempting and then
reload<00:01:28.459> if<00:01:28.670> you<00:01:28.759> fail<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:32.750> second<00:01:33.140> way<00:01:33.289> is<00:01:33.560> to

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
reload if you fail the second way is to

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.069 
reload if you fail the second way is to
kill<00:01:34.039> chef<00:01:34.399> han<00:01:34.670> lon<00:01:34.969> and<00:01:35.240> just<00:01:35.539> loot<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:35.869> gun
