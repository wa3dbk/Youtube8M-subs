00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:08.790
 Hey guys, I'm here in Ndalatando. 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.070
 and in this video I'll show you how to do the 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.530
 achievements of the violet castle dungeon 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.379
 which is a dungeon that is located 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.570
 in hortolândia here on the map forest in 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.050
 crystalline corner and more specifically 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.590
 here in dalian city right here in this 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.710
 local 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.660
 So let's stay here at this door and 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.179
 make sure that the dungeon mode is 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.759
 be heroic in five players though 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.950
 there and when you enter that dungeon you go 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.350
 need to talk to this pj call 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.420
 Lieutenant Simpere to start the 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.670
 this event but never works in a 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.239
 way a little different from normal to 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.039
 dungeon will pass in this room and 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.379
 from time to time they saw groups of 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.480
 enemies through portals that will be 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.640
 open and you should always stay 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.309
 looking around the room looking for 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.949
 portals that are the same is the one that 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.620
 You are seeing the image whenever you see. 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.409
 one of these portals run there and wait 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.930
 until the enemies appear in total 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.640
 18 portals will open if you defeat 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.310
 all the enemies that come from these with 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.409
 such you complete the dungeon 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.299
 you can see how many portals are still 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.700
 to be opened looking at the top of the 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.159
 screen where the amount of 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.080
 portals and just below you 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.259
 also has an indicator in which 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.060
 integrity of the prison seal and this 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.909
 is nothing more than an indicator of damage 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.250
 caused by the castle door and all 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.950
 enemies coming out of the portals will 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.189
 directly to the door if you do not 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.900
 attack 1º and there is the first conquest 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.930
 that I will explain the conquest if 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.030
 calls defense that defense and requires that 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.820
 you defeat the final boss who signs 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.130
 enjoy as the eternity of the wax 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.500
 is at 100 percent and that no 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.520
 crystal clear 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.350
 so used to this achievement is 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.290
 just a matter of you identify 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.180
 portals and run toward them to 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.850
 immediately and immediately record the enemies 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.099
 they will come out on the portals before they 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.039
 can reach the door of the instance 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.599
 but even if they reach the door 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.800
 it will take a few seconds until the 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.190
 intimacy of the seal 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.070
 begins to fall below 100% so it's a 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.590
 conquest very easy and neither do you 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.360
 click on these crystals that are 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.940
 scattered around the room 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.100
 if you click on one of these crystals the 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.350
 achievement will fail immediately 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.580
 so no clicks if you want 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.530
 this achievement 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.380
 then the other achievements are 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.690
 related to two random bosses 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.420
 so I 'll explain how the 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.850
 bosses in this dungeon this dungeon 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.970
 you have seven bosses in total but you 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.770
 fight against only three of them being the 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.340
 two first chosen bosses 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:55.680
 randomly between 6 and final boss who 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.380
 It's always like this when six 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.330
 portals open a random shit 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.270
 will appear bare frontal against you 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.340
 when 12 portals were opened another 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.890
 random box will appear 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.960
 and then when 18 portals are opened 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.130
 you will face the final show that is 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.900
 the dangerous 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.450
 So the next conquest I will go. 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.490
 explain is to lock out this 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.410
 conquest requires that you defeat all 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.120
 the six bosses who are random 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.600
 therefore this achievement will 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.340
 need patience and luck because you 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.590
 You will not be able to complete this achievement. 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.170
 in just one race in this most mobile and 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.350
 you will depend on luck so that you 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.209
 Face the bosses you need 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.130
 then every day that passes 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.440
 dungeon until you get lucky. 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.270
 find all six bosses 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.190
 it is worth noting that if you 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.709
 kill the flashmobs until the moment they 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.080
 the first random box recalled does not 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.540
 killing and leaving amazon radar reset 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.430
 instance the instance will be prescribed 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.850
 usually you will have to make a 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.760
 event from the beginning but the boss evoked 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.980
 will always be the same as before so 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.440
 exit the instance and reset to try 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.300
 find different bosses will not 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.350
 you will have to wait until 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.750
 the daily reset of the next day to be able to 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.940
 have a chance to see other bosses 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.919
 the other two achievements of this dungeon 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.840
 which are linked to two chiefs 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.540
 random so you too 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.039
 depend on luck to be able to find 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.940
 these forests and to be able to 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.670
 achievements 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.350
 one of them is the dehydration that 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.140
 this requires you to defeat the boss in 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.690
 colon without allowing any Globe 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.420
 clean half term with boss 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.000
 then you should hit the bossa of that 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.550
 lose booth that is in it and when it 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.820
 miss the booth countless god are going to come 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:48.030
 towards it and you should delete 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.760
 all hades before they reach a 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.100
 boss and you have two ways to do 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.600
 that the first is to use 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.440
 my area and kill them all 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.390
 quickly and the second way is by clicking 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.190
 in the crystals of defense around the room 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.270
 at the time the additional furniture 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.250
 appear 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.200
 when clicking on a crystal all the 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.650
 blood cells will die after a few seconds 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.990
 which makes conquest easier but 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.540
 You're going to miss another achievement that I 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.440
 I explained earlier that the defense that 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.870
 defense 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.460
 so if you feel confident of 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.800
 you will get to kill all 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.630
 globules qualities of its class 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.610
 do this to receive both 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.370
 achievements but if you are not 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.680
 confident then uses crystals 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.530
 but note that the other achievement will 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.120
 fail but remember that this achievement 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.120
 You need luck to find 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.520
 this boss so do not waste the 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.370
 chance already another achievement that will fail 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.010
 no luck, you can do it 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.780
 the next day and a process of killing 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.540
 the blocks should be repeated some 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.670
 times during the fine until the boss 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.290
 can be killed then when you boot 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.600
 defeated not to have the conquest with 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:00.360
 so much that no globe has touched 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.880
 in boxing and the last conquest I'll go 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.610
 explaining is causing chaos to conquest 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.400
 requires you to defeat the dramatic boss . 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.600
 shutter without killing any sentry 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.550
 chaos 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.230
 and for this achievement you will need to give 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.230
 luck once again find this 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:19.050
 forest but the achievement is very 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:21.960
 simple only if you only use 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:24.960
 attacks of something unique in the boss without causing 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.460
 damage in area and the achievement will be yours 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.560
 defeat him 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.780
 and these are the four achievements that 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.030
 are part of the hero's glory present 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:36.560
 in this dungeon and I hope you have 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.560
 liked and until the next
