00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.149
 new to be stable I bring a server of 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.919
 star wars good the only thing they have to 

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:27.960

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.570
 description tells me multiple yesterday to give 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:37.680
 direct net or add a server as 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.920
 whatever you can I just me 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.540

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:53.430
 that's all because obviously it fits 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.189
 as to say that they are the ones for 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.420
 people awarded media hashtag daniel danny 

00:00:56.189 --> 00:01:01.769

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.829

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:07.320
 come to this that compass and see if it ends 

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:08.759

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.070
 throw us here we are with daniel quoted 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.329
 daniel quoted afp 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.370
 we have to see if we take a 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:22.090
 starting fast ping 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.160
 ready to call in any class the 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.220
 that I like to us is like that because 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.680
 we do trampitas not lies because 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.710
 because easier by the pearl ndr but 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:38.250
 yes tony kanaan air then daniel team 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.250
 or do not drink a wine or not

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.580
 a sword like a good sword 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.240
 this is important that base is 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.210
 important here not nothing else and good what 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.260
 what it consists is that you have to kill the 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.810
 other evils 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.390
 that's all, but generally 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.280
 strategy is to leave 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.250
 Asia 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:09.380

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:12.780
 serves I prefer more serves me serves and 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.530
 This serves me and the pontoons 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.330
 because he plays 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.120
 because I mean pants and I do not 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.410
 they give to see nothing more 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.410

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.810

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.810

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.260

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.980
 and this I killed him 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.200
 There is more that is missing, mine is missing 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.200
 OMG 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.390

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.360

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.820
 you want 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.820
 I think it's bad for the arrows 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:34.940
 to see have no I can not or can not but 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:38.350
 maintains that the mayor has not but hopefully 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.350
 everything you want badly I hope you win 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:45.540

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.030
 3 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:59.850
 needle 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:04.750
 hello today, part of me killed me 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:06.550
 it's not bad that very bad use 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.320
 everything by the arrow leaves me a little 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.870
 balls 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.400
 the gameplay is quite entertaining 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.770
 but because Daniel does not work for 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.380
 nothing and they killed him from one we won in 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.930
 land 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.850
 at least that the second state yes 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.670
 they want we have more chapters of 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.270
