00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.470
 Who speaks to you is rafa and vivi 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.150
 here is to show some news of the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.590
 flash book is a case you like not 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.660
 forget to leave a taste underneath 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.830
 because it helps a lot of beauty then 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.960
 Let's go there first thing that 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.730
 Obviously I came back many thanks to 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.140
 all of you who supported there who stayed 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.580
 asking and is feeling a little 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.650
 lack all back so I'll try 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.149
 keep recording to you more videos 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.950
 Do not worry about it 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.690
 but finally let's go now to the news 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.700
 from the flash book in the front row to 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.890
 You are about updating the images. 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.870
 from the corners of campaign time 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.610
 and then change the images of the 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.300
 corners cried it was really cool, I liked it 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.739
 enough 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.629
 not that this will change champion of some 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.270
 way but ends up being a necessity 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.300
 same visual as the flex liter comes 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.930
 implementing anecy in these last months 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.789
 huh 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.280
 another novelty that is not too 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.980
 but it is a visual update of the 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.660
 animation called item tolle stocking up 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.619
 I'm not mistaken, it's something with thorns. 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.689
 in Portuguese 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.549
 now you will be able to see him clearly 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.409
 When are you getting back here? 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.970
 10 of this item in a parish I think well 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.979
 also interesting that the more 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.659
 information you have without 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.460
 stay there checking to see if the champion 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.220
 I have in the item is always very important 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.170
 for you to have more control of the game in 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.450
 light now then for news about it 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.549
 of the little champion who would be a 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.320
 update your looks to your 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.329
 particles of their spells 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.640
 they were updated animation is the 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.470
 effect that the magic causes of the game a 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.240
 general form as well as solar which is a 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.280
 change that is necessary that is 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.229
 interesting is nice to see that it is well 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.390
 but does not directly affect the 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.430
 power of the champion but it's legal 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.320
 to see I really like it when you do it 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.060
 even if they change little but for me 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.829
 what really makes the difference 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.479
 so these animations that you are 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.600
 watching videos are the new relations of the 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.579
 Cadin they were much more purple by 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.200
 so they became more fluent 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.759
 excluded max side said 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.530
 I quite liked maybe people. 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.479
 receive the remedy and look also at the 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.969
 So let's hope to 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.350
 something more concrete in the 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.869
 appearance of the champion but for now 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.830
 we have of the nations spells we also have 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.030
 here at bp 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.250
 the new schin renner 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.560
 called perth cuts I do not know how 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.600
 She stays translated into Portuguese, right? 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.580
 but that's what matters the least 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.870
 What matters most is cisc 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.640
 cool, she looks very pretty 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.770
 you are also buying in video I 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.110
 I thought it was sensational animations 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.180
 particles the visual part of the champion 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.860
 your armor your effects to yourself 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.590
 even with health, which has been very 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.300
 frightful there beating headlong with nothing 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.310
 hellish in my opinion clear on my 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.930
 humble opinion was very nice and 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.989
 I hope it's not a corner in daraa. 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.280
 and 15,975 is more than when you are 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.019
 promotion for sure everyone will 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.010
 want to buy more than very beautiful 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.420
 I really liked it 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.180
 I think there are a lot of you should 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.190
 have liked it even for what it seems 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.019
 which was informed there was announced 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.450
 long ago she had never been to 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.040
 done in fact but now here at tb so 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.060
 We can expect that soon she 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.530
 will also be available from 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.910
 official servers 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.340
 Let's go to the last news of 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.280
 today but not least what is the 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.500
 so famously called the former ex or the ex 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.480
 ac the new way of those who there also 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.519
 is available in the DB and how does this 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.410
 mode works and if instead of being five 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.630
 it's six then if you gave the penta that 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.370
 the now you will be able to perform ex 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.810
 Here I am curious to see how it is 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.570
 it will be the pronunciation how will 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.940
 be within the game the repercussion and 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.829
 this new game mode this hexa kill 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.019
 with six champions for 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:33.269
 each side usually runs the blue 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.530
 chip you get in the queue there are six 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.420
 people on your team and six people 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.160
 they had the opposite but it also implies 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.110
 various discussions on the 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.329
 I'm not going to throw all the subject 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.640
 the ones I have in mind in the ones I read 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.609
 but anyway you have a new method there 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.920
 you can make two top three boats 2002 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:52.290
 then you open a very 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.359
 of options for the game 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.010
 remembering that you are testing in the bp 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.630
 I know if it's going to be a definitive way of 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.060
 because we know he is 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.519
 available in normal games and also 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.620
 customized only on the map of the Andes 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.120
 flu but maybe cid gomes or give a show 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.620
 down that stays for some time maybe 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.880
 stay forever, I do not know very well 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.280
 about this I apologize for this training 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.930
 and need but give it to you at last 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.220
