00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello guys today will help you 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.990
 dealing with such a problem is not something 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:13.679
 this problem but still it bothers 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:17.820
 sometimes, to be exact, sometimes not for everyone 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.980
 she bothers and this problem is called 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.390
 locking the screen when children do not 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.720
 use not use and how 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.369
 because of which 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.300
 firstly it arises it arises 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.869
 due to you leaving just 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.960
 have inserted 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.020
 laptop computer for a long time 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.210
 enabled or just allow computer 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.510
 scan for a virus or perform 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.840
 any lengthy process so he 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.390
 well after a while to save 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.930
 food so that a lot of money is not spent 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:57.989
 let's say from electricity supply 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:02.579
 waste money and he windows so he 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.860
 many did not waste electricity here it is 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:12.420
 turns on automatically when long 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:18.780
 do not use could say how this 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:23.549
 problem to fix but it is very helpful 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:26.549
 as I said, but it still happens 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.450
 unnecessary so go in equipment and 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.450
 sound power supply 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:43.729
 see here different actions go to 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:46.890
 first password request on waking up here 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.920
 it still forgot to say that it is basically 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.290
 that is, it is for laptops I say but 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.380
 there will also just be a little more 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:59.280
 functions for ordinary computers but all 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.619
 so read the definition of a button 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.990
 power supply increase password protection 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.159
 So 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.530
 button power button settings from 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:12.590
 sleep mode and the cover well that is here 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:16.980
 they need to turn off these parameters 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.680
 more precisely, do not disable but look at 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.959
 pressing the power button that's it well you all 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.230
 know where it is 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:32.040
 we need well it depends on you but I 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:35.730
 I choose no action required here 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:43.230
 also reading just helps when you click 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:46.020
 sleep buttons well that he goes here not 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:50.310
 required here she is required when 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:53.430
 closing the lid of the laptop well shorter vizi 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.200
 action is not required another good 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:03.600
 function, that is, if you have a password 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:07.260
 on the windows computer 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.959
 after sleep mode by pressing any key 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:17.220
 you immediately enter the password that is here 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:27.170
 This is the opposite, we turn off to press 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:27.170
 save changes to the same principle, 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:35.329
 that is, it's all the same you see here 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:39.600
 do nothing you need to create a plan 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:42.989
 power supply ie you can do it yourself 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:48.299
 create a plan that is to say 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:53.790
 there was some saving 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:57.000
 Well, you understand the parameters 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.310
 take balancing further further on 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.650
 how many minutes that is here to vote or 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:08.630
 night swing any group can 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:10.500
 that is, so that he could not say so 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.540
 energy saving was that is 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.959
 electricity didn't spend much there 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.360
 such a 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.680
 behind 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.810
 what were your reasons 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.010
 make can choose how many minutes 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.049
 you need about how much 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:27.410
 download will be checked what is 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:39.260
 and create and then at this time include 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:44.260
 what exact time is needed here as well here 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:49.270
 here are the same here what functions 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.270
 throw the display for how long 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:57.410
 connect the display that is, everything will be 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.660
 be performed but the display will just 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:04.160
 switched off 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:06.500
 here translate computer sleep mode well 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.570
 and basically figure it out and anyone can 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:17.150
 it is so labor can just brightness 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:21.250
 remove click save changes 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.250
 In principle, everything is now free to 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:29.140
 use a computer and he doesn't 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:31.550
 everything will never turn off 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:36.220
 Thank you all for watching the likes 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.220
 bye everyone
