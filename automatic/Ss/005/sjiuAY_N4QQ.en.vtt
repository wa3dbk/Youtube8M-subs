00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.139
 like I say carlos drumond of the andrade 

00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:14.110
 dance is not movement is concentration of 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.680
 human natural grace and more than that 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.870
 an ancient body manifestation 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.990
 integral and lived intensely 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:25.840
 society independent of the time of the 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:30.300
 there is no one who does not feel the 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.300
 surrender to contemplate a dance 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.660
 the Joinville Dance Festival the 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.180
 body movements 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.110
 the lightness of the hands are all 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.200
 places 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.830
 when you have a community it 's like the 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:52.010
 size and economic importance of 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:54.110
 joinville student gives conditions to 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.540
 that you will actually grow 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.210
 I got a lot to come today. 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.480
 to count in hours of presentations the 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.089
 festival would have 220 almost ten days 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.990
 uninterrupted dance and the cool of it 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.899
 all that more than half 170 hours are 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.070
 so of free shows in the middle 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:14.960
 community 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.530
 is a cultural diversity because neither 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.660
 all have to understand from other countries 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.979
 and brings a cultural diversity lot 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.800
 great for the city 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.750
 the open stages of the festival are the 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.720
 responsible for increasing the number of 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.810
 dance groups and also the public 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.940
 are places where artists and audiences 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.319
 find and share rich 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:42.410
 experiences in this year's program 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:45.229
 337 groups with 838 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.840
 classical ballet choreographies dances 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.000
 different urban dances different 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.390
 which also go through the process of 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 selection, which guarantees quality almost 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.399
 50% of the groups participating in the 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.490
 dance festival only present themselves 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.410
 in the open stages is the case of these 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.860
 dancers of concord santa catarina 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:09.679
 who came for the fourth time but finally 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.980
 plant area for heartburn is well run 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.739
 well thought out but very rewarding 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.190
 There's a new 30 is an exchange is fine. 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.860
 great it has here is always very good to 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.870
 people are new every year that it gets hot and 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.000
 that 's how the street turns 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.610
 not only as an environment of calls 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.180
 dances but also of dances 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.440
 and contemporary dances 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.720
 precisely to reflect on the 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.879
 paths the intersection with the street 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.640
 The 8th dance seminar brought 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:41.379
 proposal with active life leaves the street to me 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.720
 I got there and I went to the festival. 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.849
 especially for the seminar was 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.090
 invited to present as a study of 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:51.340
 if the monobloc design is a creation of 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.010
 contemporary dance with character of 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.910
 urban intervention taking place in the square 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.370
 public 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.260
 were nine dancers and two years of 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.060
 research and work was invited to 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.620
 participate in the seminar because the theme of 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.230
 has to do with the formation of the 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.299
 survey the relationship with the street to 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.940
 street both in the understanding of what is hip 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.410
 hop of what is popular culture and even 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.359
 proposal of contemporary art that 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.579
 interact with the city or because it is a 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:17.410
 important feature of art 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.859
 contemporary interaction at this time 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.859
 with the city 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.990
