 jo servus people i am a pure one 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:18.609
 and I'm definitely thinking oh my 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.250
 god who is this fun and what 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:23.470
 yes, it just happens to happen 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.580
 kripo formulate yesterday provided from 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.740
 Forgotten his key for the cellar 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.080
 which is why he now no comments to me 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.759
 can do and for this reason had 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.430
 I just asked a new comment 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.320
 Help his channel pick up no that 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.160
 was unfortunately just a fun guys I wanted 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.750
 In any case, me completely 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.190
 Warmly thanks to keeper that me 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.430
 to introduce myself on his channel 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.540
 if we're right no thank you 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.310
 before I get to my actual release 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.840
 story I wanted to have a few more 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.490
 address things in the background 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.290
 he has a solid education clear 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.650
 from me that I have time before some 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.090
 weeks with the sgh playing on fraser and 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.470
 I wanted to guilty the case 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.820
 I sound a bit nervous because of it 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.320
 as I said my first commentary 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.710
 or my first 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.430
 guest comments on a larger channel 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.679
 then come on now too 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.439
 actual story and indeed wanted one 

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:09.490
 So, talk about my teachers 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.240
 then I just found time with mine 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.859
 Math teacher 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.450
 you surely know these teachers 

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:16.240
 only some stuff the whole day 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.920
 smoke and then soder early 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.020
 or in the morning the school 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.850
 purely in the classroom 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.820
 you stand up and you fall 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.259
 death for exactly people so you can 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.270
 introduce my math teacher 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.490
 then I would have to additionally 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:35.409
 Imagine that he is about in the tone 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:39.189
 so people say please hit your 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.719
 books so now I have you a few 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.460
 background information given to 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:44.499
 now we come to my math teacher too 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.090
 even to the actual release story that 

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:48.159
 was playing back then when I was with 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.310
 the school was on the way or on 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.499
 class ride yes I woke up there 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.719
 I looked at my phone like all 

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:58.179
 normal standard and suddenly so 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:01.060
 yes a new language message in his 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:03.249
 group i believe the whole ninth and 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.030
 So all the parallel classes hold all 

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:05.259
 are in a group 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.649
 if you have such a voice message 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.600
 I hear it so then yes supreme 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.730
 Sir 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.070
 So my math teacher holds the truth 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.110
 somehow so right through that came early 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.540
 it has some rubbish in the school 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.370
 stored shit all the time 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.090
 made himself put on his desk 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.920
 has posed in front of secretariat 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.080
 tried his his copy when he 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.210
 Capital has tried his stomach too 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.010
 copy and fuck guys like me 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.950
 that's what I thought, oh you 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.210
 shit what did he smoke today and 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.430
 we were sat us in the room 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.050
 us so laughed off the ass I have 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.120
 I just thought so why was I there 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.710
 not now it can not 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.700
 his 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.170
 yes guys then I come to already 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.210
 next release story that also acts 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.790
 from the math teacher you must remember 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.860
 martin first right a park pro always 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.510
 if he finds a park somewhere then he comes across 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.610
 either from behind or to the rear 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.560
 car 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.930
 that is always so cool and now comes 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.970
 the story so we had a break 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.230
 stop and with us you can stop off then 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.200
 the schoolhouse look normal 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.940
 You can see that all the parking lots 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.890
 Consider this between some 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.600
 parking lots are to trees with such a 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.390
 metal lattice turns that the trees 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.370
 stop not be approached 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.440
 and now comes the horny we look 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.870
 of course, see from the window again 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.940
 his car so from our math teacher and 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.860
 lakes as well as is right on the pole three 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.240
 is now said yes just had the 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.410
 Stange not hit anything bad then 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.420
 Five minutes later we'll have a look again 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.310
 now and then are the construction workers 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.290
 they try the pole 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.840
 dismount because the rod is full 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.640
 Plate old because the bar is a right one 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.260
 delle had 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.330
 and the best is yet to come 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.530
 then went up to the secretariat there 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.580
 we then met by chance 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.560
 Our martin teachers said then 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.870
 yes these are any construction workers 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.300
 should stand by their car and do 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.540
 because something and then said at once 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:00.240
 Suchow it is a great place to go if you are 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.740
 just so down goes like this outside 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.830
 the door out we were not allowed to 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.870
 Both break was and we are allowed this 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.250
 do not leave school grounds 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.000
 and during the break and then we see 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.670
 as he goes out 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.920
 it's still going on like that 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.750
 flailing somehow remember the poor 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.940
 oh so shit that's cool 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.840
 Well in the end, it came to that 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.750
 that he will go back to school 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.270
 come is a bit stressed out 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.010
 we all thought so alas 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.540
 you shit what are they doing now but there 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.910
 So let's go back out and see 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.310
 Building maintenance just always that 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.740
 still the build then just always help 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.240
 still this metal done and indeed 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.030
 just so that we can do it too 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.380
 ass on laughed so guys then it will 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.370
 then if you liked the video 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.770
 then definitely leave a positive 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.840
 rating because I would be happy too 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.740
 bring me over 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.840
 while i can be harmful if you too 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.130
 easier on this video and then 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.360
 I want to say skin up to 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.360
 next time and look
