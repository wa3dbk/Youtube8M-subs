00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:12.589
 hello girls this will be a comparison video between man's face products 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:17.119
 of the snow make-up line we begin immediately with him that 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.710
 then I would like to compare the fruit with the classic matteo 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:26.369
 blessed indeed they may seem virtually identical in reality they are 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.880
 profoundly different 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.450
 in fact, thank you for every very fine and impalpable mountain 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.659
 list restaurants fashion and if tele 

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:42.749
 extremely site uses really beautiful the martin powder db7 years 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.480
 but it can go directly to the touch, however dull however to the touch 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.180
 and as 70 risk is slightly more do not know instead I want to enjoy it 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.810
 really really use site I don't find a different term to be able to classify it 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.410
 I honestly found both having a mixed skin on the area 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.180
 I come easily to become the exit 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.880
 and in any case I also talked about horses. I added an excellent matting effect 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.670
 but above all the thing I like the most I get is this effect 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.920
 where they were held on shock tv and remains on the skin that time stands still 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.310
 searched and white stimulated 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.440
 a matting effect on the skin 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.890
 suppose, for example, to take some of the marina wet 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.990
 and dab the skin in order to recreate the look a little. of 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.000
 davide lazzaretti 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.190
 ok 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.840
 long ago count and we try to pass on some powder 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.840
 hollywood 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.050
 the earth is completely opaque 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.910
 you are no longer lucid 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.939
 therefore it plays an excellent matting function 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:05.970
 it's completely colorless 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.399
 also the lover is colorless and therefore 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.959
 the fact that it is white I had been nuanced anyway to have a 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.149
 result 

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:16.939
 however transparent 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:22.349
 however, care must be taken when seeing the well-blended otherwise good 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.569
 layers of silvia go slightly to lighten the color 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.120
 all the 2005 are very good ignorant I found a volvo hardly 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.910
 I can 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.959
 however, increasing milk are both valid 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.859
 let's now pass dominant dances 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:42.270
 poor love compares the name angela ita 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.900
 coop other 2 the nominates of the fed could be the whole turn 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.660
 our 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.159
 for the city text filters 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:56.019
 then already seeing the so envious perceives are three colors 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:56.869
 different 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:59.340
 we could say that laura is not there 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.560
 the cove is a good compromise with the shades between two dates that perhaps too much 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.340
 golden 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.900
 and the head and syphilis cyclocross ata 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.900
 for these ghosts directly the comparison 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:17.399
 on the skin are all 3 days smoking so the fact that the umbrella is a 

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:22.079
 enlightening and that one continues to be a good believer even when 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.260
 the products are well turned out 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.489
 here I love art and this is fine but sky perfection is the messiah 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.629
 told that the plague city are properly not owls 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.820
 ruminants therefore their characteristic is that of conferring a light 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.239
 more brightness to the skin without actually being the living 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:42.659
 then 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:44.939
 he could use them all over his face 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:48.629
 applying the shadow of the geraci instead the whole face would be a mistake because 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.180
 being just an illuminating sill only specific black points 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.010
 face to confer with moons 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.929
 oslo - it's done 

00:03:56.929 --> 00:03:59.899
 then i would like to compare the shadow cruises 

00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:02.090
 then darken the scepter 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.609
 curriculum and will be born 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:07.059
 which seems quite similar 

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:11.790
 the only difference is that it keeps more roast alarms than the reddish one 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.199
 while real estate ombraluce chateau and just on the brown though 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:21.669
 both are good for the contribution because they are both colors 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:22.650
 pop marks 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.160
 enough nature in the sense that they do not create other pistachios 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.560
 and therefore they work well I will show you also on the skin 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:34.300
 here is the result this here and then 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.580
 light I go down finally I would like to compare the parts of the chat 

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:40.789
 because precisely 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:44.899
 eu are those that show more finite similarity 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:49.350
 the new gramsci to what will be released soon alexandra stan 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.950
 calculus is really beautiful and reminds a little bit of the genre of whether I love it or not 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.350
 hey baby pink lady 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.060
 poor this is a little cinema provided 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.000
 the whole thing that pleases me is that with installer time it seems that 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.970
 we have increased the basic pigmentation if in fact we use for example 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.740
 the pink lady 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.740
 we insert 1 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.199
 isamar time we immediately notice 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.669
 we immediately notice that with standard time and above all basic pigmentation 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:26.940
 arms jump 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.580
 in fact the color seems a little darker than the other 2 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:38.069
 in the other cases we see above all the background reflection of the chat chat 

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:39.670
 and enter 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:45.010
 but little the color instead standart even a little bit - declared ocean finish 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.129
 the final 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:51.029
 these microlith quarters are noted that pigmented bottom patty is not noticed 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.500
 then 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.080
 you could not use shaded inbet to give 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.080
 this very colorful effect 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:01.249
 last 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:02.749
 comparison 

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:05.749
 that of the newly noticed ice in class 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.249
 crime 

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:11.339
 in the packaging facts look very similar 

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:14.059
 I'll show you 

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:19.340
 especially as a final finish the cocktail is actually slightly more 

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:21.010
 advanced of the crimes 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.440
 which appears more on the fishing preface than here 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.240
 this is the result are two extremely charlie colors 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.409
 this is the reddest cocktail 

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:35.409
 this instead of crimes 

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:42.370
 what I need is a little bit smarter than the pescara anyway 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.759
 see also 

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:46.759
 from the packs 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.500
 this one is a little bit more loaded and just a little bit of lieutenant 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.830
 more al pescara 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.419
 these were all utility comparisons in my opinion had to be made 

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:00.350
 the cost 

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.819
 I wanted to make myself pollution and eyes 

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:06.379
 rt comment first true 

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:08.559
 This 

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:12.659
 that you did but could be used safely even with the 

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:16.129
 fat in fact if you see it as a whole it does not clash with the fact 

00:07:17.119 --> 00:07:20.119
 made me smile 

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:24.080
 here she is 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.979
 therefore well shaded it could be used safely also as 

00:07:29.979 --> 00:07:33.319
 really like not wet directly on the skin 

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:39.680
 at this time I was at barium video comparison motomix among the various products 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.210
 if you have doubts and miscellaneous things, you can write a comment 

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.169
 below the video try to answer as soon as possible 

00:07:47.169 --> 00:07:48.290
 hugs to everybody 

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:50.140
