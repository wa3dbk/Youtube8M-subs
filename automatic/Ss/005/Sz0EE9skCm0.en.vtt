00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
basically a gold sword

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.030 
basically a gold sword
it<00:02:43.480> looks<00:02:43.630> pretty<00:02:43.750> plain<00:02:44.170> though<00:02:44.470> I<00:02:44.500> mean<00:02:44.770> just

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
it looks pretty plain though I mean just

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.360 
it looks pretty plain though I mean just
one<00:02:45.760> color<00:02:46.030> of<00:02:46.210> gold<00:02:46.420> on<00:02:46.780> it<00:02:46.990> and<00:02:47.290> even<00:02:48.190> the

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
one color of gold on it and even the

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
handle there's no paint here would it be

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.410 
handle there's no paint here would it be
nice<00:02:50.709> if<00:02:50.890> there<00:02:51.010> was<00:02:51.070> paint<00:02:51.430> was<00:02:52.209> some

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
nice if there was paint was some

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.530 
nice if there was paint was some
detailing<00:02:52.900> or<00:02:53.200> some<00:02:53.350> shading<00:02:54.240> but<00:02:55.240> the<00:02:55.360> end

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
detailing or some shading but the end

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.660 
detailing or some shading but the end
here<00:02:56.310> it's<00:02:57.310> like<00:02:57.459> a<00:02:58.860> carving<00:02:59.860> it's<00:03:00.459> pretty

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
here it's like a carving it's pretty

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.790 
here it's like a carving it's pretty
tough<00:03:00.850> to<00:03:00.910> see<00:03:01.240> maybe<00:03:01.560> but<00:03:02.560> there<00:03:02.680> was<00:03:02.770> a

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
tough to see maybe but there was a

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.580 
tough to see maybe but there was a
cymbal<00:03:03.280> at<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.640> very<00:03:03.820> hill<00:03:04.420> to<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:04.630> sword<00:03:05.020> so

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
cymbal at the very hill to the sword so

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.010 
cymbal at the very hill to the sword so
that's<00:03:05.709> a<00:03:05.800> pretty<00:03:05.950> good<00:03:06.130> detail<00:03:06.660> she<00:03:07.660> also<00:03:07.750> has

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.159 
articulation but you can spin it same
thing<00:04:53.780> here

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
thing here

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.950 
thing here
one<00:04:54.380> point<00:04:54.590> at<00:04:54.770> the<00:04:54.889> knee<00:04:55.690> nothing<00:04:56.690> at<00:04:56.840> the

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
one point at the knee nothing at the

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.690 
one point at the knee nothing at the
lower<00:04:57.139> legs<00:04:57.639> but<00:04:58.639> at<00:04:58.880> the<00:04:59.060> feet<00:04:59.330> area<00:05:00.250> just<00:05:01.250> up

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
lower legs but at the feet area just up

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.110 
lower legs but at the feet area just up
and<00:05:01.880> down<00:05:02.120> and<00:05:02.419> you<00:05:02.660> can<00:05:02.690> spin<00:05:03.169> that<00:05:03.200> as<00:05:03.470> well

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
and down and you can spin that as well

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.990 
and down and you can spin that as well
so<00:05:05.120> the<00:05:05.240> articulation<00:05:05.870> isn't<00:05:06.229> so<00:05:06.770> bad<00:05:07.010> the

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
so the articulation isn't so bad the

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.330 
so the articulation isn't so bad the
detailing<00:05:08.389> is<00:05:08.600> okay<00:05:08.870> but<00:05:09.010> this<00:05:10.010> what's<00:05:10.250> not

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
detailing is okay but this what's not

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.640 
detailing is okay but this what's not
much<00:05:10.580> wanted<00:05:10.970> character<00:05:11.389> so<00:05:11.630> it<00:05:11.870> is<00:05:12.020> a<00:05:12.050> good<00:05:12.560> to

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
much wanted character so it is a good to

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:19.570 
much wanted character so it is a good to
get<00:05:12.940> Valkyrie<00:05:16.150> this<00:05:17.770> green<00:05:18.770> Hulk<00:05:19.010> is<00:05:19.190> huge

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
get Valkyrie this green Hulk is huge

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
get Valkyrie this green Hulk is huge
here<00:05:20.060> and<00:05:20.860> as<00:05:21.860> mentioned<00:05:22.520> it<00:05:23.120> took<00:05:23.330> a<00:05:23.360> while<00:05:23.570> to

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
here and as mentioned it took a while to

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.540 
here and as mentioned it took a while to
get<00:05:23.780> this<00:05:23.990> figure<00:05:24.320> because<00:05:24.860> it<00:05:25.100> was<00:05:25.250> delayed

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
get this figure because it was delayed

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.700 
get this figure because it was delayed
but<00:05:26.360> what's<00:05:26.539> really<00:05:26.660> cool<00:05:26.960> is<00:05:27.020> if<00:05:27.440> you've<00:05:27.680> got

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
but what's really cool is if you've got

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.000 
but what's really cool is if you've got
the<00:05:27.919> Red<00:05:28.100> Hulk<00:05:28.960> and<00:05:29.960> you<00:05:30.229> got<00:05:30.380> this<00:05:30.500> green<00:05:30.770> Hulk

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
the Red Hulk and you got this green Hulk

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.310 
the Red Hulk and you got this green Hulk
since<00:05:31.490> they<00:05:31.640> use<00:05:32.090> the<00:05:32.270> same<00:05:32.450> base<00:05:32.720> body<00:05:32.990> and

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
since they use the same base body and

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.650 
since they use the same base body and
just<00:05:33.919> a<00:05:34.039> head<00:05:34.190> is<00:05:34.310> different<00:05:34.479> then<00:05:35.479> they<00:05:35.600> were

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
just a head is different then they were

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.529 
just a head is different then they were
perfect<00:05:36.110> match<00:05:36.380> I<00:05:36.740> could<00:05:37.130> say<00:05:37.370> that<00:05:37.669> one<00:05:38.270> fits

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:38.539 
perfect match I could say that one fits

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:41.409 
perfect match I could say that one fits
the<00:05:38.690> other<00:05:38.840> perfectly<00:05:39.440> for<00:05:39.740> a<00:05:39.770> display<00:05:40.419> so

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
the other perfectly for a display so

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.710 
the other perfectly for a display so
that's<00:05:41.690> a<00:05:41.780> really<00:05:42.080> good<00:05:42.289> thing<00:05:42.740> to<00:05:42.890> have<00:05:43.039> and

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
that's a really good thing to have and

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.140 
that's a really good thing to have and
as<00:05:44.720> mentioned<00:05:45.680> Ed<00:05:46.160> McGuinness<00:05:46.460> thought<00:05:46.850> some

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
as mentioned Ed McGuinness thought some

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.480 
as mentioned Ed McGuinness thought some
people<00:05:47.180> liked<00:05:47.570> his<00:05:47.750> style<00:05:47.990> and<00:05:48.320> some<00:05:49.100> don't

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
people liked his style and some don't

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.090 
people liked his style and some don't
this<00:05:50.030> Hawk<00:05:50.240> looks<00:05:50.690> to<00:05:51.500> be<00:05:51.620> one<00:05:51.770> of<00:05:51.890> the<00:05:51.950> better

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
this Hawk looks to be one of the better

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.810 
this Hawk looks to be one of the better
ones<00:05:52.370> maybe<00:05:52.910> not<00:05:53.150> the<00:05:53.300> best<00:05:53.330> one<00:05:53.810> overall<00:05:54.320> but

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
ones maybe not the best one overall but

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.170 
ones maybe not the best one overall but
definitely<00:05:55.820> one<00:05:56.000> of<00:05:56.030> the<00:05:56.830> higher<00:05:57.830> one<00:05:58.190> I<00:05:58.430> would

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 
definitely one of the higher one I would

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.990 
definitely one of the higher one I would
say<00:05:59.740> it's<00:06:00.740> nice<00:06:00.979> that<00:06:01.010> they<00:06:01.310> used<00:06:01.640> some

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
say it's nice that they used some

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.630 
say it's nice that they used some
shading<00:06:02.419> here<00:06:02.770> Hasbro<00:06:03.770> that<00:06:04.370> they're

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:04.640

early Marvel Legends they didn't shade

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:13.900 
early Marvel Legends they didn't shade
