about bottom bracket stiffness what all

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.850 
about bottom bracket stiffness what all
these<00:00:42.329> tests<00:00:42.750> were<00:00:42.899> late<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.320> are<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.680> ride

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
it's gonna list how we stack up against

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.119 
it's gonna list how we stack up against
our<00:01:01.820> relevant<00:01:02.360> competitors<00:01:02.899> in<00:01:03.079> the<00:01:03.170> world<00:01:03.199> so

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
our relevant competitors in the world so

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.590 
our relevant competitors in the world so
as<00:01:04.220> you<00:01:04.430> know<00:01:04.580> a<00:01:04.610> lot<00:01:04.699> of<00:01:04.850> these<00:01:05.030> tests<00:01:05.420> are<00:01:05.479> not

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
as you know a lot of these tests are not

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.230 
as you know a lot of these tests are not
new<00:01:05.900> they're<00:01:06.259> industry<00:01:06.800> standard<00:01:07.280> tests<00:01:07.670> but

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
new they're industry standard tests but

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.070 
new they're industry standard tests but
one<00:01:08.420> of<00:01:08.509> the<00:01:08.570> things<00:01:08.780> that's<00:01:08.990> a<00:01:09.050> little

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
one of the things that's a little

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.780 
one of the things that's a little
different<00:01:09.500> that<00:01:09.770> you'll<00:01:09.890> see<00:01:10.100> in<00:01:10.220> our<00:01:10.310> testing

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
different that you'll see in our testing

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.969 
different that you'll see in our testing
versus<00:01:11.119> everybody<00:01:11.360> else<00:01:11.570> is<00:01:11.869> testing<00:01:12.320> aside

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
versus everybody else is testing aside

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.440 
versus everybody else is testing aside
from<00:01:13.159> some<00:01:13.340> of<00:01:13.460> the<00:01:13.550> proprietary<00:01:14.119> methods

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
from some of the proprietary methods

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.969 
from some of the proprietary methods
that<00:01:14.600> we're<00:01:14.720> using<00:01:14.930> like<00:01:15.259> using<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:15.680> fork

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
that we're using like using the fork

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.430 
that we're using like using the fork
versus<00:01:16.430> a<00:01:16.460> steel<00:01:16.759> bar<00:01:17.090> is<00:01:17.360> that<00:01:17.990> on<00:01:18.110> everybody

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
versus a steel bar is that on everybody

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.170 
versus a steel bar is that on everybody
else<00:01:18.619> is<00:01:18.770> testing<00:01:19.190> numbers<00:01:19.520> we're<00:01:20.060> not

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
else is testing numbers we're not

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.620 
else is testing numbers we're not
included<00:01:20.830> giant<00:01:21.830> bikes<00:01:22.009> are<00:01:22.220> not<00:01:22.250> there<00:01:22.789> the

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
included giant bikes are not there the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.570 
included giant bikes are not there the
reason<00:01:23.990> why<00:01:24.200> is<00:01:24.800> because<00:01:24.860> the<00:01:25.130> giant<00:01:25.430> bikes

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
reason why is because the giant bikes

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.870 
reason why is because the giant bikes
are<00:01:25.759> superior<00:01:26.119> and<00:01:27.610> the<00:01:28.610> other<00:01:28.759> guys

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
are superior and the other guys

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.400 
are superior and the other guys
marketing<00:01:29.270> departments<00:01:29.720> can't<00:01:29.899> figure<00:01:30.170> a<00:01:30.259> way

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
marketing departments can't figure a way

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.680 
marketing departments can't figure a way
around<00:01:30.560> that<00:01:31.250> superiority<00:01:32.060> so<00:01:32.360> they<00:01:32.479> don't

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
around that superiority so they don't

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.900 
around that superiority so they don't
include<00:01:32.869> us<00:01:33.080> at<00:01:33.229> all<00:01:33.429> what<00:01:34.429> we<00:01:34.550> did<00:01:34.729> is<00:01:34.880> we

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
include us at all what we did is we

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.760 
include us at all what we did is we
actually<00:01:35.390> went<00:01:35.600> out<00:01:35.660> and<00:01:35.869> purchased<00:01:36.080> all<00:01:36.530> of

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
actually went out and purchased all of

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.520 
actually went out and purchased all of
our<00:01:36.890> relevant<00:01:37.460> competitors<00:01:38.090> frames<00:01:38.509> and<00:01:38.869> when

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
our relevant competitors frames and when

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.900 
our relevant competitors frames and when
we<00:01:39.619> bought<00:01:39.800> these<00:01:40.009> bikes<00:01:40.220> we<00:01:40.399> took<00:01:40.550> them<00:01:40.700> all

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
we bought these bikes we took them all

so<00:02:44.840> obviously<00:02:45.140> weight<00:02:45.410> is<00:02:45.560> a<00:02:45.590> key<00:02:45.800> component

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
so obviously weight is a key component

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.009 
so obviously weight is a key component

do that

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:24.140 
do that
hence<00:05:22.530> nobody<00:05:23.009> else<00:05:23.160> can<00:05:23.340> hit<00:05:23.490> those<00:05:23.610> results

hence nobody else can hit those results

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.999 
hence nobody else can hit those results
so<00:05:24.330> the<00:05:25.229> next<00:05:25.410> test<00:05:25.530> we're<00:05:25.680> gonna<00:05:25.770> talk<00:05:25.979> about

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:26.009 
so the next test we're gonna talk about

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:28.309 
so the next test we're gonna talk about
is<00:05:26.340> the<00:05:26.460> bottom<00:05:26.580> bracket<00:05:26.819> stiffness<00:05:27.449> test<00:05:27.690> and

00:05:28.309 --> 00:05:28.319 
is the bottom bracket stiffness test and

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:30.020 
is the bottom bracket stiffness test and
how<00:05:28.470> we<00:05:28.530> set<00:05:28.830> up<00:05:28.979> and<00:05:29.130> administer<00:05:29.340> this<00:05:29.729> test

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
how we set up and administer this test

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.520 
how we set up and administer this test
is<00:05:30.240> the<00:05:30.330> bike<00:05:30.509> is<00:05:30.660> locked<00:05:30.990> into<00:05:31.169> a<00:05:31.289> steel

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
is the bike is locked into a steel

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.680 
is the bike is locked into a steel
fixture<00:05:31.949> at<00:05:32.009> a<00:05:32.069> 10<00:05:32.310> degree<00:05:32.430> angle<00:05:32.610> but<00:05:33.419> rear

dropouts<00:05:34.169> and<00:05:34.410> the<00:05:34.680> fork<00:05:34.919> dropouts<00:05:35.310> are

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
dropouts and the fork dropouts are

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.010 
dropouts and the fork dropouts are
locked<00:05:35.699> into<00:05:35.940> the<00:05:36.030> steel<00:05:36.330> fixtures<00:05:36.750> so<00:05:36.900> they

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
locked into the steel fixtures so they

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.290 
locked into the steel fixtures so they
cannot<00:05:37.410> move<00:05:37.650> we<00:05:38.400> then<00:05:38.580> put<00:05:38.849> in<00:05:38.940> a<00:05:39.060> steel

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
cannot move we then put in a steel

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.420 
cannot move we then put in a steel
fixture<00:05:39.720> which<00:05:39.870> simulates<00:05:40.229> crank<00:05:40.740> load<00:05:40.979> the

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:44.779 
crank arm is set down at a 45 degree
angle<00:05:43.410> which<00:05:43.830> is<00:05:43.860> the<00:05:43.979> highest<00:05:44.280> point<00:05:44.639> of

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789 
angle which is the highest point of

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:46.999 
angle which is the highest point of
power<00:05:44.940> in<00:05:45.150> any<00:05:45.240> given<00:05:45.569> pedal<00:05:45.840> stroke<00:05:46.110> we<00:05:46.680> apply

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:47.009 
power in any given pedal stroke we apply

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:48.860 
power in any given pedal stroke we apply
pressure<00:05:47.039> to<00:05:47.580> the<00:05:47.789> end<00:05:47.970> of<00:05:48.150> that<00:05:48.180> crank<00:05:48.630> arm

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
pressure to the end of that crank arm

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.960 
pressure to the end of that crank arm
which<00:05:49.289> then<00:05:49.560> shows<00:05:49.860> us<00:05:50.099> the<00:05:50.250> deflection<00:05:50.849> in

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
which then shows us the deflection in

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.309 
which then shows us the deflection in
the<00:05:51.060> bottom<00:05:51.360> bracket<00:05:51.479> which<00:05:51.810> we<00:05:51.900> measure<00:05:52.139> in

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:52.319 
the bottom bracket which we measure in

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:54.529 
the bottom bracket which we measure in
Newton<00:05:52.620> meters<00:05:52.740> so<00:05:53.669> what<00:05:53.849> does<00:05:53.970> all<00:05:54.120> this<00:05:54.300> mean

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
Newton meters so what does all this mean

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:56.990 
Newton meters so what does all this mean
when<00:05:55.289> we<00:05:55.409> take<00:05:55.620> all<00:05:55.800> these<00:05:55.919> measurements<00:05:56.610> what

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
when we take all these measurements what

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.640 
when we take all these measurements what
we're<00:05:57.180> doing<00:05:57.419> is<00:05:57.509> we're<00:05:57.659> showing<00:05:57.900> how<00:05:58.199> stiff

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
we're doing is we're showing how stiff

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.100 
we're doing is we're showing how stiff
and<00:05:58.830> how<00:05:58.979> efficient<00:05:59.669> the<00:06:00.060> powertrain<00:06:00.509> area<00:06:00.930> is

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110 
and how efficient the powertrain area is

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.839 
and how efficient the powertrain area is
within<00:06:01.319> a<00:06:01.530> given<00:06:01.680> bike<00:06:01.979> so<00:06:02.490> here<00:06:02.669> at<00:06:02.789> the

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:02.849 
within a given bike so here at the

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:04.879 
within a given bike so here at the
bottom<00:06:03.150> bracket<00:06:03.449> stiffness<00:06:03.870> results<00:06:04.259> and<00:06:04.740> one

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:04.889 
bottom bracket stiffness results and one

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:06.170 
bottom bracket stiffness results and one
of<00:06:04.979> the<00:06:05.039> first<00:06:05.310> things<00:06:05.520> you'll<00:06:05.669> notice<00:06:05.699> is

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
of the first things you'll notice is

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.399 
of the first things you'll notice is
that<00:06:06.210> we're<00:06:06.509> not<00:06:06.659> number<00:06:06.810> one<00:06:07.080> we're<00:06:07.289> actually

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:07.409 
that we're not number one we're actually

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:09.920 
that we're not number one we're actually
number<00:06:07.740> two<00:06:07.919> and<00:06:08.280> we're<00:06:08.909> okay<00:06:09.270> with<00:06:09.479> that

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
number two and we're okay with that

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.140 
number two and we're okay with that
the<00:06:10.289> reason<00:06:10.770> why<00:06:10.919> were<00:06:11.130> ok<00:06:11.460> with<00:06:11.490> us<00:06:11.819> is<00:06:12.060> that

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
the reason why were ok with us is that

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.610 
the reason why were ok with us is that
there's<00:06:12.360> a<00:06:12.419> certain<00:06:12.690> point<00:06:13.080> in<00:06:13.289> which<00:06:13.470> it

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
there's a certain point in which it

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.200 
there's a certain point in which it
doesn't<00:06:13.889> matter<00:06:14.340> anymore<00:06:14.610> from<00:06:14.940> bottom

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
doesn't matter anymore from bottom

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.659 
doesn't matter anymore from bottom
