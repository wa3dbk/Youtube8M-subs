00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 hello to all those who are watching me now 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:10.620
 with you I and today we will look at such 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.080
 mode like a few hills I continue 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.660
 review different modes of weight space and 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.600
 here we will have to capture 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.539
 existing points of the hills still we have to 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.689
 protect cattle from air attacks now 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:29.970
 high school will boot and I will explain by 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:33.059
 As things went on, it loaded well, and we 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.050
 connect syntax less they still 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:40.200
 were mean we choose a character and 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.870
 we have this one here. this foul 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.899
 with the crown this is that hill then . 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.360
 which we need to capture both teams 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.750
 trying to reach this hill and how 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:55.620
 can you hold it longer 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.899
 my goal and well i set i play 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.000
 a sniper in this mode the game is only 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.530
 snipers i stay up some 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.229
 pathetic and wait for somebody 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.380
 some balloon will come out and right to 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.689
 me on sight 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.119
 tearing it up 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:14.460
 passes earlier I think the pick is very 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.939
 useless thing that she is very bad 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.640
 dripping that sniper just loses 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.320
 because of this but then I realized that when 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.540
 dig so small body tunnel 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.770
 by 33 you dig up just everything and 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.780
 and everything and nothing will be well let's say we 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.610
 now sit so crouched hid 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.009
 jumped out hid out sniper 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.890
 hit sniper put headshots out 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.590
 this came out this put headshots yet 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.750
 one so now seems to come up yet 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.630
 one sniper and another rocket man 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.149
 I see there we have a sniper is not one that is 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.680
 helps me well, just to help our 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.690
 team well this is a sniper so i 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.270
 here magyar 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:59.660
 and another headshots reload this too 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:02.030
 there was a shot in his head but nothing 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.230
 happens don't know sometimes you shoot 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.170
 ring 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:10.460
 you shoot and you aim at nothing 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:14.180
 you don't write anything clean good 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:18.550
 and it means there top under the map here and and 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.960
 green and here we are here now and 70 and 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.360
 140 become and air attacks you heard 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.470
 the plane and now it's all just here 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.630
 fly to hell here's the bombs of it 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.640
 probably now take yes as seen 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.120
 only with him taken in the sense you 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.790
 watched in chat left above 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.920
 written murder who killed whom and 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.440
 I saw someone who sees me 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.070
 by the way haunts me when except dude 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.350

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.000
 spoke there we are all 270 but 160 is already 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.239
 have this points the longer we hold the point 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.250
 the more points gives us 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:10.820
 it seems in this mode as I remember it is given 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:15.650
 20 minutes and now in 20 minutes who will 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:18.440
 more points that wins when 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.390
 home green i mean it's green 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.720
 captured when blue blue captured 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.060
 when Gray has no one captured when 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.739
 red on there now stand on this Th 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.739
 psalm he both commands 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.030
 That means compote because they are on such 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.610
 that is, red yes and so it is under attack 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.360
 now we dig another tunnel and 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:43.970
 we will continue to sniper no it 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:49.100
 bad need to dig a little further to 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:51.459
 We had a better review. 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:57.050
 no one noticed that I am now 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:58.880
 I am not on that field 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.730
 but I have to dig there for a very long time 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.280
 let's get better and build 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.410
 anything here 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:12.990
 here my little blue hat was not noticed 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:17.650
 and I can calmly ah-ah-ah-ah 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:19.989
 will explode and while i was digging visit 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:27.430
 air attack and now let's 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:30.900
 let's see well well we ourselves the plane we are not 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:33.810

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:38.550
 looked okay nothing happens 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:42.070

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:13.450
 we can lose with bags and snowballs 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:15.940
