00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
meant to have the tree spawn on the

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.480 
meant to have the tree spawn on the
outside<00:00:25.080> as<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.350> can<00:00:25.500> see<00:00:25.650> some<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.039> them<00:00:26.220> are

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
outside as you can see some of them are

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.359 
outside as you can see some of them are
already<00:00:26.820> spawning<00:00:27.570> up<00:00:27.689> there<00:00:27.900> but<00:00:28.369> it's

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
already spawning up there but it's

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.070 
already spawning up there but it's
interesting<00:00:29.730> because<00:00:30.119> this<00:00:30.420> guy's<00:00:30.599> actually

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
interesting because this guy's actually

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
interesting because this guy's actually
trying<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.410> get<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:32.149> win<00:00:33.149> off<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.510> this<00:00:34.100> there's

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
trying to get a win off of this there's

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.830 
trying to get a win off of this there's
not<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.460> much<00:00:35.640> loot<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.149> I'm<00:00:36.239> guessing<00:00:36.690> he

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
not that much loot so I'm guessing he

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.060 
not that much loot so I'm guessing he
was<00:00:36.930> trying<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.170> go<00:00:37.260> for<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.500> 2<00:00:37.710> star<00:00:39.170> and<00:00:40.170> so

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
was trying to go for a 2 star and so

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.619 
was trying to go for a 2 star and so
he's<00:00:41.219> working<00:00:41.370> his<00:00:41.610> way<00:00:41.640> in<00:00:41.910> he's<00:00:42.120> got<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.329> full

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
he's working his way in he's got a full

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.790 
he's working his way in he's got a full
team<00:00:43.100> his<00:00:44.100> heroes<00:00:44.489> aren't<00:00:44.850> too<00:00:45.000> strong<00:00:45.800> but

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
team his heroes aren't too strong but

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.950 
team his heroes aren't too strong but
his<00:00:46.950> troops<00:00:47.219> are<00:00:49.789> and<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.030> I'm<00:00:51.270> not<00:00:51.420> sure<00:00:51.690> what

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
his troops are and so I'm not sure what

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.770 
his troops are and so I'm not sure what
exactly<00:00:52.440> he<00:00:52.559> was<00:00:52.590> going<00:00:53.039> for<00:00:53.420> but<00:00:54.420> as<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.660> can

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
exactly he was going for but as you can

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.750 
exactly he was going for but as you can
see<00:00:54.840> his<00:00:55.110> king<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.739> his<00:00:55.829> queen<00:00:56.129> are<00:00:56.309> already

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
see his king and his queen are already

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.569 
see his king and his queen are already
down<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.899> maybe<00:00:58.440> he<00:00:58.710> was<00:00:58.890> mistaken<00:00:59.039> because

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
down and I maybe he was mistaken because

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.819 
down and I maybe he was mistaken because
he<00:00:59.969> actually<00:01:00.420> tries<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.989> throw<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.230> race<00:01:01.500> fill

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
he actually tries to throw a race fill

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.280 
he actually tries to throw a race fill

you guys so I don't know how much left
my<00:04:37.570> Packers<00:04:37.900> could<00:04:38.050> do<00:04:38.200> but<00:04:38.410> in<00:04:38.560> case<00:04:38.770> they

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
my Packers could do but in case they

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:42.300 
my Packers could do but in case they
can't<00:04:39.220> get<00:04:39.340> any<00:04:39.490> more<00:04:40.710> fast<00:04:41.710> but<00:04:41.979> it<00:04:42.130> looks

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
can't get any more fast but it looks

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.280 
can't get any more fast but it looks
like<00:04:42.400> what<00:04:43.330> a<00:04:43.360> lot<00:04:43.510> of<00:04:43.600> people<00:04:43.810> are<00:04:43.900> using<00:04:44.050> the
