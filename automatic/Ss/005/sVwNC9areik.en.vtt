00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.610
 the crawl style is the fastest of the four swimming styles 

00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:12.319
 being the style that free swim tests are used 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.589
 according to the regulations the distances that are freestyle 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:19.669
 50 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:24.569
 200 400 800 and 1,500 meters 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:27.369
 besides being the style that is usually used 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.369
 in long distance competitions 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.430
 in the tests of individual styles the crawl style is the one that is given in last 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.030
 place after labraza 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.760
 and in the relays 4 per 100 styles is also the style that dined in the 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.760
 last post 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.880
 the position that the whole body adopts is a ventral position with the 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.760
 legs extended and head slightly tilted forward 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.290
 coincide and not the surface of the water approximately at the beginning of the 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.970
 hair 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.520
 during the reign of querol 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.740
 the body will execute oscillations at the axis level 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:12.700
 longitudinal 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.070
 product of the action of the arms 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.520
 the tissue of the body will facilitate 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.340
 the effectiveness of the stroke 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.340
 and the fluency of swimming 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.880
 the action of the legs in the crawl style 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.970
 it is an alternative action 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.800
 where you can differentiate two phases 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.600
 an ascending phase at the end of which the leg reaches its highest point and 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.650
 near the surface 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.000
 and a down or down phase 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.180
 where the leg reached its deepest point being this action the 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.180
 properly propulsion 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.420
 the coordination of these leg movements is alternative and contrary 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:16.779
 that when one leg is at its highest point the other leg will be in its 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:19.779
 lowest point 

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:26.189
 the movement of the legs is carried out from the hip occurring in 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:30.769
 this one a flexion in the descending phase and an extension in the phase 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.809
 upward 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:37.569
 the knee also effects a flexion in the upward movement 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.099
 and an extension in the movement of the leg downwards being this action 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.099
 the most proposed 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.200
 the feet of large carry on a relaxed level of the articulation of the 

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:54.799
 ankle and not liquid since in this way the entire surface of the instep 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:58.079
 will execute the defect as an alert 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.969
 there will be a rotation inwards of the feet 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:03.969
 which will increase the propulsion surface 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:09.639
 It can be seen that the movement of the legs in Creole is not a movement 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.099
 purely in the vertical plane 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.159
 but due to the rotation of the body through the longitudinal axis 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:19.529
 the legs also have a slight lateral component 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.519
 the arms move alternately existing an air phase or 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:30.370
 of recovery 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.699
 and a water or traction phase 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:36.279
 being this aquatic phase the proper propulsion to while 

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:39.279
 the patience is purely of recovery of the arms 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:48.379
 the phase of traction the aquatic begins with the entrance of the arm in the 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:53.150
 water being the first hand that enters the water with the palms oriented 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.579
 outward and downward moment at which the elbow will be higher than the hamas
