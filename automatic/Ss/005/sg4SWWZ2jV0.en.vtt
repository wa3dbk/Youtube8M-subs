00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
amount of checkpoints that that equals a

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.830 
amount of checkpoints that that equals a
lap<00:03:50.579> and<00:03:50.819> you<00:03:50.909> start<00:03:51.209> over<00:03:51.420> and<00:03:51.480> get<00:03:51.629> the<00:03:51.690> same

number of laps the fastest is the winner
so<00:03:57.900> that's<00:03:58.200> halo<00:03:58.530> multiplayer<00:03:58.709> on<00:03:59.459> to<00:04:00.060> more

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
so that's halo multiplayer on to more

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.780 
so that's halo multiplayer on to more
the<00:04:00.780> campaign<00:04:01.260> and<00:04:01.590> how<00:04:01.829> to<00:04:01.889> beat<00:04:02.159> it<00:04:02.310> we're

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
the campaign and how to beat it we're

the campaign and how to beat it we're
going<00:04:02.909> to<00:04:02.970> sort<00:04:03.209> of<00:04:03.239> do<00:04:03.389> a<00:04:03.420> little<00:04:03.720> guide<00:04:04.079> i

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
going to sort of do a little guide i

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:06.740 
going to sort of do a little guide i
mean<00:04:04.530> not<00:04:04.709> like<00:04:04.970> specific<00:04:05.970> walkthrough<00:04:06.480> stuff

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
mean not like specific walkthrough stuff

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.720 
mean not like specific walkthrough stuff
but<00:04:07.109> we're<00:04:07.620> going<00:04:07.709> to<00:04:07.799> be<00:04:07.889> describing<00:04:08.310> all<00:04:08.579> the

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
but we're going to be describing all the

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.400 
but we're going to be describing all the
levels<00:04:08.910> to<00:04:09.239> view<00:04:09.389> or<00:04:09.599> at<00:04:09.750> least<00:04:09.930> most<00:04:10.049> of<00:04:10.260> them

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
levels to view or at least most of them

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.830 
levels to view or at least most of them
so<00:04:10.709> first<00:04:11.099> level<00:04:11.340> is<00:04:11.669> the<00:04:12.329> pillar<00:04:12.510> of<00:04:12.629> autumn

robot and you meet him and you get
introduced<00:06:28.389> to<00:06:28.479> the<00:06:28.750> flood<00:06:29.050> and<00:06:29.379> the<00:06:29.650> flood<00:06:29.889> or

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:30.039 
introduced to the flood and the flood or

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:31.619 
introduced to the flood and the flood or
pre<00:06:30.279> creepies<00:06:30.639> got<00:06:30.849> the<00:06:30.940> flood<00:06:31.150> to<00:06:31.270> this<00:06:31.389> brine

00:06:31.619 --> 00:06:31.629 
pre creepies got the flood to this brine

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:34.910 
pre creepies got the flood to this brine
all<00:06:31.870> the<00:06:32.500> flood<00:06:32.919> is<00:06:33.029> basically<00:06:34.029> a<00:06:34.060> pair

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:34.920 
all the flood is basically a pair

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.610 
all the flood is basically a pair
grace<00:06:35.340> that<00:06:35.760> feeds<00:06:36.030> off<00:06:36.270> dead<00:06:36.900> bodies<00:06:37.320> and

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:37.620 
grace that feeds off dead bodies and

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.120 
grace that feeds off dead bodies and
turns<00:06:38.430> them<00:06:38.640> into<00:06:38.820> well<00:06:39.690> flood<00:06:40.130> zombies

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.130 
turns them into well flood zombies

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:42.950 
turns them into well flood zombies
basically<00:06:41.700> they're<00:06:41.910> they're<00:06:42.150> just<00:06:42.390> a<00:06:42.510> zombies

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
basically they're they're just a zombies

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.230 
basically they're they're just a zombies
and<00:06:43.200> there's<00:06:43.620> these<00:06:43.800> little<00:06:43.860> tiny<00:06:44.430> things<00:06:44.850> and

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 
and there's these little tiny things and

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.080 
and there's these little tiny things and
they<00:06:45.420> drill<00:06:46.140> into<00:06:46.320> you<00:06:46.710> the<00:06:47.160> drill<00:06:47.730> into<00:06:47.910> dead

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.090 
they drill into you the drill into dead

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:49.790 
they drill into you the drill into dead
and<00:06:48.330> live<00:06:48.540> bodies<00:06:48.930> and<00:06:49.110> turn<00:06:49.500> them<00:06:49.710> into

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 
and live bodies and turn them into

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.130 
and live bodies and turn them into
walking<00:06:50.400> zombies<00:06:50.850> that<00:06:51.060> attack<00:06:51.540> people<00:06:51.870> then

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:52.140 
walking zombies that attack people then

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:56.000 
walking zombies that attack people then
after<00:06:53.100> that<00:06:53.220> you<00:06:53.430> have<00:06:53.670> the<00:06:54.630> library<00:06:55.200> which<00:06:55.980> is

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.010 
after that you have the library which is

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.250 
after that you have the library which is
this<00:06:56.670> place<00:06:57.000> and<00:06:57.330> this<00:06:57.780> is<00:06:57.930> probably<00:06:58.020> the<00:06:58.230> most

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:58.260 
this place and this is probably the most

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.960 
this place and this is probably the most
boring<00:06:58.410> level<00:06:58.980> ever<00:06:59.160> and<00:06:59.490> it's<00:06:59.610> also<00:06:59.760> the

00:06:59.960 --> 00:06:59.970 
boring level ever and it's also the
