00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
usually a lot more important than higher

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.680 
usually a lot more important than higher
weapon<00:02:11.830> power<00:02:12.040> because<00:02:12.910> if<00:02:13.060> you<00:02:13.209> miss<00:02:13.420> you

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
weapon power because if you miss you

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.260 
weapon power because if you miss you
waste<00:02:13.900> up<00:02:14.110> two<00:02:14.260> of<00:02:14.410> your<00:02:14.590> turns<00:02:14.970> number<00:02:15.970> five
