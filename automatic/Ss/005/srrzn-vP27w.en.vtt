00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:27.900
 functionality 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.229

 nothing indicates the customer's name 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:49.919
 it is useless to specify the customer in the event that they want to make you some 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:52.029
 statistics on favorite dishes 

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:56.029

 indicates the name of the waiter serving the table 

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:05.540
 It is useful if I want information about the table and then 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.379

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:09.599
