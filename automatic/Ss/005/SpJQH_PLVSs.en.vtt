years I was there we were getting off
the<00:02:26.150> back<00:02:26.300> of<00:02:26.330> a<00:02:26.540> bond<00:02:26.750> scheme<00:02:27.140> which<00:02:28.070> you<00:02:28.730> know

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
the back of a bond scheme which you know

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.970 
the back of a bond scheme which you know
I<00:02:29.120> mean<00:02:29.540> it<00:02:29.690> I<00:02:29.720> think<00:02:30.200> he<00:02:30.290> said<00:02:30.530> in<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.739> paper

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
I mean it I think he said in the paper

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.070 
I mean it I think he said in the paper
it<00:02:31.220> was<00:02:31.250> a<00:02:31.340> shambles<00:02:31.670> when<00:02:32.030> he<00:02:32.090> got<00:02:32.239> there<00:02:32.420> yeah

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
it was a shambles when he got there yeah

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.350 
it was a shambles when he got there yeah
but<00:02:33.470> it<00:02:34.340> was<00:02:34.519> on<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.760> back<00:02:34.940> of<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.180> bond

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
but it was on the back of the bond

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.970 
but it was on the back of the bond
scheme<00:02:36.370> fans<00:02:37.370> were<00:02:37.870> it<00:02:38.870> really<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:39.860> know

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
scheme fans were it really you know

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.740 
scheme fans were it really you know
there<00:02:40.160> was<00:02:40.280> writing<00:02:40.700> over<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.120> air<00:02:41.239> I<00:02:41.570> mean

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
there was writing over the air I mean

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.300 
there was writing over the air I mean
they<00:02:41.870> tried<00:02:42.110> again<00:02:42.140> that<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.590> directors<00:02:43.070> box

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
they tried again that the directors box

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.430 
they tried again that the directors box
and<00:02:43.489> stuff<00:02:43.670> like<00:02:43.940> that<00:02:44.120> and<00:02:44.750> I<00:02:44.870> think<00:02:44.930> up<00:02:45.290> until

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
and stuff like that and I think up until

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.110 
and stuff like that and I think up until
December<00:02:45.739> I<00:02:46.130> think<00:02:46.340> we<00:02:46.459> were<00:02:46.610> sort<00:02:46.820> of<00:02:46.850> halfway

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
December I think we were sort of halfway

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.120 
December I think we were sort of halfway
up<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.510> league<00:02:47.690> we<00:02:47.870> just<00:02:48.110> we<00:02:48.470> just<00:02:48.500> beaten

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
up the league we just we just beaten

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.600 
up the league we just we just beaten
Liverpool<00:02:49.870> drawn<00:02:50.870> with<00:02:51.110> Arsenal<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:51.920> I<00:02:52.370> think

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
Liverpool drawn with Arsenal and I think

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.970 
Liverpool drawn with Arsenal and I think
we<00:02:52.730> beat<00:02:53.239> Man<00:02:53.480> United's<00:02:53.989> oh<00:02:54.140> so<00:02:54.410> we<00:02:54.560> were<00:02:54.709> off

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
we beat Man United's oh so we were off

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.620 
we beat Man United's oh so we were off
what<00:02:55.220> league<00:02:55.549> we<00:02:55.700> were<00:02:55.820> going<00:02:56.060> really<00:02:56.269> quiet

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
what league we were going really quiet

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.530 
what league we were going really quiet
you<00:02:56.989> know<00:02:57.140> okay<00:02:57.470> and<00:02:58.130> then<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:59.650> club<00:03:01.390> put<00:03:02.390> out

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
you know okay and then the club put out

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.150 
you know okay and then the club put out
that<00:03:02.720> there<00:03:02.870> was<00:03:02.959> going<00:03:03.110> to<00:03:03.170> be<00:03:03.260> a<00:03:03.380> bond<00:03:03.829> scheme

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
that there was going to be a bond scheme

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.910 
that there was going to be a bond scheme
and<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.940> fans<00:03:05.390> were<00:03:05.690> dead<00:03:05.930> against<00:03:06.590> it<00:03:06.709> and

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
and the fans were dead against it and

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.199 
and the fans were dead against it and
there<00:03:07.010> was<00:03:07.130> all<00:03:07.220> kinds<00:03:07.579> of<00:03:07.670> problems<00:03:07.880> over

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
there was all kinds of problems over

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.690 
there was all kinds of problems over
there<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:09.769> players<00:03:10.040> were<00:03:10.280> sort<00:03:10.489> of<00:03:10.549> in

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
there and the players were sort of in

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.460 
there and the players were sort of in
the<00:03:10.820> end<00:03:11.000> I<00:03:11.209> think<00:03:11.480> they<00:03:11.900> had<00:03:12.019> no<00:03:12.200> confidence

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
the end I think they had no confidence

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.380 
the end I think they had no confidence
going<00:03:12.950> out<00:03:13.190> there<00:03:13.340> dumb<00:03:13.489> people<00:03:13.610> want<00:03:13.880> to<00:03:13.970> know

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390

their game until the end of the season

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.729 
their game until the end of the season
