 and now let's make a cheesecake 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.469

 let's mix all the ingredients 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.920
 in a container and then beat the 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:34.759
 first let's go with the cream cheese 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.759
 we add it 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.930
 then the eggs 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:53.070
 that no piece of shell falls 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.070
 inside the container 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.500
 OK 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:14.260
 good are 4 eggs and 200 grams of the 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.920
 cream cheese 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:20.050
 then we throw out the natural yogurt 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.030
 that the container of yogurt will serve us 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.030
 of measurement for the following 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:32.030
 where we cast everything then we throw 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:34.640
 a cream yogurt 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.479
 that is the measure 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.479
 with yogurt 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.670
 then a whole milk yogurt 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.729
 one yogurt and half sugar 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.619
 one 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.030
 and a half 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.230
 and finally 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:17.330
 to finish with the yogurt 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.330
 a flour yogurt 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.500
 all 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:30.810
 the word 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.810
 more or less and finally the yeast 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.000
 now we beat 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.610
 do you have 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.300
 we leave until it is homogeneous 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.520
 Well, this would be as you see 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.790
 it is very loose everything homogeneous already without 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:21.819
 lumps without any group and now what 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.819
 we do is pour in a mold 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.609
 we pour it 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.220
 yes 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.940
 and this goes to the oven at 170 degrees 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.569
 previously preheated for 45 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.569
 minutes 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.049
 It's been 40 minutes in the oven 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.360
 I 'm going to teach you a trick to know 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:57.690
 when is the afternoon 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:04:00.510
 the punctured with a knife 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:04.860
 and if the knife does not come out dry it's that 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.990
 is and if you can not, it's not 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.850
 It is already almost dry but still leaves 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.780
 a wet pelt so we 're going to leave it 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.720
 about 5 more minutes and we took it out 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.990
 the cake is already so we turn off the 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.990
 oven 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:24.580
 we take it out and let it cool 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:27.389
 to unmold the 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.120
 and others 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:32.009
 we have dismantled the cake and now we are going 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.300
 to serve a ration for it we are going to 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:35.300
 decorate it with icing sugar 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.770
 and with a strawberry syrup 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.330
 and it is already 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:00.330
