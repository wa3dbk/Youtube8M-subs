here's a few factors that could be one

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.490 
here's a few factors that could be one
you<00:00:50.399> could<00:00:50.579> be<00:00:50.730> not<00:00:50.969> eating<00:00:51.390> soon<00:00:51.960> enough<00:00:52.199> to

enough calories for the day I could be

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.080

could be that you're not getting enough
sleep<00:01:04.909> it<00:01:05.909> could<00:01:06.119> be<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.540> many<00:01:06.810> factors<00:01:07.350> so

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
sleep it could be so many factors so

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.170 
sleep it could be so many factors so
really<00:01:08.070> take<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.280> look<00:01:08.490> at<00:01:08.640> your<00:01:08.729> nutrition

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
because that's going to be what's going

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.039 
because that's going to be what's going
to<00:01:11.189> give<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.430> more<00:01:11.580> energy<00:01:11.930> if<00:01:12.930> your

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049

to give you more energy if your
carbohydrates<00:01:13.650> are<00:01:13.770> low<00:01:13.950> then<00:01:14.400> obviously

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
carbohydrates are low then obviously

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.420 
carbohydrates are low then obviously
that<00:01:15.540> will<00:01:15.720> affect<00:01:16.049> your<00:01:16.350> total<00:01:17.100> energy

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
that will affect your total energy

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.380 
that will affect your total energy
output<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.820> as<00:01:18.689> well<00:01:19.020> as<00:01:19.170> your<00:01:19.380> strength<00:01:19.680> I

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
but I would take a look at those things

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.670

I<00:02:36.989> would<00:02:37.920> recommend<00:02:38.220> because<00:02:38.760> legs<00:02:39.330> are<00:02:39.480> such

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
particular and then just really focus on

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.180 
particular and then just really focus on
the<00:03:06.420> mind<00:03:06.630> muscle<00:03:06.840> connection<00:03:07.380> go<00:03:07.739> slow<00:03:08.069> and

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
the mind muscle connection go slow and

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.039 
the mind muscle connection go slow and
controlled<00:03:08.310> get<00:03:08.970> full<00:03:09.330> ranges<00:03:09.750> of<00:03:09.900> motion

not going low enough you're not really

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.410 
not going low enough you're not really
getting<00:03:14.099> the<00:03:14.340> full<00:03:14.489> benefit<00:03:14.849> of<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.000> exercise

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.670 
last question i have is I've been taking
the<00:06:07.790> same<00:06:08.030> pre-workout<00:06:08.720> for<00:06:09.140> a<00:06:09.170> few<00:06:09.530> months

now and at first it works great but
lately<00:06:12.020> it<00:06:12.410> seems<00:06:13.010> like<00:06:13.220> it<00:06:13.370> hasn't<00:06:13.580> been

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:42.770 
to it so you want to cycle it I would do

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.340 
to it so you want to cycle it I would do
it<00:06:42.800> for<00:06:43.220> 8<00:06:43.669> to<00:06:43.729> 10<00:06:44.240> weeks<00:06:44.270> at<00:06:44.690> a<00:06:44.720> time<00:06:44.780> and<00:06:45.259> then

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:45.350 
it for 8 to 10 weeks at a time and then

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.189 
it for 8 to 10 weeks at a time and then
stopped<00:06:45.979> for<00:06:46.699> about<00:06:46.729> two<00:06:47.210> months<00:06:47.360> and<00:06:47.660> then<00:06:47.930> go

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:48.199 
stopped for about two months and then go

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:51.480 
stopped for about two months and then go
back<00:06:48.229> on<00:06:48.590> again<00:06:48.860> that<00:06:49.550> way<00:06:49.669> you're<00:06:50.350> constantly

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
back on again that way you're constantly

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.610 
back on again that way you're constantly
allowing<00:06:52.490> your<00:06:52.639> body<00:06:52.669> to<00:06:53.110> not<00:06:54.110> get<00:06:54.320> used<00:06:54.500> to

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:54.620 
allowing your body to not get used to

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.290 
allowing your body to not get used to
the<00:06:54.680> same<00:06:54.830> thing<00:06:54.889> over<00:06:55.160> a<00:06:55.340> long<00:06:55.729> duration<00:06:55.970> time

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:56.300 
the same thing over a long duration time

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.450 
the same thing over a long duration time
so<00:06:56.720> that's<00:06:56.900> why<00:06:57.139> your<00:06:57.710> body<00:06:57.919> is<00:06:58.070> just<00:06:58.280> getting

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:58.460 
so that's why your body is just getting

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.760 
so that's why your body is just getting
used<00:06:58.610> to<00:06:58.789> it<00:06:58.880> so<00:06:59.389> take<00:06:59.600> a<00:06:59.630> break<00:06:59.900> from<00:07:00.050> it<00:07:00.229> a<00:07:00.410> few

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:00.770 
used to it so take a break from it a few

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:06.909 
used to it so take a break from it a few
months<00:07:00.919> is<00:07:01.250> a<00:07:02.120> long<00:07:02.229> enough<00:07:03.229> time<00:07:03.789> to<00:07:05.889> you<00:07:06.889> know

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:06.919 
months is a long enough time to you know

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:09.850 
months is a long enough time to you know
before<00:07:07.729> taking<00:07:08.479> a<00:07:08.780> little<00:07:09.320> bit<00:07:09.470> of<00:07:09.530> a<00:07:09.650> break

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:09.860 
before taking a little bit of a break

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.800 
before taking a little bit of a break
and<00:07:10.100> then<00:07:10.400> maybe<00:07:10.729> going<00:07:11.000> on<00:07:11.210> it<00:07:11.360> again<00:07:11.479> at<00:07:11.720> the

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:11.810
