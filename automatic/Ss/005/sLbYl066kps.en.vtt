00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:30.260

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:33.600
 the desert and met a big turtle 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:38.120
 the turtle lay in the sun and purred 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.120
 himself a merry song 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.430
 what a nice song 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.010
 I give you a lie and he came closer 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.440
 and the turtle purred under his breath not 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:25.500
 noticing a lion cub because her eyes 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:29.090
 were closed from the pleasure of noosa hatch 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:37.590
 hatch hatch and case 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:40.890

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.460
 sand next to the turtle and lifted one 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.610
 an ear 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.610

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.170
 I'm lying on the lion cub 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.860

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:26.280
