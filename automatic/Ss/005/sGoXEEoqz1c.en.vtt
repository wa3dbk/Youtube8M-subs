00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
so we had to really work with them about

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.509 
so we had to really work with them about
how<00:03:30.030> we<00:03:30.239> could<00:03:30.750> get<00:03:31.319> the<00:03:31.470> supply<00:03:31.799> of<00:03:32.040> meat<00:03:32.220> that

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
we needed without putting too much

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.979 
we needed without putting too much
pressure<00:03:34.380> on<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.799> farmers<00:03:35.310> I<00:03:35.720> think<00:03:36.720> having

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
pressure on the farmers I think having

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.830 
pressure on the farmers I think having
eaten<00:03:37.200> pies<00:03:37.440> now<00:03:37.680> all<00:03:37.829> over<00:03:38.069> the<00:03:38.160> world<00:03:38.310> that

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
they're pastry tends to be really light

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.729 
they're pastry tends to be really light
and<00:03:44.099> flaky<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:44.730> buttery<00:03:45.440> that's<00:03:46.440> kind<00:03:46.709> of

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
and flaky and buttery that's kind of

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.530 
and flaky and buttery that's kind of
what<00:03:46.889> makes<00:03:47.040> an<00:03:47.220> Australian<00:03:47.849> Pie<00:03:48.030> unique<00:03:48.389> I

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
what makes an Australian Pie unique I

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.409 
what makes an Australian Pie unique I
think<00:03:48.569> the<00:03:48.870> pastry<00:03:49.319> is<00:03:49.470> super<00:03:49.950> delicious<00:03:50.419> the

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
think the pastry is super delicious the

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.770 
think the pastry is super delicious the
crust<00:03:52.049> should<00:03:52.680> be<00:03:52.859> flaky<00:03:53.609> but<00:03:53.849> also<00:03:54.060> tender

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
crust should be flaky but also tender

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.409 
crust should be flaky but also tender
and<00:03:55.049> that's<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.799> really<00:03:56.010> tough<00:03:56.579> balance<00:03:57.150> to

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
and that's a really tough balance to

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.630 
and that's a really tough balance to
strike<00:03:57.750> because<00:03:58.079> you<00:03:58.769> can<00:03:58.920> have<00:03:59.099> one<00:03:59.370> and<00:03:59.549> not

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
strike because you can have one and not

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.120 
strike because you can have one and not

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.880 
stuff so it was a big learning curve and
we're<00:04:25.180> still<00:04:25.480> learning<00:04:25.720> because<00:04:26.380> what<00:04:26.770> we

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
we're still learning because what we

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.310 
we're still learning because what we
found<00:04:27.130> is<00:04:27.550> that<00:04:27.580> our<00:04:28.000> main<00:04:28.450> ingredients<00:04:29.140> being

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
found is that our main ingredients being

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.430 
found is that our main ingredients being
butter<00:04:29.620> and<00:04:29.890> flour<00:04:30.960> changed<00:04:31.960> throughout<00:04:32.260> the

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
butter and flour changed throughout the

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.680 
butter and flour changed throughout the
year<00:04:32.680> which<00:04:32.950> makes<00:04:33.190> sense<00:04:33.430> right<00:04:33.700> so<00:04:34.150> the<00:04:34.360> cows

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
year which makes sense right so the cows

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.960 
year which makes sense right so the cows
are<00:04:34.990> eating<00:04:35.290> different<00:04:35.980> things<00:04:36.190> on<00:04:36.460> pasture

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
are eating different things on pasture

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.640 
are eating different things on pasture
which<00:04:37.150> then<00:04:37.360> translates<00:04:37.900> a<00:04:38.020> different<00:04:38.320> kind

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
which then translates a different kind

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.060 
which then translates a different kind
of<00:04:38.770> milk<00:04:39.190> and<00:04:39.520> different<00:04:40.120> kinds<00:04:40.360> of<00:04:40.450> butter

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
of milk and different kinds of butter

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.320 
of milk and different kinds of butter
sourcing<00:04:42.070> from<00:04:42.340> farmers<00:04:42.760> definitely

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
sourcing from farmers definitely

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.450 
sourcing from farmers definitely
complicates<00:04:43.930> things<00:04:44.080> as<00:04:44.830> a<00:04:44.860> business<00:04:45.280> owner

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
complicates things as a business owner

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.030 
complicates things as a business owner
and<00:04:45.910> I<00:04:46.390> mean<00:04:46.840> there's<00:04:46.990> definitely<00:04:47.110> times<00:04:47.680> when

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
and I mean there's definitely times when

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.460 
and I mean there's definitely times when
I<00:04:48.250> can<00:04:48.430> see<00:04:48.700> why<00:04:49.000> a<00:04:49.030> lot<00:04:49.330> of<00:04:49.510> restaurants<00:04:49.990> just

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
I can see why a lot of restaurants just

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.990 
I can see why a lot of restaurants just
place<00:04:50.920> that<00:04:51.220> one<00:04:51.430> call<00:04:51.730> to<00:04:52.180> a<00:04:53.040> big<00:04:54.040> food<00:04:54.520> supply
