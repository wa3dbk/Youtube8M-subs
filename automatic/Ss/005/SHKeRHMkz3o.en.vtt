like about rome total war i will say
this<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.690> original<00:03:13.780> one<00:03:14.230> had<00:03:14.500> a<00:03:14.530> very<00:03:14.799> unique

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
this the original one had a very unique

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.400 
this the original one had a very unique
sort<00:03:15.519> of<00:03:15.610> system<00:03:15.790> where<00:03:16.120> you<00:03:16.239> had<00:03:16.420> client's

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
sort of system where you had client's

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.319 
sort of system where you had client's
inside<00:03:18.010> Rome<00:03:18.340> I<00:03:18.549> mean<00:03:18.700> you<00:03:18.790> had<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.060> three

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
inside Rome I mean you had the three

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.030 
inside Rome I mean you had the three
families<00:03:19.840> that<00:03:19.989> was<00:03:20.109> definitely<00:03:20.290> very<00:03:20.620> unique

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
families that was definitely very unique

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.640 
families that was definitely very unique
I<00:03:22.030> don't<00:03:22.480> think<00:03:22.720> it<00:03:22.810> was<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:23.019> best<00:03:23.140> version<00:03:23.590> of

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
I don't think it was the best version of

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.470 
I don't think it was the best version of
the<00:03:23.739> game<00:03:23.890> i<00:03:23.950> think<00:03:24.100> rome<00:03:24.459> total<00:03:24.700> realism<00:03:25.060> was

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
the game i think rome total realism was

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.530 
the game i think rome total realism was
probably<00:03:25.959> far<00:03:26.290> better<00:03:27.390> but<00:03:28.390> it<00:03:28.450> was

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
probably far better but it was

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.930 
probably far better but it was
definitely<00:03:28.720> a<00:03:28.930> nice<00:03:29.079> little<00:03:29.290> twist<00:03:29.700> it<00:03:30.700> made

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
definitely a nice little twist it made

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.150 
definitely a nice little twist it made
the<00:03:31.120> Roman<00:03:31.480> families<00:03:31.900> way<00:03:32.079> too<00:03:32.160> overpowered

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
the Roman families way too overpowered

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.860 
the Roman families way too overpowered
but<00:03:33.370> it<00:03:33.489> certainly<00:03:33.700> was<00:03:34.030> nice<00:03:34.239> because<00:03:34.510> a<00:03:34.600> kind

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
but it certainly was nice because a kind

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.569 
but it certainly was nice because a kind
of<00:03:34.930> interrupt<00:03:35.320> introduced<00:03:36.130> you<00:03:36.340> to<00:03:36.489> the

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
of interrupt introduced you to the

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.720 
of interrupt introduced you to the
interior<00:03:36.970> interior<00:03:37.380> fighting<00:03:38.380> going<00:03:38.650> on<00:03:38.920> at

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
interior interior fighting going on at

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.520 
interior interior fighting going on at
the<00:03:39.820> time<00:03:40.150> of<00:03:40.299> the<00:03:40.359> game<00:03:40.540> between<00:03:40.870> different

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
the time of the game between different

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.140 
the time of the game between different
factions<00:03:41.739> and<00:03:42.250> how<00:03:42.340> that<00:03:42.400> really<00:03:42.760> led<00:03:42.940> to<00:03:43.120> a

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
factions and how that really led to a

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.630 
factions and how that really led to a
long-term<00:03:43.480> Civil<00:03:44.200> War<00:03:44.410> once<00:03:44.799> the<00:03:45.040> external

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
long-term Civil War once the external

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.370 
long-term Civil War once the external
threats<00:03:45.970> were<00:03:46.150> dealt<00:03:46.390> with<00:03:46.600> I<00:03:46.870> think<00:03:47.230> it

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
threats were dealt with I think it

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.520 
threats were dealt with I think it
certainly<00:03:47.590> could<00:03:47.950> have<00:03:48.040> been<00:03:48.160> done<00:03:48.910> better

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
certainly could have been done better

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.009 
certainly could have been done better
and<00:03:50.820> hopefully<00:03:51.820> they're<00:03:52.239> gonna<00:03:52.329> address<00:03:52.690> that

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
and hopefully they're gonna address that

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.930 
and hopefully they're gonna address that
here<00:03:53.290> in<00:03:53.549> rome<00:03:54.549> total<00:03:54.760> war<00:03:54.910> two<00:03:56.069> but<00:03:57.069> really<00:03:57.519> I

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
here in rome total war two but really I

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.580 
here in rome total war two but really I
gotta<00:03:58.330> say<00:03:58.540> I'm<00:03:58.599> pretty<00:03:58.690> disappointed<00:03:59.019> with

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
gotta say I'm pretty disappointed with

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.290 
gotta say I'm pretty disappointed with
the<00:03:59.680> preview<00:04:00.099> all<00:04:00.220> they<00:04:00.370> really<00:04:00.489> did<00:04:00.819> was<00:04:01.030> pay

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
the preview all they really did was pay

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.390 
the preview all they really did was pay
a<00:04:01.330> couple<00:04:01.659> of<00:04:01.900> actors<00:04:02.290> too<00:04:02.590> much<00:04:02.800> money<00:04:03.129> and

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
a couple of actors too much money and

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.690 
a couple of actors too much money and
have<00:04:04.090> a<00:04:04.120> couple<00:04:04.540> of<00:04:04.720> stock<00:04:05.080> I<00:04:05.580> don't<00:04:06.580> know

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
have a couple of stock I don't know

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.690 
have a couple of stock I don't know
staged<00:04:07.739> scenarios<00:04:08.739> and<00:04:08.950> it<00:04:09.040> didn't<00:04:09.519> tell<00:04:09.670> us

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
staged scenarios and it didn't tell us

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.430 
staged scenarios and it didn't tell us
anything<00:04:09.879> about<00:04:10.209> the<00:04:10.330> game<00:04:10.569> I<00:04:10.840> mean<00:04:11.290> it's

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
anything about the game I mean it's

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.080 
anything about the game I mean it's
definitely<00:04:11.590> a<00:04:11.860> hype<00:04:12.099> trailer<00:04:12.580> to<00:04:12.730> say<00:04:12.879> it's

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
definitely a hype trailer to say it's

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.300 
definitely a hype trailer to say it's
back<00:04:13.330> but<00:04:13.750> they<00:04:14.500> could<00:04:14.769> have<00:04:14.890> at<00:04:14.980> least<00:04:15.010> had

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
back but they could have at least had

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.580 
back but they could have at least had
some<00:04:15.370> rendered<00:04:15.940> images<00:04:16.450> or<00:04:16.690> something<00:04:17.200> maybe

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
some rendered images or something maybe

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.920 
some rendered images or something maybe
not<00:04:17.799> even<00:04:17.830> you<00:04:18.190> know<00:04:18.220> just<00:04:18.519> some<00:04:19.510> kind<00:04:19.750> of

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
not even you know just some kind of

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.730 
not even you know just some kind of
something<00:04:20.859> to<00:04:21.039> tell<00:04:21.250> us<00:04:21.280> it's<00:04:21.519> a<00:04:21.609> video<00:04:21.940> game<00:04:22.270> I

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
something to tell us it's a video game I

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.930 
something to tell us it's a video game I
mean<00:04:23.740> if<00:04:23.919> I<00:04:24.070> didn't<00:04:24.340> know<00:04:24.370> any<00:04:24.460> better<00:04:24.669> I<00:04:24.849> would

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
mean if I didn't know any better I would

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.050 
mean if I didn't know any better I would
have<00:04:25.120> thought<00:04:25.240> it<00:04:25.390> was<00:04:25.479> a<00:04:25.510> movie

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.460 

gotta<00:04:30.060> say<00:04:30.270> this<00:04:30.420> pretty<00:04:30.750> disappointing<00:04:31.350> I

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
gotta say this pretty disappointing I

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.050 
gotta say this pretty disappointing I
mean<00:04:31.620> like<00:04:31.950> I<00:04:32.010> said<00:04:32.160> I<00:04:32.550> know<00:04:32.670> they're<00:04:33.030> just

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
mean like I said I know they're just

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.870 
mean like I said I know they're just
trying<00:04:33.450> to<00:04:33.510> build<00:04:33.750> hype<00:04:34.020> I<00:04:34.460> know<00:04:35.460> the<00:04:35.700> game

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
trying to build hype I know the game

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.280 
trying to build hype I know the game
isn't<00:04:36.090> done<00:04:36.420> yet<00:04:36.450> but<00:04:36.840> you<00:04:36.960> could<00:04:37.140> at<00:04:37.170> least

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
isn't done yet but you could at least

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.860 
isn't done yet but you could at least
show<00:04:37.530> us<00:04:37.740> something<00:04:38.250> or<00:04:39.240> at<00:04:39.300> least<00:04:39.360> tell<00:04:39.840> us

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
something about what's going to be

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.670 
something about what's going to be
included<00:04:42.210> in<00:04:42.540> here<00:04:42.720> rather<00:04:42.900> than<00:04:43.020> basically

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
included in here rather than basically

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.680 
included in here rather than basically
just<00:04:43.890> say<00:04:44.130> there's<00:04:44.640> going<00:04:45.000> to<00:04:45.120> be<00:04:45.150> intrigued

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
just say there's going to be intrigued

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.210 
just say there's going to be intrigued
because<00:04:45.990> really<00:04:46.320> that's<00:04:46.500> all<00:04:46.710> this<00:04:46.890> preview

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
because really that's all this preview

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.350 
because really that's all this preview
told<00:04:47.490> us<00:04:47.640> is<00:04:47.790> that<00:04:47.820> there's<00:04:48.090> going<00:04:48.240> to<00:04:48.330> be

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
told us is that there's going to be

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.390 
told us is that there's going to be
intrigued<00:04:48.780> that<00:04:48.960> it's<00:04:49.500> Rome<00:04:49.800> and<00:04:50.100> that<00:04:50.250> its

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
intrigued that it's Rome and that its

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.660 
intrigued that it's Rome and that its
total<00:04:50.760> war<00:04:53.450> but<00:04:55.010> anyway<00:04:56.010> I<00:04:56.040> guess<00:04:56.280> that's<00:04:56.520> a

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
total war but anyway I guess that's a

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.840 
total war but anyway I guess that's a
that's<00:04:57.600> this<00:04:58.020> it<00:04:58.440> pretty<00:04:59.190> disappointing

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
that's this it pretty disappointing

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.300 
that's this it pretty disappointing
