00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
alright is 20 I just made a mistake I

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.270 
alright is 20 I just made a mistake I
went<00:00:48.750> too<00:00:48.930> far<00:00:49.170> out<00:00:49.410> there<00:00:49.590> guys<00:00:49.829> try<00:00:50.129> and

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
went too far out there guys try and

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.580 
went too far out there guys try and
always<00:00:50.340> cut<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.360> corner<00:00:51.780> as<00:00:51.960> little<00:00:52.469> as<00:00:52.559> you

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
always cut the corner as little as you

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.180 
always cut the corner as little as you
possibly<00:00:53.010> can<00:00:53.360> because<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.770> makes<00:00:55.770> yourself<00:00:56.070> a

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
possibly can because it makes yourself a

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.709 
possibly can because it makes yourself a
smaller<00:00:56.550> target<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.149> possibly<00:00:57.270> care<00:00:57.690> less

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
smaller target is you possibly care less

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.139 
smaller target is you possibly care less
likely<00:00:58.530> for<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.859> get<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.190> die<00:00:59.340> all<00:00:59.969> right

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
likely for you to get to die all right

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.549 
likely for you to get to die all right
let's<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:00.600> blank<00:01:01.050> round<00:01:01.260> oh<00:01:03.140> ok<00:01:04.140> I'm<00:01:04.530> not

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
let's just blank round oh ok I'm not

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.870 
let's just blank round oh ok I'm not
going<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:05.010> like<00:01:05.159> that's<00:01:05.369> writing<00:01:05.670> their

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
going that like that's writing their

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.520 
going that like that's writing their
spawn<00:01:06.180> it'll<00:01:06.510> probably<00:01:06.689> end<00:01:06.840> up<00:01:06.990> with<00:01:07.140> me<00:01:07.260> dead

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
spawn it'll probably end up with me dead

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.230 
spawn it'll probably end up with me dead
so<00:01:08.040> I'm<00:01:08.100> going<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.280> pull<00:01:08.490> back<00:01:08.670> slightly<00:01:08.880> to
