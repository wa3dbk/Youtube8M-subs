hey<00:00:12.780> there<00:00:12.990> at<00:00:13.320> 5k<00:00:13.710> here<00:00:14.219> I<00:00:14.400> figured<00:00:14.820> since<00:00:14.880> I'm

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
hey there at 5k here I figured since I'm

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.550 
hey there at 5k here I figured since I'm
down<00:00:15.389> for<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.660> little<00:00:15.750> while<00:00:15.929> with<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.230> hernia

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
down for a little while with a hernia

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.560 
down for a little while with a hernia
I'd<00:00:16.980> build<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.400> couple<00:00:17.730> planes<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.330> I<00:00:18.359> wanted

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
I'd build a couple planes and I wanted

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.450 
I'd build a couple planes and I wanted
to<00:00:18.720> show<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.470> what<00:00:19.710> i'm<00:00:19.800> doing<00:00:20.130> today<00:00:20.310> for

they're<00:00:22.230> interested<00:00:22.680> in<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.980> plane<00:00:23.640> stuff<00:00:24.180> i

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
they're interested in the plane stuff i

what i'm working on here see this is a

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.410 
what i'm working on here see this is a
tiny<00:00:28.949> little<00:00:29.160> plane<00:00:29.519> smaller<00:00:30.029> than<00:00:30.179> i<00:00:30.240> usually

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
tiny little plane smaller than i usually

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.900 
tiny little plane smaller than i usually
work<00:00:30.660> with<00:00:30.869> it's<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.500> tiny<00:00:31.949> plane<00:00:32.309> modeled

Centurion<00:00:36.270> just<00:00:37.050> going<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.230> walk<00:00:37.380> through<00:00:37.410> the

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
Centurion just going to walk through the

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.040 
Centurion just going to walk through the
design<00:00:38.010> approach<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:38.940> took<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.660> the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
design approach that I took and the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.470 
design approach that I took and the
materials<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.620> used<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.460> little<00:00:42.210> bits<00:00:42.390> about

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
materials I used and little bits about

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.479 
materials I used and little bits about
the<00:00:42.690> plane<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.530> guys<00:00:43.649> want<00:00:43.950> more<00:00:44.070> detail

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
the plane and you guys want more detail

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.250 
the plane and you guys want more detail
I<00:00:44.520> can<00:00:44.820> go<00:00:44.910> into<00:00:45.059> more<00:00:45.270> detail<00:00:45.600> later<00:00:45.629> but<00:00:45.899> I'm

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
I can go into more detail later but I'm

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.170 
I can go into more detail later but I'm
going<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.440> just<00:00:46.590> try<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.800> give<00:00:47.010> up<00:00:47.190> an<00:00:47.730> overview

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
going to just try to give up an overview

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.380 
going to just try to give up an overview
of<00:00:48.239> everything<00:00:48.420> pretty<00:00:50.000> high<00:00:51.000> level<00:00:51.030> overview

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
of everything pretty high level overview

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.200 
of everything pretty high level overview
here<00:00:53.719> design<00:00:54.719> approach<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:56.219> my<00:00:56.850> design

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
here design approach so my design

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.180 
here design approach so my design
approach<00:00:57.539> was<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.590> was<00:00:58.800> going<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.949> copy

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
approach was that I was going to copy

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.189 
approach was that I was going to copy
the<00:00:59.430> wings<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.879> tail<00:01:00.090> from<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.570> internet<00:01:00.960> I

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
the wings and tail from the internet I

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.740 
the wings and tail from the internet I
just<00:01:01.469> went<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.829> images<00:01:02.309> google<00:01:02.820> com<00:01:03.390> and

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
just went to images google com and

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.590 
just went to images google com and
looked<00:01:04.530> for<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.830> Cessna<00:01:05.400> I'm<00:01:05.610> Julia<00:01:06.000> because<00:01:06.510> I

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
looked for a Cessna I'm Julia because I

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.330 
looked for a Cessna I'm Julia because I
figured<00:01:06.900> I'd<00:01:07.020> copy<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.500> Cessna<00:01:07.860> wings<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.250> you

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
figured I'd copy the Cessna wings so you

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.640 
figured I'd copy the Cessna wings so you
can<00:01:08.490> see<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.750> diagram<00:01:09.750> came<00:01:10.140> up<00:01:10.320> their<00:01:10.530> own

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
can see that diagram came up their own

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.800 
can see that diagram came up their own
images<00:01:11.070> google<00:01:11.460> com<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.240> i<00:01:12.270> just<00:01:12.450> saved<00:01:12.720> that

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
images google com so i just saved that

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.770 
images google com so i just saved that
to<00:01:13.049> my<00:01:13.200> machine<00:01:13.590> i<00:01:13.820> inflated<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.060> wing<00:01:15.270> and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
to my machine i inflated the wing and

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.679 
to my machine i inflated the wing and
isolated<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.740> wing<00:01:16.920> like<00:01:17.250> that<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.880> then<00:01:18.509> I

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
isolated the wing like that and then I

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.230 
isolated the wing like that and then I
took<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.110> tail<00:01:19.580> isolated<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.759> on<00:01:21.000> another

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
took the tail isolated that on another

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.109 
took the tail isolated that on another
image<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.320> then<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:23.130> horizontal<00:01:23.850> part<00:01:24.060> of

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
image and then the horizontal part of

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.330 
image and then the horizontal part of
the<00:01:24.180> tail<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.420> right<00:01:25.110> there<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.619> one<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.040> I

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
the tail is right there on that one so I

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.910 
the tail is right there on that one so I
took<00:01:26.610> those<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.479> then<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:27.750> moved<00:01:28.320> them<00:01:28.439> up<00:01:28.619> to

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
took those and then I moved them up to

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.249 
took those and then I moved them up to
fit<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.490> size<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:30.119> wanted<00:01:30.570> I've<00:01:30.930> made<00:01:31.140> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
fit the size I wanted I've made the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.530 
fit the size I wanted I've made the
wings<00:01:31.439> about<00:01:31.680> nine<00:01:31.920> inches<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.610> kept<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
wings about nine inches and kept the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.660 
wings about nine inches and kept the
other<00:01:33.689> parts<00:01:34.439> of<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.619> proportional<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.549> other

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
other parts of it proportional the other

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.420 
other parts of it proportional the other
two<00:01:35.939> points<00:01:36.720> about<00:01:36.930> my<00:01:37.140> design<00:01:37.470> approach<00:01:37.890> was

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
two points about my design approach was

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.940 
two points about my design approach was
I<00:01:38.610> want<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.509> keep<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.780> weight<00:01:39.930> down<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.680> I

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
I want to keep the weight down and I

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.340 
I want to keep the weight down and I
want<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.189> balance<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.119> center<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.720> gravity

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
want to balance it to center of gravity

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.380 
want to balance it to center of gravity
one-third<00:01:44.100> back<00:01:44.340> on<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.610> main<00:01:44.790> wing<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.270> of

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
one-third back on the main wing and of

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.609 
one-third back on the main wing and of
course<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.899> know<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.049> got<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.380> do<00:01:46.470> that

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
course you know you got to do that

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.929 
course you know you got to do that
otherwise<00:01:46.799> you're<00:01:47.070> playing<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.520> either<00:01:47.820> not

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
otherwise you're playing is either not

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.789 
otherwise you're playing is either not
going<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.270> fly<00:01:48.450> are<00:01:48.689> going<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.869> be<00:01:48.990> definitely

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
going to fly are going to be definitely

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.399 
going to fly are going to be definitely
bad<00:01:50.009> for<00:01:50.670> flying<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.329> we'll<00:01:51.990> talk<00:01:52.170> about<00:01:52.290> that

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
bad for flying so we'll talk about that

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.210 
bad for flying so we'll talk about that
more<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.770> minute

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.980 

materials<00:01:56.220> so<00:01:56.880> what<00:01:57.030> materials<00:01:57.510> did<00:01:57.660> I<00:01:57.750> use

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
materials so what materials did I use

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.940 
materials so what materials did I use
take<00:01:58.470> a<00:01:58.500> look<00:01:58.650> here<00:01:58.710> I<00:02:00.380> previously<00:02:01.380> had<00:02:01.620> gotten

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
take a look here I previously had gotten

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.700 
take a look here I previously had gotten
some<00:02:02.160> samples<00:02:02.640> from<00:02:02.850> our<00:02:03.060> sea<00:02:03.330> foam<00:02:03.600> calm<00:02:04.350> and

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
some samples from our sea foam calm and

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.850 
some samples from our sea foam calm and
i'll<00:02:04.890> put<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.130> link<00:02:05.420> RC<00:02:06.420> bomb.com<00:02:07.320> i'll<00:02:07.680> show

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
i'll put a link RC bomb.com i'll show

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.200 
i'll put a link RC bomb.com i'll show
you<00:02:07.950> some<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.340> stuff<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.700> got<00:02:08.880> from<00:02:09.030> them

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
you some of the stuff I got from them

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.750 
you some of the stuff I got from them
you<00:02:09.360> can<00:02:09.540> order<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.320> box<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:11.040> samples<00:02:11.520> and

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
you can order a box of samples and

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.640 
you can order a box of samples and
they'll<00:02:12.270> label<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.750> for<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:13.020> if<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.260> ask<00:02:13.410> them

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
they'll label it for you if you ask them

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.260 
they'll label it for you if you ask them
they<00:02:13.800> did<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.160> for<00:02:14.190> me<00:02:14.490> I've<00:02:14.730> got<00:02:15.090> that

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
they did that for me I've got that

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.880 
they did that for me I've got that
several<00:02:15.690> months<00:02:15.870> ago<00:02:16.080> so<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:16.380> can<00:02:16.530> see<00:02:16.650> I<00:02:16.680> got

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
several months ago so you can see I got

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.500 
several months ago so you can see I got
a<00:02:16.920> sheet<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.220> three<00:02:17.490> millimeter<00:02:17.700> depth<00:02:18.270> Ron

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
a sheet a three millimeter depth Ron

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.370 
a sheet a three millimeter depth Ron
White<00:02:19.250> pretty<00:02:20.250> good<00:02:20.430> stuff<00:02:21.080> relatively<00:02:22.080> stiff

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
White pretty good stuff relatively stiff

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.680 
White pretty good stuff relatively stiff
I<00:02:22.620> also<00:02:22.950> have<00:02:23.610> some<00:02:24.030> two<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.570> half

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
I also have some two and a half

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.230 
I also have some two and a half
millimeter<00:02:25.140> RCF<00:02:25.890> foam<00:02:26.430> just<00:02:26.760> about<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.090> same

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
millimeter RCF foam just about the same

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.080 
millimeter RCF foam just about the same
size<00:02:27.540> slightly<00:02:28.230> thinner<00:02:28.590> but<00:02:29.370> much<00:02:29.880> more

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
size slightly thinner but much more

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.050 
size slightly thinner but much more
stiff<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:31.050> very<00:02:31.290> much<00:02:31.490> stronger<00:02:32.490> and<00:02:32.790> this<00:02:32.910> is

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
stiff so very much stronger and this is

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.640 
stiff so very much stronger and this is
actually<00:02:33.180> what<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.450> wanted<00:02:33.600> to<00:02:33.780> be<00:02:33.840> using<00:02:34.020> to

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
actually what I wanted to be using to

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.570 
actually what I wanted to be using to
make<00:02:34.770> this<00:02:35.010> plane<00:02:35.690> so<00:02:36.690> that's<00:02:36.930> good<00:02:37.170> stuff

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
make this plane so that's good stuff

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.100 
make this plane so that's good stuff
I'll<00:02:38.580> do<00:02:38.910> another<00:02:39.060> video<00:02:39.510> one<00:02:39.960> of<00:02:40.020> the

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
I'll do another video one of the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.070 
I'll do another video one of the
different<00:02:40.500> types<00:02:40.770> of<00:02:41.070> phone<00:02:41.640> later<00:02:42.360> getting

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
different types of phone later getting

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.930 
different types of phone later getting
one<00:02:43.200> of<00:02:43.230> those<00:02:43.350> sample<00:02:43.800> packs<00:02:44.070> is<00:02:44.340> really<00:02:44.730> cool

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
one of those sample packs is really cool

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.810 
one of those sample packs is really cool
because<00:02:45.150> it<00:02:45.510> just<00:02:46.130> gives<00:02:47.130> you<00:02:47.220> some<00:02:47.400> foam<00:02:47.640> to

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
because it just gives you some foam to

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.150 
because it just gives you some foam to
work<00:02:48.000> with<00:02:48.240> so<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:48.900> can<00:02:49.050> get<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.260> know<00:02:49.440> the

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
work with so you can get to know the

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.480 
work with so you can get to know the
different<00:02:50.550> kinds<00:02:50.850> of<00:02:50.940> foam<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:52.280> what<00:02:53.280> works

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
different kinds of foam and what works

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.000 
different kinds of foam and what works
for<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:53.820> basically<00:02:54.060> on<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.570> body<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.530> used<00:02:55.860> a

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
for you basically on the body I used a

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.890 
for you basically on the body I used a
little<00:02:56.190> bit<00:02:56.280> of<00:02:56.400> six<00:02:57.000> millimeter<00:02:57.420> depron

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
little bit of six millimeter depron

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.310 
little bit of six millimeter depron
couple<00:02:58.680> strips<00:02:58.920> of<00:02:59.100> it<00:02:59.220> you'll<00:02:59.489> see<00:02:59.670> that<00:03:00.320> the

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
couple strips of it you'll see that the

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.050 
couple strips of it you'll see that the
main<00:03:01.500> body<00:03:01.770> of<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:01.950> plane<00:03:02.130> is<00:03:02.400> made<00:03:02.640> with<00:03:02.850> that

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
main body of the plane is made with that

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.030 
main body of the plane is made with that
just<00:03:03.330> think<00:03:04.050> this<00:03:04.140> is<00:03:04.200> quarter<00:03:04.650> inch<00:03:04.830> by

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
just think this is quarter inch by

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.979 
just think this is quarter inch by
quarter<00:03:05.430> inch<00:03:05.610> it's<00:03:06.300> definitely<00:03:06.450> balsa<00:03:06.959> wood

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
quarter inch it's definitely balsa wood

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.449 
quarter inch it's definitely balsa wood
from<00:03:07.620> my<00:03:08.280> local<00:03:08.459> hobby<00:03:08.730> shop<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:11.310> other

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
from my local hobby shop and the other

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.870 
from my local hobby shop and the other
materials<00:03:12.180> were<00:03:12.360> these<00:03:12.540> Parkzone<00:03:13.230> parts

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
materials were these Parkzone parts

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.800 
materials were these Parkzone parts
inspection<00:03:14.880> parts<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:15.300> let<00:03:15.420> me<00:03:15.480> show<00:03:15.600> you<00:03:15.630> the

inspection parts so let me show you the

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.840 
inspection parts so let me show you the
others<00:03:16.020> from<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.590> replacement<00:03:17.190> rack<00:03:17.370> there

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
others from the replacement rack there

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.340 
others from the replacement rack there
you<00:03:18.000> go<00:03:18.150> that's<00:03:18.480> what<00:03:18.720> it<00:03:18.810> looks<00:03:18.959> like<00:03:19.140> all

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
you go that's what it looks like all

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.310 
you go that's what it looks like all
these<00:03:19.739> little<00:03:19.980> things<00:03:20.390> so<00:03:21.390> used<00:03:21.630> some<00:03:21.989> from<00:03:22.200> a

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
these little things so used some from a

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.440 
these little things so used some from a
p-51<00:03:22.950> i<00:03:23.310> use<00:03:23.520> the<00:03:23.670> landing<00:03:24.000> gear<00:03:24.120> from<00:03:24.300> the

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
p-51 i use the landing gear from the

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.750 
p-51 i use the landing gear from the
night<00:03:24.630> vapor<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.380> province<00:03:25.800> pinner<00:03:26.070> from<00:03:26.489> the

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
night vapor the province pinner from the

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.070 
night vapor the province pinner from the
j<00:03:27.180> 36<00:03:28.110> millimeter<00:03:28.610> motor<00:03:29.610> j-3<00:03:30.270> and<00:03:30.480> then<00:03:30.750> the

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
j 36 millimeter motor j-3 and then the

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.070 
j 36 millimeter motor j-3 and then the
spektrum<00:03:31.920> receiver<00:03:32.510> servo<00:03:33.510> also<00:03:33.900> from

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
spektrum receiver servo also from

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.020 
spektrum receiver servo also from
spectrum<00:03:34.530> for<00:03:34.709> these<00:03:34.830> parks<00:03:35.160> on<00:03:35.280> planes<00:03:35.550> so

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
spectrum for these parks on planes so

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.830 
spectrum for these parks on planes so
let's<00:03:36.180> take<00:03:36.360> a<00:03:36.390> look<00:03:36.660> at<00:03:37.050> what<00:03:37.709> I<00:03:38.130> did

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
let's take a look at what I did

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.460 
let's take a look at what I did
engine<00:03:40.769> mount<00:03:41.010> battery<00:03:41.760> mount<00:03:42.180> landing<00:03:43.050> gear

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
engine mount battery mount landing gear

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.520 
engine mount battery mount landing gear
the<00:03:44.220> engine<00:03:44.760> mount<00:03:45.000> I<00:03:45.300> took<00:03:45.510> that<00:03:45.720> balsa<00:03:46.500> wood

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
the engine mount I took that balsa wood

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.199 
the engine mount I took that balsa wood
and<00:03:46.800> attached<00:03:47.099> some<00:03:47.280> of<00:03:47.459> that<00:03:47.580> 6<00:03:47.819> millimeter

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
and attached some of that 6 millimeter

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.170 
and attached some of that 6 millimeter
depron<00:03:48.690> foam<00:03:49.019> to<00:03:49.410> it<00:03:49.560> and<00:03:49.680> added<00:03:50.670> a<00:03:50.730> layer<00:03:50.910> and

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
depron foam to it and added a layer and

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.690 
depron foam to it and added a layer and
that's<00:03:51.390> how<00:03:51.540> i<00:03:51.569> mounted<00:03:52.050> the<00:03:52.110> gear<00:03:53.099> box<00:03:53.280> in

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
that's how i mounted the gear box in

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.430 
that's how i mounted the gear box in
there<00:03:54.000> and<00:03:54.239> the<00:03:54.629> engine<00:03:54.870> slides<00:03:55.140> into<00:03:55.349> the

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
there and the engine slides into the

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.320 
there and the engine slides into the
gearbox<00:03:55.890> and<00:03:56.190> there's<00:03:56.610> another<00:03:56.819> shot<00:03:57.090> of<00:03:57.239> it

just<00:04:15.630> a<00:04:15.720> couple<00:04:15.930> more<00:04:16.200> pieces<00:04:16.500> of<00:04:16.729> six

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
just a couple more pieces of six

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.729 
just a couple more pieces of six
millimeter<00:04:18.299> depron<00:04:18.780> there<00:04:19.290> it<00:04:19.380> is<00:04:19.440> from<00:04:19.650> the

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
millimeter depron there it is from the

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.430 
millimeter depron there it is from the
side

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.350 

receiver<00:04:24.440> and<00:04:24.770> tail<00:04:25.130> servos<00:04:26.470> there<00:04:27.470> is<00:04:27.710> the

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
receiver and tail servos there is the

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.950 
receiver and tail servos there is the
receiver<00:04:29.360> now<00:04:30.490> it<00:04:31.490> has<00:04:31.640> to<00:04:31.820> be<00:04:32.000> close<00:04:32.720> to<00:04:32.750> the

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
receiver now it has to be close to the

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.110 
receiver now it has to be close to the
battery<00:04:33.320> in<00:04:33.470> the<00:04:33.560> prop<00:04:33.770> because<00:04:34.160> those<00:04:34.370> cables

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
battery in the prop because those cables

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.090 
battery in the prop because those cables
are<00:04:35.270> short<00:04:35.540> but<00:04:35.780> I<00:04:36.230> tried<00:04:36.500> to<00:04:36.620> move<00:04:36.740> it<00:04:36.890> further

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
are short but I tried to move it further

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.350 
are short but I tried to move it further
back<00:04:37.400> so<00:04:37.430> I'd<00:04:37.730> be<00:04:37.850> near<00:04:38.000> the<00:04:38.090> center<00:04:38.330> of

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
back so I'd be near the center of

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.330 
back so I'd be near the center of
gravity<00:04:38.750> the<00:04:39.170> documentation<00:04:39.890> is<00:04:39.980> really<00:04:40.190> good

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
gravity the documentation is really good

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.010 
gravity the documentation is really good
on<00:04:40.490> these<00:04:40.670> you<00:04:40.880> can<00:04:40.970> see<00:04:41.150> there's<00:04:41.330> two<00:04:41.570> servos

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
on these you can see there's two servos

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.900 
on these you can see there's two servos
one<00:04:42.290> for<00:04:42.500> the<00:04:42.560> elevator<00:04:42.980> one<00:04:43.340> for<00:04:43.610> the<00:04:43.670> rudder

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
one for the elevator one for the rudder

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.880 
one for the elevator one for the rudder
the<00:04:44.360> control<00:04:44.690> rods<00:04:44.930> they're<00:04:45.260> attaching

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
the control rods they're attaching

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.190 
the control rods they're attaching
there's<00:04:46.520> plugs<00:04:46.790> for<00:04:47.030> other<00:04:47.240> the<00:04:47.630> other<00:04:47.660> servos

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
there's plugs for other the other servos

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.680 
there's plugs for other the other servos
for<00:04:48.230> the<00:04:48.500> elevator<00:04:48.860> or<00:04:49.160> for<00:04:49.520> the<00:04:49.610> ailerons<00:04:50.480> and

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
for the elevator or for the ailerons and

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.370 
for the elevator or for the ailerons and
I<00:04:51.230> held<00:04:51.470> it<00:04:51.620> down<00:04:51.650> you<00:04:52.190> can<00:04:52.310> use<00:04:52.460> sticky<00:04:52.970> tape

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
I held it down you can use sticky tape

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.890 
I held it down you can use sticky tape
double<00:04:54.380> sided<00:04:54.560> foam<00:04:54.890> sticky<00:04:55.280> tape<00:04:55.570> that<00:04:56.570> that

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
double sided foam sticky tape that that

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.270 
double sided foam sticky tape that that
should<00:04:57.050> work<00:04:57.200> but<00:04:57.470> what<00:04:57.620> I<00:04:57.650> did<00:04:57.920> was<00:04:58.100> I<00:04:58.250> made

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
should work but what I did was I made

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.640 
should work but what I did was I made
little<00:04:58.670> sort<00:04:59.090> of<00:04:59.120> L<00:04:59.330> brackets<00:04:59.840> out<00:05:00.020> of<00:05:00.170> the<00:05:00.260> six

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
little sort of L brackets out of the six

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.400 
little sort of L brackets out of the six
millimeter<00:05:01.040> depron<00:05:01.430> and<00:05:01.700> the<00:05:02.450> CA<00:05:02.720> glue<00:05:03.050> so

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
millimeter depron and the CA glue so

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:04.450 
millimeter depron and the CA glue so
there's<00:05:03.560> no<00:05:03.680> actual<00:05:03.830> glue<00:05:04.160> on<00:05:04.370> the

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
there's no actual glue on the

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.670 
there's no actual glue on the
transmitter<00:05:04.970> I<00:05:05.270> I<00:05:05.750> thought<00:05:06.140> that<00:05:06.260> might<00:05:06.470> mess

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
transmitter I I thought that might mess

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.680 
transmitter I I thought that might mess
it<00:05:06.710> up<00:05:06.950> so<00:05:07.250> I<00:05:07.460> just<00:05:07.940> sort<00:05:08.060> of<00:05:08.180> glued<00:05:08.390> little

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
it up so I just sort of glued little

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.900 
it up so I just sort of glued little
brackets<00:05:09.200> around<00:05:09.320> the<00:05:09.680> whole<00:05:09.830> de<00:05:10.010> hold<00:05:10.790> the

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
brackets around the whole de hold the

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.430 
brackets around the whole de hold the
receiver<00:05:11.240> did<00:05:11.630> I<00:05:11.690> call<00:05:11.840> it<00:05:11.960> a<00:05:12.020> transmitter

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
receiver did I call it a transmitter

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.650 
receiver did I call it a transmitter
it's<00:05:12.710> a<00:05:12.860> receiver<00:05:13.190> the<00:05:13.760> rods<00:05:13.970> go<00:05:14.240> towards<00:05:14.600> the

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
it's a receiver the rods go towards the

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.930 
it's a receiver the rods go towards the
back<00:05:14.870> of<00:05:14.900> the<00:05:15.050> plane<00:05:15.320> I<00:05:15.650> have<00:05:16.190> some<00:05:16.370> foam<00:05:16.640> to

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
back of the plane I have some foam to

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.530 
back of the plane I have some foam to
kind<00:05:17.150> of<00:05:17.240> guide<00:05:17.480> the<00:05:18.520> control<00:05:19.520> rods<00:05:20.120> and

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:20.540 
kind of guide the control rods and

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.380 
kind of guide the control rods and
unfortunately<00:05:21.500> you<00:05:21.800> know<00:05:22.100> I<00:05:22.130> is<00:05:22.910> my<00:05:23.120> first

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
unfortunately you know I is my first

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.630 
unfortunately you know I is my first
time<00:05:24.080> designing<00:05:24.410> this<00:05:24.800> type<00:05:25.130> of<00:05:25.160> thing<00:05:25.430> so<00:05:25.610> I

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
time designing this type of thing so I

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.210 
time designing this type of thing so I
didn't<00:05:26.210> have<00:05:26.330> them<00:05:26.450> have<00:05:27.020> the<00:05:27.230> rods<00:05:27.470> mounted

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
didn't have them have the rods mounted

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.980 
didn't have them have the rods mounted
exactly<00:05:28.910> the<00:05:29.000> way<00:05:29.120> I<00:05:29.150> wanted<00:05:29.510> so<00:05:29.660> you<00:05:29.750> can<00:05:29.870> see

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
exactly the way I wanted so you can see

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.720 
exactly the way I wanted so you can see
they<00:05:30.140> actually<00:05:30.410> crisscross<00:05:30.920> which<00:05:31.250> you<00:05:31.610> know

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:31.730 
they actually crisscross which you know

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.940 
they actually crisscross which you know
they're<00:05:31.880> not<00:05:31.910> touching<00:05:32.480> you<00:05:32.990> know<00:05:33.170> but

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
they're not touching you know but

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:36.130 
they're not touching you know but
they're<00:05:34.160> kind<00:05:34.460> of<00:05:34.580> not<00:05:35.180> in<00:05:35.210> the<00:05:35.480> best<00:05:35.660> design<00:05:36.110> I

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
they're kind of not in the best design I

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.080 
they're kind of not in the best design I
could<00:05:36.470> have<00:05:36.560> come<00:05:36.680> up<00:05:36.830> with<00:05:36.860> so<00:05:37.310> but<00:05:37.850> this<00:05:38.030> is

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
could have come up with so but this is

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.000 
could have come up with so but this is
the<00:05:38.540> first<00:05:38.570> time<00:05:38.930> I<00:05:38.990> tried<00:05:39.320> it<00:05:39.470> so<00:05:39.680> you<00:05:39.920> know

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
the first time I tried it so you know

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:45.450 
the first time I tried it so you know
I'll<00:05:40.520> get<00:05:40.790> it<00:05:40.910> better<00:05:41.600> next<00:05:41.810> time<00:05:43.840> Dale

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
I'll get it better next time Dale

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.310 
I'll get it better next time Dale
alright<00:05:46.460> so<00:05:46.580> the<00:05:46.700> tail<00:05:47.000> this<00:05:47.660> is<00:05:47.870> a<00:05:47.900> shot<00:05:48.230> of

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
alright so the tail this is a shot of

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.930 
alright so the tail this is a shot of
the<00:05:48.410> underneath<00:05:48.710> of<00:05:48.800> the<00:05:48.860> tail<00:05:49.100> I<00:05:49.340> chose<00:05:49.730> to

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
the underneath of the tail I chose to

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.890 
the underneath of the tail I chose to
have<00:05:50.090> a<00:05:50.920> tail<00:05:51.920> dragger<00:05:52.250> just<00:05:53.060> because<00:05:53.420> I

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
have a tail dragger just because I

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.450 
have a tail dragger just because I
didn't<00:05:54.230> want<00:05:54.260> to<00:05:54.410> get<00:05:54.530> into<00:05:54.710> having<00:05:55.100> a<00:05:55.190> nose

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
didn't want to get into having a nose

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.160 
didn't want to get into having a nose
wheel<00:05:55.730> and<00:05:55.940> stop<00:05:56.150> a<00:05:56.180> taildragger<00:05:56.690> I<00:05:56.900> thought

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:57.170 
wheel and stop a taildragger I thought

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.890 
wheel and stop a taildragger I thought
what's<00:05:57.350> more<00:05:57.500> simple<00:05:57.830> to<00:05:57.860> design<00:05:58.280> so

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
what's more simple to design so

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.060 
what's more simple to design so
literally<00:05:59.900> there's<00:06:00.230> just<00:06:00.470> a<00:06:00.590> piece<00:06:00.770> of<00:06:00.800> wire

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
literally there's just a piece of wire

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.840 
literally there's just a piece of wire
sticking<00:06:01.400> down<00:06:01.700> that<00:06:02.680> drags<00:06:03.680> for<00:06:04.190> the<00:06:04.280> tail<00:06:04.490> no

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:04.850 
sticking down that drags for the tail no

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.280 
sticking down that drags for the tail no

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:06.290 
wheel back there and you can see the

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:08.860 
wheel back there and you can see the
control<00:06:06.650> rods<00:06:06.890> going<00:06:07.460> to<00:06:07.640> the<00:06:07.820> troll<00:06:08.360> horns

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870

their<00:06:09.170> control<00:06:09.740> horns<00:06:10.040> are<00:06:10.160> pieces<00:06:10.490> of

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
their control horns are pieces of

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.970 
their control horns are pieces of
plastic<00:06:11.240> from<00:06:11.570> you<00:06:12.320> know<00:06:12.440> stuff<00:06:12.710> you<00:06:12.830> buy<00:06:12.950> in

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:21.200 
that on there and poked holes in it with

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.230 
that on there and poked holes in it with
a<00:06:21.230> pin<00:06:21.470> there's<00:06:22.190> the<00:06:22.400> tail<00:06:22.580> from<00:06:22.670> the<00:06:22.760> top<00:06:22.970> side

again that Cessna some plans I pulled
off<00:06:29.600> the<00:06:29.750> internet<00:06:30.050> I<00:06:30.230> just<00:06:30.440> copied<00:06:30.740> right<00:06:31.040> off
