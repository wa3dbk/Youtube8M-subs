00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
useful and probably when the most

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.380 
useful and probably when the most
anticipated<00:01:21.720> features<00:01:22.409> poured<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:22.920> app

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
anticipated features poured this app

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.999

this will create a radio station off of
that<00:01:29.430> which<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.759> pretty<00:01:30.000> nice<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:31.229> can

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
that which is pretty nice and you can

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.289 
that which is pretty nice and you can
see<00:01:31.380> I'll<00:01:31.740> go<00:01:31.979> into<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.119> see<00:01:33.270> I

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
see I'll go into that and you see I

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.390 
see I'll go into that and you see I
created<00:01:33.659> one<00:01:33.780> for<00:01:33.810> rise<00:01:34.110> against<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.920> simply

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
created one for rise against and simply

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.249 
created one for rise against and simply

download<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.399> your<00:01:47.430> phone<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.659> it<00:01:48.899> does

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
download it to your phone and it does

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.350 
download it to your phone and it does
see<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.770> music<00:01:50.340> that's<00:01:50.490> already<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:51.090> your

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
see the music that's already on your

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.090 
see the music that's already on your
device<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:51.990> can<00:01:52.290> just<00:01:52.470> use<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:52.890> as<00:01:53.070> a

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
device so you can just use this as a

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.679 
device so you can just use this as a
normal<00:01:53.340> app<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.240> have<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.479> worry<00:01:54.630> about

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
normal app and you have to worry about

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.260 
normal app and you have to worry about
the<00:01:54.869> cloud<00:01:55.079> now<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.680> do<00:01:56.040> need<00:01:56.340> an<00:01:56.549> Xbox<00:01:56.850> music

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
the cloud now you do need an Xbox music

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.510 
the cloud now you do need an Xbox music
pass<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.930> use<00:01:58.110> this<00:01:58.409> app<00:01:58.680> right<00:01:58.979> now<00:01:59.250> and

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
pass to use this app right now and

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.920 
pass to use this app right now and
that's<00:01:59.670> because<00:01:59.759> of<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.149> cloud<00:02:00.360> services

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
that's because of the cloud services

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.899 
that's because of the cloud services
involved<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.829> don't<00:02:02.430> know<00:02:02.549> if<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.790> will

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
involved I don't know if that will

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.300 
involved I don't know if that will
change<00:02:03.180> later<00:02:03.360> on<00:02:03.659> but<00:02:04.140> for<00:02:04.500> right<00:02:04.590> now<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.829> do

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
change later on but for right now you do

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.459 
change later on but for right now you do
need<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:06.420> can<00:02:06.540> go<00:02:06.659> through<00:02:06.990> though<00:02:07.200> and

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
need that you can go through though and

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.380 
need that you can go through though and
you<00:02:07.680> can<00:02:07.829> bring<00:02:08.069> up<00:02:08.220> an<00:02:08.369> album<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.030> you're

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
you can bring up an album and you're

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.430 
you can bring up an album and you're
going<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.599> see<00:02:09.720> it's<00:02:09.840> going<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.050> allow<00:02:10.170> me<00:02:10.410> to

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
going to see it's going to allow me to

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.320 
going to see it's going to allow me to
stream<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:11.459> fact<00:02:11.489> it's<00:02:11.849> starting<00:02:12.180> to

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
stream that and in fact it's starting to

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.240 
stream that and in fact it's starting to
right<00:02:12.540> now<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:13.160> then

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
right now and then

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.070 
right now and then
can<00:02:14.490> also<00:02:14.640> give<00:02:14.880> me<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.090> option<00:02:15.210> to<00:02:15.840> download

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
can also give me the option to download

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.910 
can also give me the option to download
if<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.680> so<00:02:17.010> choose<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:22.290> so<00:02:22.470> we'll<00:02:22.650> pause

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
if I so choose to and so we'll pause

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.680 
if I so choose to and so we'll pause
that<00:02:24.680> let's<00:02:25.680> see<00:02:25.770> if<00:02:25.830> we<00:02:25.920> can<00:02:26.010> back<00:02:26.250> out<00:02:26.540> but<00:02:27.540> it

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
that let's see if we can back out but it

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.360 
that let's see if we can back out but it
overall<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.350> app<00:02:28.470> works<00:02:28.770> very<00:02:29.250> well

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
overall the app works very well

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.100 
overall the app works very well
interestingly<00:02:30.210> enough<00:02:30.270> when<00:02:30.959> you<00:02:31.080> are

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
interestingly enough when you are

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.720 
interestingly enough when you are
playing<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.890> song<00:02:32.630> which<00:02:33.630> we'll<00:02:33.810> do<00:02:33.990> right<00:02:34.170> here

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
playing a song which we'll do right here

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.880 
playing a song which we'll do right here
it<00:02:35.730> doesn't<00:02:35.970> have<00:02:36.240> a<00:02:36.270> live<00:02:36.600> tile<00:02:36.900> just<00:02:37.500> yet

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
it doesn't have a live tile just yet

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.850 
it doesn't have a live tile just yet
although<00:02:38.790> you'll<00:02:39.030> see<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.360> old<00:02:39.630> app<00:02:40.260> live

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
although you'll see the old app live

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.530 
although you'll see the old app live
tile<00:02:41.130> does<00:02:41.400> still<00:02:41.760> work<00:02:41.940> which<00:02:42.209> is<00:02:42.300> kind<00:02:42.510> of

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
tile does still work which is kind of

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.100 
tile does still work which is kind of
interesting

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
interesting

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.830 
interesting
so<00:02:43.650> nothing<00:02:44.220> here<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.550> new<00:02:44.700> app<00:02:44.880> but<00:02:45.660> there

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
so nothing here the new app but there

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.170 
so nothing here the new app but there
you<00:02:45.930> go<00:02:45.959> now<00:02:46.230> we<00:02:46.290> have<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:46.709> keep<00:02:46.800> in<00:02:46.980> mind<00:02:47.220> this

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
you go now we have to keep in mind this

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.810 
you go now we have to keep in mind this
is<00:02:48.420> just<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.870> preview<00:02:49.470> app<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:50.070> this<00:02:50.310> is<00:02:50.459> not<00:02:50.610> the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
is just a preview app so this is not the

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.340 
is just a preview app so this is not the
final<00:02:51.150> release<00:02:51.330> of<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:51.870> this<00:02:51.989> is<00:02:52.050> basically

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
final release of it this is basically

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.410 
final release of it this is basically
Microsoft<00:02:52.739> giving<00:02:53.340> us<00:02:53.459> a<00:02:53.550> tease<00:02:53.790> think<00:02:54.180> of<00:02:54.300> as

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
Microsoft giving us a tease think of as

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.770 
Microsoft giving us a tease think of as
a<00:02:54.450> beta<00:02:54.800> missing<00:02:55.800> though<00:02:56.220> from<00:02:56.520> it<00:02:56.670> is<00:02:56.880> podcast

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
a beta missing though from it is podcast

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.229 
a beta missing though from it is podcast
support<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.500> there's<00:02:58.800> no<00:02:59.150> evidence<00:03:00.150> right

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
support and there's no evidence right

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.760 
support and there's no evidence right
now<00:03:00.330> that<00:03:00.420> podcasts<00:03:01.020> are<00:03:01.080> coming<00:03:01.350> back<00:03:01.470> we

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
now that podcasts are coming back we

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.680 
now that podcasts are coming back we
don't<00:03:01.920> know<00:03:02.100> what<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.610> status<00:03:02.850> is<00:03:03.150> of<00:03:03.450> that

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
don't know what the status is of that

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.290 
don't know what the status is of that
that's<00:03:04.650> partly<00:03:05.250> because<00:03:05.370> Microsoft<00:03:06.180> has

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
that's partly because Microsoft has

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.060 
that's partly because Microsoft has
always<00:03:06.450> had<00:03:06.660> problems<00:03:06.870> getting<00:03:07.110> podcasts

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
always had problems getting podcasts

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.880 
always had problems getting podcasts

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
device every 30 days but it's kind of

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.539

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
then you have to basically wait what I

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.490 
then you have to basically wait what I

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
have found is that you can basically

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.039

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
four will be active though this will

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.400 
four will be active though this will
actually<00:04:14.610> switch<00:04:15.030> between<00:04:15.060> them<00:04:15.660> we<00:04:16.320> don't

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
actually switch between them we don't

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.349 
actually switch between them we don't
know<00:04:16.560> how<00:04:16.709> often<00:04:16.950> you<00:04:17.280> can<00:04:17.519> do<00:04:17.760> that<00:04:17.970> but<00:04:18.180> so

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359

app<00:05:16.229> that<00:05:16.440> everything<00:05:16.800> is<00:05:16.919> perfect<00:05:17.400> I<00:05:17.580> was

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
app that everything is perfect I was

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.730 
app that everything is perfect I was
doing<00:05:18.330> Batman<00:05:18.599> before<00:05:19.139> so<00:05:19.319> we'll<00:05:19.440> see<00:05:19.620> if<00:05:19.710> that

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
doing Batman before so we'll see if that

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:26.760 
doing Batman before so we'll see if that
plays

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:36.510 

and<00:05:27.400> there<00:05:27.669> it<00:05:27.759> goes<00:05:34.740> great<00:05:35.740> scene<00:05:36.009> in<00:05:36.039> Batman

obviously<00:05:37.060> so<00:05:37.539> the<00:05:38.110> one<00:05:38.560> downside<00:05:39.099> to<00:05:39.160> this

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
obviously so the one downside to this

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.629 
obviously so the one downside to this
app<00:05:39.669> right<00:05:40.090> now<00:05:40.270> is<00:05:40.630> it<00:05:40.930> does<00:05:41.110> not<00:05:41.289> support<00:05:41.860> HD

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 
app right now is it does not support HD

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:46.559 
app right now is it does not support HD
