00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.250
 very good to all welcome to a 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:08.930
 new video and today I bring you the solution 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:12.830
 of the ms vcp file error 120 points 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.540
 of ll of geometries worth of the latter 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.539
 video that I uploaded that you are putting me 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:21.470
 here in the comments that we are missing 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:24.739
 that file so well I'm going to make you 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.970
 a very fast tutorial, well, you have to 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:28.730
 know where is the folder of 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.399
 geometrical is worth the first because you go 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.430
 to have to put a new file that 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:37.670
 it would be east west depending on the system 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:41.839
 operative of your pc worth 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:46.280
 if you are 64 bit downloads this if it is 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:48.699
 of 32 downloads is fine if you do not know 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.229
 how to look at the bits if you are windows 8 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:54.140
 you go here to setup 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:58.789
 you give information to the pc and 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:02.920
 directly it goes out OK if I'm windows 7 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:05.930
 or xp then go to start control panel 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:10.009
 system insecurity and system I think that 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:13.759
 It was good once you were there and to use the 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:16.340
 system of things and everything else well I'm from 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.649
 64 bits let's imagine that I have the error 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.950
 so the only thing I would have to do 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:23.100
 is 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.119
 download this file and drag it 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.590
 within the folder it geometries 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:32.119
 if you do not know where the folder is 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:36.569
 defect from the same game icon 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:40.000
 click eyes of the isa properties and open 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:42.760
 location and there you have the folder worth 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.490
 and nothing else the solution that I found 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:49.490
 it works for almost everyone, if not 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:52.100
 it works I do not know what else I can do 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.369
 and I do not expect anything to serve you until the 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.369
 next
