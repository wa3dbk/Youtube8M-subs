 [Music] 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:39.199
 hello friends guys here we are in a 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.149
 super super super succulent guys is the 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:42.680
 mod dimension ok guys are five 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.960
 different dimensions that each 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.809
 dimension has what is a leader or a 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.339
 boss ok guys and in every dimension 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.860
 there is also a chest that with that chest 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:55.280
 you're going to try to defeat the boss who 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:58.100
 it really costs like 78 more minutes or 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.079
 least in defeating a leader by striking him 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.699
 ok guys and the leader obviously is not going 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.129
 to stay like this is also going to attack you ok 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.259
 but the chest obviously the chest has 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.570
 many things that will serve you during 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.610
 the battle ok I'm going to go to the portal 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.070
 because to see more or less how it is 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.229
 ok it's more or less like that they have to have 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.030
 what a lighter is and put it here 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.610
 opposite as if it were as if 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.440
 were the nÃ©ider ok I started ok here is 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.210
 the leader who does not have it that good what 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.580
 right now I'm not going to hit him because if I 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.039
 hit me will attack me obviously and not 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.750
 I'm going to ask obviously I'm going to lose ok 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:32.420
 I do not think I'll beat him that the truth is 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.310
 super super difficult and ok yes for a 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.409
 reason you want to return without defeating the 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.550
 leader you must always defeat him before 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.040
 because if you go by 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.440
 I'm going to go through one there's no no no 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.070
 I can defeat him I go but he passes these 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.810
 Boys 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.390
 this happens you have died and you stay 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.700
 stuck in that dimension ok can you 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.190
 say ah then it happens to the creative break 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.230
 this tried to enter and that believes and does not 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.150
 you can enter ok guys so they have 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.040
 that by force of rotating because if you do not 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.900
 you're trapped and stopping trapped 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.940
 rather in this dimension or trapped 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.530
 you can also be ok and good guys 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.240
 but they liked the video remember 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.460
 give you like subscribe share this 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.020
 grams and without guys see during this 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.450
 video they see something blurry is because the 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.420
