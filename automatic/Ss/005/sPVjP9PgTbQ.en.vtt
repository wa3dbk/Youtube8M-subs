clipping<00:00:57.089> indicators<00:00:57.870> what<00:00:58.499> that<00:00:58.679> means<00:00:58.920> is

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
clipping indicators what that means is

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.680 
clipping indicators what that means is
we're<00:00:59.339> clipping<00:00:59.760> either<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.120> whites<00:01:00.389> or<00:01:00.659> the

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
we're clipping either the whites or the

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.829 
we're clipping either the whites or the
blacks<00:01:01.109> when<00:01:01.620> we're<00:01:01.799> clipping<00:01:02.190> white

Lightroom<00:01:03.839> will<00:01:03.989> show<00:01:04.229> red<00:01:04.559> when<00:01:04.920> we're

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
Lightroom will show red when we're

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.950 
Lightroom will show red when we're
clipping<00:01:05.460> black<00:01:05.790> Lightroom<00:01:06.330> will<00:01:06.540> display

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
clipping black Lightroom will display

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.110 
clipping black Lightroom will display
blue<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.830> that's<00:01:08.070> what<00:01:08.340> we<00:01:08.460> have<00:01:08.670> here<00:01:08.970> now

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
blue and that's what we have here now

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.470 
blue and that's what we have here now
you<00:01:09.960> if<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.070> have<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.150> don't<00:01:12.300> know

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.480 
you if you have this and you don't know

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.870 
you if you have this and you don't know
how<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.690> got<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.380> obviously

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
how you got it you obviously

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.770 
how you got it you obviously
inadvertently<00:01:14.880> turned<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.270> on<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.630> there's

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
inadvertently turned it on and there's

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.230 
inadvertently turned it on and there's
two<00:01:16.020> ways<00:01:16.230> you<00:01:16.770> could<00:01:17.160> have<00:01:17.280> turned<00:01:17.550> it<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:17.790> in

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
two ways you could have turned it on in

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.150 
two ways you could have turned it on in
the<00:01:18.750> histogram<00:01:19.080> if<00:01:19.410> you<00:01:19.500> see<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.800> the<00:01:19.890> corner

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:20.160 
the histogram if you see in the corner

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.610 
the histogram if you see in the corner
here<00:01:20.310> these<00:01:20.490> little<00:01:20.910> triangles<00:01:21.290> this<00:01:22.290> one<00:01:22.500> on

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
here these little triangles this one on

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.350 
here these little triangles this one on
the<00:01:22.740> left<00:01:22.980> is<00:01:23.190> the<00:01:23.340> clipping<00:01:23.580> indicator<00:01:24.120> for

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
the left is the clipping indicator for

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.660 
the left is the clipping indicator for
the<00:01:24.390> blacks<00:01:24.720> if<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.230> click<00:01:25.530> on<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:26.340> can<00:01:26.490> see

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
the blacks if I click on it you can see

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.210 
the blacks if I click on it you can see
it<00:01:26.820> turned<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.180> off<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.740> similarly<00:01:28.740> on<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
it turned it off and similarly on the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.040 
it turned it off and similarly on the
far<00:01:29.460> right<00:01:29.700> we<00:01:29.730> have<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.150> clipping<00:01:30.510> indicator

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
far right we have the clipping indicator

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.020 
far right we have the clipping indicator
for<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.350> whites<00:01:31.620> and<00:01:32.430> I'll<00:01:32.580> click<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:32.970> that

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
for the whites and I'll click on that

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.290 
for the whites and I'll click on that
and<00:01:33.510> it<00:01:33.720> turns<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.170> off<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:35.430> other<00:01:35.670> way<00:01:35.970> you

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
and it turns that off the other way you

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.840 
and it turns that off the other way you
may<00:01:36.600> have<00:01:36.890> accidentally<00:01:37.890> turned<00:01:38.280> them<00:01:38.460> on<00:01:38.580> is

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
may have accidentally turned them on is

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.520 
may have accidentally turned them on is
while<00:01:39.030> you're<00:01:39.240> in<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:39.450> develop<00:01:39.870> module<00:01:40.320> if

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
will toggle them on and off so that is

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.140 
will toggle them on and off so that is
probably<00:01:46.500> more<00:01:46.890> likely<00:01:47.190> what<00:01:47.580> happened<00:01:48.030> you

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
probably more likely what happened you

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.570 
probably more likely what happened you
accidentally<00:01:48.690> hit<00:01:48.870> the<00:01:49.170> J<00:01:49.710> key<00:01:49.980> now<00:01:50.400> what<00:01:50.520> the

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
accidentally hit the J key now what the

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.050 
accidentally hit the J key now what the
clipping<00:01:50.909> indicators<00:01:51.390> mean<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.930> there's<00:01:52.500> no

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
clipping indicators mean is there's no

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.110 
clipping indicators mean is there's no
information<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:55.190> those<00:01:56.190> areas<00:01:56.760> they're

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
information in those areas they're

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.970 
information in those areas they're
either<00:01:57.270> clipped<00:01:57.810> absolute<00:01:58.440> white<00:01:58.680> or

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 
either clipped absolute white or

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.550 
either clipped absolute white or
absolute<00:01:59.970> black<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.540> there's<00:02:00.720> no<00:02:00.990> detail

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
absolute black and there's no detail

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.860 
absolute black and there's no detail
there<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.550> usually<00:02:02.970> you<00:02:03.060> want<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.330> avoid<00:02:03.600> that

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
there so usually you want to avoid that

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.080 
there so usually you want to avoid that
so<00:02:04.260> you<00:02:04.320> would<00:02:04.590> go<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.800> your<00:02:05.190> basic<00:02:05.610> panel<00:02:05.940> and

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
so you would go to your basic panel and

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.749 
so you would go to your basic panel and
adjust<00:02:06.180> your<00:02:06.690> whites<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:07.590> your<00:02:07.740> blacks<00:02:08.009> now

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
adjust your whites in your blacks now

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.119 
adjust your whites in your blacks now
that<00:02:09.000> leads<00:02:09.209> us<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.810> second<00:02:10.319> question<00:02:10.950> I

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
that leads us to the second question I

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.030 
that leads us to the second question I
