00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
does I started off as a producer and

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.889 
does I started off as a producer and
then<00:00:59.039> it's<00:00:59.340> solely<00:00:59.640> within<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.090> last<00:01:00.270> four

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
then it's solely within the last four

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.319 
then it's solely within the last four
five<00:01:01.530> years<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.129> was<00:01:02.340> performing<00:01:02.609> live<00:01:02.969> in

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
five years that I was performing live in

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.820 
five years that I was performing live in
the<00:01:03.480> beginning<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.989> was<00:01:04.080> producing<00:01:04.320> off<00:01:04.589> fruity

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
the beginning I was producing off fruity

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.530 
the beginning I was producing off fruity
loops<00:01:05.070> like<00:01:05.519> slightly<00:01:05.760> underrated<00:01:06.360> but<00:01:06.479> I

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
loops like slightly underrated but I

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.750 
loops like slightly underrated but I
think<00:01:06.750> there's<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.350> lot<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.740> functionality<00:01:08.220> in

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
think there's a lot of functionality in

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.160 
think there's a lot of functionality in
it<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.299> guess<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.540> process<00:01:09.900> flow<00:01:09.990> was

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
it and I guess the process flow was

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.359 
it and I guess the process flow was
something<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.439> really<00:01:10.560> appealed<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:11.010> me<00:01:11.189> but

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
something that really appealed to me but

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.270 
something that really appealed to me but
now<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.520> produce<00:01:12.150> almost<00:01:12.330> solely<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:13.040> Ableton<00:01:14.040> I

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
now I produce almost solely in Ableton I

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.830 
now I produce almost solely in Ableton I
feel<00:01:14.640> like<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.820> has<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:14.970> bit<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.600> sound

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
feel like it has a bit of a sound

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.340 
feel like it has a bit of a sound
character<00:01:16.409> like<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.920> algorithms<00:01:17.490> or<00:01:18.350> sound

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
character like the algorithms or sound

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.289 
character like the algorithms or sound
quality<00:01:19.439> always<00:01:20.159> has<00:01:20.369> its<00:01:20.580> Ableton<00:01:20.970> sound<00:01:21.150> I

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
quality always has its Ableton sound I

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.429 
quality always has its Ableton sound I
know<00:01:21.479> when<00:01:21.750> someone<00:01:21.990> makes<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.200> beat<00:01:22.350> on

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
know when someone makes a beat on

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.679 
know when someone makes a beat on
Ableton<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:24.390> know<00:01:24.479> it's<00:01:24.570> really

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
Ableton so you know it's really

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:25.789 
Ableton so you know it's really
important<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.080> do<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.439> right<00:01:25.560> amount<00:01:25.770> of

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
important to do like the right amount of

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.499 
important to do like the right amount of
processing<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.640> your<00:01:26.759> audio<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.119> make<00:01:27.390> it

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
processing to your audio to make it

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.060 
processing to your audio to make it
sound<00:01:27.659> like<00:01:27.840> it's<00:01:28.110> not<00:01:28.200> just<00:01:28.439> in<00:01:28.530> Ableton<00:01:28.950> be

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
sound like it's not just in Ableton be

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.289 
sound like it's not just in Ableton be
the<00:01:29.250> same<00:01:29.430> thing<00:01:29.640> with<00:01:29.759> fruity<00:01:29.939> loops<00:01:30.150> you

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
the same thing with fruity loops you

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.359 
the same thing with fruity loops you
know<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:31.170> always<00:01:31.470> run<00:01:31.650> things<00:01:31.890> through<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.130> Pete

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
know so always run things through a Pete

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.460 
know so always run things through a Pete

you realize one melody can have so many
different<00:03:03.310> kinds<00:03:04.310> of<00:03:04.489> progressions<00:03:05.269> it<00:03:05.420> could

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
different kinds of progressions it could

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.690 
different kinds of progressions it could
be<00:03:05.600> in<00:03:05.690> a<00:03:05.750> different<00:03:05.930> key<00:03:06.260> I<00:03:06.769> usually<00:03:07.370> try<00:03:07.640> to

it<00:03:12.200> a<00:03:12.230> little<00:03:12.470> bit<00:03:12.680> more<00:03:12.890> if<00:03:13.100> it's<00:03:13.310> mellow<00:03:14.030> or

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
it a little bit more if it's mellow or

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.000 
it a little bit more if it's mellow or
if<00:03:14.690> it's<00:03:14.840> really<00:03:15.109> upbeat<00:03:15.320> then<00:03:15.709> I'll<00:03:15.799> try<00:03:15.950> to

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
if it's really upbeat then I'll try to

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.800 
if it's really upbeat then I'll try to
find<00:03:16.280> a<00:03:16.340> way<00:03:16.370> to<00:03:16.519> make<00:03:16.700> it<00:03:16.820> more<00:03:16.970> soulful<00:03:17.269> or

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
find a way to make it more soulful or

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.920 
find a way to make it more soulful or
more<00:03:18.380> obscure<00:03:18.920> or<00:03:19.480> it's<00:03:20.480> a<00:03:20.510> different<00:03:20.810> angle

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
more obscure or it's a different angle

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.180 
more obscure or it's a different angle
because<00:03:21.260> you<00:03:21.440> know<00:03:21.530> if<00:03:21.620> you're<00:03:21.680> doing<00:03:21.739> a<00:03:21.920> remix

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
because you know if you're doing a remix

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.470 
because you know if you're doing a remix
you<00:03:22.370> should<00:03:22.519> make<00:03:22.609> the<00:03:22.700> song<00:03:22.880> different<00:03:23.299> I

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
you should make the song different I

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.819 
you should make the song different I
usually<00:03:23.840> don't<00:03:23.930> do<00:03:24.079> too<00:03:24.230> much<00:03:24.350> editing<00:03:24.530> to

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
usually don't do too much editing to

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.590 
usually don't do too much editing to
vocals<00:03:25.220> so<00:03:25.489> if<00:03:25.549> the<00:03:25.790> song<00:03:26.000> is<00:03:26.180> all<00:03:26.299> the<00:03:26.420> same

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
vocals so if the song is all the same

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.440 
vocals so if the song is all the same
when<00:03:27.350> you<00:03:27.440> build<00:03:27.620> around<00:03:27.709> it<00:03:28.010> will<00:03:28.130> always<00:03:28.450> be

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
when you build around it will always be

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.180 
when you build around it will always be
an<00:03:29.569> appropriation<00:03:30.319> of<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.530> original<00:03:30.920> songs
