00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
from your side deck now you'd think this

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.520 
from your side deck now you'd think this
might<00:02:02.399> be<00:02:02.520> bad<00:02:02.759> because<00:02:03.119> he<00:02:03.780> negates<00:02:04.110> treeborn

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
might be bad because he negates treeborn

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.190 
might be bad because he negates treeborn
frog<00:02:04.670> but<00:02:05.670> it's<00:02:05.820> kind<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.180> same<00:02:06.360> idea<00:02:06.750> with

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
frog but it's kind of the same idea with

frog but it's kind of the same idea with
light<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.649> darkness<00:02:07.860> dragon<00:02:08.399> is<00:02:08.610> where<00:02:08.910> it

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
that they have to find a solution to it

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.619 
that they have to find a solution to it
