lasting<00:02:32.370> longer<00:02:32.700> than<00:02:32.849> December<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.450> think

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:33.689 
lasting longer than December I think

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:35.509 
lasting longer than December I think
after<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.959> December<00:02:34.379> the<00:02:34.950> game<00:02:35.129> is<00:02:35.280> going<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.459> be

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:28.439 
think if amp clan did it if energy

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:31.399

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:14.240 
had quite a bit of fun but i think it
was<00:06:12.690> overshadowed<00:06:12.930> by<00:06:13.500> me<00:06:13.680> raging<00:06:13.950> and

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
was overshadowed by me raging and

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:15.950 
was overshadowed by me raging and
complaining<00:06:14.669> half<00:06:14.789> the<00:06:14.910> time<00:06:15.090> like<00:06:15.270> a<00:06:15.479> lot<00:06:15.840> of

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
complaining half the time like a lot of

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.750 
complaining half the time like a lot of
those<00:06:16.020> gameplays<00:06:16.470> you'll<00:06:16.650> see<00:06:16.860> like<00:06:17.130> that<00:06:17.610> was

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:17.760 
those gameplays you'll see like that was

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.490 
those gameplays you'll see like that was
one<00:06:17.970> game<00:06:18.150> out<00:06:18.210> of<00:06:18.450> a<00:06:18.630> three<00:06:18.870> hours<00:06:19.139> of<00:06:19.169> playing

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500

34<00:06:19.950> hours<00:06:20.100> of<00:06:20.340> playing<00:06:20.550> and<00:06:21.020> i'm<00:06:22.020> not<00:06:22.169> too<00:06:22.320> sure

a<00:06:24.210> new<00:06:24.450> YouTube<00:06:24.810> channel<00:06:24.840> and<00:06:25.229> like<00:06:26.070> I<00:06:26.130> said

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
a new YouTube channel and like I said

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.560 
a new YouTube channel and like I said
I'll<00:06:26.520> we'll<00:06:26.729> see<00:06:26.880> in<00:06:26.940> the<00:06:27.000> next<00:06:27.060> couple<00:06:27.419> of

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.570 
I'll we'll see in the next couple of

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.490 
I'll we'll see in the next couple of
weeks<00:06:27.780> what<00:06:28.590> I<00:06:28.620> decided<00:06:29.070> to<00:06:29.220> do<00:06:29.370> and<00:06:30.500> i'll

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500
