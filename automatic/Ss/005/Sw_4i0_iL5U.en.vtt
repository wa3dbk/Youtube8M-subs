00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
6 3 1 &amp; 2 &amp; a 3 &amp; a 4 and you do that

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.270 
6 3 1 &amp; 2 &amp; a 3 &amp; a 4 and you do that
again<00:03:58.240> for<00:03:58.390> another<00:03:58.570> bar<00:03:58.900> that's<00:03:59.860> actually

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
again for another bar that's actually

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.740 
again for another bar that's actually
kind<00:04:00.460> of<00:04:00.520> what<00:04:00.610> Harry<00:04:00.820> Chapin's<00:04:01.300> doing<00:04:01.600> at

kind of what Harry Chapin's doing at
this<00:04:01.870> point<00:04:02.200> but<00:04:03.190> we<00:04:03.280> could<00:04:03.550> also<00:04:03.790> add<00:04:04.150> in<00:04:04.330> a

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
this point but we could also add in a

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.200 
this point but we could also add in a
little<00:04:04.570> lick<00:04:04.930> that<00:04:05.860> sort<00:04:06.550> of<00:04:06.610> replicates<00:04:07.060> what

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.210 
little lick that sort of replicates what

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:13.590 
little lick that sort of replicates what
the<00:04:07.330> cello<00:04:07.690> does<00:04:08.020> on<00:04:08.200> the<00:04:08.290> record<00:04:12.300> if<00:04:13.300> you<00:04:13.360> want
