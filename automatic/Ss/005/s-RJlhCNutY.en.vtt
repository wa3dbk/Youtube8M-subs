that<00:00:34.200> was<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.350> great<00:00:34.559> stipulation<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.670> was<00:00:36.480> just

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
that was a great stipulation I was just

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.810 
that was a great stipulation I was just
really<00:00:37.050> really<00:00:37.200> bad<00:00:37.500> at<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.920> due<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.670> fact

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
really really bad at it due to the fact

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.970 
really really bad at it due to the fact
that<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.090> don't<00:00:39.510> use<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.110> babyface<00:00:40.469> blaster

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
that I don't use the babyface blaster

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.670 
that I don't use the babyface blaster
I'm<00:00:41.610> not<00:00:41.760> used<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.840> whole<00:00:43.050> lack<00:00:43.410> of

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
I'm not used to it the whole lack of

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.549 
I'm not used to it the whole lack of
speed<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.340> start<00:00:44.670> off<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.120> just<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.570> kills<00:00:46.200> my

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
speed to start off it just it kills my

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.190 
speed to start off it just it kills my
aim<00:00:46.829> for<00:00:46.860> whatever<00:00:47.460> reason<00:00:47.850> I've<00:00:48.030> come<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.110> the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
aim for whatever reason I've come to the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.529 
aim for whatever reason I've come to the
realization<00:00:49.469> that<00:00:49.910> scattergun<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
realization that scattergun is the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.319 
realization that scattergun is the
perfect<00:00:52.199> weapon<00:00:52.440> for<00:00:52.649> me<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.100> used<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.149> I'm

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
perfect weapon for me and used to it I'm

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.900 
perfect weapon for me and used to it I'm
used<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.320> way<00:00:55.440> Scout<00:00:55.770> moves<00:00:56.219> with<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.730> and

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
used to the way Scout moves with it and

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.639 
used to the way Scout moves with it and
just<00:00:57.030> stock<00:00:57.329> scout<00:00:57.690> speed<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.350> everything

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
just stock scout speed and everything

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.189 
just stock scout speed and everything
like<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.340> it<00:01:00.000> did<00:01:00.210> take<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.660> little<00:01:00.899> bit<00:01:01.140> of

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
like that so it did take a little bit of

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.889 
like that so it did take a little bit of
time<00:01:01.469> for<00:01:01.800> me<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.129> actually<00:01:02.340> be<00:01:03.090> able<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.690> hit

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
time for me to actually be able to hit

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.289 
time for me to actually be able to hit
people<00:01:04.170> with<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.589> babyface<00:01:04.979> blaster<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:06.000> get

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
people with the babyface blaster to get

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.969 
people with the babyface blaster to get
that<00:01:06.479> speed<00:01:06.780> boost<00:01:07.049> up<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> first<00:01:07.830> place

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
that speed boost up in the first place

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.850 
that speed boost up in the first place
to<00:01:08.760> try<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.030> then<00:01:09.299> use<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.930> melee<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.530> kill

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
to try to then use the melee to kill

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.030 
to try to then use the melee to kill
people<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:12.270> don't<00:01:12.689> know<00:01:12.869> but<00:01:13.290> for<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.890> most

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
people and I don't know but for the most

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.560 
people and I don't know but for the most
part<00:01:14.159> what<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.460> realized<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.119> did<00:01:15.299> probably

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
part what I realized that I did probably

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.740 
part what I realized that I did probably
do<00:01:16.049> like<00:01:16.310> six<00:01:17.310> or<00:01:17.460> seven<00:01:17.700> different<00:01:18.030> games<00:01:18.479> on

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
do like six or seven different games on

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.620 
do like six or seven different games on
three<00:01:19.619> or<00:01:19.740> four<00:01:19.950> different<00:01:20.220> maps<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.970> every

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
three or four different maps and every

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.410 
three or four different maps and every
single<00:01:21.810> time<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.110> was<00:01:22.380> just<00:01:22.439> getting<00:01:22.830> worked

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
and it's just it's really hard to go up

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.280 
and it's just it's really hard to go up
against<00:01:35.610> people<00:01:36.090> like<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.479> Pyro's<00:01:37.170> are
