Mary at the farmers market and so what I

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:34.310 
Mary at the farmers market and so what I

thought I'd do today is just you know
what<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.770> so<00:00:34.950> important<00:00:35.280> about<00:00:35.340> organic<00:00:35.880> food

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.060 
what is so important about organic food

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.900 
what is so important about organic food
and<00:00:36.270> organic<00:00:36.900> food<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.489> essence

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
and organic food is is that the essence

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.670 
and organic food is is that the essence
is<00:00:39.060> you're<00:00:39.360> only<00:00:39.480> as<00:00:39.750> good<00:00:40.020> as<00:00:40.079> whatever<00:00:40.500> your

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
is you're only as good as whatever your

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.590 
is you're only as good as whatever your
food<00:00:40.860> ate<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.610> it's<00:00:41.850> really<00:00:42.000> about<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.450> dirt

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
food ate so it's really about the dirt

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.630 
food ate so it's really about the dirt
dirts<00:00:42.989> either<00:00:43.260> alive<00:00:43.560> or<00:00:43.620> it's<00:00:44.130> dead<00:00:44.220> and

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
dirts either alive or it's dead and

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.280 
dirts either alive or it's dead and
that's<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.480> difference<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:45.960> brought<00:00:46.079> a

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
on an organic food diet because now

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.370 
on an organic food diet because now
she's<00:01:29.039> getting<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.310> nutrients<00:01:30.079> from<00:01:31.079> so

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
she's getting the nutrients from so

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.899 
she's getting the nutrients from so
that's<00:01:31.560> really<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.950> essence<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.639> the<00:01:32.759> got

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
that's really the essence of it the got

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.449 
that's really the essence of it the got
they<00:01:33.179> look<00:01:33.450> exactly<00:01:33.719> the<00:01:34.289> same<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:35.279> guy's

00:01:35.449 --> 00:01:35.459 
they look exactly the same this guy's

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:36.980 
they look exactly the same this guy's
going<00:01:35.639> to<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:35.819> a<00:01:35.849> higher<00:01:36.029> price<00:01:36.329> tag<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:36.899> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
going to have a higher price tag in the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.269 
going to have a higher price tag in the
grocery<00:01:37.319> store<00:01:37.529> so<00:01:37.560> people<00:01:37.979> are<00:01:38.069> going<00:01:38.189> to

00:01:38.269 --> 00:01:38.279 
grocery store so people are going to

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:40.249 
grocery store so people are going to
walk<00:01:38.369> up<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.670> him<00:01:38.789> and<00:01:38.880> say<00:01:39.060> do<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.689> do<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:40.079> do<00:01:40.200> I

not do it but if you say that the
nutrients<00:01:43.920> are<00:01:44.039> higher<00:01:44.219> what<00:01:44.459> kind<00:01:44.609> of

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:44.669 
nutrients are higher what kind of

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:46.039 
nutrients are higher what kind of
nutrients<00:01:45.179> are<00:01:45.299> we<00:01:45.419> talking<00:01:45.719> about<00:01:45.899> her<00:01:45.990> at

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
nutrients are we talking about her at

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.749 
nutrients are we talking about her at
the<00:01:46.109> vitamin<00:01:46.409> C<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.770> vitamin<00:01:47.099> D<00:01:47.219> what<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.579> it

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
the vitamin C the vitamin D what is it

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.010 
the vitamin C the vitamin D what is it
you<00:01:47.909> know<00:01:48.029> there's<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.450> many<00:01:48.569> different

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
you know there's so many different

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.989 
you know there's so many different
studies<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:49.829> there's<00:01:50.009> different<00:01:50.159> nutrients

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:50.999 
studies so there's different nutrients

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:52.519 
studies so there's different nutrients
and<00:01:51.149> minerals<00:01:51.359> and<00:01:51.779> so<00:01:51.929> forth<00:01:52.169> and<00:01:52.259> again

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:52.529 
and minerals and so forth and again

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:54.679 
and minerals and so forth and again
those<00:01:52.770> minerals<00:01:53.340> only<00:01:53.700> come<00:01:54.029> from<00:01:54.209> what's<00:01:54.479> in

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
those minerals only come from what's in

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.080 
those minerals only come from what's in
the<00:01:54.810> soil<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:55.829> mean<00:01:56.159> when<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.369> was<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.579> kid<00:01:56.669> we

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
the soil so I mean when I was a kid we

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.789 
the soil so I mean when I was a kid we
had<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.240> compost<00:01:57.689> pile<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.139> we<00:01:58.259> took<00:01:58.409> everything

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
had a compost pile so we took everything

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.199 
had a compost pile so we took everything
out<00:01:59.099> of<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.219> back<00:01:59.429> and<00:01:59.459> my<00:01:59.759> grandma<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.119> we

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:00.209 
out of the back and my grandma and we

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:01.969 
out of the back and my grandma and we
had<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.539> topsoil<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.229> our<00:02:01.349> garden<00:02:01.739> that<00:02:01.829> was

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
had the topsoil in our garden that was

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.609 
had the topsoil in our garden that was
so<00:02:02.279> thick<00:02:02.609> and<00:02:02.639> so<00:02:02.819> dark<00:02:03.389> and<00:02:03.599> it<00:02:03.989> was<00:02:04.049> so<00:02:04.319> rich

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
so thick and so dark and it was so rich

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.199 
so thick and so dark and it was so rich
and<00:02:04.770> I<00:02:04.829> mean<00:02:05.009> my<00:02:05.130> grandparents<00:02:05.700> lived<00:02:05.969> till

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
and I mean my grandparents lived till

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:08.660 
and I mean my grandparents lived till
their<00:02:06.450> 90's<00:02:06.929> and<00:02:07.079> we're<00:02:07.739> so<00:02:08.069> healthy<00:02:08.489> so<00:02:08.640> I

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
their 90's and we're so healthy so I

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.400 
their 90's and we're so healthy so I
kind<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.060> had<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.330> model<00:02:09.720> for<00:02:09.930> me<00:02:10.020> when<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.200> was

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
kind of had this model for me when I was

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.680 
kind of had this model for me when I was
young<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.860> yet<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:11.760> remember<00:02:12.240> just<00:02:12.330> taken<00:02:12.600> the

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
young and yet I remember just taken the

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.680 
young and yet I remember just taken the
eggs<00:02:12.870> peels<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.560> everything<00:02:14.340> eggshell

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
eggs peels and everything eggshell

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.630 
eggs peels and everything eggshell
I'm<00:02:16.140> tossing<00:02:16.350> it<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.830> again<00:02:17.220> that's<00:02:17.370> really

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
I'm tossing it and again that's really

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.550 
I'm tossing it and again that's really
what<00:02:17.760> organic<00:02:18.030> farming<00:02:18.450> is<00:02:18.660> about<00:02:18.870> composting

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
what organic farming is about composting

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.110 
what organic farming is about composting
because<00:02:19.950> again<00:02:20.280> it's<00:02:20.400> all<00:02:20.550> that<00:02:20.880> it's<00:02:21.000> the

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
because again it's all that it's the

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.510 
because again it's all that it's the
humans<00:02:21.570> in<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.810> soil<00:02:22.080> so<00:02:22.710> we're<00:02:22.950> only<00:02:23.130> as<00:02:23.400> good

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
humans in the soil so we're only as good

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.590 
humans in the soil so we're only as good
as<00:02:23.580> whatever<00:02:23.910> they<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:24.090> if<00:02:24.300> you<00:02:24.360> have<00:02:24.510> an

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
as whatever they so if you have an

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.720 
as whatever they so if you have an
animal<00:02:25.020> that's<00:02:25.140> eating<00:02:25.470> bad<00:02:25.980> foods<00:02:26.400> right

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
animal that's eating bad foods right

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.760 
animal that's eating bad foods right
then<00:02:27.360> it's<00:02:27.870> going<00:02:27.990> to<00:02:28.050> pass<00:02:28.260> that<00:02:28.470> on<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.680> you

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
then it's going to pass that on to you

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.710 
then it's going to pass that on to you
and<00:02:29.070> then<00:02:29.400> it's<00:02:29.850> if<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.300> don't<00:02:30.450> have<00:02:30.570> any

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
and then it's if you don't have any

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.910 
and then it's if you don't have any
energy<00:02:30.840> from<00:02:31.140> that<00:02:31.170> then<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.500> need<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.650> coffee

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
energy from that then you need a coffee

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.680 
energy from that then you need a coffee
a<00:02:32.100> red<00:02:32.370> bull<00:02:32.610> then<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:33.120> get<00:02:33.360> off<00:02:33.390> on<00:02:33.480> that

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
a red bull then you get off on that

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.970 
a red bull then you get off on that
sugar<00:02:33.960> cycle<00:02:34.320> all<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.560> things<00:02:34.770> that<00:02:34.890> we've

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
sugar cycle all the things that we've

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.350 
sugar cycle all the things that we've
been<00:02:35.070> talking<00:02:35.130> about<00:02:35.550> these<00:02:35.880> past<00:02:36.120> few<00:02:36.300> weeks

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
been talking about these past few weeks

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.660 
been talking about these past few weeks
all<00:02:36.720> start<00:02:37.170> from<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.680> dirt<00:02:37.860> are<00:02:38.250> there<00:02:38.430> some

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
all start from the dirt are there some

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.120 
all start from the dirt are there some
organic<00:02:39.600> foods<00:02:39.990> that<00:02:40.560> are<00:02:40.710> better<00:02:40.980> than

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
organic foods that are better than

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.100 
organic foods that are better than
others<00:02:41.400> when<00:02:42.360> it<00:02:42.480> comes<00:02:42.600> to<00:02:42.720> going<00:02:42.870> organic

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
others when it comes to going organic

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.330 
others when it comes to going organic
like<00:02:43.320> I'm<00:02:43.500> going<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.740> have<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.040> make<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.280> choice

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
Belgium then let's say something from

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.090 
Belgium then let's say something from
Oregon<00:03:09.630> where<00:03:09.750> these<00:03:09.900> apples<00:03:10.290> are<00:03:10.380> from<00:03:10.620> or<00:03:10.860> we

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
Oregon where these apples are from or we

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.740 
Oregon where these apples are from or we

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
this cauliflower so if these are all

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.670 
this cauliflower so if these are all
different<00:03:14.970> companies<00:03:15.510> that<00:03:15.720> certify<00:03:16.200> organic

how their standards are so in Mexico

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:21.830 
how their standards are so in Mexico
