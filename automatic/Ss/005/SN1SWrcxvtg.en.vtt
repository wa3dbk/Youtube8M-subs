 only that instead landlords let's talk 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:58.140

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.920
 more or less there at the turn of the millennium and 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.200
 2000 and 2001 inclusive I remember is 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.930

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.850
 I was afraid of fireworks and I always rocket 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.220
 I was a child that I call looting 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.460
 Captain until that day I filled the bag 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.360
 zhang 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.430

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.189
 did not give another one to that of lan house 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.920
 conquered the people of the whole world I 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.270
 I remember that I met once when 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.000
 was about eight 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.009
 A friend of mine took me to a house there. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.290
 near where he lived that at the back of a 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.820
 I was even scared that I 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.200
 I did not know the place and go somewhere 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.850
 more discussed 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.759
 So I went in there and had enough. 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.340
 computer I was shocked I was 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.860

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.259
 a person who is passionate about games and 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.369
 computers then it fascinated me 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.080

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.850
 functioned network games the games 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.610
 several computers in the same room 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.680
 because at that time I had practiced 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.890
 It was years after I used the internet 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.320

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.630
