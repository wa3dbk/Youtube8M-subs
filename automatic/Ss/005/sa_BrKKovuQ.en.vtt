00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
done now the components of a hard drive

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.120 
done now the components of a hard drive
is<00:01:11.420> basically<00:01:11.900> the<00:01:12.080> platters<00:01:12.650> in<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:12.800> center

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
is basically the platters in the center

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.500 
is basically the platters in the center
top<00:01:13.850> portion<00:01:14.290> and<00:01:15.290> your<00:01:15.530> magnetic<00:01:16.120> armed<00:01:17.120> with

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
top portion and your magnetic armed with

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.109 
top portion and your magnetic armed with
heads<00:01:17.660> on<00:01:17.810> it<00:01:17.960> that<00:01:18.440> reads<00:01:18.800> data<00:01:19.610> off<00:01:19.850> of<00:01:19.880> the

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
heads on it that reads data off of the

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.810 
heads on it that reads data off of the
disk<00:01:20.360> now<00:01:20.860> this<00:01:21.860> entire<00:01:21.979> things<00:01:22.369> inside<00:01:22.640> of<00:01:22.759> a

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
disk now this entire things inside of a

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.740 
disk now this entire things inside of a
metal<00:01:23.240> usually<00:01:23.660> aluminum<00:01:24.080> case<00:01:24.850> so<00:01:25.850> question

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
metal usually aluminum case so question

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.230 
metal usually aluminum case so question
is<00:01:26.840> whether<00:01:27.020> or<00:01:27.080> not<00:01:27.170> around<00:01:28.090> we'll<00:01:29.090> go

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
is whether or not around we'll go

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.550 
is whether or not around we'll go
through<00:01:29.270> and<00:01:29.869> get<00:01:29.960> stuck<00:01:30.170> either<00:01:30.380> on<00:01:30.470> the

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
through and get stuck either on the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.590 
through and get stuck either on the
platters<00:01:30.979> it's<00:01:31.970> definitely<00:01:32.119> gonna<00:01:32.390> cut

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
platters it's definitely gonna cut

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.330 
platters it's definitely gonna cut
through<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:32.900> head<00:01:33.530> but<00:01:33.740> like<00:01:33.800> a<00:01:33.950> stuck<00:01:34.130> on<00:01:34.250> the

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
through the head but like a stuck on the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.460 
through the head but like a stuck on the
case<00:01:34.580> or<00:01:34.970> if<00:01:35.270> you<00:01:35.390> managed<00:01:35.690> to<00:01:35.780> hit<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:36.020> motor

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
case or if you managed to hit the motor

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.560 
case or if you managed to hit the motor
in<00:01:36.650> the<00:01:36.740> middle<00:01:36.979> it<00:01:37.100> moves<00:01:37.310> it<00:01:37.490> whether<00:01:38.360> or<00:01:38.479> not

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
in the middle it moves it whether or not

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.330 
in the middle it moves it whether or not
that<00:01:38.720> will<00:01:38.869> stop<00:01:39.080> it<00:01:39.229> which<00:01:39.350> taking<00:01:39.950> it<00:01:40.040> proper

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
that will stop it which taking it proper

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.530 
that will stop it which taking it proper
well<00:01:40.960> well<00:01:41.960> let's<00:01:42.740> see<00:01:42.830> what<00:01:42.920> happens<00:01:46.540> here

five identical hard drive five identity

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.440 
five identical hard drive five identity
looks<00:01:51.920> good

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:05.200

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
well that look like it much as I did

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.100 
well that look like it much as I did
that<00:02:23.330> looks<00:02:23.480> like<00:02:23.570> it<00:02:23.720> might<00:02:23.750> have<00:02:23.870> almost

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
that looks like it might have almost

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.200 
that looks like it might have almost
been<00:02:24.260> affected<00:02:24.680> I<00:02:25.270> see<00:02:26.270> what<00:02:26.390> happened<00:02:28.210> well

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
been affected I see what happened well

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.970 
been affected I see what happened well
she<00:02:29.840> flipped<00:02:30.080> him<00:02:30.200> over<00:02:31.300> and<00:02:32.300> there<00:02:32.570> she<00:02:32.600> is<00:02:32.980> no
