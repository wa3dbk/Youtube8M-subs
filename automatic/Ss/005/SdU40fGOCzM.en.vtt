00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.680 
we're just going to put it in the bus
here<00:02:53.180> so<00:02:54.180> I'll<00:02:54.300> run<00:02:54.480> on<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:55.190> once<00:02:56.190> we<00:02:56.540> get<00:02:57.540> on

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.050 
here so I'll run on and once we get on
the<00:02:57.840> bus<00:02:58.020> here<00:02:58.260> basically<00:02:59.130> you<00:02:59.460> just<00:02:59.520> look<00:02:59.880> up

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
the bus here basically you just look up

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.730 
the bus here basically you just look up
and<00:03:00.240> it's<00:03:00.330> just<00:03:00.660> right<00:03:01.200> in<00:03:01.320> the<00:03:01.410> ceiling

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
and it's just right in the ceiling

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.470 
and it's just right in the ceiling
sometimes<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.580> prompt<00:03:02.910> won't<00:03:03.060> come<00:03:03.180> up<00:03:03.330> so

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
sometimes the prompt won't come up so

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.600 
sometimes the prompt won't come up so
you<00:03:03.600> might<00:03:03.870> have<00:03:04.050> to<00:03:04.110> jump<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:05.040> little<00:03:05.130> bit<00:03:05.370> here

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
you might have to jump a little bit here

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.180 
you might have to jump a little bit here
like<00:03:06.030> that<00:03:06.210> we'll<00:03:07.110> just<00:03:07.230> hold<00:03:07.380> it<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:07.680> connect

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
like that we'll just hold it and connect

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.270 
like that we'll just hold it and connect
it<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.580> will<00:03:08.700> be<00:03:08.850> part<00:03:09.240> 2<00:03:09.510> of<00:03:09.540> 3<00:03:09.960> so<00:03:10.860> we'll

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
it and that will be part 2 of 3 so we'll

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.680 
it and that will be part 2 of 3 so we'll
go<00:03:11.400> ahead<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.790> head<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.180> next<00:03:12.510> section

here<00:03:22.680> I<00:03:22.830> might<00:03:22.920> as<00:03:23.130> well<00:03:23.220> run<00:03:23.490> through<00:03:23.730> turn

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
here I might as well run through turn

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.650 
here I might as well run through turn

for now I'm just going to kind of come

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.710 
for now I'm just going to kind of come
over<00:03:35.550> here<00:03:35.730> and<00:03:35.820> build<00:03:36.060> it<00:03:36.150> real<00:03:36.360> quick<00:03:36.570> and

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
over here and build it real quick and

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.170 
over here and build it real quick and
I'll<00:03:36.840> just<00:03:36.990> kind<00:03:37.050> of<00:03:37.230> cut<00:03:37.530> to<00:03:38.220> most<00:03:38.940> of<00:03:39.060> the

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
I'll just kind of cut to most of the

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.700 
I'll just kind of cut to most of the
parts<00:03:39.480> just<00:03:39.720> to<00:03:39.840> kind<00:03:40.050> of<00:03:40.110> speed<00:03:40.350> up<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.590> video

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.710 
parts just to kind of speed up the video

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.130 
parts just to kind of speed up the video
a<00:03:40.890> little<00:03:41.190> bit<00:03:41.340> so<00:03:41.660> we'll<00:03:42.660> go<00:03:42.780> ahead<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:42.960> build

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
a little bit so we'll go ahead and build

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.140 
a little bit so we'll go ahead and build
that<00:03:43.380> here's<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.370> next<00:03:44.490> part<00:03:44.640> that's<00:03:45.030> the

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
that here's the next part that's the

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.800 
that here's the next part that's the
switch<00:03:45.890> build<00:03:46.890> that<00:03:47.240> right<00:03:48.240> here<00:03:48.420> is<00:03:48.510> a<00:03:48.540> zombie

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
switch build that right here is a zombie

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.410 
switch build that right here is a zombie
hand<00:03:49.230> that<00:03:49.440> will<00:03:49.560> be<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.770> last<00:03:49.980> part<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.640> once

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
hand that will be the last part and once

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.120 
hand that will be the last part and once
we<00:03:51.600> have<00:03:51.780> that<00:03:51.810> on<00:03:52.080> there<00:03:52.290> we<00:03:52.530> flip<00:03:52.800> the<00:03:52.830> switch

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
we have that on there we flip the switch

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.280 
we have that on there we flip the switch
there's<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.090> power<00:03:54.300> I'm<00:03:54.990> going<00:03:55.080> to<00:03:55.140> go<00:03:55.260> ahead

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
there's the power I'm going to go ahead

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.930 
there's the power I'm going to go ahead
and<00:03:55.530> cut<00:03:55.560> out<00:03:55.830> here<00:03:56.040> because<00:03:56.400> it<00:03:56.520> takes<00:03:56.640> 30

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
and cut out here because it takes 30

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.910 
and cut out here because it takes 30
seconds<00:03:57.300> for<00:03:57.450> this<00:03:57.540> door<00:03:57.750> to<00:03:57.780> open<00:03:57.960> but<00:03:58.650> just

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
seconds for this door to open but just

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.680 
seconds for this door to open but just
so<00:03:58.980> you<00:03:59.100> know<00:03:59.310> you<00:03:59.370> can<00:03:59.550> open<00:04:00.210> that<00:04:00.240> door<00:04:00.510> with

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
so you know you can open that door with

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.300 
so you know you can open that door with
the<00:04:00.780> turbine<00:04:01.140> as<00:04:01.320> well<00:04:01.500> I<00:04:01.710> just<00:04:01.770> didn't<00:04:02.190> want

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
the turbine as well I just didn't want

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.560 
the turbine as well I just didn't want
to<00:04:02.370> do<00:04:02.490> it<00:04:02.640> because<00:04:02.760> I<00:04:03.000> have<00:04:03.030> a<00:04:03.150> runner<00:04:03.390> in

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
to do it because I have a runner in

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:04.850 
to do it because I have a runner in
there<00:04:03.690> with<00:04:03.840> me<00:04:04.020> so<00:04:04.170> it<00:04:04.230> was<00:04:04.320> easier<00:04:04.620> just<00:04:04.650> to

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
there with me so it was easier just to

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.220 
there with me so it was easier just to
wait<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.190> 30<00:04:05.400> seconds<00:04:05.850> but<00:04:06.060> I'll<00:04:06.810> jump<00:04:07.080> out

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
wait the 30 seconds but I'll jump out

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.390 
wait the 30 seconds but I'll jump out
here<00:04:07.470> I'm<00:04:07.590> going<00:04:07.680> to<00:04:07.770> head<00:04:07.890> back<00:04:08.070> towards<00:04:08.370> the

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
here I'm going to head back towards the

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.040 
here I'm going to head back towards the
bus<00:04:08.670> going<00:04:09.510> to<00:04:09.600> have<00:04:09.720> to<00:04:09.810> wait<00:04:09.960> a<00:04:09.990> couple

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
bus going to have to wait a couple

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.020 
bus going to have to wait a couple
seconds<00:04:10.590> for<00:04:10.740> the<00:04:10.800> bus<00:04:10.980> to<00:04:11.010> pull<00:04:11.250> up<00:04:11.430> and<00:04:11.670> head

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
seconds for the bus to pull up and head

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.570 
seconds for the bus to pull up and head
to<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.180> next<00:04:12.450> area<00:04:12.740> I'll<00:04:13.740> right<00:04:13.890> here<00:04:14.160> go

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
to the next area I'll right here go

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.550 
to the next area I'll right here go
through<00:04:14.820> this<00:04:14.910> door<00:04:15.180> this<00:04:15.390> is<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.600> last<00:04:15.810> area

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
through this door this is the last area

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.880 
through this door this is the last area
on<00:04:16.830> the<00:04:16.950> route<00:04:17.100> this<00:04:17.820> is<00:04:17.910> a<00:04:17.940> little<00:04:18.150> town<00:04:18.420> here

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
on the route this is a little town here

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.229 
on the route this is a little town here
or<00:04:19.890> you<00:04:20.070> go<00:04:20.190> through<00:04:20.400> this<00:04:20.489> first<00:04:20.730> building

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
or you go through this first building

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.640 
or you go through this first building
you're<00:04:21.570> kind<00:04:21.750> of<00:04:21.810> forced<00:04:21.989> to<00:04:22.200> go<00:04:22.290> through<00:04:22.530> it

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
you're kind of forced to go through it

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:23.540 
you're kind of forced to go through it
so
