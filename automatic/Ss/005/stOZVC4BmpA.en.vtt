 the hypothesis because I was standing 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.759
 the one for the queen 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.890
 Hi guys, how are you? I'm fine today. 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.480
 I'm here in SÃ£o Paulo and I'm recording a 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.410
 video with these two little things 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.240
 cute here crime and said x 1 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.820

 book excerpts and challenges and tag more 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.070
 I think the tag that the pedro hugo do 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.829
 The moment they invented everything okay that I 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.750
 I'm going to miss everything, it 's a very very fact. 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.760
 likely that will happen here will not 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.700
 have who will win here who goes the most 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.489
 It's a goal from the wheel so it was champion. 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.370
 every year we chose two sentences 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.840
 or excerpts from two books for each 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.489
 so we have two chances of 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:57.449
 do not have four malls in 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:00.600
 four sets and watch the show only show 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.739
 from sucker to this phase goes there the phrase is the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.159
 Following 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.950
 I liked that books were more reliable 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.920
 that people of any 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.750
 ended 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.580
 Oh my god, books were more reliable. 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.900
 than people there 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.100
 nervous after kicking the girl who stole 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:26.100
 books is not new is the ocean at the end of 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:32.400
 No one said that this was a 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:34.500
 little boy bring our body starts to 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.990
 to destroy, to destine, to be fragile 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.400
 transient creatures all that remains of 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.140
 our in our actions 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.140
 good the evil that we do our 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:48.990
 I think I did well 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:52.200

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.759
 want to sack what I most know yet 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.810
 because it also had that phrase so many 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.320
 books 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.320
 they go in the same sentence the same free 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.090
 the first crisis 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.099

 they knew just like some mythical 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:29.189
 modern as the list kaolin and albin and 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:32.939
 dare to think you 've read the revenge of 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:37.139
 Our alliance, what a pity for ethical truth 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:41.549
 in the wave of no hint neither north nor 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:42.810
 I know who'll kick whatever is played on 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.569
 floor 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.819

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.829

 war of thrones nÃ© 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:09.480
 At first he hit the ground because it will be 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.810
 that we have been working to produce the 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.419
 that we do not consume and in exchange for that 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.639
 we consume what is not is not useful and 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:20.430
 we have what we do not use and finally 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:24.299
 we are never satisfied 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:29.459

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.930
 but at the same time very 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.419
 could not be said that our 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.310
 relationship was the work of fate but she 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:41.610
 seemed stronger than anything 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:45.560
