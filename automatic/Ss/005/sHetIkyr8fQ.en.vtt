review<00:00:15.920> coz<00:00:16.920> I've<00:00:17.010> been<00:00:17.130> testing<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:17.520> out<00:00:17.580> for

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
review coz I've been testing it out for

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.279 
review coz I've been testing it out for
a<00:00:18.270> little<00:00:18.480> bit<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:18.779> wanted<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.080> give<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.260> my

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
a little bit and I wanted to give you my

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.150 
a little bit and I wanted to give you my
thoughts<00:00:20.090> so<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.119> believe<00:00:21.600> this<00:00:21.960> replaced<00:00:22.800> the

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
thoughts so I believe this replaced the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.880 
thoughts so I believe this replaced the
old<00:00:23.340> silk<00:00:23.939> cream<00:00:24.500> foundation<00:00:25.500> from<00:00:25.680> Laura

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
old silk cream foundation from Laura

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.560 
old silk cream foundation from Laura
Mercier<00:00:26.189> which<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.460> had<00:00:26.609> never<00:00:26.699> tried<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.300> I

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
Mercier which I had never tried so I

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.240 
Mercier which I had never tried so I
will<00:00:28.109> just<00:00:28.230> preface<00:00:28.529> this<00:00:28.650> by<00:00:28.710> saying<00:00:28.859> I<00:00:29.189> don't

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
will just preface this by saying I don't

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.490 
will just preface this by saying I don't
know<00:00:29.490> what<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.849> performed<00:00:30.510> like<00:00:30.720> all<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.320> know

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
know what that performed like all I know

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.670 
know what that performed like all I know
is<00:00:31.740> how<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:32.040> performs<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:33.530> it's<00:00:34.530> just

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
is how this performs so it's just

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.260 
is how this performs so it's just
launched<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.700> comes<00:00:35.880> in<00:00:36.030> two<00:00:36.239> different

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
launched and it comes in two different

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.000 
launched and it comes in two different
formulations<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.380> there's<00:00:37.559> one<00:00:37.739> that's<00:00:37.890> oil

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
formulations so there's one that's oil

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.310 
formulations so there's one that's oil
free<00:00:38.370> that's<00:00:38.520> better<00:00:38.730> for<00:00:38.790> oily<00:00:39.540> skin<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:40.200> I

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
free that's better for oily skin and I

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.600 
free that's better for oily skin and I
think<00:00:40.500> there's<00:00:40.649> just<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.920> regular<00:00:41.100> silk

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
think there's just the regular silk

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.080 
think there's just the regular silk
cream<00:00:41.820> photo<00:00:42.180> edition<00:00:42.899> foundation<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:44.090> one

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
cream photo edition foundation and one

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.720 
cream photo edition foundation and one
gives<00:00:45.360> like<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.719> more<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.230> matte<00:00:46.440> finish<00:00:46.730> well

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
gives like a more of a matte finish well

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.850 
gives like a more of a matte finish well
free<00:00:47.940> one<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.360> then<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.320> other<00:00:49.500> one<00:00:49.680> gives

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
free one and then the other one gives

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.670 
free one and then the other one gives
kind<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.160> like<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> natural<00:00:51.379> slightly<00:00:52.379> probably

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
kind of like a natural slightly probably

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.990 
kind of like a natural slightly probably
more<00:00:52.829> luminous<00:00:53.100> finish<00:00:53.309> that's<00:00:53.610> better<00:00:53.940> for

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
more luminous finish that's better for

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.799 
more luminous finish that's better for
dry<00:00:54.300> skin<00:00:54.770> so<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:56.219> have<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.760> oil-free<00:00:57.420> one<00:00:57.600> in

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
dry skin so I have the oil-free one in

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.380 
dry skin so I have the oil-free one in
the<00:00:58.289> shade<00:00:58.469> cream<00:00:58.859> ivory<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.879> shades<00:01:00.149> were<00:01:00.359> a

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
the shade cream ivory the shades were a

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.270 
the shade cream ivory the shades were a
little<00:01:00.600> bit<00:01:00.809> hard<00:01:01.050> for<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.980> colors

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
little bit hard for so that the colors

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.719 
little bit hard for so that the colors
have<00:01:02.399> definitely<00:01:02.699> changed<00:01:03.860> versus<00:01:04.860> like<00:01:05.580> I

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
have definitely changed versus like I

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.149 
have definitely changed versus like I
have<00:01:06.330> used<00:01:06.659> other<00:01:07.080> foundation<00:01:07.799> colors<00:01:08.040> from

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
have used other foundation colors from

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.039 
have used other foundation colors from
her<00:01:08.280> before<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:09.119> wasn't<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.540> same<00:01:09.750> shade

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
her before and I wasn't the same shade

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.410 
her before and I wasn't the same shade
in<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.950> one<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.340> think<00:01:11.430> colors<00:01:11.939> changed<00:01:12.330> a

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
in this one so I think colors changed a

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.260 
in this one so I think colors changed a
little<00:01:12.630> bit<00:01:13.100> so<00:01:14.100> I'm<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.430> shade<00:01:14.610> cream<00:01:14.970> ivory

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
little bit so I'm the shade cream ivory

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.530 
little bit so I'm the shade cream ivory
which<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.840> feel<00:01:15.990> was<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.170> good<00:01:16.380> fit<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.729> am

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
within the first day or two you just

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.969 
within the first day or two you just
know<00:01:54.479> kind<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.869> how<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.140> wears<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.770> how<00:01:55.860> you're

gonna<00:01:56.070> like<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.399> but<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.579> wanted<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.880> give<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.030> a

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
gonna like it but I wanted to give it a

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.719 
gonna like it but I wanted to give it a
few<00:01:57.360> days<00:01:57.509> because<00:01:58.380> sometimes<00:01:58.680> my<00:01:58.829> skin<00:01:59.130> can

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
few days because sometimes my skin can

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.069 
few days because sometimes my skin can
change<00:02:00.210> from<00:02:00.390> day<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.630> day<00:02:01.369> so<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.759> is

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
change from day to day so it is

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.620 
change from day to day so it is
definitely<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:04.860> I've<00:02:05.430> had<00:02:06.030> some<00:02:06.060> growing

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
definitely so I've had some growing

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.650 
definitely so I've had some growing
pains<00:02:06.750> with<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.560> I'm<00:02:08.099> glad<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:09.179> did

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
pains with it and I'm glad that I did

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.580 
pains with it and I'm glad that I did
because<00:02:09.929> then<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.319> was

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
because then I was

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.380 
because then I was
able<00:02:10.769> to<00:02:10.920> really<00:02:11.519> figure<00:02:11.700> out<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.000> best<00:02:12.180> way

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
able to really figure out the best way

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.600 
able to really figure out the best way
to<00:02:12.420> use<00:02:12.629> it<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:12.989> then<00:02:13.140> get<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.860> best<00:02:14.099> results

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
to use it and then get the best results

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.759 
to use it and then get the best results
which<00:02:15.569> I<00:02:15.780> really<00:02:16.019> got<00:02:16.140> some<00:02:16.290> fantastic

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
which I really got some fantastic

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.830 
which I really got some fantastic
results<00:02:16.890> so<00:02:17.250> initially<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:18.090> cannot<00:02:18.420> squeeze

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
results so initially I cannot squeeze

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.520 
results so initially I cannot squeeze
something<00:02:19.110> out<00:02:19.230> into<00:02:19.769> like<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:19.950> little<00:02:21.530> you

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
something out into like a little you

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.380 
something out into like a little you
know<00:02:22.560> tissue<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.489> I<00:02:23.550> take<00:02:23.730> my<00:02:23.879> buffing<00:02:24.300> brush

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.259 
and I just kind of like dabbing it on my
skin<00:02:26.129> and<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:26.400> just<00:02:26.550> kind<00:02:26.670> of<00:02:26.700> buff<00:02:26.879> it<00:02:27.030> around

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
skin and I just kind of buff it around

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.080 
skin and I just kind of buff it around
it<00:02:28.260> was<00:02:28.379> way<00:02:28.470> too<00:02:28.500> much<00:02:28.680> coverage<00:02:28.920> this<00:02:29.670> stuff

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
it was way too much coverage this stuff

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.539 
it was way too much coverage this stuff
you<00:02:30.510> will<00:02:30.540> need<00:02:30.810> only<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:31.260> little<00:02:32.010> lit<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.250> little

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
you will need only a little lit a little

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.940 
you will need only a little lit a little
bit<00:02:32.780> I<00:02:33.780> was<00:02:34.140> just<00:02:34.319> kind<00:02:34.470> of<00:02:34.500> like<00:02:34.590> dotting

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
bit I was just kind of like dotting

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.070 
bit I was just kind of like dotting
around<00:02:35.160> my<00:02:35.250> skin<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:36.209> just<00:02:36.480> kind<00:02:36.690> of<00:02:36.720> blending

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
around my skin and just kind of blending

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.990 
around my skin and just kind of blending
it<00:02:37.170> out<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:37.500> really<00:02:37.830> didn't<00:02:38.040> kind<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.430> know<00:02:38.790> how

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
it out I really didn't kind of know how

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.910 
it out I really didn't kind of know how
much<00:02:39.150> coverage<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.660> had<00:02:39.989> but<00:02:40.290> it<00:02:40.410> has<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.560> lot<00:02:40.830> of

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
much coverage it had but it has a lot of

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.759 
much coverage it had but it has a lot of
coverage<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:42.030> I<00:02:42.330> just<00:02:42.780> scrapped<00:02:43.200> that<00:02:43.230> whole

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
coverage so I just scrapped that whole

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.069 
coverage so I just scrapped that whole
application<00:02:44.099> process<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:45.540> squeezed<00:02:46.049> it

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
application process and I squeezed it

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.990 
application process and I squeezed it
onto<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.500> tissue<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:46.950> now<00:02:47.099> I<00:02:47.130> just<00:02:47.250> take<00:02:47.700> my

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
onto a tissue and now I just take my

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.120 
onto a tissue and now I just take my
brush<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:48.329> just<00:02:48.599> kind<00:02:48.780> of<00:02:48.870> literally<00:02:49.319> dab<00:02:49.890> it

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
brush and just kind of literally dab it

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.580 
brush and just kind of literally dab it
in<00:02:50.400> just<00:02:50.910> a<00:02:51.000> smallest<00:02:51.510> amount<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.049> it<00:02:52.440> can

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
in just a smallest amount and it can

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.150 
in just a smallest amount and it can
cover<00:02:52.829> a<00:02:53.069> good<00:02:53.310> portion<00:02:53.549> of<00:02:53.760> my<00:02:53.819> face<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:55.160> so

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
cover a good portion of my face and so

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.220 
cover a good portion of my face and so
that<00:02:56.310> was<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.459> first<00:02:56.760> kind<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.269> thing<00:02:57.569> that<00:02:58.049> I

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
that was the first kind of thing that I

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.660 
that was the first kind of thing that I
discovered<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.829> once<00:02:59.010> I<00:02:59.099> started<00:02:59.340> doing<00:02:59.400> that

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
discovered and once I started doing that

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.030 
discovered and once I started doing that
it<00:02:59.940> is<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:00.420> gorgeous<00:03:01.079> flawless<00:03:01.530> finish

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.400 
it does give a natural matte finish
which<00:03:04.349> I<00:03:04.500> like<00:03:04.739> not<00:03:05.310> too<00:03:05.910> powdered<00:03:06.569> I<00:03:06.840> am

three<00:03:24.569> o'clock<00:03:25.310> um<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.700> second<00:03:27.030> day<00:03:27.120> I<00:03:27.150> wore

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
three o'clock um the second day I wore

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.809 
three o'clock um the second day I wore
it<00:03:27.599> I<00:03:27.690> used<00:03:27.870> less<00:03:28.139> I<00:03:28.380> didn't<00:03:28.680> get<00:03:28.799> as<00:03:28.920> shiny<00:03:29.190> in

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:29.819 
it I used less I didn't get as shiny in

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.550 
it I used less I didn't get as shiny in
the<00:03:29.910> third<00:03:30.090> day<00:03:30.269> I<00:03:30.510> got<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:30.900> little<00:03:31.139> shinier<00:03:31.440> at

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
the third day I got a little shinier at

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.720 
the third day I got a little shinier at
three<00:03:31.739> or<00:03:31.829> four<00:03:31.980> o'clock<00:03:32.160> which<00:03:32.459> is<00:03:32.489> fine

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
three or four o'clock which is fine

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:33.890 
three or four o'clock which is fine
because<00:03:32.880> I<00:03:33.060> just<00:03:33.239> used<00:03:33.389> a<00:03:33.450> little<00:03:33.599> bit<00:03:33.720> powder

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
because I just used a little bit powder

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.629 
because I just used a little bit powder
to<00:03:34.049> touch-up<00:03:34.380> no<00:03:34.560> big<00:03:34.709> deal<00:03:34.889> but<00:03:35.190> I<00:03:35.220> didn't<00:03:35.519> use

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
to touch-up no big deal but I didn't use

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.849 
to touch-up no big deal but I didn't use
powder<00:03:35.849> to<00:03:36.000> set<00:03:36.180> it<00:03:36.329> so<00:03:36.510> I<00:03:36.540> should<00:03:36.810> say<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.440> in

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
powder to set it so I should say that in

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.309 
powder to set it so I should say that in
that<00:03:38.760> morning's<00:03:39.450> that<00:03:39.540> I<00:03:39.660> used<00:03:39.870> it<00:03:40.019> I<00:03:40.079> didn't

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
that morning's that I used it I didn't

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.770 
that morning's that I used it I didn't
use<00:03:40.410> any<00:03:40.560> powder<00:03:40.829> to<00:03:41.010> set<00:03:41.160> it<00:03:41.310> and<00:03:42.239> it<00:03:43.519> oxidizes

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
use any powder to set it and it oxidizes

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.970 
use any powder to set it and it oxidizes
just<00:03:45.780> a<00:03:46.380> little<00:03:47.370> bit<00:03:47.519> like<00:03:47.959> enough<00:03:48.959> where<00:03:49.560> I

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
just a little bit like enough where I

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.720 
just a little bit like enough where I
look<00:03:50.400> healthy<00:03:51.290> rather<00:03:52.290> than<00:03:52.769> it's<00:03:53.160> too<00:03:53.459> dark

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
look healthy rather than it's too dark

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.059 
look healthy rather than it's too dark
so<00:03:54.060> I<00:03:54.989> was<00:03:55.139> kind<00:03:55.380> of<00:03:55.440> you<00:03:55.680> know<00:03:55.709> that's<00:03:55.859> always

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
so I was kind of you know that's always

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.589 
so I was kind of you know that's always
my<00:03:56.220> concerns<00:03:56.609> my<00:03:56.849> foundations<00:03:57.329> tend<00:03:57.540> to

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
my concerns my foundations tend to

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.089 
my concerns my foundations tend to
oxidize<00:03:57.750> and<00:03:58.230> I'll<00:03:58.290> get<00:03:58.410> like<00:03:58.560> a<00:03:58.590> darker<00:03:58.919> face

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
oxidize and I'll get like a darker face

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.300 
oxidize and I'll get like a darker face
than<00:03:59.400> my<00:03:59.549> neck<00:03:59.760> but<00:04:00.540> this<00:04:00.840> definitely<00:04:01.349> oxidize

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
than my neck but this definitely oxidize

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.250 
than my neck but this definitely oxidize
just<00:04:02.730> a<00:04:02.910> small<00:04:03.299> amount<00:04:03.569> to<00:04:03.750> the<00:04:03.900> point<00:04:04.109> where<00:04:04.230> I

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
just a small amount to the point where I

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.080 
just a small amount to the point where I
just<00:04:04.290> looked<00:04:04.590> healthy<00:04:04.889> like<00:04:05.220> it<00:04:05.340> looked<00:04:05.549> you

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
just looked healthy like it looked you

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.629 
just looked healthy like it looked you
know<00:04:06.209> fresh<00:04:06.540> and<00:04:06.959> healthy<00:04:07.340> rather<00:04:08.340> than

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
know fresh and healthy rather than

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.819 
know fresh and healthy rather than
oxidize<00:04:09.090> to<00:04:09.120> home<00:04:09.450> darker<00:04:10.139> color<00:04:10.349> I<00:04:10.620> did<00:04:11.430> find

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
oxidize to home darker color I did find

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.400 
oxidize to home darker color I did find
it<00:04:13.829> didn't<00:04:14.459> pull<00:04:14.639> on<00:04:14.940> dry<00:04:15.150> patches<00:04:15.419> only<00:04:16.260> if<00:04:16.349> I

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
it didn't pull on dry patches only if I

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.190 
it didn't pull on dry patches only if I
had<00:04:16.590> a<00:04:16.620> really<00:04:16.829> significant<00:04:17.519> dry<00:04:17.700> patch

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
had a really significant dry patch

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.900 
had a really significant dry patch
I<00:04:18.230> had<00:04:18.350> a<00:04:18.380> really<00:04:18.770> bad<00:04:18.890> dry<00:04:19.100> patch<00:04:19.370> I<00:04:19.640> would

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
I had a really bad dry patch I would

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:20.830 
I had a really bad dry patch I would
kind<00:04:20.090> of<00:04:20.120> have<00:04:20.240> to<00:04:20.330> put<00:04:20.420> a<00:04:20.450> little<00:04:20.540> bit<00:04:20.630> more

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
kind of have to put a little bit more

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.140 
kind of have to put a little bit more
moisture<00:04:21.110> on<00:04:21.350> eyes<00:04:21.740> are<00:04:21.980> on<00:04:22.100> that<00:04:22.280> and<00:04:22.520> kind<00:04:23.030> of

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
moisture on eyes are on that and kind of

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.420 
moisture on eyes are on that and kind of
blend<00:04:23.390> it<00:04:23.540> out<00:04:23.690> but<00:04:24.470> it<00:04:24.710> really<00:04:24.920> kind<00:04:25.130> of<00:04:25.220> just

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
blend it out but it really kind of just

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.700 
blend it out but it really kind of just
glides<00:04:25.760> right<00:04:26.060> on<00:04:26.120> I<00:04:26.570> don't<00:04:26.960> use<00:04:27.080> my<00:04:27.230> fingers<00:04:27.560> I

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
really need to touch up not that I ever

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.680 
really need to touch up not that I ever
touch<00:04:52.670> up<00:04:52.820> my<00:04:52.850> foundations<00:04:53.390> because<00:04:53.600> that

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
touch up my foundations because that

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.600 
touch up my foundations because that
would<00:04:53.780> just<00:04:53.810> be<00:04:54.050> like<00:04:54.170> way<00:04:54.440> too<00:04:54.500> much<00:04:54.740> but

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610

using<00:05:07.340> it<00:05:07.460> pretty<00:05:07.700> much<00:05:07.790> every<00:05:08.060> day<00:05:08.180> since<00:05:08.420> I

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
using it pretty much every day since I

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.590 
using it pretty much every day since I
started<00:05:08.960> trying<00:05:09.290> it<00:05:09.500> because<00:05:09.770> I<00:05:09.920> just<00:05:10.600> going

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
started trying it because I just going

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.630 
started trying it because I just going
into<00:05:11.840> summer<00:05:12.110> now<00:05:12.350> though<00:05:12.590> I'd<00:05:12.830> be<00:05:12.980> curious<00:05:13.340> to

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
into summer now though I'd be curious to

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.190 
into summer now though I'd be curious to
see<00:05:13.670> how<00:05:14.000> it<00:05:14.150> wears<00:05:14.330> in<00:05:14.660> the<00:05:14.750> summer<00:05:14.960> so<00:05:15.170> I

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
see how it wears in the summer so I

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.990 
see how it wears in the summer so I
definitely<00:05:15.380> will<00:05:15.620> keep<00:05:15.770> you<00:05:15.860> posted<00:05:16.250> and<00:05:16.460> if

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
definitely will keep you posted and if

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.540 
definitely will keep you posted and if
it<00:05:17.150> gets<00:05:17.360> too<00:05:17.990> oily<00:05:18.260> or<00:05:18.470> it<00:05:18.800> kind<00:05:19.010> of<00:05:19.070> separates

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
it gets too oily or it kind of separates

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.150 
it gets too oily or it kind of separates
in<00:05:19.700> the<00:05:19.790> summer<00:05:20.000> I<00:05:20.210> don't<00:05:20.270> think<00:05:20.720> that<00:05:20.840> it<00:05:20.960> will

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
in the summer I don't think that it will

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.380 
in the summer I don't think that it will
but<00:05:22.160> this<00:05:22.280> may<00:05:22.430> be<00:05:22.490> a<00:05:22.580> little<00:05:22.880> more<00:05:23.030> coverage

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
but this may be a little more coverage

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.850 
but this may be a little more coverage
than<00:05:23.420> I<00:05:23.600> want<00:05:23.840> the<00:05:23.990> summer<00:05:24.200> I<00:05:24.290> may<00:05:24.650> just<00:05:24.770> have

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
than I want the summer I may just have

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.230 
than I want the summer I may just have
to<00:05:24.920> sheer<00:05:25.340> it<00:05:25.430> out<00:05:25.490> with<00:05:25.640> a<00:05:25.700> Beauty<00:05:25.940> Blender

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
to sheer it out with a Beauty Blender

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.820

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
but right now this time of year and for

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.810 
but right now this time of year and for
winter<00:05:28.040> it<00:05:28.970> is<00:05:29.180> just<00:05:29.510> it's<00:05:29.930> like<00:05:30.020> flawless<00:05:30.820> and

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
winter it is just it's like flawless and

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.330 
winter it is just it's like flawless and
things<00:05:32.750> blend<00:05:32.990> so<00:05:33.200> well<00:05:33.320> on<00:05:33.500> it<00:05:33.650> on<00:05:33.800> top<00:05:34.040> of<00:05:34.220> it

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
things blend so well on it on top of it

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.190 
things blend so well on it on top of it
like<00:05:34.550> you<00:05:34.910> know<00:05:35.000> blush<00:05:35.360> and<00:05:35.690> powder<00:05:35.720> and

whatnot<00:05:36.470> just<00:05:36.710> kind<00:05:36.890> of<00:05:36.920> glide<00:05:37.370> right<00:05:37.610> on<00:05:37.670> so<00:05:38.660> I

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
whatnot just kind of glide right on so I

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.810 
whatnot just kind of glide right on so I
highly<00:05:39.200> recommend<00:05:39.230> it<00:05:39.770> if<00:05:40.400> you<00:05:40.550> have<00:05:40.610> white

highly recommend it if you have white
skin<00:05:41.030> definitely<00:05:41.360> check<00:05:41.780> out<00:05:41.900> the<00:05:42.020> oil<00:05:42.170> free

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560
