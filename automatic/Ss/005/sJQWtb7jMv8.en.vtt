00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
didn't happen but we still had our

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.280 
didn't happen but we still had our
chances<00:01:44.820> as<00:01:44.939> well<00:01:45.090> Fellaini<00:01:45.750> had<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.020> chance

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290

thought<00:01:48.479> has<00:01:48.600> been<00:01:48.630> poor<00:01:49.079> against<00:01:49.409> Chelsea<00:01:49.829> on

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
thought has been poor against Chelsea on

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.190 
thought has been poor against Chelsea on
city<00:01:50.250> maybe<00:01:51.060> it's<00:01:51.299> with<00:01:51.420> them<00:01:51.540> doubling<00:01:51.930> up<00:01:52.049> on

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
city maybe it's with them doubling up on

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.649 
city maybe it's with them doubling up on
him<00:01:52.380> but<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.159> feel<00:01:53.460> his<00:01:53.820> corners<00:01:54.299> were<00:01:54.420> poor

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
him but I feel his corners were poor

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.149 
him but I feel his corners were poor
today<00:01:54.810> kept<00:01:55.170> hitting<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.530> first<00:01:55.710> man<00:01:56.009> it's

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.580 
today kept hitting the first man it's
like<00:01:56.340> how<00:01:56.850> our<00:01:57.329> corner<00:01:57.780> kick<00:01:57.930> takes<00:01:58.170> have<00:01:58.409> been

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
like how our corner kick takes have been

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.530 
like how our corner kick takes have been
all<00:01:58.829> for<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.490> last<00:01:59.610> three<00:01:59.909> four<00:02:00.090> years<00:02:00.149> just

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
all for the last three four years just

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.910

hitting<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.810> first<00:02:01.110> man<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.439> was<00:02:01.619> like<00:02:01.770> that

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
hitting the first man it was like that

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.249 
hitting the first man it was like that
all<00:02:01.950> over<00:02:02.070> again<00:02:02.630> so<00:02:03.630> he<00:02:03.750> was<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.930> little<00:02:04.140> bit

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
all over again so he was a little bit

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.109 
all over again so he was a little bit
poorer<00:02:04.530> today<00:02:04.860> Fellaini<00:02:05.460> was<00:02:05.700> probably<00:02:05.969> my

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
poorer today Fellaini was probably my

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.520 
poorer today Fellaini was probably my
man<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.509> match<00:02:06.630> alongside<00:02:07.049> we<00:02:07.350> Wayne

then can be happy with that but as I

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.690 
then can be happy with that but as I
said<00:02:41.640> this<00:02:41.880> is<00:02:41.940> why<00:02:42.150> we<00:02:42.330> won't<00:02:42.510> win<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.720> league
