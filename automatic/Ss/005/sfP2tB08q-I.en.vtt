00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
this is my 50th year on aviation I did

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.220 
this is my 50th year on aviation I did
in<00:00:14.990> 1917<00:00:15.950> in<00:00:16.820> those<00:00:17.060> days<00:00:17.330> the<00:00:17.600> aeroplane<00:00:17.930> was

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
in 1917 in those days the aeroplane was

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.380 
in 1917 in those days the aeroplane was
very<00:00:18.440> simple<00:00:18.920> there<00:00:19.640> was<00:00:19.730> a<00:00:19.760> stick<00:00:20.029> and<00:00:20.210> wire

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
very simple there was a stick and wire

somebody<00:00:24.260> had<00:00:24.380> drawn<00:00:24.619> a<00:00:24.650> picture<00:00:25.070> of<00:00:25.189> a

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
somebody had drawn a picture of a

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:26.740 
somebody had drawn a picture of a
modern-day<00:00:25.610> airplane<00:00:26.240> we<00:00:26.480> would<00:00:26.660> have

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
modern-day airplane we would have

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.200 
modern-day airplane we would have
thought<00:00:26.869> him<00:00:27.080> slightly<00:00:27.380> mad<00:00:27.800> that's<00:00:28.789> the<00:00:29.000> best

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.880 
thought him slightly mad that's the best
way<00:00:29.420> to<00:00:29.449> explain<00:00:29.990> what's<00:00:30.410> happened<00:00:30.800> in

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
way to explain what's happened in

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.220 
way to explain what's happened in
aviation<00:00:31.490> is<00:00:31.609> to<00:00:31.760> say<00:00:31.940> that<00:00:32.239> in<00:00:32.660> those<00:00:32.960> days

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
force is due to a reduction in the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.109 
force is due to a reduction in the
purchasing<00:01:24.560> power<00:01:24.770> of<00:01:24.829> the<00:01:24.950> dollar<00:01:25.039> but<00:01:25.820> most

purchasing power of the dollar but most
of<00:01:26.270> it<00:01:26.420> is<00:01:26.719> due<00:01:27.020> to<00:01:27.259> the<00:01:27.380> things<00:01:27.619> have<00:01:27.829> been<00:01:27.979> put
