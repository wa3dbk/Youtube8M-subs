game<00:03:45.840> heading<00:03:46.230> to<00:03:46.319> the<00:03:46.409> second<00:03:46.680> half<00:03:46.859> he

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
game heading to the second half he

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.679 
game heading to the second half he
missed<00:03:47.579> a<00:03:47.639> wide-open<00:03:47.819> three<00:03:48.299> I<00:03:48.420> thought<00:03:48.629> it

missed a wide-open three I thought it

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:50.000 
missed a wide-open three I thought it
was<00:03:48.810> good<00:03:48.930> luck<00:03:49.109> I<00:03:49.319> think<00:03:49.709> he<00:03:49.769> should<00:03:49.920> have

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
was good luck I think he should have

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.339 
was good luck I think he should have
made<00:03:50.129> it<00:03:50.629> regardless<00:03:51.629> of<00:03:51.840> that<00:03:51.870> missed<00:03:52.260> shot
