of acids

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.430 
of acids
with<00:00:04.080> metals<00:00:05.480> now<00:00:06.480> hopefully<00:00:06.660> none<00:00:07.109> of<00:00:07.259> this

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
with metals now hopefully none of this

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.459 
with metals now hopefully none of this

specific<00:00:18.570> formula<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.949> reactions<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.490> metals

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
specific formula the reactions of metals

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.410 
specific formula the reactions of metals
with<00:00:21.060> acids<00:00:21.590> relating<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.039> acid<00:00:23.430> used<00:00:26.420> so

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
with acids relating to the acid used so

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.529 
with acids relating to the acid used so
first<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.500> all<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:29.369> general<00:00:29.970> equation<00:00:30.510> for

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
first of all the general equation for

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.510 
first of all the general equation for
when<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:30.960> add<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.500> metal<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.099> an<00:00:32.219> acid

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
when you add a metal to an acid

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.069 
when you add a metal to an acid
regardless<00:00:35.520> of<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.790> metal<00:00:36.120> or<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.360> acid<00:00:36.719> used

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
regardless of the metal or the acid used

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:45.200 
regardless of the metal or the acid used
the<00:00:37.950> products<00:00:38.550> are<00:00:39.020> salt<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.940> hydrogen<00:00:44.210> now

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
the products are salt and hydrogen now

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.860 
the products are salt and hydrogen now
in<00:00:45.360> chemistry<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.289> salt<00:00:47.149> refers<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.180> any

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
in chemistry a salt refers to any

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.299 
in chemistry a salt refers to any
compound<00:00:50.000> where<00:00:51.000> metal<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.840> joined<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:53.280> a

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
compound where metal is joined to a

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.229 
compound where metal is joined to a
nonmetal<00:00:54.180> element<00:00:55.430> so<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:56.489> covers<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> huge

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
nonmetal element so this covers a huge

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.130 
nonmetal element so this covers a huge
range<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:58.260> different<00:00:58.590> chemicals<00:00:59.690> so<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.719> salt

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
range of different chemicals so a salt

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.520 
range of different chemicals so a salt
is<00:01:01.350> not<00:01:01.920> just<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.120> stuff<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.840> put<00:01:03.870> on<00:01:04.290> your

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
is not just the stuff you put on your

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.789 
is not just the stuff you put on your
chips<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.549> just<00:01:05.760> one<00:01:06.150> example<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.990> a

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
chips that is just one example of a

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.920 
chips that is just one example of a
range<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.610> different<00:01:08.820> compounds<00:01:11.780> so<00:01:12.780> what

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
range of different compounds so what

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.660 
range of different compounds so what
does<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.170> mean<00:01:13.710> with<00:01:14.189> real<00:01:14.400> chemicals<00:01:16.670> well

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
does that mean with real chemicals well

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.450 
does that mean with real chemicals well
he<00:01:17.850> has<00:01:17.939> three<00:01:18.299> examples<00:01:19.040> so<00:01:20.040> we're<00:01:20.159> acting

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
he has three examples so we're acting

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.330 
he has three examples so we're acting
three<00:01:20.729> different<00:01:21.060> types<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.540> metal<00:01:21.979> with<00:01:22.979> just

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
three different types of metal with just

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.320 
three different types of metal with just
an<00:01:23.880> acid<00:01:24.979> our<00:01:25.979> first<00:01:26.220> one<00:01:26.430> if<00:01:26.970> we<00:01:27.119> react

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
an acid our first one if we react

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.749 
an acid our first one if we react
magnesium<00:01:27.960> with<00:01:28.110> an<00:01:28.229> acid<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:29.400> get<00:01:29.610> what's

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
magnesium with an acid you get what's

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.420 
magnesium with an acid you get what's
called<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:30.000> magnesium<00:01:30.329> salt<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.979> magnesium

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
called a magnesium salt so the magnesium

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.039 
called a magnesium salt so the magnesium
the<00:01:33.030> metal<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:34.049> joined<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.540> something<00:01:36.540> else

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
the metal is joined to something else

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.649 
the metal is joined to something else
which<00:01:37.170> would<00:01:37.320> be<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.470> nonmetal<00:01:38.119> then<00:01:39.119> we<00:01:39.360> get<00:01:39.509> an

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
which would be a nonmetal then we get an

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.289 
which would be a nonmetal then we get an
magnesium<00:01:40.470> salt<00:01:42.950> you'll<00:01:43.950> notice<00:01:44.310> hydrogen

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
magnesium salt you'll notice hydrogen

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.560 
magnesium salt you'll notice hydrogen
gas<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.960> also<00:01:46.470> produced<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.060> produced<00:01:48.420> in

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
gas is also produced this is produced in

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.380 
gas is also produced this is produced in
any<00:01:48.810> reaction<00:01:49.409> where<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.770> metal<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.460> reacted

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
any reaction where a metal is reacted

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.639 
any reaction where a metal is reacted
with<00:01:51.420> an<00:01:51.810> acid<00:01:53.630> regardless<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.840> which<00:01:55.409> metal

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
with an acid regardless of which metal

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.560 
with an acid regardless of which metal
is<00:01:55.920> or<00:01:56.340> which<00:01:57.000> acid<00:01:57.689> is

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
is or which acid is

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.380 
is or which acid is
second<00:02:00.570> one<00:02:00.720> I've<00:02:00.930> just<00:02:01.400> put<00:02:02.400> in<00:02:02.520> zinc<00:02:02.880> instead

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
second one I've just put in zinc instead

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.680 
second one I've just put in zinc instead
of<00:02:03.480> magnesium<00:02:04.080> so<00:02:04.440> you<00:02:04.500> get<00:02:04.650> zinc<00:02:04.950> plus<00:02:05.130> acid

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
of magnesium so you get zinc plus acid

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.520 
of magnesium so you get zinc plus acid
mix<00:02:06.690> the<00:02:07.230> zinc<00:02:07.560> salt<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.729> hydrogen<00:02:09.240> and<00:02:09.530> the

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
mix the zinc salt and hydrogen and the

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.390 
mix the zinc salt and hydrogen and the
third<00:02:10.770> one<00:02:11.070> just<00:02:11.760> follows<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.210> same<00:02:12.420> trend

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
third one just follows the same trend

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.090 
third one just follows the same trend
aluminium<00:02:14.400> plus<00:02:14.640> acid<00:02:15.080> makes<00:02:16.080> unmeaning<00:02:16.620> salt

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
aluminium plus acid makes unmeaning salt

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:25.670 
aluminium plus acid makes unmeaning salt
and<00:02:17.540> hydrogen<00:02:21.470> so<00:02:23.720> he<00:02:24.720> has<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:25.110> higher<00:02:25.290> level

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
and hydrogen so he has the higher level

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.640 
and hydrogen so he has the higher level
stuff

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.100 

you<00:02:32.250> should<00:02:32.489> be<00:02:32.610> able<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.909> protect<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.780> name

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
you should be able to protect the name

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.330 
you should be able to protect the name
of<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:35.159> salt<00:02:35.459> if<00:02:36.150> you<00:02:36.840> know<00:02:37.140> which<00:02:37.650> methyl<00:02:38.190> on

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
of the salt if you know which methyl on

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.440 
of the salt if you know which methyl on
which<00:02:38.519> acid<00:02:39.120> are<00:02:39.330> used<00:02:40.730> now<00:02:41.730> how<00:02:41.970> do<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.269> know

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
which acid are used now how do you know

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:49.180 
which acid are used now how do you know
this<00:02:44.569> while<00:02:45.569> specific<00:02:45.810> acids<00:02:47.299> make<00:02:48.299> specific

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
this while specific acids make specific

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.740 
this while specific acids make specific
salts<00:02:51.230> so<00:02:52.230> if<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.440> use<00:02:52.970> hydrochloric<00:02:53.970> acid

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
salts so if you use hydrochloric acid

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.680 
salts so if you use hydrochloric acid
you<00:02:55.470> will<00:02:55.590> get<00:02:55.790> chlorides<00:02:56.959> formed<00:02:59.299> if<00:03:00.299> you<00:03:00.510> use

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
you will get chlorides formed if you use

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.849 
you will get chlorides formed if you use
sulfuric<00:03:01.440> acid<00:03:01.950> you<00:03:03.140> get<00:03:04.140> sulfates<00:03:04.980> formed

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
sulfuric acid you get sulfates formed

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.680 
sulfuric acid you get sulfates formed
let's<00:03:07.859> see<00:03:08.040> how<00:03:08.340> many<00:03:08.519> people<00:03:08.700> know<00:03:09.000> what<00:03:09.480> you

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
let's see how many people know what you

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.479 
let's see how many people know what you
get<00:03:09.959> if<00:03:10.140> you<00:03:10.260> use<00:03:10.290> nitric<00:03:11.040> acids<00:03:11.459> I<00:03:13.220> can<00:03:14.220> quite

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
get if you use nitric acids I can quite

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.180 
get if you use nitric acids I can quite
a<00:03:14.519> few<00:03:14.940> of<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:15.359> will<00:03:15.569> have<00:03:15.720> guessed<00:03:16.069> that<00:03:17.069> you

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
a few of you will have guessed that you

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.699 
a few of you will have guessed that you
get<00:03:17.400> nitrates<00:03:18.829> formed<00:03:21.049> so<00:03:22.049> again<00:03:22.260> what<00:03:22.500> does

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
get nitrates formed so again what does

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.220 
get nitrates formed so again what does
this<00:03:22.859> look<00:03:23.849> like<00:03:23.909> if<00:03:24.329> we<00:03:24.359> use<00:03:24.720> actual

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
this look like if we use actual

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.119 
this look like if we use actual
chemicals<00:03:27.349> well<00:03:28.349> first<00:03:28.590> of<00:03:28.739> all<00:03:28.799> let's<00:03:29.010> look

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
chemicals well first of all let's look

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.729 
chemicals well first of all let's look
if<00:03:29.400> we<00:03:29.549> use<00:03:29.760> hydrochloric<00:03:30.629> acid<00:03:30.989> now<00:03:31.650> I'm

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
if we use hydrochloric acid now I'm

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.640 
if we use hydrochloric acid now I'm
going<00:03:31.859> to<00:03:31.920> use<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.250> three<00:03:32.670> same<00:03:33.000> examples

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
going to use the three same examples

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.839 
going to use the three same examples
from<00:03:34.650> before<00:03:36.620> so<00:03:37.620> for<00:03:37.769> instance<00:03:38.069> if<00:03:38.250> you<00:03:38.459> react

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
from before so for instance if you react

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.680 
from before so for instance if you react
magnesium<00:03:39.720> with<00:03:39.989> hydrochloric<00:03:40.470> acid<00:03:41.690> we've

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
magnesium with hydrochloric acid we've

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.949 
magnesium with hydrochloric acid we've
already<00:03:42.900> seen<00:03:43.200> you<00:03:43.500> get<00:03:43.680> magnesium<00:03:44.069> salt<00:03:44.959> now

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
already seen you get magnesium salt now

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.280 
already seen you get magnesium salt now
because<00:03:46.470> you've<00:03:46.919> used<00:03:47.389> hydrochloric<00:03:48.389> acid

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
because you've used hydrochloric acid

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.190 
because you've used hydrochloric acid
you<00:03:50.250> get<00:03:50.459> magnesium<00:03:51.209> chloride<00:03:53.690> also<00:03:54.690> don't

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
you get magnesium chloride also don't

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.699 
you get magnesium chloride also don't
forget<00:03:55.590> they<00:03:55.889> get<00:03:56.129> hydrogen<00:03:56.579> formed<00:03:57.650> quite<00:03:58.650> a

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
forget they get hydrogen formed quite a

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:00.259 
forget they get hydrogen formed quite a
few<00:03:58.950> people<00:03:59.099> when<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.849> right<00:04:00.030> in<00:04:00.150> these

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
few people when the right in these

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.500 
few people when the right in these
reactions<00:04:01.459> they're<00:04:02.459> able<00:04:02.760> to<00:04:02.879> work<00:04:03.060> out<00:04:03.299> which

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
reactions they're able to work out which

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.629 
reactions they're able to work out which
salt<00:04:03.870> is<00:04:04.049> formed<00:04:04.079> but<00:04:04.799> they<00:04:04.889> also<00:04:05.129> forget<00:04:05.310> to

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
salt is formed but they also forget to

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.849 
salt is formed but they also forget to
put<00:04:05.819> the<00:04:05.849> hydrogen<00:04:06.510> and<00:04:06.720> hydrogen<00:04:07.019> is<00:04:07.319> always

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
put the hydrogen and hydrogen is always

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:13.729 
put the hydrogen and hydrogen is always
formed<00:04:10.400> okay<00:04:11.400> so<00:04:11.459> the<00:04:11.639> second<00:04:11.910> example<00:04:12.739> zinc

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
formed okay so the second example zinc

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.670 
formed okay so the second example zinc
plus<00:04:14.250> hydrogen<00:04:14.459> chloride<00:04:15.090> acid<00:04:15.680> because

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
plus hydrogen chloride acid because

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.039 
plus hydrogen chloride acid because
you're<00:04:16.829> using<00:04:17.329> hydrochloric<00:04:18.329> acid<00:04:18.750> you<00:04:18.870> get<00:04:19.019> a

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
you're using hydrochloric acid you get a

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.680 
you're using hydrochloric acid you get a
chloride<00:04:19.440> formed<00:04:20.039> because<00:04:20.849> you<00:04:21.150> use<00:04:21.329> zinc

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
chloride formed because you use zinc

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.650 
chloride formed because you use zinc
metal<00:04:22.160> the<00:04:23.160> salt<00:04:23.490> is<00:04:23.669> zinc<00:04:24.419> chloride<00:04:26.599> I'm<00:04:27.599> a

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
metal the salt is zinc chloride I'm a

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.890 
metal the salt is zinc chloride I'm a
third<00:04:28.169> one<00:04:28.500> when<00:04:29.250> you<00:04:29.370> react<00:04:29.610> aluminium<00:04:30.419> with

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
third one when you react aluminium with

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.469 
third one when you react aluminium with
hydrochloric<00:04:31.349> acid<00:04:31.800> you<00:04:32.490> get<00:04:32.639> aluminium

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
hydrochloric acid you get aluminium

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:41.060 
hydrochloric acid you get aluminium
chloride<00:04:33.690> and<00:04:34.260> then<00:04:34.830> plus<00:04:35.400> hydrogen<00:04:38.780> so<00:04:40.070> same

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
chloride and then plus hydrogen so same

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.450 
chloride and then plus hydrogen so same
time<00:04:41.370> if<00:04:41.760> you<00:04:42.060> use<00:04:42.380> sulfuric<00:04:43.380> acid

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
time if you use sulfuric acid

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.150 
time if you use sulfuric acid
instead<00:04:45.000> of<00:04:45.090> a<00:04:45.150> chloride<00:04:46.070> you<00:04:47.070> get<00:04:47.220> a<00:04:47.250> sulfate

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
instead of a chloride you get a sulfate

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.190 
instead of a chloride you get a sulfate
so<00:04:50.160> magnesium<00:04:50.520> plus<00:04:51.180> super<00:04:51.390> your<00:04:51.750> facet<00:04:52.080> you

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
so magnesium plus super your facet you

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.300 
so magnesium plus super your facet you
get<00:04:52.350> magnesium<00:04:52.620> sulfate<00:04:53.360> possession<00:04:55.310> the

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
get magnesium sulfate possession the

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.300 
get magnesium sulfate possession the
second<00:04:56.640> one<00:04:56.870> it's<00:04:57.870> simply<00:04:58.440> zinc<00:04:58.800> ore<00:04:59.070> often

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
second one it's simply zinc ore often

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.960 
second one it's simply zinc ore often
magnesium<00:05:00.230> see<00:05:01.230> you<00:05:01.950> you<00:05:02.190> think<00:05:02.520> originally

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
magnesium see you you think originally

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.680 
magnesium see you you think originally
and<00:05:03.210> you<00:05:03.240> get<00:05:03.420> a<00:05:03.450> zinc<00:05:03.810> sulfate<00:05:04.530> formed<00:05:05.690> then

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
and you get a zinc sulfate formed then

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.750 
and you get a zinc sulfate formed then
if<00:05:06.840> you<00:05:06.930> use<00:05:06.960> aluminium<00:05:07.290> you<00:05:07.920> can<00:05:08.100> aluminium

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
if you use aluminium you can aluminium

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:14.360 
if you use aluminium you can aluminium
sulfate<00:05:09.540> formed<00:05:10.940> so<00:05:11.940> you<00:05:12.030> can<00:05:12.270> see<00:05:13.190> you<00:05:14.190> can

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
sulfate formed so you can see you can

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.210 
sulfate formed so you can see you can
easily<00:05:14.520> protect<00:05:14.940> the<00:05:15.240> products<00:05:15.690> of<00:05:16.080> this<00:05:16.980> type

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
easily protect the products of this type

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.550 
easily protect the products of this type
of<00:05:17.250> reaction<00:05:17.520> if<00:05:18.000> you<00:05:18.300> know<00:05:18.480> which<00:05:18.750> acid<00:05:19.320> and

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
of reaction if you know which acid and

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.770 
of reaction if you know which acid and
which<00:05:20.520> metal<00:05:21.680> just<00:05:22.680> be<00:05:22.830> aware<00:05:23.010> that<00:05:23.070> this

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
which metal just be aware that this

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.060 
which metal just be aware that this
check<00:05:24.780> this<00:05:25.050> formula<00:05:25.590> applies<00:05:27.560> to<00:05:28.560> almost<00:05:28.680> all

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
check this formula applies to almost all

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:37.340 
check this formula applies to almost all
metals<00:05:31.280> so<00:05:32.280> the<00:05:32.430> third<00:05:32.670> one<00:05:36.170> we're<00:05:37.170> using

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
metals so the third one we're using

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.160 
metals so the third one we're using
nitric<00:05:37.950> acid<00:05:38.310> now<00:05:38.490> I'm<00:05:39.240> going<00:05:39.510> to<00:05:39.570> use<00:05:39.690> nitric

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
nitric acid now I'm going to use nitric

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:44.180 
nitric acid now I'm going to use nitric
acid<00:05:40.530> you<00:05:40.860> get<00:05:41.040> nitrate<00:05:41.850> salts<00:05:42.630> so<00:05:43.530> magnesium

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
acid you get nitrate salts so magnesium

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.790 
acid you get nitrate salts so magnesium
plus<00:05:44.340> nitric<00:05:44.700> acid<00:05:45.060> makes<00:05:45.810> magnesium<00:05:46.350> nitrate

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
plus nitric acid makes magnesium nitrate

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.390 
plus nitric acid makes magnesium nitrate
plus<00:05:47.130> hydrogen<00:05:47.990> zinc<00:05:48.990> plus<00:05:49.650> nitric<00:05:50.040> acid

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
plus hydrogen zinc plus nitric acid

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
plus hydrogen zinc plus nitric acid
makes<00:05:51.060> think<00:05:51.480> nitrate<00:05:52.020> plus<00:05:52.200> hydrogen

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:53.420 
makes think nitrate plus hydrogen

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:57.110 
makes think nitrate plus hydrogen
aluminium<00:05:54.420> plus<00:05:54.780> 6<00:05:54.990> plus<00:05:55.410> nitric<00:05:55.890> acid<00:05:56.190> makes

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
aluminium plus 6 plus nitric acid makes

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:04.690 
aluminium plus 6 plus nitric acid makes
either<00:05:57.330> mininum<00:05:57.960> nitrate<00:05:58.800> plus<00:05:59.550> hydrogen

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.700 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.830 

so<00:06:05.240> quite<00:06:05.810> a<00:06:05.840> brief<00:06:06.140> presentation<00:06:06.380> this<00:06:06.980> one

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
so quite a brief presentation this one

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.210 
so quite a brief presentation this one
hopefully<00:06:08.840> you<00:06:09.470> should<00:06:09.500> now<00:06:09.710> be<00:06:09.890> able<00:06:09.980> to

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
hopefully you should now be able to

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.760 
hopefully you should now be able to
