00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.360
 more than a hundred years ago the future is english 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.130
 King Edward 7 invited his lady 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.560
 heart named plot in trendy 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.970

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.220

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.100
 said that this is a new dish in their 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.930
 less festive and today I will cook 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.000
 the dessert that came out with this 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.160
 smart waiter for that to me 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.019
 need three quarters of a cup of flour 2 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.230
 tablespoons of sugar and a quarter teaspoon 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.840
 spoons of salt 2 eggs 1 cup milk 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.000
 3 tablespoons butter for 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.629
 sauce 1 cup sugar three quarters cups 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.390
 water 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.640
 half a cup of orange juice zest single 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.559
 orange and 50 grams of butter 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.600
 you need to make dough first 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.890
 bake delicious pancakes for it better 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.640
 take all the room products 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.530
 temperature take flour and baking powder 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.109
 so that it is enriched with oxygen now 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.100
 I'll add a pinch of salt 2 tablespoons 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.409
 spoons of sugar and mix it all up 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.000
 eggs need to be whipped separately so that they 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.040
 just later it is easier to connect the letter 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.439
 milk needs to be poured in little by little 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.180
 so that the dough was thick first 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.380
 what if we price it all options to us 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.900
 it will be very difficult to get rid of small 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.080
 lumps add 3 tablespoons here 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.220
 melted butter 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.290
 the dough now needs to be left minutes for 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.960
 25-30 and during this time I will do 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.829
 prepare the sauce by taking a cup of sugar 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.869
 pour it into the pot now need 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.909
 make a single orange peel and thin 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.610
 thin and and cut into the same on the new Zulu 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.329
 glasses cause high and three quarters 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.710
 cups of water and now I do not mix 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.450
 I'll put it all on fire and bring it to 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.740
 boil and then on a tiny fire 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.990
 need this sun boil for minutes 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.119
 ten to fifteen dough rested 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.780
 it became much thicker so you can 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.970
 now it is diluted with water 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.090
 dilute it with milk for diluted 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.330
 water you can begin to fry pancakes 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.920
 take about a quarter or third 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.630
 ladle that they pour out pour 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.220
 can slowly be fast all the time 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.869
 turn over the pan because it 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.520
 hotter it will immediately begin already 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.289
 bake pancake to even 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.120
 the first pancake you did not get a lump 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.410
 you need to heat up the pan very much 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.270
 then smear it 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.030
 or vegetable or butter and 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.550
 best to do it with a brush sauce 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.170
 I got ready he thickened a little and 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.060
 Now you can proceed to the 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.570
 interesting exciting moment in this 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.880
 recipe 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.739
 first I pour some creamy 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.530
 butter melted pan and 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.100
 you can put a little pancake sauce 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.010
 overlap 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.090
 and do not forget to water them 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.810
 orange sauce 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.650
 now i take one tablespoon 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.959
 orange liqueur 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.450
 and pour on the pan beer long 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.390
 it is better to take a long stick and of course 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.040
 set fire as soon as the flame goes out it 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.380
