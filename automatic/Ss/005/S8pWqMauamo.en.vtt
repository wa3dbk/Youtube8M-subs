absolutely allows foot to get in much
easier<00:00:28.470> but<00:00:28.710> prevents<00:00:29.099> flushing<00:00:29.519> through<00:00:29.670> the

opening to get your foot in on the
outside<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.630> boot<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:37.230> big<00:00:37.890> protective

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
outside of the boot a big protective

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.549 
outside of the boot a big protective
area<00:00:38.730> across<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.239> front<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:40.050> when<00:00:40.350> you've<00:00:40.469> got

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
area across the front so when you've got

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.220 
area across the front so when you've got
a<00:00:40.590> fin<00:00:40.860> on<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.670> foot<00:00:42.210> pockets<00:00:42.540> not<00:00:42.660> wearing

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
a fin on the foot pockets not wearing

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.750 
a fin on the foot pockets not wearing
against<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.739> neoprene<00:00:44.100> itself<00:00:44.460> it's<00:00:44.640> got

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
against the neoprene itself it's got

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.029 
against the neoprene itself it's got
this<00:00:44.910> abrasive<00:00:45.239> protection<00:00:46.079> on<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.829> boat

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
this abrasive protection on the boat

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.630 
this abrasive protection on the boat
we're<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> much<00:00:48.180> harder<00:00:48.480> rubber<00:00:49.079> material<00:00:49.680> and

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
we're a much harder rubber material and

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.740 
we're a much harder rubber material and
again<00:00:50.820> you've<00:00:50.940> got<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.149> on<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.390> back<00:00:51.539> as

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
again you've got that on the back as

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.720 
again you've got that on the back as
well<00:00:51.870> when<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.170> hill<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.129> raised<00:00:53.399> lump

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
well when the hill and a raised lump

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.000 
well when the hill and a raised lump
which<00:00:54.120> also<00:00:54.300> helps<00:00:54.690> prevent<00:00:54.960> your<00:00:55.379> fin<00:00:55.800> strap

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
which also helps prevent your fin strap

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.860 
which also helps prevent your fin strap
from<00:00:56.070> coming<00:00:56.430> off<00:00:56.520> but<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.360> finish<00:00:57.629> up<00:00:57.750> over

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
from coming off but to finish up over

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.479 
from coming off but to finish up over
the<00:00:58.020> top<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.829> prevents<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.340> from

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
the top and that prevents that from

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.819 
the top and that prevents that from
falling<00:01:00.239> down<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.690> obviously<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.170> strap<00:01:01.710> for

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
falling down and obviously the strap for

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.660 
falling down and obviously the strap for
one<00:01:01.980> off<00:01:02.070> completely<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:04.250> has<00:01:05.250> been<00:01:05.400> given

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
one off completely so has been given

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.510 
one off completely so has been given
some<00:01:05.850> design<00:01:06.390> thoughts<00:01:06.689> as<00:01:06.810> well<00:01:07.220> this<00:01:08.220> gray<00:01:08.490> a

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
some design thoughts as well this gray a

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.030 
some design thoughts as well this gray a
lighter<00:01:09.090> gray<00:01:09.630> section<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.470> basically<00:01:10.950> a

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
lighter gray section is basically a

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.609 
lighter gray section is basically a
grooves<00:01:11.310> area<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.750> allows<00:01:12.990> water<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.500> flow

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
grooves area and it allows water to flow

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.880 
grooves area and it allows water to flow
into<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.700> foot<00:01:15.060> pocket<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.990> lot<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.470> time<00:01:16.650> in<00:01:16.799> to

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
into the foot pocket a lot of time in to

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.190 
into the foot pocket a lot of time in to
take<00:01:17.040> your<00:01:17.070> foot<00:01:17.670> out<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.180> fin<00:01:18.600> there's<00:01:19.080> a

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
take your foot out of a fin there's a

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.469 
take your foot out of a fin there's a
lot<00:01:19.380> resistance<00:01:19.920> as<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.549> vacuum<00:01:20.729> seal<00:01:21.180> is

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
lot resistance as the vacuum seal is

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.359 
lot resistance as the vacuum seal is
there<00:01:21.689> as<00:01:21.780> you've<00:01:21.869> broken<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:23.009> basically

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
there as you've broken this basically

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.550 
there as you've broken this basically
eases<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:23.880> by<00:01:24.330> allowing<00:01:24.540> water<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.229> flow

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
eases that by allowing water to flow

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.770 
eases that by allowing water to flow
into<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.400> foot<00:01:26.610> pocket<00:01:26.790> as<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.180> take<00:01:27.420> your

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
into the foot pocket as you take your

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.899 
into the foot pocket as you take your
boot<00:01:27.990> out<00:01:28.200> making<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:28.979> much<00:01:29.159> easier<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.670> get

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
boot out making it much easier to get

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.080 
boot out making it much easier to get
your<00:01:30.119> your<00:01:30.570> foot<00:01:30.720> out

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
your your foot out

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
your your foot out
grips<00:01:33.090> really<00:01:33.329> been<00:01:33.450> improved<00:01:33.780> on<00:01:33.930> these

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
grips really been improved on these

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.539 
grips really been improved on these
boots<00:01:34.290> as<00:01:34.470> well<00:01:34.680> got<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> lot<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.220> different

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
grip areas giving you much better

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.310 
grip areas giving you much better
