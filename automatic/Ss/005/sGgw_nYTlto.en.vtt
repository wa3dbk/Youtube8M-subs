00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
basically the cosmetic surgeon and from

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.249 
basically the cosmetic surgeon and from
that<00:01:20.100> Beverly<00:01:20.340> Hills<00:01:20.670> clinic<00:01:21.180> they<00:01:21.630> took<00:01:22.049> out

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
that Beverly Hills clinic they took out

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.990 
that Beverly Hills clinic they took out
some<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.799> woman's<00:01:23.159> abdominal<00:01:23.759> fat<00:01:24.030> using

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
some of the woman's abdominal fat using

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.100 
some of the woman's abdominal fat using
liposuction<00:01:27.000> okay<00:01:27.590> now<00:01:28.790> from<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:30.270> abdominal

liposuction okay now from that abdominal

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.490 
liposuction okay now from that abdominal
fat<00:01:31.619> they<00:01:32.009> extracted<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.119> adopts<00:01:33.840> themselves

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
fat they extracted the adopts themselves

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.460 
fat they extracted the adopts themselves
okay<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.369> then<00:01:36.150> from<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.720> adult<00:01:36.990> stem<00:01:37.170> cells

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
okay and then from the adult stem cells

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.080 
okay and then from the adult stem cells
they<00:01:37.680> actually<00:01:38.100> identify<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.090> extracted<00:01:39.840> a

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
they actually identify and extracted a

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.609 
they actually identify and extracted a
specific<00:01:42.090> kind<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.420> cells<00:01:42.689> now<00:01:43.110> adult<00:01:43.439> stem

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
specific kind of cells now adult stem

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.280 
specific kind of cells now adult stem
cells<00:01:43.890> basically<00:01:44.159> they<00:01:44.640> are

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
cells basically they are

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.170 
cells basically they are
undifferentiated<00:01:46.290> or<00:01:46.890> unspecialized<00:01:47.850> cells

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
undifferentiated or unspecialized cells

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.359 
undifferentiated or unspecialized cells
which<00:01:48.479> can<00:01:48.720> develop<00:01:48.899> into<00:01:49.350> different<00:01:49.860> cells

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
which can develop into different cells

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.940 
which can develop into different cells
and<00:01:50.610> tissues<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.960> what<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.140> did<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.470> they<00:01:52.680> took

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
and tissues so what I did is they took

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.670 
and tissues so what I did is they took
these<00:01:53.220> stem<00:01:53.759> cells<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.299> then<00:01:54.509> extracted<00:01:55.259> only

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
these stem cells and then extracted only

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.789 
these stem cells and then extracted only
what<00:01:55.979> they<00:01:56.070> call<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.930> mesenchymal<00:01:57.930> stem

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
what they call the mesenchymal stem

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.490 
what they call the mesenchymal stem
cells<00:01:59.250> now<00:01:59.549> basically<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.869> mesenchymal<00:02:01.200> stem

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
cells now basically the mesenchymal stem

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.649 
cells now basically the mesenchymal stem
cells<00:02:01.829> also<00:02:02.070> known<00:02:02.250> as<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.490> multi<00:02:03.090> potent

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659

cells also known as a multi potent
stromal<00:02:04.590> cells<00:02:04.920> which<00:02:05.790> are<00:02:05.939> stem<00:02:06.180> cells<00:02:06.210> which

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
stromal cells which are stem cells which

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.660 
stromal cells which are stem cells which
can<00:02:06.810> developed<00:02:07.320> into<00:02:07.979> various<00:02:08.340> types<00:02:08.580> of

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
can developed into various types of

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
can developed into various types of

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.570 
are commonly used by scientists for stem
cell<00:02:43.980> research<00:02:45.650> due<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:46.980> fact<00:02:47.220> that<00:02:47.280> they

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
cell research due to the fact that they

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.600 
cell research due to the fact that they
can<00:02:47.820> be<00:02:47.850> easily<00:02:48.030> extracted<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:49.290> cultured<00:02:49.800> in

the left and outside body basically now

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.540 
the left and outside body basically now
and<00:02:53.700> they<00:02:54.120> also<00:02:54.330> have<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:54.750> high<00:02:55.170> potential<00:02:55.680> to

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
and they also have a high potential to

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.520 
and they also have a high potential to
be<00:02:56.670> induced<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.450> cultured<00:02:57.870> outside<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.350> body

in<00:02:58.740> the<00:02:58.860> lab<00:02:59.070> and<00:03:00.530> therefore<00:03:01.530> these

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
in the lab and therefore these

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.740 
in the lab and therefore these
characteristics<00:03:03.060> make<00:03:03.300> them<00:03:03.510> very

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
characteristics make them very

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.290 
characteristics make them very
attractive<00:03:04.100> for<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.190> purpose<00:03:05.580> of<00:03:05.700> stem<00:03:06.000> cell

aged on her face now three months
everything<00:03:52.470> went<00:03:52.800> well<00:03:52.980> a<00:03:53.250> tree<00:03:53.640> months<00:03:53.880> later

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
everything went well a tree months later

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.300 
everything went well a tree months later
the<00:03:54.480> women<00:03:54.780> went<00:03:55.080> to<00:03:55.140> see<00:03:55.410> another<00:03:55.860> cosmetic

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
the women went to see another cosmetic

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.810 
the women went to see another cosmetic
surgeon<00:03:56.910> and<00:03:57.090> complained<00:03:57.720> that<00:03:58.310> she<00:03:59.310> has<00:03:59.430> pain

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
surgeon and complained that she has pain

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.330 
surgeon and complained that she has pain
in<00:04:00.510> her<00:04:00.989> eyes<00:04:01.200> when<00:04:01.590> she's<00:04:01.860> tried<00:04:02.070> to<00:04:02.100> open

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
in her eyes when she's tried to open

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.390 
in her eyes when she's tried to open
eyes<00:04:02.700> okay<00:04:03.360> and<00:04:03.600> the<00:04:04.440> worst<00:04:04.650> thing<00:04:04.860> is<00:04:05.010> and

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
eyes okay and the worst thing is and

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.670 
eyes okay and the worst thing is and
when<00:04:05.910> she<00:04:06.120> tried<00:04:06.330> to<00:04:06.420> open<00:04:06.570> her<00:04:06.840> eyes<00:04:06.989> she

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
when she tried to open her eyes she

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.490 
when she tried to open her eyes she
heard<00:04:07.890> cracking<00:04:08.400> sound<00:04:08.880> okay<00:04:09.870> each<00:04:10.110> time<00:04:10.470> she

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
heard cracking sound okay each time she

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.300 
heard cracking sound okay each time she
open<00:04:10.950> eyes<00:04:11.720> now<00:04:12.720> so<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:13.350> cosmetic<00:04:13.950> surgeon

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
open eyes now so the cosmetic surgeon

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.199 
open eyes now so the cosmetic surgeon
examined<00:04:15.090> her<00:04:15.269> and<00:04:15.530> they<00:04:16.820> observed<00:04:17.820> that<00:04:17.940> her

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
examined her and they observed that her

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.370 
examined her and they observed that her
I<00:04:18.359> was<00:04:19.109> actually<00:04:19.320> drooping<00:04:20.220> and<00:04:21.260> they<00:04:22.260> were

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
I was actually drooping and they were

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.000 
I was actually drooping and they were
swelling<00:04:22.740> around<00:04:23.479> you<00:04:24.479> know<00:04:24.660> the<00:04:25.080> around<00:04:25.320> the

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
swelling around you know the around the

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.200 
swelling around you know the around the
eye<00:04:26.039> region

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
eye region

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.409 
eye region
so<00:04:27.870> they<00:04:28.500> decided<00:04:28.949> to<00:04:29.220> do<00:04:29.370> an<00:04:29.520> operation<00:04:29.699> and

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
so they decided to do an operation and

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.930 
so they decided to do an operation and
she<00:04:31.139> actually<00:04:31.320> went<00:04:31.740> through<00:04:31.830> six<00:04:32.220> hours<00:04:32.820> of

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
she actually went through six hours of

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.760 
she actually went through six hours of
surgery<00:04:33.150> and<00:04:35.240> by<00:04:36.240> this<00:04:36.539> cosmetic<00:04:37.259> surgeon<00:04:37.620> and

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
surgery and by this cosmetic surgeon and

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.060 
surgery and by this cosmetic surgeon and
his<00:04:38.070> team<00:04:38.370> they<00:04:39.360> took<00:04:39.690> out<00:04:39.960> chunks<00:04:40.500> and<00:04:40.800> pieces

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
his team they took out chunks and pieces

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.790 
his team they took out chunks and pieces
of<00:04:41.310> bones<00:04:41.759> from<00:04:42.330> the<00:04:42.389> eyelids<00:04:43.020> and<00:04:43.259> tissues

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
of bones from the eyelids and tissues

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.310 
of bones from the eyelids and tissues
around<00:04:44.100> the<00:04:44.550> eyes<00:04:44.669> as<00:04:45.000> scary<00:04:45.389> isn't<00:04:45.870> it

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
around the eyes as scary isn't it

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.740 
around the eyes as scary isn't it
so<00:04:47.449> it<00:04:48.449> seems<00:04:48.750> that<00:04:48.810> bones<00:04:49.259> and<00:04:49.669> growing<00:04:50.750> under

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
so it seems that bones and growing under

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.570 
so it seems that bones and growing under
the<00:04:51.870> eyelids<00:04:52.289> and<00:04:52.560> and<00:04:53.690> surrounding<00:04:54.690> you<00:04:55.229> know

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
the eyelids and and surrounding you know

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.510 
the eyelids and and surrounding you know
area<00:04:56.580> of<00:04:56.759> the<00:04:57.000> eyes<00:04:57.650> so<00:04:58.650> what<00:04:58.860> actually<00:04:59.009> went

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
area of the eyes so what actually went

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.900 
area of the eyes so what actually went
wrong<00:04:59.699> was<00:05:00.300> during<00:05:01.199> the<00:05:01.500> previous<00:05:01.979> cosmetic

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
wrong was during the previous cosmetic

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.930 
wrong was during the previous cosmetic
stem-cell<00:05:03.330> cosmetics<00:05:04.289> procedure<00:05:05.660> the

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
stem-cell cosmetics procedure the

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.029 
stem-cell cosmetics procedure the
Beverly<00:05:08.940> Hills<00:05:09.120> clinic<00:05:09.599> they<00:05:09.840> also<00:05:10.380> injected

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
Beverly Hills clinic they also injected

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.290 
Beverly Hills clinic they also injected
a<00:05:11.570> chemical<00:05:12.570> known<00:05:12.810> as<00:05:12.840> calcium

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
a chemical known as calcium

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.960 
a chemical known as calcium
hydroxyapatite<00:05:15.830> now<00:05:16.830> this<00:05:17.039> is<00:05:17.190> basically

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
hydroxyapatite now this is basically

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.080 
hydroxyapatite now this is basically
what<00:05:18.449> they<00:05:18.539> call<00:05:18.780> a<00:05:18.990> dermal<00:05:19.470> filler<00:05:19.830> and<00:05:20.160> it's

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
what they call a dermal filler and it's

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.540 
what they call a dermal filler and it's
been<00:05:21.300> used<00:05:21.509> for<00:05:21.870> more<00:05:22.530> than<00:05:22.650> 20<00:05:23.070> years<00:05:23.099> by

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
been used for more than 20 years by

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.529 
been used for more than 20 years by
plastic<00:05:24.150> surgeon<00:05:24.750> and<00:05:24.960> the<00:05:25.770> purpose<00:05:26.160> of

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539 
plastic surgeon and the purpose of

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:29.650 
plastic surgeon and the purpose of
injecting<00:05:27.539> this<00:05:27.780> was<00:05:27.990> to<00:05:28.199> reduce<00:05:28.530> wrinkles

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
injecting this was to reduce wrinkles

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.689 
injecting this was to reduce wrinkles
but<00:05:30.660> what<00:05:30.930> they<00:05:31.139> did<00:05:31.620> not<00:05:31.889> know<00:05:32.130> is<00:05:32.400> that<00:05:32.430> this

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 
but what they did not know is that this

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.540 
but what they did not know is that this
chemicals<00:05:33.330> is<00:05:33.510> also<00:05:33.900> capable<00:05:34.349> of<00:05:34.740> inducing

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
chemicals is also capable of inducing

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.330 
chemicals is also capable of inducing
this<00:05:36.000> miss<00:05:36.360> and<00:05:36.570> climb<00:05:36.810> of<00:05:36.990> stem<00:05:37.260> cells<00:05:37.590> to

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
this miss and climb of stem cells to

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.080 
this miss and climb of stem cells to
grow<00:05:38.520> bones<00:05:38.960> so<00:05:39.960> that<00:05:40.229> is<00:05:40.349> when<00:05:40.669> when<00:05:41.669> haywire

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
grow bones so that is when when haywire

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.830 
grow bones so that is when when haywire
okay

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
okay

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:48.080 
okay
so<00:05:45.289> they<00:05:46.289> did<00:05:46.590> not<00:05:46.770> they<00:05:47.310> were<00:05:47.520> not<00:05:47.639> aware<00:05:47.820> that

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
so they did not they were not aware that

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.980 
so they did not they were not aware that
you<00:05:48.690> know<00:05:48.949> this<00:05:50.150> commonly<00:05:51.150> used<00:05:51.360> dermal

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
you know this commonly used dermal

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.110 
you know this commonly used dermal
filler<00:05:52.380> these<00:05:52.800> chemicals<00:05:53.430> and<00:05:53.760> can<00:05:54.690> also<00:05:56.120> make

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
filler these chemicals and can also make

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.469 
filler these chemicals and can also make
the<00:05:57.360> missing<00:05:57.810> kymo<00:05:58.080> stem<00:05:58.740> cells<00:05:59.130> to<00:06:00.000> grow<00:06:00.150> bone

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 
the missing kymo stem cells to grow bone

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.300 
the missing kymo stem cells to grow bone
and<00:06:00.780> that's<00:06:00.960> why<00:06:01.169> when<00:06:01.380> they<00:06:01.530> injected<00:06:02.070> into

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
and that's why when they injected into

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.899 
and that's why when they injected into
the<00:06:02.430> face<00:06:02.669> of<00:06:02.699> the<00:06:03.060> women<00:06:04.020> in<00:06:04.289> and<00:06:04.759> around<00:06:05.759> the

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:05.909 
the face of the women in and around the

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:06.950 
the face of the women in and around the
eye<00:06:05.940> area

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
eye area

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.029 
eye area
this<00:06:07.229> chemical<00:06:07.800> actually<00:06:08.759> and<00:06:09.409> triggered<00:06:10.409> the

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 
this chemical actually and triggered the

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:16.629 
this chemical actually and triggered the
growth<00:06:11.370> of<00:06:11.400> bones<00:06:12.259> around<00:06:13.259> that<00:06:13.860> region<00:06:14.250> so

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 
growth of bones around that region so

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:19.129 
growth of bones around that region so
this<00:06:17.639> is<00:06:17.849> probably<00:06:18.300> something<00:06:18.659> that<00:06:18.690> we<00:06:18.930> can

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:19.139 
this is probably something that we can

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:23.350 
this is probably something that we can
techno<00:06:19.800> enough<00:06:20.039> when<00:06:20.520> we<00:06:21.060> do<00:06:21.810> undertake<00:06:22.650> care

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
techno enough when we do undertake care

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.779 
techno enough when we do undertake care
