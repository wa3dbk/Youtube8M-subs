00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:04.640
 Herkommer Garten Television North German Garden Show Professor Hans-Dieter Warda 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.529
 Interlocutors already from many cases put here 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.529
 right next to a tree accident give the 

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:12.939
 Autumn cyclamen grow 

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:16.259
 And that's a simple plan since I'm good at any garden 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:17.250
 Plants could 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.420
 yes, that's what the full-bearded wild cyclamen is planning 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.589
 here the foliation 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:24.230
 LÃ¼bs 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.080
 The End 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.860
 At the end of October, Uli is sometimes also one until mid-November 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.879
 lovely perennial 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:35.979
 a garden culmination in itself and I have to tell them they still do not 

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:36.829
 known enough 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.220
 absolutely winter hardy he comes from the Mediterranean area so 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.860
 I have them everywhere in Anatolia Greece 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.359
 in the mountain forests, pines teach 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:50.479
 we see and that is very important for an Albanian that she is here with us 

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:53.639
 half shady map space finds a place for 

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:56.050
 the main ways to us time 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.260
 magnificent picture cyclamen z takes place in January until March instead of the 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.820
 is called percents she has 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.269
 great for the leaves 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:06.340
 marbled 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.600
 Blatter and if then 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.340
 in March the warm sun is on the leaves and the nights then 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.849
 getting cold and being frustrated then it comes to very great stress 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.570
 is a Schirmer made of pine dwarf pine or even dense 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.159
 Deciduous trees in the bog are of great benefit and should 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.090
 the temperatures once permanently 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.820
 under 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.060
 Minus 20 degrees fall 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.549
 then in the thalia I have a slight 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.060
 30 cities or a fleece or whatever hoster lean tissue Green 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.250
 doubly laid down then nothing happens 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.969
 I live here in the arboretum 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:42.820
 25 years and it is still us 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.810
 no cyclamen at all 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.000
 Erfurt and that believes that in the spring again that will be in the 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.950
 Spring one but actually m 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.490
 Mayer I'll tell you if it's in the Mediterranean area 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.540
 hot the percent precipitation will fail to attract the foliage and 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.290
 the duo the dangerous time that wild cyclamen is with us in the gardens 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.259
 I have to remember the place already or adjust small pieces in 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.120
 It does not have to be or any 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.979
 Percent 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.150
 for the flower buds and Latin seats are yes on top of this flat 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.019
 tuber 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.919
 and then you would confirm 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:21.889
 yes the exciting thing is so small and delicate this bloom is too 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:25.499
 the tuber which is under it but the purchase of the event I small but with the 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:27.950
 It can become huge " 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.860
 In 25 years he has been here already after the meal, they can fly 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.680
 Pieces of Steller are going to be big 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.090
 So right little flying saucer only my daughter has that time 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.909
 counted 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:43.410
 on a tuber then sit up to 200 small 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.299
 pinkish pink 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.480
 beautiful flowers that is ONP 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.249
 believe light 

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:51.569
 the library I call this song cyclamen to complain about the 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:52.399
 films 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:56.569
 that is clear as before, but there is also a second program for 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:57.890
 the garden suitable 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.700
 the picture then in a year the picture again that it to complaints KOMCOM also out 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.240
 The Mediterranean has small round leaves and that's the one too 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.900
 difference 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.499
 to follow this album 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:12.789
 That's why we're talking about that because of the lethargic almost 

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:14.799
 sometimes 3 Lakic he leaves 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.799
 a bit marbled as we with the animal lover 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.929
 the flower abundance 

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:24.159
 the gc-defense it reaches the consequences of the crisis and this 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.359
 Roses contiguous surfaces that can be created with it 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.199
 You can do that with cow's milk 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:33.069
 and as for the propagation in which he remains rain it is so that 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.999
 she herself likes to look out herself about having the little one herself 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.430
 unauthorized and that is the whole 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.340
 interesting 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.360
 the fruits 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.080
 have an appendage a so-called the lyre son and the ants love 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.760
 everywhere this appendage is very accomplished and abducted by more 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.030
 Of course these little ones say they are maybe half the size of a box 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.200
 Korn and then finds this old club with us 

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:02.760
 but Holland under all these wooden planks and the little one 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.340
 Come wood pines whatever Voves did not plant at all and 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.279
 There are now some areas 

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:12.609
 the burden of the son multiplied and settled whole splendid 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:13.320
 small 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.899
 regions 

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:18.799
 yes and good opportunity to clean up times in the mind 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.990
 the animal is a cyclamen which is thought very similar to the theme 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.509
 Leaf drawing but significantly larger and this is not nice garden suitable 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:31.970
 but also has such a beautiful tuber never old at this garden at the garden 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:32.569
 Case is enough 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:35.120
 yes you can lose that but flat 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.949
 Philippsen Pharmaceuticals Knowle and 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:41.069
 You have to pay attention as a garden friend as a plant-lover 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:45.179
 Per cent that the tuber does not push too high she always has the desire 

00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:49.719
 grow taller and then the top area is completely free of tealights 

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:52.939
 The sun shed by the frost hit the estimate also none 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:53.569
 blossoms 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:54.650
 percent 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:55.849
 these 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:59.180
 if the upside-up and consumed and it is very very dry 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.949
 with a very important story 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:06.439
 the tuber of this image cyclamen is this in a row finds a naughty must 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:11.569
 putting at least 13 team meters under the ground is a very important one 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:12.490
 history 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.440
 that at all 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.390
 The most important of these wonderful tempting are cyclamen that is 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.729
 Every year he should throw on it again 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:23.770
 we will do it like that 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.380
 in the summer months 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.380
 because there is no foliage and the areas are completely bare 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:32.349
 Let us take the opportunity to clean the areas 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:36.589
 and pecking insulted a new humus layer of a data unit value or 

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:39.639
 Foliage he books according to earth mix fertilizer with agar 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:42.319
 let's look over these 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:46.360
 often already very exposed roots necks 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.460
 and so it's a blessing to a blessing who for this song "all 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.580
 Sharing that is a very important one 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.770
 Measure above all, then you get a rich flowers use 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.790
 because he stays the upper area in May 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:01.180
 and then 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.370
 It may be important to know 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.629
 that the soil should not be too acidic 

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:09.569
 Just make sure that the floor is neutral or maybe even one 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:10.720
 slightly alkaline 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.100
 all our surfaces 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.009
 just under the conifers where year 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:20.060
 There is also a slight spread of soil around this camp. We give it every year 

00:06:20.059 --> 00:06:24.819
 I always say about 600 grams of carbon dioxide cold that it is very important 

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:26.819
 History and when we do 

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:28.180
 in the summer though 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.780
 no space at all 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.220
 if we want to attach the surfaces so silly and apply the floor with 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.610
 the same as the ground 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.610
 for light organic fertilizer 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:37.850
 they like that too 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:40.409
 and they have been here for a long time 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:43.349
 for decades no human life long 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:45.240
 do you enjoy this? 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:50.479
 small magnificent lovely wild alps Violets the Clan resist the foliation 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:54.559
 and maybe even added this Dirk Wagner carrier as on the 

00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:56.949
 Spring cyclamen come in two colors 

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:01.490
 a violet and a white tone who knows only in white Mark can just be the 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.300
 white variety plants 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.550
 There is always a wonderful sight when you plan both together 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:11.250
 yes that's right there are lately selections that have so 

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.360
 a popo 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.170
 and quite rarely can you find them among the plant lovers or because special ones 

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:18.139
 providers 

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:20.300
 but usually they are already like they say 

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.630
 Pink and white with you 

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:26.080
 just have to say that the white color is dominant so 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:26.990
 if 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:31.070
 Nothing in this area would make it that would lie ahead of us then 

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.090
 Slowly referring to the time to express it 

00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:38.840
 yes we thank you for allowing us to see one 

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.320
 Every hot spot for every garden has a bit of shade 

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.870
 some woods and this is just this cyclamen wonderful 

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:46.910
 Movie thanks to our 

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:50.050
 suggest that then in previous cycles we comm 

00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:53.580
 we would have come back to this bank again 

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.659
 continue
