00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.769

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.049
 tutorial then today I bring you this 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.800
 video tutorial because I want to make you 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.230
 let's say I want to help you for 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.920
 understand how it rises as it is created 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.650
 caban say then I saw others 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.619
 video regarding this on how 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.300
 install crack all cam calls though 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.820
 and obviously they wanted to download samples 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.899
 bandic to this is a thing from the site 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.300
 official this is something i don't 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:44.520
 I advise you because they do not seem to me 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.489
 I do not think the case at this point you do 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.570
 you put a folder on mediafire 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.329
 inside calls cam 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.420
 already because you have to waste time at 70 a 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.449
 do download all these things instead 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.649
 I did something we say here 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.949
 will save much time 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.189
 you with the link that I will leave you in 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.159
 description that of mediafire downloaded 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:12.090
 this this is a rar archive 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.270
 it's written calls cam2 download it 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.680
 would this be you open it and you will find 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.960
 within this archive one 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.130
 folder with written announcements inside 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.799
 of this card there are all these 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.229
 file but to us those those who there 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.240
 are bid affect stitch cam exe 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.240
 that is 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.080
 execution of gam and call maker ex 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.460
 and therefore you can safely 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.770
 pull this folder out of the killer 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.670
 ar really is on the desktop that it would be 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.150
 this 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.610
 in the end and open calls if you 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.170
 you will have calls for the first time you will notice 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.820
 that comes to you out of a 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.130
 message that says you're not 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.030

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.800
 pay for it yourself 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.320
 at that point mandate fuck off calls that 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.120
 ask for it fuck off those from 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.740
 calls for tenders that manage tenders 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.570
 they want you to be paid for 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.050
 usual for a program because it serves for 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.940

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.170

 always ask in the folder 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.690
 click once here on what maker does 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.800
 of the right button execute as 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.780
 administrator here as you can see is 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.780
 this is the real point of the crack you see 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.790
 here not written media and mail address 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:50.060
 putting a dick down i know 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.930
 an e-mail address or whatever you can 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:03:00.260
 also put your wind on you 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:01.129
 you must c powerful in the samsung snail 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.780
 gmail.com 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:05.900
 so you can put what the fuck 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.489
 true then just that the email is valid 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.260
 in the sense that it is not that you can put yourself 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.959

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.879

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:19.340
 in short, whatever you like is hotmail 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:20.389
 it is enough that the hyper is valid for this 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.609
 point once you have entered 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:24.200
 the email you are sure that valina does the 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.959
 register application and here that is 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.019
 written practically that you are 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.629
 successfully registered on calls 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:35.900
 at this point it closes that maker e 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:38.239
 reopen calls that at this point 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.189
 you will notice that there is practically not here 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.359
 more written here the message there 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:44.239
 released before you are not registered 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:46.579
 there is no more written and therefore this is 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.439
 already one more step and you will also notice 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.760
 which above 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:51.560
 if you want to open for the first time e 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.319
 make ok to that message that appears 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.440
 via prÃ© pandico normally only there is 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:01.250
 written in brackets above not 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.720
 registered ok so close by who 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.159
 has the written description not registered 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.489
 so once you've done it 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:09.349
 this step makes makers and reopen 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.379

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.190

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:14.780
 bought 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.669

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:21.169
