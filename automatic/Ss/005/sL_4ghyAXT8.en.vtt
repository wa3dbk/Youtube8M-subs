all right um I think I'm going to have
to<00:02:09.950> leave<00:02:10.250> out<00:02:10.460> the<00:02:10.640> articulation<00:02:11.540> part

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
to leave out the articulation part

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.120

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
unless it matters all sigma six figures

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.750 
unless it matters all sigma six figures
have<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.550> same<00:02:16.790> amount<00:02:16.970> of<00:02:17.350> articulation

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
have the same amount of articulation

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.730 
have the same amount of articulation
except<00:02:19.760> for<00:02:20.090> two<00:02:20.480> figures<00:02:21.020> that's<00:02:21.470> the

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
except for two figures that's the

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
with the wheels on the bottom so I guess

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:39.570

that says as you're pushing it you can

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.800 
that says as you're pushing it you can
