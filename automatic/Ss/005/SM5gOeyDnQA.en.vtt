share some very important tricks
production<00:00:17.680> tricks<00:00:17.920> for<00:00:18.490> reason<00:00:18.820> so<00:00:19.570> let's

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:19.779 
production tricks for reason so let's

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.029 
production tricks for reason so let's
get<00:00:19.930> started

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.700 

what<00:00:23.880> if<00:00:23.999> we<00:00:24.119> want<00:00:24.329> more<00:00:24.419> control<00:00:25.109> over<00:00:25.470> an

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
what if we want more control over an

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.060 
what if we want more control over an
audio<00:00:25.980> loop<00:00:26.189> if<00:00:26.789> that's<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.660> case<00:00:27.890> then<00:00:28.890> we're

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
audio loop if that's the case then we're

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.040 
audio loop if that's the case then we're
going<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.250> want<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.519> turn<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.149> into<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.390> Rex<00:00:30.810> loop

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
going to want to turn it into a Rex loop

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.009 
going to want to turn it into a Rex loop
and<00:00:31.289> as<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.710> Rex<00:00:32.129> loop<00:00:32.369> then<00:00:32.790> we<00:00:33.000> can<00:00:33.180> remove

00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:34.019 
and as a Rex loop then we can remove

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:36.290 
and as a Rex loop then we can remove
each<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.980> little<00:00:35.129> beats<00:00:35.699> or<00:00:36.059> we<00:00:36.180> can

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
each of the little beats or we can

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.630 
each of the little beats or we can
rearrange<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.960> beats<00:00:37.140> or<00:00:37.559> we<00:00:37.680> can<00:00:37.829> add<00:00:37.980> swing

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
rearrange the beats or we can add swing

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.819 
rearrange the beats or we can add swing
to<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.269> beats<00:00:39.480> all<00:00:39.780> kinds<00:00:40.470> of<00:00:40.559> different

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
to the beats all kinds of different

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.740 
to the beats all kinds of different
things<00:00:41.210> let's<00:00:42.210> give<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> try<00:00:44.449> so<00:00:45.449> first

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
things let's give that a try so first

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.000 
things let's give that a try so first
we're<00:00:45.870> going<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.019> want<00:00:46.229> to<00:00:46.290> look<00:00:46.379> at<00:00:46.530> all<00:00:46.680> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
we're going to want to look at all the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.000 
we're going to want to look at all the
warp<00:00:47.250> markers<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.540> audio<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.559> make<00:00:49.710> sure

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
warp markers in the audio to make sure

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.149 
warp markers in the audio to make sure
that<00:00:50.610> they're<00:00:50.850> all<00:00:50.879> set<00:00:51.300> right

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:52.159 
that they're all set right

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:55.009 
that they're all set right
so<00:00:53.159> let's<00:00:53.399> solo<00:00:53.760> this<00:00:54.000> track<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.600> take<00:00:54.989> a

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
so let's solo this track and take a

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:00.130 
so let's solo this track and take a
listen<00:00:55.259> to<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:56.519> is<00:00:56.580> a<00:00:56.729> Bongo<00:00:57.150> track<00:00:57.449> here

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.749 

you<00:01:01.140> only<00:01:01.290> need<00:01:01.470> one<00:01:01.500> iteration<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.610> the<00:01:02.729> loop

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:02.759 
you only need one iteration of the loop

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:05.570 
you only need one iteration of the loop
so<00:01:03.689> we'll<00:01:03.809> just<00:01:03.989> grab<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.589> one<00:01:04.769> well<00:01:05.220> double

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
so we'll just grab this one well double

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.789 
so we'll just grab this one well double
click<00:01:05.729> on<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.030> open<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.390> up<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.720> show<00:01:06.799> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
click on it to open it up and show the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.249 
click on it to open it up and show the
work<00:01:07.979> markers<00:01:09.950> zoom<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.130> here<00:01:11.960> so<00:01:12.960> each<00:01:13.229> of

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
work markers zoom in here so each of

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.980 
work markers zoom in here so each of
these<00:01:13.500> warp<00:01:13.920> markers<00:01:14.509> those<00:01:15.509> are<00:01:15.659> actually

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
these warp markers those are actually

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.210 
these warp markers those are actually
the<00:01:16.220> beat<00:01:17.220> markers<00:01:17.640> for<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.299> transients<00:01:19.220> each

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
the beat markers for the transients each

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.510 
the beat markers for the transients each
part<00:01:20.670> where<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:22.250> spikes<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:25.280> little<00:01:26.280> warp

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
part where this spikes a little warp

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.200 
part where this spikes a little warp
marker<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:27.030> put<00:01:27.360> down

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
marker is put down

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.780 
marker is put down
and<00:01:29.740> it's<00:01:30.740> always<00:01:30.890> good<00:01:31.130> to<00:01:31.159> double<00:01:31.310> check<00:01:31.460> and

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
and it's always good to double check and

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.450 
and it's always good to double check and
see<00:01:32.150> if<00:01:32.390> the<00:01:32.630> work<00:01:32.780> markers<00:01:33.280> registered<00:01:34.280> each

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
see if the work markers registered each

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.710 
see if the work markers registered each
of<00:01:34.610> the<00:01:34.670> transients<00:01:35.150> in<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:35.390> wave<00:01:35.540> farm

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
of the transients in the wave farm

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.649 
of the transients in the wave farm
correctly<00:01:36.350> if<00:01:36.590> they<00:01:37.220> didn't<00:01:37.729> we<00:01:38.300> can<00:01:38.479> for

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
correctly if they didn't we can for

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.810 
correctly if they didn't we can for
example<00:01:39.050> just<00:01:39.950> grab<00:01:40.310> one<00:01:40.520> of<00:01:40.550> these<00:01:40.670> guys<00:01:40.970> here

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
example just grab one of these guys here

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.149 
example just grab one of these guys here
we<00:01:43.820> just<00:01:43.970> click<00:01:44.360> on<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:45.259> work<00:01:45.470> marker<00:01:45.800> select

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
we just click on the work marker select

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.410 
we just click on the work marker select
it<00:01:46.310> and<00:01:46.400> we<00:01:46.490> can<00:01:46.670> delete<00:01:46.909> it<00:01:47.060> or<00:01:48.729> if<00:01:49.729> we<00:01:50.000> need

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
it and we can delete it or if we need

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.760 
it and we can delete it or if we need
another<00:01:50.570> one<00:01:50.930> in<00:01:51.050> there<00:01:51.170> we<00:01:51.320> just<00:01:51.350> grab<00:01:51.740> a

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
another one in there we just grab a

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.630 
another one in there we just grab a
pencil<00:01:52.040> tool<00:01:52.430> and<00:01:52.720> up<00:01:53.720> here<00:01:54.050> and<00:01:54.310> just<00:01:55.310> drop

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
pencil tool and up here and just drop

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.730 
pencil tool and up here and just drop
another<00:01:55.850> word<00:01:56.060> marker<00:01:56.360> down

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.399 

also<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.850> make<00:01:59.970> sure<00:02:00.120> that<00:02:00.240> each<00:02:00.659> beat<00:02:01.380> is

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
also to make sure that each beat is

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.870 
also to make sure that each beat is
being<00:02:01.799> registered<00:02:01.979> make<00:02:02.430> sure<00:02:02.549> there's<00:02:02.729> not

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
being registered make sure there's not

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.190 
being registered make sure there's not
something<00:02:03.060> I'm<00:02:03.270> missing<00:02:03.479> in<00:02:03.750> here<00:02:03.900> in<00:02:04.080> terms

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:41.099 
and now that conga same line it's got a

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:43.489 
and now that conga same line it's got a
couple<00:05:41.309> rearranged<00:05:41.699> notes<00:05:41.999> and<00:05:42.239> it<00:05:43.050> has<00:05:43.229> a<00:05:43.259> new

shuffle<00:05:43.679> feel<00:05:48.050> little<00:05:49.050> bit<00:05:49.199> a<00:05:49.469> little<00:05:49.800> bit

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
shuffle feel little bit a little bit

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:54.769 
shuffle feel little bit a little bit
funkier<00:05:50.339> a<00:05:50.369> little<00:05:50.639> bit<00:05:50.729> more<00:05:50.879> MPC<00:05:51.300> and<00:05:53.779> that's

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:54.779 
funkier a little bit more MPC and that's

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:56.329 
funkier a little bit more MPC and that's
how<00:05:54.929> you<00:05:54.989> turn<00:05:55.199> an<00:05:55.379> audio<00:05:55.709> loop<00:05:55.860> and<00:05:56.069> reason

00:05:56.329 --> 00:05:56.339 
how you turn an audio loop and reason

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:59.209

into<00:05:56.550> a<00:05:56.669> Rex<00:05:56.999> loop<00:05:57.239> for<00:05:57.809> the<00:05:58.129> ultimate<00:05:59.129> in

00:05:59.209 --> 00:05:59.219 
into a Rex loop for the ultimate in

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:03.199 
into a Rex loop for the ultimate in
control<00:05:59.699> of<00:06:00.139> your<00:06:01.139> audio<00:06:02.069> slices<00:06:02.819> and<00:06:03.119> your
