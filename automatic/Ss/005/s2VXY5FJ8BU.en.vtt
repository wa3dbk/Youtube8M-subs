00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
to come into your life

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.180 
to come into your life
I<00:02:09.280> had<00:02:10.090> nothing<00:02:10.599> before<00:02:10.720> I've<00:02:11.500> had<00:02:11.769> a<00:02:11.950> lot

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
I had nothing before I've had a lot

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.670 
I had nothing before I've had a lot
before<00:02:12.760> and<00:02:13.360> I've<00:02:13.480> had<00:02:13.720> nothing<00:02:14.049> yet<00:02:14.349> again

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
before and I've had nothing yet again

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.490 
before and I've had nothing yet again
only<00:02:15.430> to<00:02:15.549> find<00:02:15.790> myself<00:02:15.970> back<00:02:16.900> on<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.290> top

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
only to find myself back on the top

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.309 
only to find myself back on the top
again<00:02:17.799> so<00:02:18.160> this<00:02:18.670> is<00:02:18.730> just<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.599> cycle<00:02:20.019> of<00:02:20.110> life

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
again so this is just the cycle of life

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.520 
again so this is just the cycle of life
as<00:02:20.739> all<00:02:21.010> cycles<00:02:21.459> are<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:22.049> what<00:02:23.049> I<00:02:23.079> hope<00:02:23.349> for

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
as all cycles are and what I hope for

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.720 
as all cycles are and what I hope for
you<00:02:23.650> is<00:02:23.860> that<00:02:23.980> you<00:02:24.160> find<00:02:24.190> your<00:02:24.670> journey<00:02:25.120> within

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
you is that you find your journey within

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.100 
you is that you find your journey within
and<00:02:27.730> hopefully<00:02:28.480> you'll<00:02:28.599> find<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:28.959> same
