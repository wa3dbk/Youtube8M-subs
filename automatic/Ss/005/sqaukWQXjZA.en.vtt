00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 The beauty here is the night with more 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:11.219
 a minecraft video where I want 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:16.049
 show a good mold is strong well if well 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:18.240
 Simple and cool cute for minecraft is 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.320
 the shape shifter as the name itself 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.320
 says it's a mutant mold a lot of 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.900
 thing so it will be in my 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.689
 discretion to go over craft 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.940
 this mode and the mod link 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.890
 Now I'll be right back, he's still with 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.290
 the bugs every time i try 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.480
 turn into something like click 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.760
 No ac choosing what I get 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.950
 transform is the cattle because of 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.469
 my then I'll take it now and 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.039
 I'll be back later, I'll talk later. 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.530
 I came back now and now I want to show 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:01:00.530
 that cool moggi that where you can 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.530
 turn wolves 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.159
 you can turn clippers 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.689
 you can also use mature while 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.119
 You're turned into such bugs. 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.520
 as an adult's body is worse 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.530
 nightmare of us all 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.530
 it's no use even if you can 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.650
 you can turn other animals like 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:38.640
 spider you can stick on the wall in 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:42.170
 year after year but here everyone 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.170
 I do not know for the tv 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.180
 maybe farid school 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.510
 okay I'm being attacked by these 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.560
 bugs here is how we even saw you 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:07.470
 being 1211 monster 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.170
 the furniture will continue to attack you 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:15.270
 Can you turn one in Berlin? 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:19.620
 the independent natura is to have several 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:22.680
 other critters like a ceo ocelot the law 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.650
 That I'm going to get here quickly. 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.600
 ready now you can already see better 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.240
 already the majority of the animals with armor 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.950
 It's very strange so I'm going to take 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:37.740
 one hard of them and leave it is only strength 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:42.150
 also changes different from the bugs that 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.860
 you get type only if it's an ocelot only 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.420
 has more strength than if you smoke 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.740
 line 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:54.140
 It's normal, that's right, you can become a 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:58.560
 fish only the river of the fish is that it only 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:05.550
 walk fast in the water that saw him 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:07.230
 walk slowly, give it when you already 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:12.000
 When you walk there in the water. 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:15.480
 he turns into a bug faster than he has until 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.180
 You understand why I was coming after me? 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:28.110
 seeing them and can also become a 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:30.989
 dragonfly that are the animals that do not have 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.180
 name that they added in the mod 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:36.690
 Where you can turn you can become a 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.519
 snow man but this is a man from 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.769
 snow different from maine craft 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.920
 if you do not take the snowball or leave the 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:47.090
 snow where you pass what is good and 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:55.410
 Bad why I should snow everywhere 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:59.820
 and you can turn the hook you can 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:02.870
 turn a blaze that animal that lives 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.870
 fortress of neder 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:10.370
 but unfortunately for what seems the only 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:13.040
 flying in survivor the only flying 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.320
 survivor is the boss 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.260
 What is it, will you? Will you? 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.269
 to continue flying and it was to be 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.290
 wait right 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:28.730
 coming back here because active has the goal in 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:32.120
 you can also turn the page the 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:36.080
 google comes in armor and dies here 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.640
 you can be an armor goal see if 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:45.320
 you can put more of the fat 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:47.660
 it's kind of like this, not that 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.340
 it seems that's just it but the bug 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.340
 Ugly is a signing goal 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.720
 now there's something else I want 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:00.230
 show but this one lets us use 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.970
 which kim ki-nam buga and I enjoy and 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:06.850
 Come back here to finish the video until 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:12.380
 He said, "What is sleep today?" 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:15.830
 bobrun joÃ£o and the foot of beans 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:18.740
 here is one of the ways 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:23.960
 this show that gives to you and for you 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:26.000

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.250

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.780
 you 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:37.610
 they die crushed then it is 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.350
 basically this did not have much 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.760
 to show in this template 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:46.880

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:49.610

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:53.180
 of one mod and other mini games 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:56.060
 craft is not ours for other games without 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:06:00.020

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:02.140
