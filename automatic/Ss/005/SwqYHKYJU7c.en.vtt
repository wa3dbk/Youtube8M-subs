00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.940
 how to draw a koala first 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.219
 we will start with the head that will be this 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.469
 circle and then this circle that I've 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:18.420
 done in the middle will be the nose other 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:21.090
 circle more for one eye and another for the 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.410
 another one now let's make the pupil with 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.180
 another circle and another and here on one side 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:34.469
 to make it funny we will make a 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:39.719
 smile and this is the shine and let's 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:42.239
 paint the black pupils we are going to 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:46.969
 to do like some waves and little hairs like that 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.969
 for the ears you see 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.730
 very simple and now with this line 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:57.770
 come on we do like this 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:01.129
 and so and so and now like this and this will be the 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:09.860
 arm and now the back another stroke here 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:16.190
 to do the hind legs and now the 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:18.500
 tail like the ears and this is the 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.000
 fingers and very small hands for 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:26.869
 to hold on to the tree that we are now going to 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:30.530
 draw vale let's start here 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:35.149
 this will be a trunk so that a 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:40.430
 twig we are going to put a leaf very well 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:44.680
 so simple it and a few drops of 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.680
 typical waves of trees worth 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.190
 and these cookies are going to make a 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.590
 texture of hairs so very simple with 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.440
 small lines that will go on 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.210
 direction according to the extremities the 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.429
 head then we will try to make them 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.660
 little lines that are doing a little bit 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:17.640
 circle of the head and so it remains 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:19.350
 something more a little more detailed we are going to 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.209
 put here what is the interior of 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.209
 the ears with two or three lines 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:31.700
