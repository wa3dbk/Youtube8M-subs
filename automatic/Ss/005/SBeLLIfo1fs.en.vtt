 today fast vidyo on my way to 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.450
 we like scarf on the head in the middle 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.370
 asked by two or three 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.049
 subscribers and that I found super 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.170
 interesting to film so that I have you 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.640
 filmed four different ways of us 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.380
 and the fola on the head 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.539
 so it's for different pressure 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.539
 who so suddenly could choose in 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.929
 do what we like to see the method 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.270
 Coue most me well and I hope that 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.660
 video or there and like that responds to 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.980
 your questions or some questions 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.110
 also if you want to know where I got this 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.149
 scarf and both at home at 14 bitch 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.420
 euros 95 and I seem to have seen 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.680
 recently still in stores so 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.079
 you want to get it and is 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.360
 still so go and we 'll start 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.129
 physical so first of all you 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.510
 start taking your scarf and where 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.399
 the customer in two stages form a 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.620
 triangle like this so me I think 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.780
 that half because it's easy 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.699
 then 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.079
 you take the base so the part the 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:07.159
 longest of the triangle and you 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:11.240
 find inward from tournai or 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:13.490
 to roll up tatra 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.740
 to form a kind of big ribbon like 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.740
 these and after you can start 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.960
 this first technique is 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.609
 currently the most common you 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.170
 can see me wearing my headscarf 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:28.670
 this way sickly and saglam 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.859
 members for in my money out 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.719
 recently so pleases you place your 

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:34.609
 green scarf to the head and bring back the 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:38.409
 all the way to the front to create a kind of 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:38.409
 cross and you and us at the real 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.000
 I 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.340
 the second technique is to place 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.410
 your crazy there in the front of your head of 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.390
 preference pushes to the side actually 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.360
 a double trick with the scarf and we 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.100
 finish with a double in the front for 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.140
 have a nice knot just open 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.950
 and to place both ends of 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.950
 drunk caste 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.220
 e 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.940
 or for you use your color 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.709
 as certainly to be different you 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.260
 want to keep the hair in the front 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:50.100
 and just separate the front parts 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:53.790
 and back otherwise you can jump 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:57.000
 this step so just pass the 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.400
 scarf behind the head underneath and 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.910
 you made a double turn and where we 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.910
 and downstairs 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.660
 the 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.689
 when I use this technique of 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.849
 scarf I also like strapped my hair 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:33.620
 have messi good that is to say that I 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.939
 take a rubber band I tie sir to 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.400
 the back in China 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:40.389
 and Thursday is to give a little air 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.389
 neglect past 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.420
 1 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.650
 and 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.330
 for this last way to tie his 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.920
 scarf amp of them fabric 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.560
 only in two to form a 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.780
 complete triangle to the head with the 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.700
 slope at the front we also bring back the 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.530
 other sides in the front and we start to 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.220
 we and that are too tight allow 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.220
 small adjustments 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.740
 once everything is in place we can 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.150
 squeeze harder and roll up the 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.740
 triangle slope inside 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.690
 we then realize several small 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.620
 knots that we then found again a 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.620
 inwards 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.220
 and 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.680
 this is my life that these are the four 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:03.630
 ways to wear or there I hope it 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.630
 we enjoyed and soon house
