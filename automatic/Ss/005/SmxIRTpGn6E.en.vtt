00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.390
 and a few days ago we witnessed the 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.639
 new trailer for bz the resurrection of 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.290
 offer in the we could appreciate many 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.209
 things that left us with our mouths 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.400
 open like for example the new 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:16.470
 good offer but 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.539
 before we got there we started showing 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.359
 the trailer scene by scene and we see 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.490
 our opinions everything starts with 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.840
 trunks of the future eliminating a wick 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.730
 freezer 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.369
 subsequently the ship of 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.800
 freezer coming to earth then 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.050
 we can appreciate the warriors z but 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.860
 not only that but also to jaco the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.900
 of the manga 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.750
 jaco the galactic patrolman also 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.580
 created by akira toriyama for all 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.470
 those people who do not have even the 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.780
 the slightest idea of ​​the manga hack or the 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.750
 Galactic patrolman, I'll explain 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.970
 a little bit of it is a manga created by 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.760
 akira toriyama that links with the series 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.460
 Dragon Ball manga premiered 13 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.580
 July 2013 in the weekly shonen together 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.610

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.170
 the North American version this sleeve of 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.149
 comedy tells the story of a 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.900
 mighty galactic patrolman named 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.850
 jacob 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.890
 is stranded on earth the 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.290
 events are narrated by Mori 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.600
 who starts his story 10 years ago 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.940
 Jaco was sent to earth to 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.940
 stop a sayayin from the planet vegeta 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.280
 bulma's older sister I say is one of 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.980
 the main protagonists together with 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.990
 jaco and an older man love and those 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.420
 characters from other manga series 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.180
 toriyama make cameos as well as a 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.580
 Martian One I like an alien Tex Tex 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.180
 hake of fifth vigor or curry gas 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.890
 Goku the grandfather Gohan and the Briet family 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.260
 if they want the whole history of 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.030
 this sleeve and other sleeves created by 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.840
 Akira Toriyama leave it in 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.060
 comments 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.540
 good to not get out of the subject let's continue 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.940
 with what is shown in this trailer 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.590
 is shown to offer coming out of your mini 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:02:00.140
 xd ship is subsequently shown to goku 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.150
 then he shows up to offer and then he 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.550
 they show all the freser soldiers 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.680
 flying one after one you hear the 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.690
 Hormone maximum music and wait 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.310
 a moment apparently jaco also 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.740
 will take your ship in this new movie 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.440
 it will be that we will also see the sister of 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.420
 bulma then it is shown to the master roshi 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.300
 throwing a kamehameha to one of the 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.970
 Soldiers offer then shown 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.850
 attention have thrown their kickoff to about 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.850
 how many soldiers to offer then 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:32.000
 It shows creel and then itching shown 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.700
 attacking with your energy waves and 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.950
 then it shows goian in ssj well 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.200
 now I explain to them apparently goian has 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.420
 lost his mystical state or maybe not 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.170
 but it is curious that follow in 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.209
 ssj in this trailer even then it shows 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.239
 sober with your ring that there is something very 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.920
 curious about it later on then it 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.800
 shows to this magician the scene seems 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.210
 when to offer it kills or something 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.380
 and then it shows to goku against offering 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.060
 subsequently offer is shown 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.100
 saying I'll show you my new 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.080
 transformation 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.050
 then it shows of goku as dodging 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.960
 a freezer attack and attention here 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.850
 is the new freezer transformation 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:16.550
 Many liked it and others were a 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.920
 total disappointment in me the personal thing is not 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.020
 it shocked me because I was waiting for 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.080
 another type of transformation but then 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:27.140
 to see the trailer about 150 times xd me 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.210
 ended up pleasing then in the trailer it 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.980
 shows freezer attacking ghost with 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.290
 a supernova and goku throwing their 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.420
 kamehameha there is a big explosion and 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.260
 then you see a freezer flying with a 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.000
 aura very similar to ssj god then it looks 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.230
 to goku breaking them who sans of 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.060
 freezer then returns to Jaco 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.710
 then he shows bulma with his new 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.540
 design 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:55.160
 then it shows the battery gang 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:58.310
 mai and then it shows number 18 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.709
 then it shows golden freezer then 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.760
 It shows vegueta loading your key or 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.890
 as many user 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.760
 believe that it is becoming the 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.829
 ssj blue god and choir is responsible for one of 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.310
 the heavy ones there is a very curious 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:15.110
 curious of this character later 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.540
 then a scene without 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.239
 explaining why why Goián falls to 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.220
 floor without any scratch 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:25.760
 then it is shown to grow in 3d or 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.770
 better known as 3d background xd and here 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.229
 they show a fight between freezer 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.949
 between goku and freezer in which it shows 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:36.560
 that fraser has great power before goku 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:38.780
 then they show up to bills and wish then 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.910
 It shows vegueta without any scratch 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.460
 and goku all hurt what this 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.080
 get to the following conclusion that 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.410
 vegueta will be the protagonist of the 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.060
 next movie and defeat offer 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.430
 the end of the trailer is the destruction 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.460
 total of the earth with a great cry not 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:58.430
 very nice from goku now well what 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.350
 curious that I wanted to make them known not 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.389
 There is no doubt that the last trailer of the 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.340
 movie has given much to talk about not 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:06.530
 just because the transformation was shown 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.390
 to offer but also by appearances 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.120
 unexpected like that of jacob 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.860
 galactic patrolman a detail that 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.230
 it got a lot of attention and that has been 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.270
 discussed in some pages is the fact 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.820
 that we see how piccolo is beaten 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.650
 by one of the soldiers offering this 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.360
 red-skinned soldier has been the subject of 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.610
 discussion since some fans 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.690
 they claim that it is a transformation of 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.960
 sorbet on which they rely to believe that 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.030
 one 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.150
 the soldier has a suit of armor 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:38.450
 color two has a koala nose 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.550
 similar to that of sorbet 3 in the trailer 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:43.010
 you see sorbet use a kind of 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:46.040
 ring is believed that that way gets 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.360
 transform does not sound preposterous the 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.670
 fact that sorbet bette could 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.700
 transform an element that you have had 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:54.590
 several enemies as we know it will be 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.510
 was in charge of the army of freser 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.520
 after the death of this one the fact that 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.500
 when transformed could face 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.510
 piccolo is a sign of his great power 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.570
 something that would be good for someone who 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:07.550
 lead an army even if it sounds good 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.490
 theory there is a detail that does not fit and 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:12.920
 that's the armor if we look closely 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.820
 we will notice that the armor of the soldier is 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.400
 different from short bet 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.290
 by the shoulder pads and the chest in fact its 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.390
 owner is more like the one he uses 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:23.490
 it's gum that includes image 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:26.280
 to compare only with some 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.440
 variations the only way this 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.080
 character it would be sorbet would be 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.940
 that the armor will change in these 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.890
 moments we can not affirm if that 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.990
 character that attacks piccolo is about 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.820
 I veto just another character neither 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.920
 neither can we affirm the use that 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.660
 will have that ring those answers will 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:44.490
 they will give until the premiere of the movie or 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:46.770
 until some reliable source what 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.380
 reveal but there is no doubt that the 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.060
 trailer has given what to talk about 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:54.300
 bardot could appear in this new 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:56.190
 film dragon ball z for other due 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.560
 to that in an interview to the cgera 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:01.320
 Toriyama was asked and Bardock will be 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.570
 that we can see it again and well this one 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.430
 he said yes but only in flashback that 

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:07.440
 frizer remember when he destroyed the 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:09.480
 beautiful planet although many fans 

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.700
 they want this character to return to 

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.710
 just like benito that although we saw everything 

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:16.170
 what freezer could do maybe not 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:18.180
 everything may have a hidden power what 

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:20.190
 which they need to create a crime or 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.890
 any other type of merger or also 

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:26.070
 a crime ss 

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:28.020
 ssj god I do not know what you think when 

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:31.530
 the movie is in the movies not them 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:33.830
 would like to see it in 4dx to feel the 

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:36.810
 blows and action in this same format 

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:39.060
 because you can support this cause in the 

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.590
 description I will leave you a page for

 much in editing it because I showed the 

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:57.690
 full trailer scene by scene and 

00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:00.020
