00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
here I can get to it right there the

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.020 
here I can get to it right there the
bees<00:02:22.830> are<00:02:23.070> coming<00:02:23.100> in<00:02:23.490> through<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.790> side<00:02:24.000> and

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.360 
bees are coming in through the side and
pollinating<00:02:24.870> so<00:02:25.110> not<00:02:25.650> having<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.010> do<00:02:26.100> a<00:02:26.130> whole

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
pollinating so not having to do a whole

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.850 
pollinating so not having to do a whole
lot<00:02:26.520> of<00:02:26.580> pollinating<00:02:27.180> by<00:02:27.390> hand<00:02:27.860> cantaloupe

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
lot of pollinating by hand cantaloupe

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.350 
lot of pollinating by hand cantaloupe
are<00:02:29.100> just<00:02:30.000> really<00:02:30.980> starting<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.010> take<00:02:32.280> off<00:02:32.490> the

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
are just really starting to take off the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:40.040 
are just really starting to take off the
big<00:02:33.570> deal<00:02:33.810> is<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:37.010> right<00:02:38.010> there<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.810> have<00:02:39.810> set

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
big deal is that right there I have set

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.199 
big deal is that right there I have set
up<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.380> irrigation<00:02:40.910> for<00:02:43.190> automatic<00:02:44.209> watering

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
up the irrigation for automatic watering

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.890 
up the irrigation for automatic watering
of<00:02:45.570> these<00:02:45.870> plants<00:02:46.260> here<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:47.600> figured<00:02:48.600> I<00:02:48.690> won't

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
of these plants here I figured I won't

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.000 
of these plants here I figured I won't
walk<00:02:49.110> in<00:02:49.320> between<00:02:49.530> their<00:02:51.230> lease<00:02:52.230> until<00:02:52.470> I

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
walk in between their lease until I

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.949 
walk in between their lease until I
figure<00:02:53.580> out<00:02:53.610> a<00:02:53.730> different<00:02:54.030> way<00:02:54.239> maybe<00:02:54.600> to<00:02:54.720> do

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
figure out a different way maybe to do

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.040 
figure out a different way maybe to do
that<00:02:55.170> I<00:02:55.760> might<00:02:56.760> run<00:02:56.940> it<00:02:57.090> overhead<00:02:57.480> eventually

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
that I might run it overhead eventually

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.110 
that I might run it overhead eventually
