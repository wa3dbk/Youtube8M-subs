00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:29.609
 this is what our first approach, a historical analysis will be 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.179
 human action 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:33.700
 within geographic space 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.820
 begin 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.620
 approach we need to know very well how human societies 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.980
 have been organizing over time 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.370
 initially during prehistory 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.760
 We want to ap 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:53.010
 man as taxing nature and in this tributary being the rational use of 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.920
 all natural resources 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.999
 when we get to the activity 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:02.259
 we've already found a man who needs to use water as an instrument 

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:03.220
 of state 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.789
 the formation of theocratic monarchies 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:08.420
 will allow this state 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.850
 dominate production 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.220
 already starting the stocking already start the silage 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.610
 already begins another series of organizations that will transform the use 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:22.420
 from soil 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.700
 a much more intensive way 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.299
 it is these companies 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.670
 called monarchies which is the character of irrigated water will appear in the east 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.079
 next 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:34.410
 recognized as the Middle East 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.039
 Egypt to Mesopotamia 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:40.039
 the Persia and there the rich deborah people 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.700
 during the period of classical dignity 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.399
 gregory romania 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:46.729
 we will have 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:53.000
 the development of slave societies in these societies beyond the 

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:54.990
 use of natural resources 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.550
 we will also have an increase in the commercial process relating 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.890
 mainly the exploitation of colonies 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.710
 along the smaller asia 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.069
 and all that region called equality I wanted 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.979
 in the final average period 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.839
 the man initially in the stage called the high middle age 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.480
 use steel annually 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.470
 its natural resources the problem is that the system used in that period 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.579
 that everyone knows called feudalism 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.340
 I was just judo 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.389
 in a way very attached to a feudal lord 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:34.880
 of this dependence on the servant 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.759
 in relation to the feudal lord and the land 

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:43.799
 promoted the formation of a society of character kiko mobilia or 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:49.329
 in a society where power was based on land I see no problem of the 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:50.390
 human action 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.320
 we already have a society where economic power is defined by land 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.439
 In the lake, what's going to happen? 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:00.799
 in land use 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.999
 will start to get much more intensive 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:06.999
 in the period called low average age 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.649
 was exactly in the 14th century 

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:16.869
 we will have the first signs that the boat could no longer hold so much 

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:19.049
 farm 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.019
 around 1315 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.379
 we had the first big hunger 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:32.779
 ie the relation of production and the relation of consumption became unbalanced 

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:38.139
 it saw much more consumption around 36 million people 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.560
 in the accident the location 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.000
 and there were production for only twenty million people 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.700
 after calculation was made 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.830
 by the famous scholar tomas malthus 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:50.739
 what did you say 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.659
 at a particular historical moment 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:55.430
 there will be no food 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.090
 because agricultural production is growing ethically 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.640
 but the production of manager 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.780
 geometrically so that these balance with the avaÃ­ at the beginning of the 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.780
 14th century but did not end there 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.429
 the continuity of the soil expansion process 

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:16.989
 will cause 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.799
 around 1348 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.780
 the appearance of the first great and api of mine 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.699
 in the European accident 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.419
 the famous black plague 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.969
 which was caused by lack of hygiene by mouse proliferation ipva is 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:35.580
 to cause in europe 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.920
 16 million dead 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:40.300
 now the geographic space 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.199
 its first major problems is lived speaking of great problems the 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:48.520
 current time but there in the period of the low average age 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.880
 the man has already lived two situations 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.970
 of great impact 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:54.930
 in relationships 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:01.100
 social and economic conditions immediately after the Black Death, the accident is the 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.170
 yours will suffer the second big and hungry 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.180
 1360 to one thousand three hundred and seventy 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.900
 again there is an imbalance between production 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.969
 and the kosovo there comes the question 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:23.589
 but there was no death during the black plague I answered yes there was 

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:27.960
 but the highest number of dead were certain. 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.509
 were laborers there 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:33.830
 you have to remember a related skill 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.150
 ability to understand geographic space 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.839
 and to human action what is 

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:41.659
 black budapest ' 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:43.940
 the death of deer 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.290
 no one wanted to work in the feudal period 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:53.730
 What I can not do is be a grandmother, my nobleman. No church member only serves the 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.110
 worker 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.210
 it was the process 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.280
 production if the deforestation was greater than deer 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.530
 decreases the labor force 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.500
 in the feudal period at the end of the 14th century 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.319
 we have the overcoming of the feudal order 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:13.740
 and this overcoming will be done 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.879
 by a class that is half way through the 12th century 

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:19.210
 the bourgeoisie 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.400
 and this class will bring 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.580
 commercial capitalism here usually in the vestibular 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.180
 baby it's called you 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.389
 it's very important 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:34.289
 care the caregiver 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:37.580
 often also appears the term 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.800
 for capitalization 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.710
 in mind with these terms in the enem and its vestibular 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:44.729
 go ahead
