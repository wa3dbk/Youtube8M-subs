00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:15.990
 today 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.640
 I will try to make you understand we have enough to make you 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.600
 understand 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.909
 the best we can 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:26.639
 what is the immune system and what is the true role of microbes and 

00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:31.529
 virus in relation to our body in general the project being of not 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.340
 to be fatal to the project the micro of rmc an international economic project 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.730
 who tries to understand the role of microbes a party that is bacteria 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.340
 and microbes in general 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.600
 in the functioning of the human body in the vision not serene before like the 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.819
 body for pass 

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:49.200
 and completely healthy 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.060
 and that microbes that is necessarily from the outside one has to 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.060
 not just protect all microorganisms 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.150
 studies in the face cooperation with the company and who lives from this 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.070
 cooperation with our environment 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.160
 we ourselves create our own misfortune finally and your own 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.820
 sickness and that's a fact 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.520
 transformation forgiveness and a succession of bacterial spacings 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.420
 that does not give natural form system not only does it ultimately 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.230
 immune was time 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.470
 in time there the thesis of the industrial accident cic 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.340
 we consider that these are the viruses 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.450
 or that it is bacteria that are responsible for the disease 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.610
 we could compare the immune system 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.670
 stop a sting ttr 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.730
 who receive novelties 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.590
 the larva is a predator 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.100
 so what happens and that predators 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.700
 they are revealers 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.829
 populations actually I realized that in many traditions 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:51.060
 whether it is that of traditional Chinese medicine whether in 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.950
 homeopathy 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.950
 whether in osteopathy or the medicine of tomorrow 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.920
 in fact one realizes that the disease is always going on is always developing in 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.780
 two phases a stranger who passes who is not aware m a strike of 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.700
 trash 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.580
 Ivory 3 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.969
 it is a village not too precise 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:12.969
 no waste in the street 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.569
 donations there everyone not to worry while in reality there 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.749
 we should rejoice because we are taking out his trash is true 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:23.619
 we are recovering our team 

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:27.009
 and so the first impacted with which he is in contact all over the 

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:28.379
 mother's bacteria 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:29.649
 at the World level 

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:31.629
 nomination contestant 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.230
 you want to be far from the defenseless system of defense 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.230
 where you have to wage a ruthless war against the virus 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:42.650
 he gave his daughters 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.410
 damn it 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.200
 could it be that praying with the quality of the water 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.589
 and the sanitary quality of the environment 

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:50.869
 remove infectious diseases 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:53.869
 when you do a mass evacuation 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:58.650
 you're going to have an increase in bonuses and I showed you the end 

00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:59.330
 of the year 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.780
 decay curves of infectious diseases which showed that 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.730
 90 to deal with cases of infectious disease mortality due to 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.509
 infectious diseases had already disappeared 

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:12.509
 before we introduce most vaccines 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:18.449
 when you can now better understand why there is an explosion 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:19.889
 of autism 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.069
 why an autoimmune disease explosion 

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:26.749
 why there is an explosion of allergic disease 

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:30.809
 I invite you not to be reconciled with viruses and microbes 

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:34.729
 and bacteria and have attended military no longer as a system of 

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:37.639
 defense but as a system of learning and treatment of 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:41.069
 information and I think you will live much better here I thank 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.119
 a lot
