00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 is the computer teacher where 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.509
 computer teacher and good work 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.210
 in the fp here in the center of profession 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.670
 of professional training and here I have 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.820
 adult students usually seven 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.980
 students try to occupy each 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.670
 time with a student the two machines with 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.130
 speaking programs and a single medium work 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.340
 that gets complicated because when you're with 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.780
 every student 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.040
 and can be in the individual class 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.450
 you saw that a teacher of 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.280
 computer science of a secondary school 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.980
 is doing some screen and everything 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.840
 others are following it good I can not 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.540
 do that as much as be with each one 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.530
 unemployed hour is a very little 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.300
 of advanced student 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.449
 I put it with headphones we have another 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.340
 machine with also conditioning for 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:54.020
 that they practice while I of classes what 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.880
 that we use is a screen reader 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.180
 which is reading you to everything you're going 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:03.010
 doing on the computer through the 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.010
 keyboard move the arrow to ernesto 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:12.960
 on the desktop and visualize it because 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.630
 we can not visualize it you are playing 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.320
 and where are you here in an icon tells you to 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:23.930
 that belongs or my pc or the ares is not 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.930
 certain center 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.760
 a space if it's a button you can give 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:35.930
 space in the program this 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:37.480
 the truth that it was a huge change in 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.280
 where technology refers 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.740
 usually 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.650
 my school to take out super students 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.619
 advanced it happens that not everyone has the 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.810
 same the same incentive or not all 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:54.340
 give him 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.409
 the same use nothing else here in 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.770
 in the fp they are two years 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.399
 and they are received from pc operator when a 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.399
 student comes 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.890
 we have an interview first you 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.990
 I wonder if he had some knowledge 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.750
 computer previews 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:16.319
 if the one starts from scratch we have to 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.719
 start from recognizing a cpu 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.340
 and tell him he has a cpu inside 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:23.519
 what is each component of the 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.129
 compu after a lot of keyboard the keyboard 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:29.360
 it's super important to be able to manage 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:31.950
 in everything that comes after 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.650
 keyboard recognition dictation 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.290
 write words letters first the 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.000
 letters of the computer and then the keys 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.330
 specific to the common 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.220
 of the pc on the keyboard and if there is time 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.630
 of the program we can not only reach 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.790
 see other things like sound editing 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.700
 make turner backup and other 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.380
 skype and other things that are already more 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.920
 they are extras 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.580
 good 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.760
 that if there is time you see I am 60 years old and 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.950
 well I started last year here very 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.370
 good classes are barbarians I think that 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.290
 he is a good teacher and very clear 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.890
 didactic 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.990
 this 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.590
 and he's a good friend because we're 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.190
 we made friends 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:23.330
 It is very enjoyable to teach and that is 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:26.510
 important is not that you get tired and you do not 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.840
 bored I need an activity too 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:33.019
 I am a mechanical technician received and I 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.750
 like everything that is the knowledge or the 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:39.260
 science the fact of learning computer 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:43.120
 for example and be able to enter the internet to 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.120
 wherever it is for me it is very important
