hi I'm gene joiner with unbelievable

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.619 
hi I'm gene joiner with unbelievable
acres<00:00:02.399> here<00:00:02.639> in<00:00:02.669> West<00:00:02.909> Palm<00:00:03.090> Beach<00:00:03.120> Florida

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
acres here in West Palm Beach Florida

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.059 
acres here in West Palm Beach Florida
and<00:00:04.110> we're<00:00:04.230> going<00:00:04.380> to<00:00:04.470> be<00:00:04.560> talking<00:00:04.830> about

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
and we're going to be talking about

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.700 
and we're going to be talking about
doing<00:00:05.460> a<00:00:05.759> cocktail<00:00:06.000> tree<00:00:06.600> putting<00:00:07.230> multiple

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
doing a cocktail tree putting multiple

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.089 
doing a cocktail tree putting multiple
graphs<00:00:07.980> on<00:00:08.280> your<00:00:09.030> avocados<00:00:09.450> seasons<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:10.200> this

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
graphs on your avocados seasons and this

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.220 
graphs on your avocados seasons and this
one<00:00:11.340> that's<00:00:11.519> got<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.790> straight<00:00:12.330> Center<00:00:12.990> and

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
one that's got a straight Center and

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.140 
one that's got a straight Center and
then<00:00:13.620> it's<00:00:13.740> got<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:13.950> branch<00:00:14.280> off<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.910> side

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
then it's got a branch off to the side

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.760 
then it's got a branch off to the side
so<00:00:15.540> we're<00:00:15.719> going<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:15.900> put<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.139> different

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
so we're going to put a different

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.279 
so we're going to put a different
avocado<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.760> each<00:00:17.880> one<00:00:18.180> hopefully<00:00:19.170> if

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
avocado and each one hopefully if

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.400 
avocado and each one hopefully if
they're<00:00:19.500> successful<00:00:19.710> when<00:00:20.460> they<00:00:21.020> grow<00:00:22.020> out<00:00:22.050> to

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
they're successful when they grow out to

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.380 
they're successful when they grow out to
get<00:00:22.529> about<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.800> year<00:00:23.130> year-and-a-half<00:00:23.580> old<00:00:23.910> nor

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
get about a year year-and-a-half old nor

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.150 
get about a year year-and-a-half old nor
fruiting<00:00:24.840> then<00:00:25.500> you<00:00:25.619> can<00:00:25.769> have<00:00:25.890> two

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
fruiting then you can have two

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.009 
fruiting then you can have two
completely<00:00:26.340> different<00:00:26.760> types<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.359> applicati

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
completely different types of applicati

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.160 
completely different types of applicati
on<00:00:28.320> one<00:00:28.890> crimp<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:30.570> don't<00:00:30.750> have<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.960> stop

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
on one crimp and you don't have to stop

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.049 
on one crimp and you don't have to stop
with<00:00:31.380> two<00:00:31.619> if<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.949> have<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.160> really<00:00:32.700> multi

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
grafted to a different variety and you

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.569 
grafted to a different variety and you
can<00:00:38.579> have<00:00:38.760> two<00:00:39.719> three<00:00:39.750> five<00:00:40.559> ten<00:00:41.040> as<00:00:41.219> many<00:00:41.460> as

can have two three five ten as many as

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.940 
can have two three five ten as many as
you<00:00:41.700> want<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.969> put<00:00:42.149> on<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.629> really<00:00:43.410> amaze<00:00:43.770> your

you want to put on and really amaze your

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.040 
you want to put on and really amaze your
friends<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.489> neighbors<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.570> let's<00:00:45.780> go<00:00:45.930> ahead

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
friends and neighbors so let's go ahead

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.380 
friends and neighbors so let's go ahead
and<00:00:46.200> we've<00:00:47.190> got<00:00:47.370> some<00:00:47.550> graphs<00:00:47.789> with<00:00:48.030> already

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
and we've got some graphs with already

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.810 
and we've got some graphs with already
prepared<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:50.070> want<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.399> match<00:00:50.550> your

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
prepared and you want to match your

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.000 
prepared and you want to match your
graph<00:00:51.030> hood<00:00:51.329> with<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.690> size<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.559> pizzas

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
graph hood with the size of the pizzas

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.130 
graph hood with the size of the pizzas
going<00:00:53.219> on<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:53.730> this<00:00:53.940> one<00:00:54.180> here<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.719> ideal

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
going on so this one here is the ideal

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.330 
going on so this one here is the ideal
size<00:00:55.469> for<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.610> smaller<00:00:57.030> branch<00:00:58.129> this<00:00:59.129> one

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
size for this smaller branch this one

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.700 
size for this smaller branch this one
here<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.760> lot<00:01:00.059> bigger<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.750> it's<00:01:01.379> going<00:01:01.620> to

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
here is a lot bigger and it's going to

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.950 
here is a lot bigger and it's going to
be<00:01:01.859> better<00:01:02.309> for<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:02.940> branch<00:01:03.270> with<00:01:03.570> just<00:01:03.840> a

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
be better for this branch with just a

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.410 
be better for this branch with just a
little<00:01:04.080> bit<00:01:04.260> thicker<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.769> diameter<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:06.090> let<00:01:06.299> me

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
little bit thicker in diameter so let me

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.870 
little bit thicker in diameter so let me
go<00:01:06.840> ahead<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.380> take<00:01:07.680> printing<00:01:08.220> shears<00:01:08.520> and

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
go ahead and take printing shears and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.510 
go ahead and take printing shears and
cut<00:01:08.909> off<00:01:09.180> most<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.470> leaves<00:01:10.650> on<00:01:10.950> these<00:01:11.130> I'll

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
cut off most of the leaves on these I'll

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.170 
cut off most of the leaves on these I'll
just<00:01:11.729> leave<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.150> portion<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.689> one<00:01:12.930> leaf<00:01:13.170> and

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
just leave a portion of one leaf and

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.609 
just leave a portion of one leaf and
we'll<00:01:15.180> do<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:17.119> branch<00:01:18.119> here<00:01:18.479> first<00:01:18.900> with<00:01:19.439> this

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
we'll do the branch here first with this

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.170 
we'll do the branch here first with this
larger<00:01:20.070> piece<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.640> I'm<00:01:20.729> going<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.000> use<00:01:21.150> a

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
larger piece and I'm going to use a

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.890 
larger piece and I'm going to use a
graph<00:01:21.570> called<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:22.020> venir<00:01:22.350> graph<00:01:22.640> which<00:01:23.900> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
graph called a venir graph which the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.230 
graph called a venir graph which the
piece<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.350> want<00:01:25.500> really<00:01:26.490> only<00:01:26.640> needs<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.090> be

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
piece you want really only needs to be

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.020 
piece you want really only needs to be
about<00:01:27.420> three<00:01:27.840> inches<00:01:28.460> you<00:01:29.460> don't<00:01:29.640> want<00:01:29.850> too

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
about three inches you don't want too

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.179 
about three inches you don't want too
long<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.509> piece<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.020> about<00:01:31.259> three<00:01:31.650> inches<00:01:31.979> is

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
long of a piece so about three inches is

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.899 
long of a piece so about three inches is
ideal<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.710> this<00:01:34.710> one<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.159> little<00:01:35.369> bit<00:01:35.579> bowed

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
ideal and this one is a little bit bowed

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.780 
ideal and this one is a little bit bowed
which<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.600> ideal<00:01:37.110> because<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.920> stock<00:01:38.220> here<00:01:38.610> is

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
which is ideal because the stock here is

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.850 
which is ideal because the stock here is
a<00:01:38.820> little<00:01:39.030> bit<00:01:39.210> both<00:01:39.450> so<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.350> should<00:01:40.619> make<00:01:40.799> a

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
a little bit both so that should make a

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.289 
a little bit both so that should make a
really<00:01:41.520> nice<00:01:42.020> perfect<00:01:43.020> union<00:01:43.460> so<00:01:44.460> once<00:01:45.030> you've

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
really nice perfect union so once you've

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.550 
really nice perfect union so once you've
got<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.570> ready<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.979> cut<00:01:47.340> off<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:48.479> whole<00:01:49.140> length

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
got it ready you cut off a whole length

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.139 
got it ready you cut off a whole length
of<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.829> piece

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.240 

and<00:01:52.329> we'll<00:01:52.689> cut<00:01:52.869> a<00:01:52.899> little<00:01:53.200> bit<00:01:53.350> more<00:01:53.590> up<00:01:53.770> top

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
and we'll cut a little bit more up top

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.859 
and we'll cut a little bit more up top
here<00:01:54.579> so<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:56.350> is<00:01:56.560> what<00:01:56.770> we've<00:01:56.950> got<00:01:56.979> and<00:01:57.869> then

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
here so this is what we've got and then

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.889 
here so this is what we've got and then
on<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.530> stock<00:01:59.829> here<00:02:00.280> we<00:02:00.850> make<00:02:01.030> it<00:02:01.210> a<00:02:01.359> grant

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
on the stock here we make it a grant

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:16.380 
on the stock here we make it a grant
part<00:02:02.469> cut

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.660 

see<00:02:16.960> this<00:02:17.140> piece<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:17.770> this<00:02:17.980> piece<00:02:18.040> are<00:02:18.520> about

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
see this piece and this piece are about

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.150 
see this piece and this piece are about
the<00:02:18.850> same<00:02:19.120> lip<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:20.470> I'm<00:02:20.860> going<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.040> use

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
the same lip and I'm going to use

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.870 
the same lip and I'm going to use
plastic<00:02:21.670> tape<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:23.190> plastic<00:02:24.190> tape<00:02:24.400> is<00:02:24.610> real

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
plastic tape and plastic tape is real

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.540 
plastic tape and plastic tape is real
good<00:02:25.120> because<00:02:25.750> it's<00:02:25.990> being<00:02:26.620> not<00:02:26.830> adhesive<00:02:27.400> you

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
good because it's being not adhesive you

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.840 
good because it's being not adhesive you
can<00:02:27.730> remove<00:02:28.000> it<00:02:28.180> easy<00:02:28.330> to<00:02:29.250> can<00:02:30.250> you<00:02:30.340> line<00:02:30.610> this

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
can remove it easy to can you line this

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.060 
can remove it easy to can you line this
up<00:02:32.790> start<00:02:33.790> wrapping<00:02:34.540> it<00:02:34.630> and<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.680> bottom

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
up start wrapping it and the bottom

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.360 
up start wrapping it and the bottom
needs<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.490> be<00:02:36.640> overlap<00:02:37.380> about<00:02:38.380> a<00:02:38.860> couple<00:02:39.310> of

needs to be overlap about a couple of

00:02:39.370 --> 00:03:07.730 
needs to be overlap about a couple of
times<00:02:39.460> to<00:02:39.940> get<00:02:40.060> it<00:02:40.120> started

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:43.600 

that<00:03:08.550> about<00:03:09.080> the<00:03:10.080> 50%<00:03:10.680> overlap<00:03:11.520> with<00:03:11.910> each<00:03:12.030> rap

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.540 

once<00:03:44.240> it's<00:03:44.450> finished<00:03:44.720> then<00:03:45.320> you<00:03:45.560> can<00:03:45.770> leave<00:03:46.400> it

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
once it's finished then you can leave it

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.430 
once it's finished then you can leave it
exposed<00:03:46.700> or<00:03:47.330> some<00:03:47.570> people<00:03:47.870> will<00:03:48.020> cover<00:03:48.290> it

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
exposed or some people will cover it

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.760 
exposed or some people will cover it
with<00:03:48.590> plastic<00:03:48.770> or<00:03:49.340> a<00:03:49.400> little<00:03:50.390> bag<00:03:51.350> of<00:03:51.560> some

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.700 
with plastic or a little bag of some
type<00:03:51.980> just<00:03:52.370> to<00:03:52.550> keep<00:03:52.850> this<00:03:53.060> humid<00:03:53.510> but<00:03:54.260> you

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:54.710 
type just to keep this humid but you

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.380 
type just to keep this humid but you
have<00:03:54.860> to<00:03:55.010> keep<00:03:55.130> it<00:03:55.280> out<00:03:55.400> of<00:03:55.430> Sun<00:03:55.760> because<00:03:56.180> in

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
have to keep it out of Sun because in

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.150 
have to keep it out of Sun because in
the<00:03:56.450> Sun<00:03:56.690> it's<00:03:56.960> going<00:03:57.170> to<00:03:57.230> dehydrate<00:03:57.440> very

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
the Sun it's going to dehydrate very

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.670 
the Sun it's going to dehydrate very
quickly<00:03:58.430> and<00:03:58.730> overheat<00:03:59.180> so<00:04:00.050> once<00:04:00.500> you've<00:04:00.650> made

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
quickly and overheat so once you've made

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.970 
quickly and overheat so once you've made
your<00:04:00.860> graph<00:04:01.220> keep<00:04:01.580> it<00:04:01.760> in<00:04:02.000> a<00:04:02.150> shaded<00:04:02.420> area<00:04:02.980> so

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
your graph keep it in a shaded area so

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.010 
your graph keep it in a shaded area so
this<00:04:04.670> one<00:04:04.880> is<00:04:05.390> finished<00:04:07.510> we<00:04:08.510> do<00:04:08.630> the<00:04:08.780> same

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
this one is finished we do the same

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.200 
this one is finished we do the same
thing<00:04:09.290> on<00:04:09.500> the<00:04:09.680> other<00:04:09.860> ones<00:04:10.250> with<00:04:10.700> a<00:04:10.730> smaller

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:11.210 
thing on the other ones with a smaller

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.740 
thing on the other ones with a smaller
piece<00:04:11.570> again<00:04:12.380> the<00:04:12.710> smaller<00:04:13.280> diameter<00:04:14.620> and

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
piece again the smaller diameter and

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.420 
piece again the smaller diameter and
again<00:04:17.750> we're<00:04:18.200> going<00:04:18.290> to<00:04:18.350> come<00:04:18.560> up<00:04:18.590> high<00:04:19.040> where

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
again we're going to come up high where

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.500 
again we're going to come up high where
it's<00:04:19.580> a<00:04:19.640> little<00:04:19.850> bit<00:04:19.940> skinnier<00:04:20.540> and<00:04:22.330> about<00:04:23.330> the

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
it's a little bit skinnier and about the

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.220 
it's a little bit skinnier and about the
same<00:04:23.750> diameter<00:04:24.940> and<00:04:25.940> this<00:04:26.480> one<00:04:26.690> again<00:04:27.020> is

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
same diameter and this one again is

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.650 
same diameter and this one again is
bowed<00:04:27.560> a<00:04:27.590> little<00:04:27.950> bit<00:04:28.130> so<00:04:28.580> you<00:04:28.640> get<00:04:29.240> your<00:04:29.510> bow

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
bowed a little bit so you get your bow

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.860 
bowed a little bit so you get your bow
up<00:04:29.870> in<00:04:30.050> here<00:04:30.290> where<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:30.910> plant<00:04:31.910> is<00:04:32.060> otherwise

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
up in here where the plant is otherwise

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:56.129 
up in here where the plant is otherwise
bowed<00:04:33.290> to<00:04:33.590> and<00:04:33.890> it<00:04:34.010> will<00:04:34.610> come<00:04:34.940> out<00:04:35.090> very<00:04:35.450> nice

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.010 

this<00:04:56.740> one<00:04:57.300> we're<00:04:58.300> going<00:04:58.449> to<00:04:58.539> do<00:04:58.659> a<00:04:58.689> little

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
this one we're going to do a little

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.559 
this one we're going to do a little
variation<00:04:59.229> called<00:04:59.860> a<00:04:59.949> side<00:05:00.249> veneer<00:05:00.699> so<00:05:01.449> we

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:01.569 
variation called a side veneer so we

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:05.100 
variation called a side veneer so we
shaved<00:05:01.870> both<00:05:02.139> sides<00:05:02.469> and<00:05:03.479> then<00:05:04.479> we<00:05:04.509> stick<00:05:04.960> it

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
shaved both sides and then we stick it

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:12.629 
shaved both sides and then we stick it
back<00:05:05.259> in<00:05:05.650> behind<00:05:10.830> and<00:05:11.830> make<00:05:12.009> it<00:05:12.159> a<00:05:12.219> little<00:05:12.520> bit

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 
back in behind and make it a little bit

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:53.700 
back in behind and make it a little bit
shorter

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.100 

and<00:05:54.190> once<00:05:54.400> that's<00:05:54.669> in<00:05:54.940> there<00:05:55.240> then<00:05:55.540> you<00:05:55.870> just

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
and once that's in there then you just

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.200 
and once that's in there then you just
have<00:05:56.350> to<00:05:56.560> wrap<00:05:56.770> it<00:05:56.830> securely<00:05:57.550> to<00:05:57.729> keep<00:05:58.030> it

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
have to wrap it securely to keep it

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:31.629 
have to wrap it securely to keep it
basically<00:05:58.780> from<00:05:59.009> falling<00:06:00.009> out

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:31.639 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:35.290 

okay<00:06:32.389> and<00:06:32.810> we<00:06:32.960> have<00:06:33.169> our<00:06:33.650> two<00:06:33.979> graphs<00:06:34.280> each<00:06:34.969> one

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
okay and we have our two graphs each one

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.170 
okay and we have our two graphs each one
a<00:06:35.330> different<00:06:35.419> type<00:06:35.990> of<00:06:36.020> avocados<00:06:36.879> and<00:06:37.879> within

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
a different type of avocados and within

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.119 
a different type of avocados and within
about<00:06:38.360> three<00:06:39.259> to<00:06:39.409> four<00:06:39.650> weeks

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:40.129 
about three to four weeks

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:43.540 
about three to four weeks
these<00:06:41.060> are<00:06:41.300> healing<00:06:42.229> properly<00:06:42.680> then<00:06:43.310> they

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
these are healing properly then they

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.580 
these are healing properly then they
should<00:06:43.759> start<00:06:44.120> to<00:06:44.330> push<00:06:44.599> out<00:06:44.810> and<00:06:44.960> growth<00:06:45.199> a

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:45.590 
should start to push out and growth a

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.540 
should start to push out and growth a
top<00:06:46.310> can<00:06:46.669> then<00:06:46.879> be<00:06:47.060> either<00:06:47.539> bent<00:06:47.870> over<00:06:48.110> or<00:06:49.069> cut

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.550 
top can then be either bent over or cut

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.420 
top can then be either bent over or cut
off<00:06:49.699> completely<00:06:50.240> and<00:06:50.569> then<00:06:51.530> all<00:06:51.800> the<00:06:52.039> energy

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:52.430 
off completely and then all the energy

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.850 
off completely and then all the energy
from<00:06:52.580> below<00:06:52.789> will<00:06:53.240> push<00:06:53.509> into<00:06:53.870> these<00:06:54.050> small

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:54.860 
from below will push into these small

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.909 
from below will push into these small
new<00:06:55.159> graphs<00:06:55.460> and<00:06:55.759> a<00:06:56.479> way<00:06:56.659> they'll<00:06:56.930> go<00:06:57.110> and
