00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
also a mobile Wi-Fi app so that is just

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.799 
also a mobile Wi-Fi app so that is just
some<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.219> specifications<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.660> this

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
some of the specifications of this

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.650 
some of the specifications of this
little<00:01:04.080> thing<00:01:04.550> so<00:01:05.550> on<00:01:05.789> if<00:01:06.149> you<00:01:06.390> don't<00:01:06.570> know

little thing so on if you don't know

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.370 
little thing so on if you don't know
what<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.080> it's<00:01:08.039> a<00:01:08.160> little<00:01:08.280> portable<00:01:09.380> really

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
what it is it's a little portable really

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.350 
what it is it's a little portable really
small<00:01:10.820> portable<00:01:11.820> little<00:01:13.729> really<00:01:14.729> it's<00:01:15.149> just<00:01:15.210> a

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
small portable little really it's just a

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.600 
small portable little really it's just a
reasonable<00:01:15.720> thing<00:01:15.929> that<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.649> could<00:01:16.800> put<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.039> 3G

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
reasonable thing that you could put a 3G

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.300 
reasonable thing that you could put a 3G
SIM<00:01:17.820> card<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.210> or<00:01:18.450> even<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.750> 2g<00:01:19.110> SIM<00:01:19.320> card<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:20.160> it

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
SIM card in or even a 2g SIM card and it

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.480 
SIM card in or even a 2g SIM card and it
will<00:01:20.429> create<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:21.060> life<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.539> hotspot<00:01:22.369> so<00:01:23.369> they

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
will create a life a hotspot so they

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.520 
will create a life a hotspot so they
claim<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.030> can<00:01:24.060> reach<00:01:24.330> speeds<00:01:24.539> up<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.899> twenty

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
claim it can reach speeds up to twenty

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.490 
claim it can reach speeds up to twenty
one<00:01:25.560> point<00:01:25.950> six<00:01:26.060> megabytes<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.420> second<00:01:27.840> which

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
one point six megabytes a second which

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.790 
one point six megabytes a second which
is<00:01:28.649> actually<00:01:29.009> pretty<00:01:29.190> quick<00:01:29.580> but<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:31.289> chances

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
is actually pretty quick but the chances

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.199 
is actually pretty quick but the chances
of<00:01:31.830> actually<00:01:32.190> reaching<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:32.819> speed<00:01:33.030> adds

00:01:33.199 --> 00:01:33.209 
of actually reaching that speed adds

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:35.749 
of actually reaching that speed adds
they're<00:01:33.360> quite<00:01:33.660> sim<00:01:33.929> so<00:01:34.920> I'm<00:01:35.069> here<00:01:35.459> is<00:01:35.580> the

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
they're quite sim so I'm here is the

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.889 
they're quite sim so I'm here is the
microUSB<00:01:36.380> cable<00:01:37.380> this<00:01:37.709> USB<00:01:38.160> 2.0<00:01:38.819> but<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.569> camera

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
microUSB cable this USB 2.0 but I camera

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:41.809 
microUSB cable this USB 2.0 but I camera
doesn't<00:01:40.140> want<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.319> focus<00:01:40.500> on<00:01:40.800> it<00:01:40.950> but<00:01:41.580> yeah

00:01:41.809 --> 00:01:41.819 
doesn't want to focus on it but yeah

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:46.210 
doesn't want to focus on it but yeah
there's<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:43.489> and<00:01:44.489> there's<00:01:45.330> a<00:01:45.450> few<00:01:45.630> little

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
other things about it there is a

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.330 
other things about it there is a
companion<00:02:02.910> app<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:04.319> can<00:02:04.500> also<00:02:04.649> um<00:02:04.950> have

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
companion app that you can also um have

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.969 
companion app that you can also um have
a<00:02:05.399> lookout<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.729> tells<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.709> what<00:02:07.709> speeds

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
a lookout that tells you what speeds

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.249 
a lookout that tells you what speeds
you're<00:02:08.250> getting<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.940> how<00:02:09.929> much<00:02:10.080> detail

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
you're getting and how much detail

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.750 
you're getting and how much detail
you've<00:02:10.619> used<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:11.129> that<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.310> actually<00:02:11.580> quite

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
you've used so that is actually quite

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.520 
you've used so that is actually quite
good<00:02:11.970> because<00:02:12.660> you're<00:02:12.989> probably<00:02:13.230> going<00:02:13.470> to

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
good because you're probably going to

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.160 
good because you're probably going to
have<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.680> day<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:13.950> limit<00:02:14.370> on<00:02:14.489> your<00:02:14.520> sim<00:02:15.020> so<00:02:16.020> I'm

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
have a day to limit on your sim so I'm

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.589 
have a day to limit on your sim so I'm
just<00:02:16.890> opening<00:02:17.340> up<00:02:17.459> we<00:02:17.970> can<00:02:18.150> actually<00:02:18.420> take<00:02:18.569> a

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
just opening up we can actually take a

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.390 
just opening up we can actually take a
look<00:02:18.810> at<00:02:19.050> how<00:02:19.200> many<00:02:19.319> milliamps<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:19.980> battery

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
look at how many milliamps the battery

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.520 
look at how many milliamps the battery
is<00:02:20.550> but<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.209> is<00:02:21.330> about<00:02:21.599> the<00:02:21.720> same<00:02:21.900> size<00:02:21.930> as<00:02:22.470> a

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
is but it is about the same size as a

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.900 
is but it is about the same size as a
battery<00:02:23.099> in<00:02:23.370> its<00:02:23.580> smaller<00:02:24.030> phone<00:02:24.480> um<00:02:24.959> and<00:02:25.910> the

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
battery in its smaller phone um and the

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.780 
battery in its smaller phone um and the
actual<00:02:27.180> battery<00:02:27.569> is<00:02:27.890> 1500<00:02:28.890> milliamp<00:02:29.340> hours

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
actual battery is 1500 milliamp hours

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.660 
actual battery is 1500 milliamp hours
which<00:02:30.750> year<00:02:30.989> they<00:02:31.170> say<00:02:31.409> can<00:02:31.620> give<00:02:31.799> 6<00:02:32.159> hours<00:02:32.430> of

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
which year they say can give 6 hours of

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.020 
which year they say can give 6 hours of
use<00:02:33.060> which<00:02:33.719> I<00:02:33.840> guess<00:02:34.019> is<00:02:34.200> quite<00:02:34.379> good

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
use which I guess is quite good

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.430 
use which I guess is quite good
so<00:02:35.930> I'm<00:02:36.460> on<00:02:37.460> the<00:02:37.880> actual<00:02:38.150> device<00:02:38.330> if<00:02:39.020> you<00:02:39.080> pull

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
so I'm on the actual device if you pull

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.750 
so I'm on the actual device if you pull
off<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.590> back<00:02:39.890> of<00:02:39.950> it<00:02:40.190> it<00:02:40.310> will<00:02:40.430> give<00:02:40.580> you<00:02:40.730> your

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
off the back of it it will give you your

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.120 
off the back of it it will give you your
internet<00:02:41.390> password<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.170> you<00:02:43.130> can<00:02:43.370> take<00:02:45.130> take

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
internet password and you can take take

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.770 
internet password and you can take take
out<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.430> battery<00:02:46.850> and<00:02:47.120> add<00:02:47.330> them<00:02:47.510> out<00:02:47.600> you're

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
out the battery and add them out you're

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.870 
out the battery and add them out you're
sorry<00:02:47.990> and<00:02:48.260> putting<00:02:49.160> your<00:02:49.250> SIM<00:02:49.430> card<00:02:49.460> but

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
sorry and putting your SIM card but

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.060 
sorry and putting your SIM card but
there<00:02:49.970> was<00:02:50.060> no<00:02:50.210> micro<00:02:50.690> SD<00:02:50.960> card<00:02:51.260> slot<00:02:51.350> in<00:02:51.740> this

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
there was no micro SD card slot in this

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.430 
there was no micro SD card slot in this
one

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
one

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.410 
one
so<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:54.470> actually<00:02:54.560> bought<00:02:54.950> this<00:02:54.980> for<00:02:55.310> 45<00:02:56.030> pounds

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
so I actually bought this for 45 pounds

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.750 
so I actually bought this for 45 pounds
I<00:02:56.510> think<00:02:56.540> it<00:02:56.810> was<00:02:56.959> off<00:02:57.170> Amazon<00:02:57.920> so<00:02:58.520> it's

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
I think it was off Amazon so it's

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.550 
I think it was off Amazon so it's
definitely<00:02:59.090> not<00:02:59.209> reach<00:02:59.510> EEP<00:02:59.810> what<00:03:00.200> it<00:03:00.320> does

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
definitely not reach EEP what it does

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.890 
definitely not reach EEP what it does
considering<00:03:01.459> that<00:03:01.490> you<00:03:02.240> can<00:03:02.420> do<00:03:02.600> the<00:03:02.720> same

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
considering that you can do the same

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.410 
considering that you can do the same
thing<00:03:03.200> on<00:03:03.380> your<00:03:03.440> phone<00:03:03.980> but<00:03:04.790> this<00:03:05.090> should<00:03:05.390> be

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
thing on your phone but this should be

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.410 
thing on your phone but this should be
quicker<00:03:05.750> because<00:03:06.470> on<00:03:07.030> this<00:03:08.030> has<00:03:08.830> HSPA+

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
quicker because on this has HSPA+

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.770 
quicker because on this has HSPA+
technology<00:03:11.420> that<00:03:12.110> should<00:03:12.350> be<00:03:12.470> quicker<00:03:12.739> than

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
technology that should be quicker than

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.680 
technology that should be quicker than
what<00:03:14.780> would<00:03:14.930> be<00:03:15.280> in<00:03:16.280> your<00:03:16.310> like<00:03:16.970> a<00:03:17.209> normal

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
what would be in your like a normal

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.590 
what would be in your like a normal
phone<00:03:17.900> which<00:03:18.380> would<00:03:18.500> probably<00:03:18.590> be<00:03:19.150> HSDPA<00:03:20.150> if<00:03:20.450> I

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
phone which would probably be HSDPA if I

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.370 
phone which would probably be HSDPA if I
remember<00:03:20.870> right<00:03:21.050> but<00:03:21.830> um<00:03:22.010> there's<00:03:22.700> a<00:03:22.790> micro<00:03:23.150> s

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
remember right but um there's a micro s

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.100 
remember right but um there's a micro s
in<00:03:24.380> the<00:03:24.530> micro<00:03:24.860> USB<00:03:25.220> charging<00:03:25.940> port<00:03:26.270> it's

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
in the micro USB charging port it's

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.770
