characteristics on this baby was just
plain<00:03:39.940> awesome<00:03:40.150> he<00:03:40.420> just<00:03:40.599> wants<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:40.900> float<00:03:41.170> in

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
plain awesome he just wants to float in

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.020 
plain awesome he just wants to float in
the<00:03:41.380> air<00:03:41.410> even<00:03:42.010> for<00:03:42.250> landings<00:03:42.670> you<00:03:42.730> could<00:03:42.910> just

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
the air even for landings you could just

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.699 
the air even for landings you could just
bring<00:03:43.209> it<00:03:43.330> down<00:03:43.480> to<00:03:43.660> like<00:03:43.780> a<00:03:43.810> slow<00:03:44.080> speed<00:03:44.380> crawl

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
bring it down to like a slow speed crawl

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.500 
bring it down to like a slow speed crawl
and<00:03:44.920> then<00:03:45.040> it<00:03:45.550> just<00:03:45.700> comes<00:03:45.910> right<00:03:46.180> on<00:03:46.209> down

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
and then it just comes right on down

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.509 
and then it just comes right on down
there's<00:03:47.200> no<00:03:47.410> bad<00:03:47.650> cut<00:03:47.890> risk<00:03:48.130> except<00:03:48.370> that<00:03:48.489> I

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
there's no bad cut risk except that I

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.330 
there's no bad cut risk except that I
could<00:03:48.670> see<00:03:48.849> in<00:03:48.880> this<00:03:49.030> plane<00:03:49.269> so<00:03:49.300> far<00:03:49.780> um<00:03:50.340> the

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
could see in this plane so far um the

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.250 
could see in this plane so far um the
only<00:03:51.430> bad<00:03:51.730> thing<00:03:51.910> about<00:03:52.000> this<00:03:52.180> plane<00:03:52.599> was<00:03:52.840> the

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
only bad thing about this plane was the

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.380 
only bad thing about this plane was the
service<00:03:53.620> for<00:03:53.769> the<00:03:53.830> retracts<00:03:54.280> and<00:03:55.269> they're

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
service for the retracts and they're

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.140 
service for the retracts and they're
ready<00:03:55.540> to<00:03:55.599> ready<00:03:56.319> to<00:03:56.470> fly<00:03:56.709> version<00:03:57.160> the<00:03:57.819> servos

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
ready to ready to fly version the servos

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.000 
ready to ready to fly version the servos
were<00:03:58.300> a<00:03:58.330> little<00:03:58.510> on<00:03:58.720> the<00:03:58.810> weak<00:03:58.930> side<00:03:58.989> it<00:03:59.830> could

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
were a little on the weak side it could

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.350 
were a little on the weak side it could
have<00:04:00.130> been<00:04:00.220> my<00:04:00.370> setup<00:04:00.640> that<00:04:00.970> when<00:04:01.209> you<00:04:01.269> know

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
have been my setup that when you know

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.720 
have been my setup that when you know
when<00:04:01.569> I<00:04:01.600> read<00:04:02.440> it<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:02.680> grub<00:04:03.280> screws<00:04:03.549> on<00:04:03.670> the

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
when I read it the grub screws on the

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:04.860 
when I read it the grub screws on the
collar<00:04:03.940> I<00:04:04.090> couldn't<00:04:04.390> you<00:04:04.450> know<00:04:04.540> move<00:04:04.750> the

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
collar I couldn't you know move the

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.229 
collar I couldn't you know move the
linkage<00:04:05.140> on<00:04:05.230> exit<00:04:05.560> or<00:04:05.650> something<00:04:05.920> but<00:04:06.069> it<00:04:07.000> kind

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
linkage on exit or something but it kind

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.210 
linkage on exit or something but it kind
of<00:04:07.299> like<00:04:07.569> this<00:04:07.780> is<00:04:07.930> fold<00:04:08.230> in<00:04:08.410> all<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:08.860> way<00:04:09.010> it

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
of like this is fold in all the way it

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.920 
of like this is fold in all the way it
flying<00:04:09.640> too<00:04:09.880> fast<00:04:10.180> so<00:04:10.390> I<00:04:10.420> think<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:10.750> server

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
flying too fast so I think the server

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.900 
flying too fast so I think the server
was<00:04:11.049> not<00:04:11.140> strong<00:04:11.350> enough<00:04:11.410> but<00:04:12.190> it<00:04:12.340> could<00:04:12.519> be<00:04:12.730> me

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
was not strong enough but it could be me

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.759 
was not strong enough but it could be me
it<00:04:13.150> could<00:04:13.209> be<00:04:13.420> my<00:04:13.569> user<00:04:13.930> setup<00:04:14.260> this<00:04:14.530> is<00:04:14.680> my

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
it could be my user setup this is my

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.770 
it could be my user setup this is my
first<00:04:15.040> plane<00:04:15.250> retracts<00:04:15.700> on<00:04:15.880> there<00:04:16.030> so<00:04:16.630> I'm

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
first plane retracts on there so I'm

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.680 
first plane retracts on there so I'm
still<00:04:17.049> learning<00:04:17.169> on<00:04:17.410> the<00:04:17.500> retracts<00:04:17.889> um<00:04:18.370> and<00:04:19.209> it

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
still learning on the retracts um and it

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.300 
still learning on the retracts um and it
flies<00:04:19.840> very<00:04:20.229> good<00:04:20.500> with<00:04:20.650> the<00:04:20.739> sport<00:04:21.010> blade<00:04:21.190> of

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
flies very good with the sport blade of

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.469 
flies very good with the sport blade of
prop<00:04:21.519> but<00:04:21.760> for<00:04:21.940> some<00:04:22.030> of<00:04:22.090> you<00:04:22.150> guys<00:04:22.240> out<00:04:22.419> there

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
prop but for some of you guys out there

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:23.909 
prop but for some of you guys out there
who<00:04:22.720> wants<00:04:22.900> like<00:04:23.020> a<00:04:23.050> higher<00:04:23.290> performers<00:04:23.770> like

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
who wants like a higher performers like

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.770 
who wants like a higher performers like
a<00:04:23.950> faster<00:04:24.340> speed<00:04:24.460> you<00:04:25.090> can<00:04:25.210> always<00:04:25.360> swap<00:04:25.600> out

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
a faster speed you can always swap out

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.570 
a faster speed you can always swap out
the<00:04:25.870> four<00:04:26.080> bladed<00:04:26.290> proper<00:04:26.590> or<00:04:26.889> two<00:04:27.070> later<00:04:27.280> prop

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
the four bladed proper or two later prop

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.310 
the four bladed proper or two later prop
and<00:04:28.090> that<00:04:28.270> would<00:04:28.360> give<00:04:28.540> the<00:04:28.630> plane<00:04:28.840> a<00:04:28.870> lot<00:04:29.110> more

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
and that would give the plane a lot more

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.180 
and that would give the plane a lot more
performance<00:04:29.830> out<00:04:30.070> of<00:04:30.610> the<00:04:30.700> p-51<00:04:31.300> Mustang<00:04:31.690> and

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
performance out of the p-51 Mustang and

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.140 
performance out of the p-51 Mustang and
the<00:04:33.190> wind<00:04:33.400> did<00:04:33.550> pick<00:04:33.760> up<00:04:33.910> for<00:04:34.060> the<00:04:34.090> flight

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
the wind did pick up for the flight

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.469 
the wind did pick up for the flight
video<00:04:34.590> and<00:04:35.590> it's<00:04:35.979> pot<00:04:36.190> blowing<00:04:36.460> about<00:04:36.580> 15<00:04:37.390> to

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
video and it's pot blowing about 15 to

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.050 
video and it's pot blowing about 15 to
20<00:04:37.720> mile<00:04:37.870> an<00:04:37.990> hour<00:04:38.080> now<00:04:38.350> so<00:04:38.490> but<00:04:39.490> the<00:04:39.610> people

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
20 mile an hour now so but the people

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.430
