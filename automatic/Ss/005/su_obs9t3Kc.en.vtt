alright guys this is fu bringing you
another<00:00:03.840> video<00:00:04.290> on<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:05.009> Xperia<00:00:05.700> S<00:00:05.940> now<00:00:06.629> what

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
another video on the Xperia S now what

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.540 
another video on the Xperia S now what
I'm<00:00:07.080> going<00:00:07.200> to<00:00:07.259> do<00:00:07.470> this<00:00:07.710> time<00:00:08.069> round<00:00:08.309> is

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
I'm going to do this time round is

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.520 
I'm going to do this time round is
pretty<00:00:09.030> much<00:00:09.240> a<00:00:09.450> synthetic<00:00:10.080> battery

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
pretty much a synthetic battery

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.999 
pretty much a synthetic battery
benchmark<00:00:11.990> received<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.110> few<00:00:13.290> complaint<00:00:13.769> notes

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
benchmark received a few complaint notes

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.000 
benchmark received a few complaint notes
from<00:00:14.370> some<00:00:14.670> users<00:00:15.240> about<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:16.350> previous<00:00:16.710> test

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
from some users about the previous test

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.880 
from some users about the previous test
that<00:00:17.340> carried<00:00:18.000> out<00:00:18.119> being<00:00:18.960> not<00:00:19.320> very<00:00:19.350> fair

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
that carried out being not very fair

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.609 
that carried out being not very fair
because<00:00:20.160> it's<00:00:20.460> not<00:00:20.789> synthetic<00:00:21.240> so<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.410> don't

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
because it's not synthetic so I don't

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.130 
because it's not synthetic so I don't
have<00:00:22.769> any<00:00:22.949> numbers<00:00:23.119> yet<00:00:24.119> people<00:00:24.689> carving

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
have any numbers yet people carving

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.259 
have any numbers yet people carving
numbers<00:00:25.529> here<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.010> disgusting<00:00:26.670> really<00:00:26.970> i

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
numbers here and disgusting really i

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.689 
numbers here and disgusting really i
don't<00:00:28.019> have<00:00:28.349> some<00:00:28.529> solid<00:00:28.769> numbers<00:00:29.340> actually

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
don't have some solid numbers actually

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.319 
don't have some solid numbers actually
compare<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:31.099> some<00:00:32.099> other<00:00:32.130> phones<00:00:32.730> so

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
compare it to some other phones so

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.299 
compare it to some other phones so
basically<00:00:33.840> what<00:00:34.020> i<00:00:34.050> did<00:00:34.380> was<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.920> download

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
basically what i did was to download

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.360 
basically what i did was to download
onto<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.790> tester<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.739> did<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.770> battery<00:00:38.160> test

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
onto to tester and did a battery test

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.049 
onto to tester and did a battery test
with<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:38.879> what<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.360> xperia<00:00:39.840> s<00:00:39.989> scored<00:00:40.590> is

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
with it so what the xperia s scored is

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.840 
with it so what the xperia s scored is
466<00:00:42.059> points<00:00:42.300> now<00:00:43.200> where<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.980> stands<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.789> the

the battery life of the xperia as lies
probably<00:02:16.110> somewhere<00:02:16.560> in<00:02:16.620> between<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:18.650> droid

interesting<00:02:22.050> comparison<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:23.250> be<00:02:23.370> made<00:02:23.400> is

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
interesting comparison to be made is

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.070 
interesting comparison to be made is
with<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:25.760> Xperia<00:02:26.760> Arc<00:02:26.819> S<00:02:27.150> running<00:02:27.599> ice<00:02:27.780> cream

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
same but the score that it got is 408

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
ice cream sandwich or beta I'm just

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.850 
ice cream sandwich or beta I'm just
going<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.090> guess<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.630> assume<00:02:45.750> that<00:02:46.260> it<00:02:46.530> should

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
going to guess and assume that it should

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.400 
going to guess and assume that it should
have<00:02:47.100> a<00:02:47.130> battery<00:02:47.400> better<00:02:47.910> battery<00:02:48.450> life<00:02:48.480> when

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
have a battery better battery life when

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.470 
have a battery better battery life when
the<00:02:49.620> final<00:02:49.950> version<00:02:50.130> of<00:02:50.459> ice<00:02:50.880> cream<00:02:51.120> sandwich

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
the final version of ice cream sandwich

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.199 
the final version of ice cream sandwich
gets<00:02:51.690> rolled<00:02:51.900> out<00:02:52.110> for<00:02:52.319> it<00:02:52.440> but<00:02:52.980> all<00:02:53.730> in<00:02:54.090> all

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
gets rolled out for it but all in all

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.080 
gets rolled out for it but all in all
yeah<00:02:54.780> that<00:02:55.769> pretty<00:02:56.010> much<00:02:56.130> wraps<00:02:56.700> up<00:02:56.910> this

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
yeah that pretty much wraps up this

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.320 
yeah that pretty much wraps up this
video<00:02:57.299> over<00:02:57.510> here<00:02:57.810> I<00:02:57.840> guess<00:02:59.209> thanks<00:03:00.209> for

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
video over here I guess thanks for

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.360
