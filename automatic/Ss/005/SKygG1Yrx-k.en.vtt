00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:10.410
 if you leave me is and nick 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:12.750
 the whiskers 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.990
 hi friends today we are going to learn to play 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.460
 cold soup a m-clan theme and how 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.470
 I will always show you all the 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.480
 chords and all the rhythms that he uses 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.340
 if you like the idea of â€‹â€‹learning them 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.340
 stay and let's go to it 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.829
 because in the intro and in the stanza he uses 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.420
 only two chords 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.420
 the first one is my minor 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:45.810
 and the second is F major 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:50.580
 and it is not used without going to least fa 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:53.410
 greater for half retail one thousand less 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.930
 please make more 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.430
 easy truth but good as you will have 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.260
 heard the issue now is that that's not the 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.710
 rhythm that makes the rhythm that it uses is 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.710
 this look 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.170
 how do we do it then well let's put 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.190
 my minor and we are going to hit first 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.410
 down 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.870
 I will sound and the next to 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.180
 down but sounding quickly we come back 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.860
 to stop that it would be again the first 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.410
 that does not sound is to say is a loop 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.410
 always to sound for sounds like this 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.470
 does not then we already have everything that is 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.450
 the stanza look very simple if you do not 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.990
 it comes out then you have to practice it very 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.990
 slowly 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.430
 So it's good after that, I eat 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.430
 I have done well the refrain 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.290
 from superchulo in the chorus 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.459
 uses first of greatest 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.459
 for now 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.459
 now 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:35.240
 by shawn marion 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.530
 let's see him again hit 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.530
 towards him we publish the rhythm 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:57.430
 very well the rhythm you use here are 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.430
 two hits down two up and two down 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
 ah 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.620
 very slow 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.459
 changes 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.010
 want 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.240
 again 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.840
 do not 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.840
 for the least 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.120
 less 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:44.300
 Sun 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.300
 with more than 100 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.130
 ace 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.830
 Y 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:58.040
 and after the second chorus does 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:03.409
 this and now I drink the sea 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:05.959
 I do not stand in this puddle and it's good 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:09.140
 a very simple part simply makes 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.700
 greater sun to deplete my seventh which is 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.819
 A) Yes 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.080
 especially do not copy and the minor where 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:20.150
 we do the same rhythm that we have 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:22.760
 learned before and toasted with caviar sun 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.090
 bigger and it burns for us to come back from 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.090
 once 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.060
 well, nothing has the whole subject 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.590
 now what you have to do if you want 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.689
 is to practice it with the video 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.120
 show where I have the subject to 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:39.819
 that you see how we put everything into practice 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.919
 I learned as I always tell you if you 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:44.319
 like the video dale I like subscribe 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:46.509
 to the channel and share it with your friends and 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:48.909
 a very important thing now when I 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:50.800
 finish and disappear you will have another 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:53.430
 suggestion of interesting videos of 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.430
 live guitar
