exactly that you're trying to accomplish

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.070 
exactly that you're trying to accomplish
it<00:02:35.340> seems<00:02:35.580> really<00:02:35.760> simple<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.630> mission<00:02:36.989> of

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
it seems really simple the mission of

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.540 
it seems really simple the mission of
the<00:02:37.200> diversity<00:02:37.500> Council<00:02:37.920> is<00:02:38.099> just<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.430> create

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
the diversity Council is just to create

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.280 
the diversity Council is just to create
an<00:02:38.880> environment<00:02:39.480> that's<00:02:39.540> more<00:02:39.930> culturally

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
an environment that's more culturally

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.110 
an environment that's more culturally
relevant<00:02:40.590> for<00:02:40.950> our<00:02:41.250> colleagues<00:02:41.670> as<00:02:41.819> well<00:02:41.970> as

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
relevant for our colleagues as well as

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.880 
relevant for our colleagues as well as
those<00:02:42.300> we<00:02:42.450> serve<00:02:42.630> but<00:02:43.380> it's<00:02:43.500> actually<00:02:43.769> quite

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
those we serve but it's actually quite

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.190 
those we serve but it's actually quite
challenging<00:02:44.220> because<00:02:44.700> diversity<00:02:45.150> is<00:02:45.420> a<00:02:45.630> more

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
challenging because diversity is a more

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.259 
challenging because diversity is a more
of<00:02:46.319> a<00:02:46.470> process<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.880> requires<00:02:48.180> a

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
of a process and it requires a

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.699 
of a process and it requires a
commitment<00:02:48.540> on<00:02:48.810> all<00:02:48.959> of<00:02:49.080> our<00:02:49.140> parts<00:02:49.560> and

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
commitment on all of our parts and

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.710 
commitment on all of our parts and
really<00:02:49.950> focus<00:02:50.400> more<00:02:50.610> on<00:02:50.670> commonalities<00:02:51.600> and

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
really focus more on commonalities and

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.840 
really focus more on commonalities and
differences<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.590> look<00:02:53.100> for<00:02:53.250> opportunities

differences and look for opportunities

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.759 
differences and look for opportunities
to<00:02:53.880> create<00:02:54.150> or<00:02:55.049> look<00:02:55.170> for<00:02:55.200> more<00:02:55.440> opportunities

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
to create or look for more opportunities

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.539 
to create or look for more opportunities
to<00:02:56.190> be<00:02:56.580> more<00:02:57.080> accepting<00:02:58.080> and<00:02:58.230> inclusive<00:02:58.650> I<00:02:58.860> can

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
to be more accepting and inclusive I can

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.309 
to be more accepting and inclusive I can
see<00:02:59.730> how<00:02:59.849> that<00:02:59.910> would<00:03:00.150> be<00:03:00.299> challenging<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:00.959> how

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
see how that would be challenging so how

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.170
