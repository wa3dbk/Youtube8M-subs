over and then they'll just take a biopsy

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.740 
over and then they'll just take a biopsy
of<00:01:05.140> some<00:01:05.950> cancerous<00:01:06.789> tissue<00:01:07.030> send<00:01:07.450> it<00:01:07.570> to<00:01:07.660> the

lab to confirm what kind of cancer is

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:13.109 
lab to confirm what kind of cancer is
and<00:01:09.940> they'll<00:01:10.060> close<00:01:10.380> that's<00:01:11.380> a<00:01:12.119> surgical

and they'll close that's a surgical

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.290 
and they'll close that's a surgical
procedure<00:01:13.509> that<00:01:13.960> is<00:01:14.560> not<00:01:14.979> necessarily<00:01:15.729> what<00:01:15.910> a

similar clinical scenario would do what

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:23.279 
similar clinical scenario would do what
we<00:01:21.550> would<00:01:21.700> do<00:01:21.819> in<00:01:21.970> situations<00:01:22.179> where<00:01:22.690> we<00:01:22.899> think

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
we would do in situations where we think

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:25.740 
we would do in situations where we think
we<00:01:23.500> can<00:01:23.800> get<00:01:24.429> all<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.819> cancer<00:01:25.179> out<00:01:25.330> we<00:01:25.569> would

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
we can get all the cancer out we would

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.740 
we can get all the cancer out we would
do<00:01:26.500> a<00:01:26.530> big<00:01:27.190> incision<00:01:27.550> and<00:01:27.910> we<00:01:28.090> would<00:01:28.300> try<00:01:28.720> and

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
do a big incision and we would try and

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.050 
do a big incision and we would try and
take<00:01:29.410> out<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.950> cancer<00:01:30.160> wherever<00:01:30.610> its<00:01:30.789> spread

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
take out the cancer wherever its spread

take out the cancer wherever its spread
whether<00:01:31.360> it<00:01:31.509> be<00:01:31.630> on<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:31.780> ovaries<00:01:32.610> only<00:01:33.610> or<00:01:33.880> the

way we would try to take out all the
cancer<00:01:39.160> and<00:01:39.340> that's<00:01:39.640> called<00:01:39.819> a<00:01:39.940> debulking<00:01:40.479> or

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
optimal debulking first we have to

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.710 
optimal debulking first we have to
explain<00:01:46.240> how<00:01:46.690> somebody<00:01:47.380> with<00:01:47.530> ovarian<00:01:47.830> cancer

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
explain how somebody with ovarian cancer

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.350 
explain how somebody with ovarian cancer
how<00:01:49.720> their<00:01:49.899> abdomen<00:01:50.380> looks<00:01:50.910> people<00:01:51.910> kind<00:01:52.270> of

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
how their abdomen looks people kind of

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.330 
how their abdomen looks people kind of
think<00:01:52.569> that<00:01:52.690> you<00:01:52.780> just<00:01:52.959> go<00:01:53.140> in<00:01:53.319> there<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:53.739> then

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
think that you just go in there and then

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.029 
think that you just go in there and then
you<00:01:54.489> just<00:01:54.690> pluck<00:01:55.690> apples<00:01:56.500> from<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.739> apple

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
you just pluck apples from the apple

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.650 
you just pluck apples from the apple
tree<00:01:57.220> and<00:01:57.970> even<00:01:58.209> if<00:01:58.300> there's<00:01:58.450> a<00:01:58.509> hundred

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
tree and even if there's a hundred

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.600 
tree and even if there's a hundred
apples<00:01:59.080> how<00:01:59.319> hard<00:01:59.590> could<00:01:59.739> that<00:01:59.800> be<00:01:59.950> the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
apples how hard could that be the

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.520 
apples how hard could that be the
problem<00:02:01.000> is<00:02:01.119> it's<00:02:01.330> really<00:02:01.390> not<00:02:01.810> apples<00:02:02.410> from

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
problem is it's really not apples from

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.160 
problem is it's really not apples from
an<00:02:02.649> apple<00:02:02.950> tree<00:02:03.069> you<00:02:03.399> have<00:02:03.580> to<00:02:04.080> kind<00:02:05.080> of

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
an apple tree you have to kind of

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.800 
an apple tree you have to kind of
picture<00:02:05.640> let's<00:02:06.640> say<00:02:06.789> I<00:02:06.819> had<00:02:07.119> a<00:02:07.149> bucket<00:02:07.420> of<00:02:07.630> sand

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
picture let's say I had a bucket of sand

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.910 
picture let's say I had a bucket of sand
and<00:02:08.140> each<00:02:09.130> little<00:02:09.429> sand<00:02:09.970> granule<00:02:10.920> represents

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
and each little sand granule represents

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.150 
and each little sand granule represents
a<00:02:12.099> cancerous<00:02:12.819> mass<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.530> it's<00:02:14.530> as<00:02:14.739> if<00:02:14.920> somebody

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
a cancerous mass and it's as if somebody

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.940 
a cancerous mass and it's as if somebody
took<00:02:15.459> a<00:02:15.520> bucket<00:02:15.790> of<00:02:16.000> sand<00:02:16.239> and

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
took a bucket of sand and

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.580 
took a bucket of sand and
kind<00:02:17.129> of<00:02:17.480> spilled<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.660> into<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.050> abdomen<00:02:19.170> and

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
kind of spilled it into the abdomen and

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.890 
kind of spilled it into the abdomen and
that<00:02:20.160> so<00:02:20.489> those<00:02:20.610> sand<00:02:20.970> granules<00:02:21.390> could<00:02:21.750> go

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
that so those sand granules could go

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.960 
that so those sand granules could go
anywhere<00:02:22.200> they<00:02:22.800> could<00:02:23.040> all<00:02:23.220> clump<00:02:23.730> in<00:02:23.879> the

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
anywhere they could all clump in the

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.699 
anywhere they could all clump in the
pelvis<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.569> although<00:02:24.840> almost<00:02:25.110> all<00:02:25.349> the<00:02:25.500> tumor

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
pelvis and although almost all the tumor

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:26.750 
pelvis and although almost all the tumor
would<00:02:25.769> be<00:02:25.920> in<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.069> pelvis<00:02:26.400> where<00:02:26.519> they<00:02:26.610> could

would be in the pelvis where they could

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.449 
would be in the pelvis where they could
all<00:02:26.910> clump<00:02:27.239> near<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.319> liver<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.280> right

all clump near the liver and the right

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.970 
all clump near the liver and the right
diaphragm<00:02:30.030> or<00:02:30.239> most<00:02:31.019> likely<00:02:31.140> as<00:02:31.590> in<00:02:31.769> most

that<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:34.920> sand<00:02:35.310> particles<00:02:36.090> would<00:02:36.209> wash

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
that the sand particles would wash

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.479 
that the sand particles would wash
around<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.930> entire<00:02:37.200> belly<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.860> the
