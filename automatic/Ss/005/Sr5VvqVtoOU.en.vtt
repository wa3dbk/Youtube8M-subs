00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
the glue I will glue the edges of the

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.099 
the glue I will glue the edges of the
foam<00:01:47.579> making<00:01:48.579> sure<00:01:48.880> that<00:01:49.119> your<00:01:49.299> hands<00:01:49.780> stay

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
once you have glue the edges you can

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.310 
once you have glue the edges you can
just<00:02:03.229> push<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.409> in<00:02:04.530> for<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.280> stay<00:02:05.549> in<00:02:05.579> place

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
just push it in for it to stay in place

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:14.600

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.590 

kind<00:03:21.180> of<00:03:21.239> like<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.840> roundness<00:03:22.650> of<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:24.060> top<00:03:24.359> of

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
kind of like the roundness of the top of

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.199 
kind of like the roundness of the top of
this<00:03:24.780> container<00:03:25.549> it<00:03:26.549> just<00:03:26.790> gives<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.150> a

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
this container it just gives it a

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.340 
this container it just gives it a
finished<00:03:27.450> feel<00:03:28.019> feeling<00:03:28.709> so<00:03:29.190> that<00:03:29.989> is<00:03:30.989> how<00:03:31.290> you

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
finished feel feeling so that is how you

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.580 
finished feel feeling so that is how you
form<00:03:31.769> a<00:03:31.950> container<00:03:32.370> until<00:03:33.120> next<00:03:33.810> time<00:03:34.109> this<00:03:34.530> is

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
form a container until next time this is
