goes<00:01:11.460> from<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.700> circuit<00:01:12.060> board<00:01:12.270> not<00:01:12.869> like<00:01:12.990> a

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
goes from the circuit board not like a

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.270 
goes from the circuit board not like a
circuit<00:01:13.350> board<00:01:13.380> it's<00:01:13.619> like<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:13.860> panel

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
circuit board it's like this panel

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.429 
circuit board it's like this panel
behind<00:01:14.610> here<00:01:14.909> that's<00:01:15.420> stuck<00:01:15.750> on<00:01:15.930> really<00:01:16.320> well

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
behind here that's stuck on really well

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.080 
behind here that's stuck on really well
and<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.799> pulled<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.430> pulled<00:01:17.729> some<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:17.939> it

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
and I pulled it and I pulled some of it

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.010 
and I pulled it and I pulled some of it
off<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.390> don't<00:01:18.600> know<00:01:18.750> if<00:01:18.840> it'll<00:01:18.960> work

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
off so I don't know if it'll work

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.990 
off so I don't know if it'll work
anymore<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.740> was<00:01:20.130> kind<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.400> concerned<00:01:20.759> about

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
anymore I was kind of concerned about

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.700 
anymore I was kind of concerned about
that<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.420> just<00:01:21.689> put<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:21.960> standard<00:01:22.259> black<00:01:22.470> one

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
that so I just put a standard black one

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.469 
that so I just put a standard black one
in<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.979> I'll<00:01:23.040> test<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.369> later<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:24.299> may

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
in and I'll test it later so you may

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.140 
in and I'll test it later so you may
actually<00:01:24.630> see<00:01:25.080> me<00:01:25.320> put<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.770> clear<00:01:26.159> touchpad<00:01:27.030> in

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
here eventually it's just it's black now

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.300 
here eventually it's just it's black now
cuz<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.340> didn't<00:01:29.640> want<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.939> not<00:01:30.750> work<00:01:31.310> but

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
cuz I didn't want it to not work but

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.499 
cuz I didn't want it to not work but
literally<00:01:32.579> everything<00:01:32.909> else<00:01:33.150> on<00:01:33.360> this

literally everything else on this

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.569 
literally everything else on this
controller<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:33.960> clear<00:01:34.350> front<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.159> back<00:01:35.310> shell
