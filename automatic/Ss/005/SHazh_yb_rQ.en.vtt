00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.830
 to make the chicken dough with catupiry you will need two 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.069
 liters of water 

00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:13.009
 two liters of milk 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.909
 two cubes of chicken broth 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:18.279
 no margarine dramas 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.849
 two tablespoons of salt and about three and a half pounds of wheat flour 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:28.489
 put the water to boil in the cauldron of the pasta maker 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:29.649
 hot 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:34.449
 add all ingredients and let the machine mix until smooth 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.560
 when you squeeze some dough in your hand and it looks smooth and 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.540
 sticking is at the point the dough should be used immediately after being ready 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.430
 for the filling you will need two kilos of tomato sauce 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.820
 one pound and 200 grams and grated onion 250 grams daily 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.240
 without dramas and salt 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.150
 thirteen pounds of cooked and shredded chicken and 300 grams of gold 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.670
 saute garlic and so off 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.760
 and let it brown a little 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.760
 put the tomato sauce and the cooked chicken 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.880
 and let it dry well after being quiet there is no way you can stick the little ribs 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.240
 of pork 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.259
 When you work with the apple, take out the amount you will use and charge the 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.370
 remaining with a clean plastic 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.750
 because if the mass gets exposed it formed a caste on it and you lose to this one 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.530
 It's a bit 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.920
 put 5 grams of curd in the bottom of the wrap and cover with 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.450
 chicken 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.430
 until you get the practice of each snack so everyone 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.000
 same size 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 then you do not need to think anymore 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.960
 pass the egg whites into the egg whites mixed with a little water and 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.170
 then in the flour 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.740
 then it's just frozen
