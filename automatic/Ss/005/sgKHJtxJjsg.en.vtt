00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.480
 hello, welcome to one more class 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.559
 of biology and the subject of this class are 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.929
 the fruits 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.789
 okay we already know that one fruit 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.820
 exclusivity of the group of plants 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.279
 called angiosperms on tv the office 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.010
 bryophytes of my legs have no fruit 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.470
 the people in the legs have only seeds 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.160
 fruit fruit protecting the seed 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.669
 do not have 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.100
 so the college entrance exam likes to charge 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.020
 What are the types of fruit that we 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.540
 do not exist or which are the main 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.250
 parts that make up the fruits 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.809
 so I brought you here one 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:49.350
 scheme of a general fruit is showing 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.289
 how is this fruit organized in 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.199
 to their tissues the shell of the 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.050
 fruits we used to call and snack on 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.980
 the part that is usually in the fruits is 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.870
 affectionate is called mesocarp and the 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.659
 endocarp which is represented here in 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.960
 red is the part of the fruit that is 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.130
 in contact with the seed is then in 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.890
 of fruits 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.520
 usually we have the seed there 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.070
 folks 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.180
 There I put a word there for 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.909
 you on the issue of parthenon cardia one 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.270
 paternal paternal fruit is a fruit that has 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.520
 formed without the fertilization of an ovum or 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.530
 be that fruit does not have an embryo there 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.689
 inside he does not have a seed 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.360
 just to remind you that not all 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.100
 have seeds and since we are 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.780
 here talking about this issue of 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.740
 fruits will try to remember where it is that 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.380
 they come, for example, to draw here 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.310
 today neither one of you 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.740
 This is the feminine part of the flower. 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.530
 ok so here we have a stigma that 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.950
 the region that gives the female part that 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.950
 receives the pollen grain and the stiletto 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.619
 where the pollen tube goes down and here it is 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.290
 our various ovary will have a 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.810
 crucial role for the formation of fruit 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.400
 because it develops and gives origin 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.060
 to this structure you are seeing 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.920
 on here 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.020
 So what do we matter? 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.340
 inside the ovary we have some 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.980
 segments 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.480
 okay and within those segments that are 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.340
 protective fabrics 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:30.870
 we have a structure that is ours 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.340
 heartthrob our female gametophyte side 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.290
 female tokyo outline 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.810
 we have some cells in particular 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.000
 we have the three remaining cells 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.590
 on top that are the antipodes we have 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.440
 the polar nuclei 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.230
 we have the cells if nerds and the 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.239
 our great teacher that our or 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.830
 sphere which is the female gamete 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.319
 more or less in this region 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.459
 All this we have already watched in videos 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.769
 previous 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.950
 then the set of segments with this 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.120
 female gametophyte is called ovule by 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.170
 that this structure that is 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.900
 indicated queen with the little string is called 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.370
 ovary and this internal structure is the 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.530
 set of complementary segments 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:16.260
 female life we call egg're 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:19.290
 then ovary carries the eggs but at last 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.209
 what matters for us matters here 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.820
 this internal structure that will 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.370
 give rise to seed when it waits 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:30.090
 was fertilized by the kitten that what the 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.769
 that will come out of the great pollen to him 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.920
 will give rise to a small embryo that 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:37.260
 inside the seed are then these 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.989
 arguments here that protect the top baby 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.530
 feminine vanda the origin of the 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.150
 seed is the fertilized egg will give 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.900
 origin of an embryo depending on the 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.000
 seed and female metal will give 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.320
 so I still hope is that the fabric of 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.780
 Enemy nutrition 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:58.400
 that is, every ovum will end if 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.810
 developing and giving rise to seed 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.390
 as the embryo develops 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.510
 it releases hormones 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:10.139
 these hormones they will act here 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.120
 the wall of the ovary and will cause 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:14.069
 this wall of the ovary begins to accumulate 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.380
 some nutrients such as 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.840
 fructose and is the wall of the ovary goes 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.630
 thickening thickening joining up 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.500
 gives rise to these 3 fabrics that people 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.520
 talked 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.330
 the carpi epi the mesocarp and the endocarp or 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.990
 be 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:33.060
 the ovary wall this structure that 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.849
 It's green in here for you, that's it. 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.990
 from here it is developing but it is still 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:40.469
 just thicken 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:43.740
 to give rise to this structure that the epi 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:46.379
 carpo at the time because even charge and 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:50.969
 endocarp the set of these three 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:52.430
 structures is the pericarp then the fruit 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:55.409
 huh 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:59.699
 emerged thanks to the development of the 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:05:02.340
 ovary and the seed came 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:05.580
 development of the egg integument of the 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.770
 the seed egg and the seed 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.199
 rice that the female gamete that 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.620
 I was inside origin in Brazil is 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:15.930
 inside the seed right people so why 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.599
 while that 's it then in the next video to 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:25.819
 people will see the types of fruits that 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:25.819
 There is a kiss and even good
