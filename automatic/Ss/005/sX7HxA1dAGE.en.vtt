whenever it's moved over an object they

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:06.979 
whenever it's moved over an object they
can<00:03:05.640> interact<00:03:06.000> with<00:03:06.420> it<00:03:06.599> will<00:03:06.720> have<00:03:06.840> the

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
can interact with it will have the

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.270 
can interact with it will have the
double<00:03:07.290> blocks<00:03:07.500> whenever<00:03:07.890> you<00:03:07.980> move<00:03:08.069> it<00:03:08.220> over

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
double blocks whenever you move it over

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.170 
double blocks whenever you move it over
the<00:03:08.489> pylon<00:03:09.380> it'll<00:03:10.380> have<00:03:10.620> no<00:03:11.010> double<00:03:11.310> box<00:03:11.640> so

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
the pylon it'll have no double box so

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.160
