 I hope you like it since it is a 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.300
 project that we had planned to do already 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.940
 I know that the era pg maybe it's very 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.550
 but this time it will be five videos 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.160
 only with this in the first part 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.979
 it was pg how and why it started so 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:22.460
 let's start or youtube people are lr a 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.350
 louis 271 of 1 and this time is my 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.509
 presentation in these videos that comes out 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.580
 with roger master not about lopez that 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.149
 something so known and criticized by the 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.220
 original fans of the wwf that is what 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.259
 that they know from previous times 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.570
 to be exact since the age of 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.000
 fitness or even further back though there's 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.979
 in those times it was not if I had fish 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.410
 and also a fish that before and now there is 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.660
 a fish now but good let's start with 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.400
 this me and roger we will divide the videos in 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.470
 parties in what we'll talk about the 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.680
 what good it could have crowded or 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.930
 improved good let's start roger good since 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.810
 let's start with what would be the beginning of 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.910
 this was in the ww for that we have 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.980
 to go back a little further back 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.830
 a few years ago but not so many 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.690
 They exist exactly in the year 2008 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.759
 almost by the middle of this year it 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.890
 started this era again since as 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.220
 I said the CG era was also before 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.470
 he was in the golden age of the wwf but 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.140
 let's talk about when he came back because that 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.140
 we were 2008 nothing new happened but 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:28.220
 surprise the ww announces that lópez 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.350
 or I would be the ww pp return was 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.170
 like in the middle of that year when what 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.510
 announced and we talked about the first pp 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.730
 who had the environment weigh or more 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.950
 familiar between that memories are 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.200
 live top 6 jones that same year and 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.020
 summerslam also from that same year 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.940
 traveled forward everything would be pg but 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.980
 at first the change was not so 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.170
 notorious of the tpv because there was still 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.540
 traits of the previous one was dominated to 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.489
 ruth les agressions because there was still a 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.240
 little of violent struggles but with the 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.580
 step from 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.680
 Surely if I would change that since 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.170
 He had to adapt to the new or is 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.540
 doping but that caused the start of it 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.580
 Well , wait for the main reason but 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.680
 Roger looks at them all and the reason 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.260
 simple is the main campaign 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.360
 cute herself or not be the wife I said 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.760
 that vince claimed him because he said that 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.070
 the company of his wife or the good 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.900
 live and empty verbal in their campaigns 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:24.500
 run for the Senate because the 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.990
 violent mainly that was the ww 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.150
 it made her look bad so people had to 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.770
 change everything to do the campaign well 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.960
 from one to the Senate but that's the 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.880
 principal according to my opinion although there 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.800
 several also but that one wants it 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.960
 roger díaz to conclude let's talk because 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.120
 they searched for the exit in a category of 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.220
 television does not get attached because it's simple 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.720
 this category of television that is 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.790
 American because it 's a 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.920
 add classification means 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.470
 more familiar environment without so much violence 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.120
 or sexual things or things that children do not 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.580
 can see and that the whole family is 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.830
 entertain with it then that there vince 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.690
 found the perfect outlet to help 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.760
 to linda with such never won in their 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.170
 campaigns exists since this is more 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.650
 familiar and so all 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.810
 or look is the ww that entertains everyone 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.910
 children and it's not so violent and it's for 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.620
 the family if we can see it and the children 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.989
 also without worrying 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.209
 that would be the parents' reactions 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.919
 exists like this could help linda to that 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.720
 vote for her because although there are more 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:24.200
 reasons but those yesterday to roger 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.510
 forward bro up here wit good to 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.120
 me why good as told my 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.300
 friend Luis this was wine to change part 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.790
 of the wwf in what aspects then in several 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.800
 aspects since before we knew part 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.550
 of the attitude era like the rule 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.770
 that aggression 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:43.130
 these eras were the best so 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.440
 say it about fights and fighters good at 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.570
 part why the old age was 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.180
 shows by several things some of the 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.430
 main when he started as he told them 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.380
 louis one of the main ones is by 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.389
 blame of linda mad man since as 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.400
 we know or because those who do not know 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.470
 she ran as country senator 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.690
 jumped from the USA 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.150
 that's why she mainly wanted to be 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.130
 the senator but she and vince thought 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.750
 that if I wanted to be a senator I had to 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.360
 show yourself a person with values 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.120
 and that's why the brilliant idea came between 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.520
 quotes to create an era in which no 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.790
 there would be a lot of violence and they would not present 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.380
 serious problems for her and her family 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.930
 other of the circumstances that led to 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.880
 this is what mcmahon came for 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.040
 example due to injuries by 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.620
 extreme movements that they made with 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.720
 this from p &amp; g was about eradicating this 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.790
 since this made fighters some 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.190
 important for the company to leave 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.110
 for good time, they were as I said 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.360
 injuries that were not at a hundred 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:45.660
 hundred and there was lack of violence to 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:48.690
 the struggles in the end the old age change 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.640
 a lot of things example was attitude the 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.590
 fighters were free to task 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.180
 they could do the ones that hit the 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.460
 gift won 'they had better 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.550
 development in the struggles and in the 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.650
 tests that they presented 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.810
 aggression goals this was considered a 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.970
 of the best showed varieties of 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.950
 fights of stipulations in which 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.990
 they gave their whole lives in the 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.700
 they showed the necessary condition 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:15.390
 in the struggles 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:16.740
 and finally what came to screw it ww xd 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.870
 it was the age of g 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:22.110
 making several changes from struggles 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:24.960
 creative fighters and many things that 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:27.330
 they took a 180 degree turn accepting 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.370
 well the fanaticada of the old school and
