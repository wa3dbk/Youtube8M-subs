00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:38.439 
they do well then they tried a new idea

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:41.819 
they do well then they tried a new idea
it's<00:02:39.400> called<00:02:39.700> catch<00:02:39.970> shares<00:02:40.420> it<00:02:41.379> goes<00:02:41.590> like

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
it's called catch shares it goes like

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.699 
it's called catch shares it goes like
this<00:02:42.069> if<00:02:42.939> a<00:02:43.420> small<00:02:43.750> group<00:02:43.989> of<00:02:44.109> people<00:02:44.319> owned

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
this if a small group of people owned

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.920 
this if a small group of people owned
the<00:02:44.889> fish<00:02:45.129> they<00:02:45.879> might<00:02:46.120> take<00:02:46.329> better<00:02:46.599> care<00:02:46.870> of

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.720 
the fish they might take better care of
them<00:02:47.200> that's<00:02:47.680> good<00:02:47.950> for<00:02:48.129> the<00:02:48.189> fish

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730
