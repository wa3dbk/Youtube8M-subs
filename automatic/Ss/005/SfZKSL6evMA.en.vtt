00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.810
 very good welcome back to classes 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.400
 then we are here the first thing that 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.620
 I have to tell you is that today we are going to 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.840
 have a clear war yes man 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.210
 we are 35 there has only been one small mistake 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.249
 how good between some things and others 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.710
 We have only been able to participate 35 of 

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:20.509
 the 45 that we are so good guys 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.039
 you do not have to think much about that either 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:23.839
 what do I want to tell you today in the first place 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.050
 is that if you want a new series in the 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:29.419
 channel and would learn to attack with 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.159
 balloons not especially with balloons not with 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.140
 air troops and I say good maybe 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:35.239
 with air troops because I think it's 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.649
 it gives me pretty good in general and what 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.750
 I'm going to show you today it's just a 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.370
 attack for night to set a 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.989
 little gameplay and such that nothing 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.730
 guys if we reach the figure of 150 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.030
 likes before 12 o'clock 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.920
 more or less in a day then you will have how 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.899
 attack with balloons and such so good 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.820
 guys let's go good first show you a 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.260
 one hundred percent you will see first 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.239
 You already know that I am City Hall 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.940
 level 7 here we have another town hall 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.399
 level 7 with enough resources and such and 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.800
 you see it's a good village between 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.420
 quotes difficult as who says because 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.020
 maybe the defense is very focused on 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.719
 the mortar 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.149
 the archers good is not that mega 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:13.909
 ultra difficult but good simply 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:16.460
 so I decided to attack her for the resources and 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.590
 but maybe having the defenses 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.840
 they are scattered for example one by 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.909
 here the magician tower above then by 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.710
 down here another tower of magicians so very 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.409
 weird I will not be very weird a lot wall 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.420
 the center finally has strange things not 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.459
 like who says then this what 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.170
 perfect the perfect because apart it has 

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:34.579
 the antiaircraft out the perfect thing would be 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.560
 make an air attack then I have 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:39.049
 done the same thing so I want to 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.130
 show you how I did it I'm not going to 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.599
 explain nothing simply that some 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.299
 giants to try good to distract 

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:45.649
 a little bit to take out the tesla and destroy 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.060
 a little antiaircraft and such but now 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.489
 you will see how well I use the 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.189
 troops then I would like to know if 

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:54.200
 you really want to know how good I 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.599
 he will only attack in war with attacks 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.909
 with balloons usually balloons and minions 

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:00.709
 and you are going to see before explaining anything that 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.179
 they are here it goes super leftover that is not 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:03.560
 they should have pulled so much balloon 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.110
 so many in ferro or nothing shot all the 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.210
 troops spare me a spell of rage but 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.670
 I already tell you that still guys 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.410
 I do not know very well and that an attack 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.660
 good with balloons really is an attack 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.340
 very well taken advantage of you will see that this 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.660
 village I found it pretty fast 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.980
 in general over here I'm going to throw away 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.350
 clan castle that also had ones 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.970
 how many serve you and I tell you guys that 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.530
 I think the balloons 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.300
 I do not know I'm very good at least 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.190
 people who are much more level than me in 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.930
 the clan says that I'm very good at it 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.150
 that I think they explained later 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.130
 strategies like I think at the time of 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.770
 throw balloons without me centering that something 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.870
 first what do I do after the spells 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.190
 well there are many things not to explain 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.050
 in the end, after all, they are my troop 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.340
 favorite not so nothing if you want the 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.410
 series just tell me in the 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.000
 comment section and guys I think that 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.830
 takes youtube well you know that these 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.360
 days it has been a bit bad yet 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.030
 so I hope that the channel will do 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.220
 at your usual pace it's not going to about 40 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.750
 daily subscribers and everything that I 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.610
 reach more than 100 likes, that's good 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.380
 already normal and I guess now with 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.270
 this improvement I hope it arrives then a 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.830
 little bit more guys good guys I've 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.330
 had to paste a small cut for 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.650
 some problems but I do not expect anything 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.300
 you liked the video really if 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.860
 you want me to make a small series of 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.060
 how to attack with air attacks not 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.860
 forget to leave your likes 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.000
 your comment and I guess already with 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.190
 this from youtube what's up 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.650
 better then I hope the channel comes back to 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.150
 your normal rhythm guys so nothing we 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.470
 we see in the next video a greeting to 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.470
 all and goodbye
