00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
days but we also know the devs want to

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.700 
days but we also know the devs want to
regain<00:00:41.980> confidence<00:00:42.519> in<00:00:43.030> the<00:00:43.120> series<00:00:43.569> I<00:00:43.780> really

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
regain confidence in the series I really

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:45.989 
regain confidence in the series I really
like<00:00:44.859> where<00:00:45.100> all<00:00:45.159> the<00:00:45.309> developers<00:00:45.730> have<00:00:45.879> had

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:45.999 
like where all the developers have had

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:47.700 
like where all the developers have had
to<00:00:46.120> say<00:00:46.300> so<00:00:46.359> far<00:00:46.539> and<00:00:47.019> I<00:00:47.079> think<00:00:47.140> the<00:00:47.440> general

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
to say so far and I think the general

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.130 
to say so far and I think the general
structure<00:00:48.249> of<00:00:48.489> hardline<00:00:48.999> will<00:00:49.600> lend<00:00:49.839> itself

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
structure of hardline will lend itself

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.899 
structure of hardline will lend itself
to<00:00:50.260> being<00:00:50.499> a<00:00:50.649> more<00:00:50.859> stable<00:00:51.129> game<00:00:51.460> than

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:51.909 
to being a more stable game than

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:54.119 
to being a more stable game than
