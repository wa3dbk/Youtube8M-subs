before I finally got them understanding

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.480 
before I finally got them understanding
what<00:01:57.810> we<00:01:57.930> were<00:01:58.050> talking<00:01:58.410> about<00:01:58.470> but<00:01:58.890> once<00:01:59.190> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
what we were talking about but once the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.750 
what we were talking about but once the
first<00:01:59.790> sample<00:02:00.720> of<00:02:01.080> glass<00:02:01.430> ended<00:02:02.430> up<00:02:02.550> at<00:02:02.670> the

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
first sample of glass ended up at the

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.190 
first sample of glass ended up at the
factory<00:02:03.150> it<00:02:04.020> was<00:02:04.380> like<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:06.020> million<00:02:07.020> light

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
factory it was like a million light

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.530 
factory it was like a million light
bulbs<00:02:07.530> going<00:02:07.740> off<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.340> was<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.700> tremendously

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
bulbs going off it was a tremendously

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.680 
bulbs going off it was a tremendously
exciting<00:02:10.080> process<00:02:10.520> our<00:02:11.520> job<00:02:11.940> was<00:02:12.630> to

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
exciting process our job was to

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.980 
exciting process our job was to
facilitate<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:14.600> installation<00:02:15.600> of<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.810> glass

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
facilitate the installation of the glass

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.800 
facilitate the installation of the glass
pieces<00:02:16.290> into<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:16.800> work<00:02:16.980> so<00:02:17.310> we<00:02:18.030> actually<00:02:18.390> had

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
pieces into the work so we actually had

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.220 
pieces into the work so we actually had
to<00:02:18.930> develop<00:02:19.110> techniques<00:02:19.560> for<00:02:20.990> carving<00:02:21.990> and

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
to develop techniques for carving and

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.220 
to develop techniques for carving and
routing<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:23.600> indentations<00:02:24.600> for<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.870> work<00:02:25.050> as

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
routing the indentations for the work as

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.620 
routing the indentations for the work as
well<00:02:25.710> as<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:25.920> hearing<00:02:26.370> them<00:02:26.550> as<00:02:26.760> well<00:02:27.390> as

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
well as a hearing them as well as

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.390 
well as a hearing them as well as
there's<00:02:28.140> some<00:02:28.230> particular<00:02:28.590> modifications

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
there's some particular modifications

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.310 
there's some particular modifications
than<00:02:29.610> on<00:02:29.820> this<00:02:29.940> panel<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.810> were<00:02:30.960> required

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
than on this panel that were required

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.960 
than on this panel that were required
because<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.010> size<00:02:32.280> of<00:02:32.610> some<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.820> the

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
because of the size of some of the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.850 
because of the size of some of the
pieces<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.540> then<00:02:34.140> we<00:02:34.290> had<00:02:34.440> to<00:02:34.470> figure<00:02:34.680> out<00:02:34.770> a

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
pieces and then we had to figure out a

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.100 
pieces and then we had to figure out a
way<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.070> ship<00:02:35.400> it<00:02:35.550> so<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.300> was<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.930> was<00:02:36.960> a

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
way to ship it so it was a it was a

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.770 
way to ship it so it was a it was a
challenge<00:02:37.860> for<00:02:38.160> us<00:02:38.330> but<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:39.450> was<00:02:39.600> something
