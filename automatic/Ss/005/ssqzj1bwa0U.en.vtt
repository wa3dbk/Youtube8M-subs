 God 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.509
 XT played 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:13.889
 give optimistic impulses 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.659
 ot / si 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:18.409
 Celesio takes over 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:22.159
 Hildburghausen are not excluded so it is the development 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:27.990
 So every student in the game 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.990
 against St. Pauli 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.750
 now the sound will be noticeably rougher in addition to it 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.750
 Peter, I'm fine too 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.310
 m st 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.970
 Berlin 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.139
 she starts 

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:51.670
 the impetus lives 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.670
 Lucerne Pauli 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.730
 and should win the first victory 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.850
 a donges still unbeaten 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.850
 but only to use the passes Aubisque 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.350
 to book 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.350
 life BZ but time 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.010
 Nachtwey 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.300
 Wollitz 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.300
 he can easily overcome 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.800
 big Kreutz Kaka was various 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.560
 Schmölzer 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.920
 deserves a very casual ending 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.950
 Soost 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.450
 Exhibitions Kiel out here and 9 and also in the run to our 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.360
 be good shot 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.360
 Munich 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.530
 like Peters 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.750
 Mrs. Homburger has not yet been the safest entry of the left in the 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.750
 rehearse 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.320
 Peter Platzer 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.730
 be black and green on time in Bahrain 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.730
 jump up 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:18.049
 and not beautiful after all 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.049
 what will come out of the ranks 

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:27.399
 Kaka was 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:30.399
 Grosskreutz 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.249
 smelter 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:42.499
 so the power exchange becomes offensive 

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:45.929
 specially motivated for full-back on the oecd-cut 

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:48.929
 to look forward 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.819
 because you nothing happened milk year of life 

00:02:57.119 --> 00:03:00.219
 so far the most boring of the three 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:03.219
 SG Bayern was ex-cop we did not know bad either 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:07.059
 you have to go here this is SC July Christian Moosmann 

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:08.389
 to give 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:11.879
 Grosskreutz, too, did not want to hear that 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.449
 that denies 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:16.419
 too deep in the back 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:17.649
 dollar 

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:19.059
 stay 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:22.379
 Player of documents 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.149
 Tappert and its system focus 

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:29.269
 mostly with Joan Crawford has its effectiveness between again Florack 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.479
 ambiguous for 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:34.479
 Dapd Dapd's exam can be done through focus checks 

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:38.429
 last run TuS Zülpich 

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:39.970
 3 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.469
 half 

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:45.459
 this game 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.889
 we've been knocking the ton 6 right here 

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:52.499
 I hope I change that now 

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:55.499
 of course not so aware of another draw 

00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:00.509
 markets 

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:05.509
 the door 

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:08.509
 Underworld name 

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:12.199
 percent 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.430
 ripe Miersch 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.289
 who take first 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.979
 Charles Takyi he 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.979
 that would be Google's first voters 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.419
 Broders Ruben Helix is ​​Laurich Wenzel 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.210
 Simmel himself downstairs has been so long that I saw players took the player 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.520
 have to be 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.520
 by Dirk Möllers they should 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:47.319
 after half an hour 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:52.229
 the big question is how will the loupe happen in this game? 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:58.400
 the crime shot right all that was Pauli's best chance 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.400
 Patent protection applies to the game 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:05.860
 Weidenfeller 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.189
 this is called further 

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:12.379
 The crowbar he always says implies and I would have troops too 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:16.639
 goes through the hiking boots Bender Potsdam 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.589
 the Paldauer recently also Twitter 

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:22.589
 Percent left euro on 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.210
 new products six games due 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:31.659
 brought the center forward game 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:35.689
 i hope that thank you 7 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.569
 that's nonsense the game is going on 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:44.919
 Minute and 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:47.960
 the Zurich managed to place some tourists in the race 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.629
 Shot or so wonderful 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:53.900
 in the north park pilgrim's head made head full 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.969
 who maybe immediately has Ostvorpommern 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:59.969
 but his last action seems to be borrowing 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:03.809
 that will already know 

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:05.039
 exciting races 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:09.809
 because percent manage and Sven Bender from the seat and they played on this 

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:11.059
 Chair opposition 

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:12.499
 therefore 

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:15.499
 to buy the tunnels to the point 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.360
 Present the grant game 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:23.599
 and now you change 

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:26.599
 and let's see if I happen something 

00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:31.959
 Dior is that they are extraordinarily first Saturday against Les individually 

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:34.089
 Santo Holding 

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:35.349
 so is where 

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:38.539
 unanimous if so called percent 

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:43.780
 always free 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:44.960
 because 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.960
 "He has that thing is Malena Böckenholt system 

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:54.589
 the header duel against the c won Yapi now can defensive tactics 

00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:57.430
 defensive force 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.860
 "It is now my need to be able to use terms 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.199
 but as I said is dead 

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:09.199
 made the defense 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:19.530
 Gallen last-minute defeat so it looks now after it looks 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.610
 now those who are interested will not deserve a winner 

00:07:28.379 --> 00:07:31.379
 but at least that is 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:37.090
 Football wanted is crazy and subtle and Bungert 

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.660
 Peter Fill 

00:07:42.039 --> 00:07:44.619
 3 take it to the 2 

00:07:44.619 --> 00:07:45.680
 and there painting 

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.680
 because I continue to win and lose it makes use of that 

00:07:51.449 --> 00:07:52.469
 Rheine 

00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:53.610
 March 15 

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.860
 I punished her 

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.860
 So the busses and Bayern in Munich resulted in Pauli being awarded 

00:08:00.499 --> 00:08:01.969
 I punch 

00:08:01.969 --> 00:08:04.969
 Leaving here is really asking 

00:08:07.399 --> 00:08:08.689
 Voeckler will 

00:08:08.689 --> 00:08:10.109
 what finally to know
