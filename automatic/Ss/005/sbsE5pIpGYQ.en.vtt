00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
a 5 inch 720p resolution screen and it

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.330 
a 5 inch 720p resolution screen and it

processor<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.750> if<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.770> compare<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.219> Lumia

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
processor so if you compare it to Lumia

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.959 
processor so if you compare it to Lumia
640<00:00:45.050> so<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.200> better<00:00:46.379> Lumia<00:00:46.890> 640<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.550> terms<00:00:47.789> of

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
640 so it better Lumia 640 in terms of

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.720 
640 so it better Lumia 640 in terms of
the<00:00:48.149> front-facing<00:00:48.719> camera<00:00:49.430> so<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.700> a

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
the front-facing camera so that is a

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.510 
the front-facing camera so that is a
mean<00:00:51.149> that's<00:00:52.140> why<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.379> looks<00:00:52.890> interesting<00:00:53.399> and

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
mean that's why it looks interesting and

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.939 
mean that's why it looks interesting and
though<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.910> has<00:00:54.030> been<00:00:54.180> priced<00:00:54.949> reasonably

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
though it has been priced reasonably

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.689 
though it has been priced reasonably
around<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.260> 10000<00:00:58.260> INR<00:00:58.680> or<00:00:58.859> like<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.280> see<00:00:59.579> it

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
around the 10000 INR or like I see it

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.950 
around the 10000 INR or like I see it
converting<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.829> dollars<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:02.070> should<00:01:02.280> be<00:01:02.430> like

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
converting to dollars it should be like

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.679 
converting to dollars it should be like
mmm<00:01:04.549> somewhere<00:01:05.549> around<00:01:06.619> 165<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.890> 170<00:01:08.159> dollars

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
mmm somewhere around 165 to 170 dollars

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.690 
mmm somewhere around 165 to 170 dollars
so<00:01:09.689> that's<00:01:09.930> pretty<00:01:10.229> reasonable<00:01:10.500> pricing<00:01:11.159> for

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
so that's pretty reasonable pricing for

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.890 
so that's pretty reasonable pricing for
India<00:01:12.479> market<00:01:13.040> ok<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.340> now<00:01:14.939> I'm<00:01:15.000> coming<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.659> the

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
device through basis and we will come

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.180 
device through basis and we will come
back<00:02:52.660> with<00:02:52.840> different<00:02:53.470> things<00:02:53.650> will<00:02:53.920> evaluate

the camera the the battery life the

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.330 
the camera the the battery life the
performance<00:02:58.420> and<00:02:58.810> you<00:02:59.620> will<00:02:59.739> obviously<00:02:59.980> you

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
performance and you will obviously you

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.460 
performance and you will obviously you
can<00:03:00.489> expect<00:03:00.790> also<00:03:00.970> videos<00:03:01.420> and<00:03:01.750> also<00:03:02.049> covers

okay<00:03:03.090> so<00:03:04.090> now<00:03:05.579> it<00:03:06.579> has<00:03:06.849> a<00:03:06.880> more<00:03:07.329> power<00:03:07.810> door

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
okay so now it has a more power door

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.190 
okay so now it has a more power door
okay<00:03:10.510> so<00:03:10.900> let's<00:03:11.109> just<00:03:11.440> check<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.959> how<00:03:13.959> how<00:03:14.139> the

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
okay so let's just check the how how the

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.120 
okay so let's just check the how how the
device<00:03:14.530> looks<00:03:14.709> in<00:03:14.919> the<00:03:15.010> hand<00:03:15.190> so<00:03:15.419> looks<00:03:16.419> pretty

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
device looks in the hand so looks pretty

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.259 
device looks in the hand so looks pretty
comfortable<00:03:18.130> while<00:03:18.370> you<00:03:18.519> try<00:03:18.819> to<00:03:18.849> you<00:03:19.239> know

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
comfortable while you try to you know

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:25.789 
comfortable while you try to you know
handle<00:03:20.109> it<00:03:20.260> or<00:03:20.380> use<00:03:20.530> it<00:03:20.769> in<00:03:21.280> a<00:03:22.269> one-handed<00:03:23.139> way

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.699 

five<00:03:26.799> for<00:03:27.130> each<00:03:27.430> screen<00:03:27.819> what's<00:03:28.419> ok<00:03:28.750> I<00:03:28.959> can

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
five for each screen what's ok I can

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.700 
five for each screen what's ok I can
handle<00:03:30.010> it<00:03:30.359> seems<00:03:32.280> ok

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
handle it seems ok

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.030 
handle it seems ok
the<00:03:35.710> screen<00:03:36.010> looks<00:03:36.250> quite<00:03:36.550> black<00:03:37.150> so<00:03:37.480> again<00:03:38.230> it

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
the screen looks quite black so again it

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
the screen looks quite black so again it
seems<00:03:39.520> that<00:03:39.810> it's<00:03:40.810> like<00:03:41.020> the<00:03:41.230> CBD

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
seems that it's like the CBD

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.180 
seems that it's like the CBD
technologies<00:03:43.060> being<00:03:43.660> used<00:03:43.870> so<00:03:44.170> it's<00:03:44.680> hard<00:03:44.980> to

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
technologies being used so it's hard to

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.190 
technologies being used so it's hard to
differentiate<00:03:45.520> with<00:03:45.820> the<00:03:45.970> back<00:03:46.210> and<00:03:46.540> the

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
differentiate with the back and the

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.040 
differentiate with the back and the
black<00:03:47.410> of<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:47.590> screen<00:03:47.950> quite<00:03:48.910> good<00:03:49.540> impact<00:03:49.840> by

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
black of the screen quite good impact by

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.620 
black of the screen quite good impact by
good<00:03:50.230> effect<00:03:50.530> it's<00:03:50.710> a<00:03:50.830> speciality<00:03:51.100> of<00:03:51.630> Lumia
