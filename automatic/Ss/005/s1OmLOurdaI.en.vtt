00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
time around it's more in depth so

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.890 
time around it's more in depth so
characters<00:01:20.700> can<00:01:20.880> look<00:01:21.120> you<00:01:21.360> know<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.659> play

question<00:01:26.579> for<00:01:27.090> me<00:01:27.210> since<00:01:27.450> we<00:01:27.630> have<00:01:27.840> character

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
question for me since we have character

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.350 
question for me since we have character
creation<00:01:28.799> do<00:01:29.399> you<00:01:29.490> think<00:01:29.790> we'll<00:01:30.000> be<00:01:30.030> able<00:01:30.210> to

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
creation do you think we'll be able to

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.330

create<00:01:30.689> our<00:01:30.869> own<00:01:31.020> movesets<00:01:31.799> where<00:01:32.070> we<00:01:32.189> can

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
create our own movesets where we can

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.090 
create our own movesets where we can
customize<00:01:32.790> our<00:01:32.939> own<00:01:33.450> super<00:01:33.930> attacks<00:01:34.259> ultimate

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
attacks signature moves and combos that

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.929 
attacks signature moves and combos that
would<00:01:37.710> be<00:01:37.829> pretty<00:01:37.979> cool<00:01:38.130> as<00:01:38.399> well<00:01:38.430> because<00:01:38.850> you

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
would be pretty cool as well because you

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:39.889 
would be pretty cool as well because you
know<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.090> wouldn't<00:01:39.420> want<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.719> wouldn't

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
know you wouldn't want to you wouldn't

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:41.870 
know you wouldn't want to you wouldn't
want<00:01:40.350> every<00:01:40.649> character<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.280> play<00:01:41.399> the<00:01:41.579> exact

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
want every character to play the exact

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.300 
want every character to play the exact
same<00:01:42.090> way<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.479> mean<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.439> option<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:43.950> probably

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
same way I mean that option is probably

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.679 
same way I mean that option is probably
there<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.789> mean<00:01:45.000> how<00:01:45.119> can<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.329> not<00:01:45.390> put

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689

something<00:01:46.020> like<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.890> fighting<00:01:47.250> game

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
something like that in a fighting game

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.370 
something like that in a fighting game
where<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.090> have<00:01:48.270> created<00:01:48.509> characters<00:01:49.049> but

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
where you have created characters but

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.959
