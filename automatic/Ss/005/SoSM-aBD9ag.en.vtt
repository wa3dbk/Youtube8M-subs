 Cooking profile solves the net I think I was great Yeah 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.570
 If so you guys can remember a lot of happiness or abhilash that he moves naked 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.410
 After the bride has her down to make an appearance if she is one of the 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.260
 The luxuries we are going to have for our master are her father 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.369
 Okay

 Anyway so people really got angry about this call to them ... Racism Wah 

00:00:26.549 --> 00:00:27.689
 Serena 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.819
 Email u_s_a_ today for a kind of talk about sharing ideas and having it in town on 

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:36.800
 Mission to determine I do not care to call her my friend and I do not think she 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.190
 I mean anything racially house because they still read at the end of the day I spent my time 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.360
 Time to spend my focused time on things to become better 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.550
 And bring me I have to add down if people think this is the way they should take 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.130
 The reason is to do something different next time 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.780
 This is not very 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.720
 On goods 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.130
 defensive 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.660
 Well so that citizens debate on the offer you and I had on the side of 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.859
 Friends it's not racist they're just around the corner 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.560
 Jesse came to say that I was not a little surprised that he was 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.950
 And then overturned the entire Supreme Court even though it had arrived 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.700
 In America he responded with his extra sounds tonight but she was nevertheless 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.500
 We have decided that he is not racist and we are the right partner 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.670
 Uh ... but 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.880
 He landed on something 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.220
 Cricket but we are Edo 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.060
 Ahlan 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.440
 Defense is not very good is why it is strange to pray 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.950
 I know Cal 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.909
 I will call her reaction my friend I was not 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.180
 You immediately know the freeze on it but it is not as big as if it stripped more 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.310
 The world she does not speak I wrote in the email 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.590
 Perhaps the last publicity a couple of people looked at was this 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.450
 Press rate 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.530
 I call her my friend is a way to say I really like what you do it 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.700
 Right I think that the very last statement really makes that clear 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.350
 Wallace basically says she insulted other people before she would probably she should 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.240
 Think 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.220
 Twice before doing something like yes I mean it 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.520
 Almost or her on the bus 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.990
 Not quite an issue so there is an election in equal parts of the limit 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.190
 From the risk to the situation you can restore it okay 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.900
 But uh ... 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.310
 And it's a weeks parcel to send this look if I did a joke where I did not 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.909
 Make something against you or something funny, I'm you 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.099
 And 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.689
 Everyone asks you to close your colleague to eight p 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.010
 Sexual or whatever the right 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.019
 Against you 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.699
 It takes several weeks to reply I'll be like 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:38.279
 I can get a lawyer you can help a brother how Wednesday will be a long time 

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:40.559
 To write you you have no situation you have a statement 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:44.370
 I think I would call Jack the friends of this watchmate 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.760
 But not now but 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.980
 That was apparently so after payment 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.900
 I knew she was a bit more upset about it than we thought 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.739
 Yes and I think if she is upset she has the right to know that he is upset 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.719
 And without that unless it is 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:05.719
 Well if they do not like anyone 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.920
 The largest in time and so on and so on so I fixed fact groups and I 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.239
 That's why I did 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.999
 Frustration to pardon left and right if Jimmy did not door this call come fishing 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:29.829
 I would get a big belly in baseball as well as would not be offended by that 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.649
 No I will not find amusing I do not want any of you say I do not think I knew you 

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:37.869
 Did not immediately put it like if you get real work craft 

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:42.209
 I got no writing on those colonies starting here 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.190
 Meeting and we have to be like that night until your exit 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.579
 You should be close to making fun of me it's only five 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.499
 Acrobatics and family senses on Sunday when you see this first run of 

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:53.400
 Reports 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.379
 But given the reaction of the Renault General House 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:59.930
 I had one project in fact this is more about right after you know how it is 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.650
 We proceeded we were definitely
