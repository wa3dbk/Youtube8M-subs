 Y 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:19.880
 I'm a musician 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.880
 a ghost inside his terror 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.360
 I am a coconut of computers and you 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.360
 I come to scare 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.920
 lie 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:41.790
 I am the cuckoo just the coconut of the 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.790
 computers and they know I do not exist 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:52.479
 I'm here to present you a new 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.479
 very useful and practical tool that is 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:01.780
 this is a computer 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.780
 a computer serves to 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:11.149
 many things but we go by parties 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:13.570
 this is a desktop computer and it has 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:17.869
 several parts 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:20.930
 this is the keyboard a keyboard that serves 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:24.140
 to write no and good has lyrics 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.780
 what is going to serve good not only has 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.450
 letters has other keys numbers signs 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.020
 and others that serve several things that 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.990
 you are going to learn a button that makes 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.120
 exploit the computer 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.050
 a button that blows up the 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.050
 computer 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:51.679
 it only has so you can touch everything 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.939
 what do you want 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:58.700
 this is the monitor with the monitor 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.939
 show what you wrote with the keyboard 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.100
 and many more things see the things that there are 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:07.490
 inside the computer and things 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:11.480
 what are you looking for on the internet but beware 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:18.170
 monitor is not a TV without the others 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:19.690
 parts is useless now let's 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:26.890
 talk about the mouse 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:29.959
 not that mouse or this other mouse 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.420
 used to move the cursor that is the 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.280
 little arrow that you see on the monitor has 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.860
 buttons that are used for different 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.849
 things between them to select what 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.130
 that we want moving the mouse to move 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.769
 the cursor and pressing the buttons 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.230
 you enter different places like 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:51.879
 example 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:58.349
 file folder one of the most 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:58.349
 important is the calera 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:13.640
 Well not the tower but the tower for what 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.920
 It serves is like the engine and the deposit of 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.380
 the computer is where they are 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.540
 the data processor 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.140
 the components that makes the 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:27.400
 computer and the hard drive where it 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.650
 record information and files 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.430
 normally in the tower there is also the 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.430
 power button 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:41.720
 that is not a cup holder but the tray 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.420
 to put CDs and dvd and 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.480
 also these plugs landmarks for 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.549
 connect the same parts there are others 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.109
 useful elements that can be added to 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:55.489
 a computer microphone and speakers 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:57.739
 printer for printing on the 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:01.370
 things that we can write or draw or 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:04.250
 photos a camera to record image of 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.739
 video or you can even have a 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.700
 conversation seeing the other person to 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.700
 through the internet 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:18.360
 there are different computer models 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.330
 laptops such as plan 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.790
 ceibal for example I want to say a 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:27.660
 thing more many things are computers 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:31.890
 a cell phone has monitor keyboard camera 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:35.750
 Speaker Microphone therefore he 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.750
 it is also a computer 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.070
 since computers were invented 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.530
 they have been getting better and better for 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:46.350
 able to meet a greater number of 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.930
 functions there are many tasks some 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.800
 everyday things that become simpler 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.800
 with the computer as for example 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.800
 to write 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:07.510
 no no no 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.510
 why 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:15.450
 although many tell you 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:20.180
 even if you think you saw what I 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.180
 I mean friend is not like here 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.479
 Y 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.479
 3 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.830
 the computer does not work just for 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:36.990
 write you can also send and receive 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:40.909
 letters that are called emails 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:44.099
 electronic or emails save photos 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:47.340
 images videos draw consult 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:51.300
 information on the internet record sound or 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:54.000
 video save documents to consult 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.729
 write for tomorrow you can read the 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.340
 news you can see photos of something that you 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:01.560
 like to have a conversation with 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:05.159
 someone who is in another country powers 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:09.919
 you want to do calculations powers to record 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:09.919
 video and sound can be able to power 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:17.150
 all these possibilities be at your 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:21.020
 Reach remember with a little 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:24.800
 patience you can learn and start 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:28.250
 take advantage of some things do not seem 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.289
 easy with the computer but not you 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:34.889
 bilges 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:39.030
 below methods to finish with 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:43.680
 the coconuts so that the hand and the mind will 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:46.400
 they are getting used they are constancio for 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.400
 start 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:53.160
 and remember the coconuts do not exist
