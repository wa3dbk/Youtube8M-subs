list<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:36.180> be<00:01:36.299> listed<00:01:36.750> here<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.320> has<00:01:37.799> been

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
list to be listed here and has been

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.630 
list to be listed here and has been
tested<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.659> takes<00:01:39.960> 12<00:01:40.680> hours<00:01:41.189> for<00:01:41.520> the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
tested that it takes 12 hours for the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.730 
tested that it takes 12 hours for the
dragon<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.150> breed<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.960> it's<00:01:43.079> relatively<00:01:43.439> the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
dragon to breed so it's relatively the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.899 
dragon to breed so it's relatively the
same<00:01:43.979> as<00:01:44.189> most<00:01:44.369> dragons<00:01:46.460> well<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.610> can<00:01:47.759> also

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
same as most dragons well you can also

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.179 
same as most dragons well you can also
get<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.450> cool<00:01:48.750> fire<00:01:49.049> dragon<00:01:49.320> which<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.740> also

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
get the cool fire dragon which is also

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.880 
get the cool fire dragon which is also
cool<00:01:50.460> but<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.540> soccer<00:01:51.840> dragon<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.500> just<00:01:52.740> so

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890
