00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 hello world I hope you go 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.970
 well today I find you for 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.810
 a review on sexy mascara paul ii 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.030
 at yves rock 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.349
 so if you watched the video on 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.330
 my first as you rock yves 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.340
 know that I had a gift and that at 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.170
 hardly tested I already found it super 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.190
 to lengthen the styles and I got 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.990
 said it would be interesting to you 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.050
 review this product 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.460
 so it costs around 18h50 there 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.109
 seems to me it's still a price for 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.760
 a mascara and I find that it's not 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.380
 evil before buying look for 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.260
 different journals which I hope the 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.850
 town hall will please you so here at 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.190
 packaging level I find it is 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.200
 very pretty it's a purple and I find 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.350
 that it's a very nice color with the 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.969
 sexy pulp a little bit in brilliant and in 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.829
 kind of pink I find it is 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.100
 really very pretty i love everything 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.539
 simply at the level of the brush I 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.140
 find that the right is big enough 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.850
 still 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.530
 but that's a little bit important you see that 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.329
 at that level the biggest ones actually 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.920
 real alps narrows towards the middle and 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.280
 call becomes a little bigger 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.680
 so it's a brush and hair is 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.299
 no pimples here so if I 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.439
 compare to my volume just hearths 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.939
 for you see a little bit and the 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.680
 different up not so we go it's 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.250
 also much bigger if she has a 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.530
 form 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.900
 they gave him that's thick 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.400
 at the ends it is bigger and 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.070
 this one was very simple actually 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.100
 it was 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.710
 bros quite simple so I'm going to start 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.229
 by making a first opinion with the sexy 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.580
 poehl be able to a little bit naked what 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.990
 it gives and after I'll show you 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.440
 how I work on most 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.440
 the other eye 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.240
 so here I do them enough 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.960
 roughly we see that it was a 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.490
 blow fast enough and you already see the 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.840
 difference between my two eyes you 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.240
 see also who does not hurt 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.130
 of packages labrosse is pretty big 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.200
 so it's not super easy to 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.830
 do something to go there 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.900
 slowly 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.090
 it's directly packets even if 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.820
 we go pretty slowly so it's okay 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.709
 still but there is a little bit of 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.390
 packages and you still see 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.190
 definitely the difference finally me I 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.709
 find that messi have never been so 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.120
 big we really see what it gives 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.160
 so next I'll show you a 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.680
 little bit how do I do to try 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.320
 to work it is not easy 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.360
 I find no I come to take my 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.489
 deployed volume that no longer looks like 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.500
 nothing that is all room excuse me 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.360
 really one but he is finally he is 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.580
 almost finished and he's a little bit 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.300
 all dry and this is why 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.070
 that he is all disgusting 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.140
 so the brush and like these on the 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.519
 volume deploy wanted wanted to come in master 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.930
 on the other eye as I do 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:50.090
 normally with this one so I'm getting up 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.660
 thoroughly dry the volume deployed and after 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.250
 just at the ends i'm going to come 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.310
 really really slowly going to make two 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.049
 packages with the sexy poehl 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.640
 so here I think it has dried knowing 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:05.829
 that his cut and all that my card 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:09.380
 was full so I will resume the 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:10.270
 sexy toll and I will come gently in 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.520
 made 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.930
 lengthen styles by trying to 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.980
 not to do too much Easter and his skins 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.980
 very very easy 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.750
 that's what it gives then I find 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.890
 that I honestly do not know maybe 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.840
 that you have found that at the level of my 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.940
 two eyes on the level of sexy poehl 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.850
 all alone and sexy pulp and volume 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.440
 deployed there is not much difference 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.959
 but I think there is still 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.880
 I think it's darker if 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.590
 level there a little bit that the 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.810
 and who has fewer packets on this side 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.310
 after I do not know if you really see 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.350
 the difference is just in my head 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.650
 but I really find that there is a 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.650
 difference 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.319
 so that's what it gives with the sexy 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.650
 boy 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.180
 so I think you saw him sarah 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.069
 really really lashes a lot 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.840
 when I put the volume of the pouilly on 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.489
 this one and that I had not yet 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.930
 sexy mile paul I think that's it 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.639
 really sent the difference that one 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.300
 let it be far away 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:27.669
 than with this one then the strong points 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.500
 of this mascara are that it lengthens 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:32.110
 really a lot the eyelashes I find 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.580
 in any case really it is lengthened 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.039
 for those who would have small if 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.289
 is good I think it's a good 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:40.210
 option for extensions and after it 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:42.190
 beware of its brands and ultra 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.710
 volume I find it's not an ultra 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.590
 ultra long hours volume yes but 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.880
 after I find that at the volume level 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.260
 should put another mascara thing 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.660
 to make a combo with another 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.100
 mascara and finish with this one in small 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.210
 really costs to lengthen the sites 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.520
 because I really find it is 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.350
 very very effective so here I have you 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.080
 shown I hope you've seen at 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.880
 maximum what it gives but I find 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.470
 here it is a very very good mascara 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.360
 so here I hope that this video you 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.949
 will have interested I found it nice of 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.849
 do a review his masquerade I hope 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:11.500
 that you liked 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:13.800
 I do lots of big kisses finds myself 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.800
