is it so far I had some major problems
with<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.289> chain<00:00:23.900> so<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:25.080> doesn't<00:00:25.380> run<00:00:25.590> very

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
with the chain so it doesn't run very

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:46.000 
with the chain so it doesn't run very
well<00:00:26.480> but<00:00:27.480> here<00:00:28.320> we<00:00:28.859> go

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
chain but it's gonna get enough speed to

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.380 
chain but it's gonna get enough speed to
do<00:00:51.810> what<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.050> want<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.380> to<00:00:52.410> do<00:00:52.650> and<00:00:53.300> you<00:00:54.300> guys

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
I got a little bit more building down as

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
I got a little bit more building down as
you<00:01:15.300> can<00:01:15.420> see<00:01:15.570> it's<00:01:15.720> going<00:01:15.810> through<00:01:16.020> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
you can see it's going through the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.710 
you can see it's going through the
little<00:01:16.410> hole<00:01:16.470> right<00:01:17.090> there<00:01:20.420> test<00:01:21.420> again

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
little hole right there test again

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.870 
little hole right there test again
because<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.710> test<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.100> mainly<00:01:23.280> just<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.610> see

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
because this test is mainly just to see

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.570 
because this test is mainly just to see
make<00:01:24.570> sure<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.899> the<00:01:24.990> chain<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:26.100> won't

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
make sure that the chain that won't

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:40.450 
make sure that the chain that won't
interfere<00:01:26.940> with<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.479> car

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:47.950

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
the chain but I'm still worried about

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.510 
the chain but I'm still worried about
the<00:02:39.080> speed<00:02:39.880> ah<00:02:40.880> let<00:02:41.660> me<00:02:41.750> show<00:02:41.930> you<00:02:42.280> it's<00:02:43.280> made

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
the speed ah let me show you it's made

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.180 
the speed ah let me show you it's made
me<00:02:43.640> that<00:02:43.850> wheel<00:02:44.060> that<00:02:44.360> helps<00:02:44.690> a<00:02:44.780> lot<00:02:48.070> see<00:02:49.070> it's

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
me that wheel that helps a lot see it's

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.870 
me that wheel that helps a lot see it's
a<00:02:49.250> lot<00:02:49.430> less<00:02:49.610> jerky<00:02:54.340> see<00:02:55.340> I<00:02:55.370> don't<00:02:55.460> know<00:02:55.730> how

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
a lot less jerky see I don't know how

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.760 
a lot less jerky see I don't know how
much<00:02:56.030> if<00:02:56.210> I<00:02:56.390> need<00:02:56.810> more<00:02:56.990> speed<00:02:57.260> than<00:02:57.410> that<00:02:57.620> or

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
much if I need more speed than that or

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.520 
much if I need more speed than that or
not<00:02:57.920> probably<00:02:58.220> do<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:59.750> I<00:02:59.840> really<00:03:00.170> hope<00:03:00.320> I

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
last for you my first roller coaster did

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.770 
last for you my first roller coaster did
not<00:03:30.170> work<00:03:30.910> this<00:03:31.910> is<00:03:32.090> a<00:03:32.120> different<00:03:32.630> one<00:03:34.780> it's

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
not work this is a different one it's

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.570 
not work this is a different one it's
much<00:03:36.200> taller<00:03:36.530> I'm<00:03:36.800> afraid<00:03:37.130> I'm<00:03:37.250> gonna<00:03:37.370> learn

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
much taller I'm afraid I'm gonna learn

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.630 
much taller I'm afraid I'm gonna learn
how<00:03:37.610> to<00:03:37.730> pieces<00:03:38.390> actually<00:03:42.220> this<00:03:43.220> is<00:03:43.400> about

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
how to pieces actually this is about

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.050 
how to pieces actually this is about
what<00:03:43.850> it<00:03:43.970> is<00:03:44.120> I<00:03:44.980> think<00:03:45.980> it's<00:03:46.100> about<00:03:46.220> four<00:03:46.820> feet

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
what it is I think it's about four feet

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:54.280 
what it is I think it's about four feet
tall<00:03:50.800> but<00:03:51.800> not<00:03:52.040> very<00:03:52.400> stable<00:03:52.670> so<00:03:53.000> far<00:03:53.290> i'm

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
tall but not very stable so far i'm

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.340 
tall but not very stable so far i'm
working<00:03:54.680> on<00:03:54.769> that<00:03:55.209> but<00:03:56.209> yeah

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.120 

going<00:04:00.340> to<00:04:00.400> do<00:04:00.490> a<00:04:00.520> test<00:04:00.700> is<00:04:01.120> up<00:04:01.270> the<00:04:01.450> chain<00:04:02.100> see<00:04:03.100> a

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
going to do a test is up the chain see a

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:10.310 
going to do a test is up the chain see a
fact<00:04:03.580> that<00:04:03.790> goes<00:04:06.390> it<00:04:07.390> booked<00:04:07.870> the<00:04:08.110> cottage

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
fact that goes it booked the cottage

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.930 
fact that goes it booked the cottage
let's<00:04:11.320> not<00:04:11.500> broken<00:04:11.800> but<00:04:11.950> take<00:04:12.490> the<00:04:12.700> front

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
let's not broken but take the front

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.900 
let's not broken but take the front
thing<00:04:13.210> came<00:04:13.450> off<00:04:14.220> is<00:04:15.220> it<00:04:15.640> free<00:04:15.850> faster<00:04:17.910> come

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
thing came off is it free faster come

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.440 
thing came off is it free faster come
over<00:04:19.090> here<00:04:19.209> is<00:04:19.989> my<00:04:20.489> dicks<00:04:21.489> coaster<00:04:22.090> with<00:04:22.300> the

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
over here is my dicks coaster with the

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.630 
over here is my dicks coaster with the
dive<00:04:22.720> loop<00:04:22.960> at<00:04:23.170> the<00:04:23.200> end<00:04:23.350> but<00:04:24.130> I<00:04:24.190> noticed

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
dive loop at the end but I noticed

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.950 
dive loop at the end but I noticed
something<00:04:24.820> is<00:04:25.150> that<00:04:25.270> i'm<00:04:25.390> almost<00:04:25.600> out<00:04:25.900> of

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
something is that i'm almost out of

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.830 
something is that i'm almost out of
pieces<00:04:26.910> so<00:04:27.910> this<00:04:28.030> will<00:04:28.210> probably<00:04:28.390> be<00:04:28.540> working

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
pieces so this will probably be working

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:39.530 
pieces so this will probably be working
progress<00:04:29.170> for<00:04:29.620> a<00:04:29.680> while<00:04:29.890> but<00:04:32.250> yeah<00:04:37.800> but<00:04:38.800> yeah

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
progress for a while but yeah but yeah

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.790 
progress for a while but yeah but yeah
it's<00:04:40.540> probably<00:04:40.900> not<00:04:41.080> going<00:04:41.200> to<00:04:41.260> be<00:04:41.320> done<00:04:41.410> for<00:04:41.560> a

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
it's probably not going to be done for a

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.520 
it's probably not going to be done for a
little<00:04:41.890> while<00:04:42.070> i<00:04:42.130> might<00:04:42.430> have<00:04:42.580> to<00:04:42.640> get<00:04:42.790> another

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
little while i might have to get another

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:50.940 
little while i might have to get another
tip<00:04:44.530> or<00:04:44.890> something<00:04:48.900> yeah<00:04:49.900> see<00:04:50.440> I<00:04:50.470> followed

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
tip or something yeah see I followed

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.820 
tip or something yeah see I followed
your<00:04:51.100> instruction<00:04:51.640> booklet<00:04:52.000> for<00:04:52.150> that<00:04:52.300> loop

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
your instruction booklet for that loop

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.460 
your instruction booklet for that loop
because<00:04:53.830> I<00:04:54.460> just<00:04:54.520> I<00:04:55.210> knew<00:04:55.750> it<00:04:55.870> didn't<00:04:56.110> use<00:04:56.230> very

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
because I just I knew it didn't use very

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.410 
because I just I knew it didn't use very
many<00:04:56.500> pieces<00:04:56.920> compared<00:04:57.550> to<00:04:57.700> other<00:04:57.880> guys<00:04:58.150> and

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
many pieces compared to other guys and

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.480 
many pieces compared to other guys and
I've<00:04:58.510> seen<00:04:59.400> so<00:05:00.400> many<00:05:01.890> pieces<00:05:02.890> i'm<00:05:03.190> learning

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
I've seen so many pieces i'm learning

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.650 
I've seen so many pieces i'm learning
out<00:05:03.640> of<00:05:03.760> this<00:05:03.880> is<00:05:04.000> the<00:05:04.060> green<00:05:04.360> the<00:05:06.300> green<00:05:07.300> track

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
out of this is the green the green track

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.630 
out of this is the green the green track
I<00:05:07.990> point<00:05:08.920> with<00:05:09.190> my<00:05:09.370> foot<00:05:09.810> but<00:05:10.810> yeah<00:05:11.520> the<00:05:12.520> green

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
I point with my foot but yeah the green

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.640 
I point with my foot but yeah the green
tractor<00:05:13.000> purple<00:05:13.480> track<00:05:13.720> I'm<00:05:14.710> running<00:05:15.040> out<00:05:15.160> so

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
tractor purple track I'm running out so

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:22.080 
tractor purple track I'm running out so
i'll<00:05:17.650> get<00:05:18.190> probably<00:05:18.460> get<00:05:18.760> another<00:05:18.910> kid<00:05:21.090> and

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
i'll get probably get another kid and

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.810 
i'll get probably get another kid and
i'll<00:05:22.360> see<00:05:22.600> you<00:05:22.630> guys<00:05:22.780> later<00:05:23.140> i<00:05:23.380> guess<00:05:23.680> this<00:05:24.580> is

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
i'll see you guys later i guess this is

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.620 
i'll see you guys later i guess this is
my<00:05:25.150> roller<00:05:25.390> coaster<00:05:25.750> so<00:05:25.990> far<00:05:27.150> the<00:05:28.150> reason

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
my roller coaster so far the reason

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.200 
my roller coaster so far the reason
proof<00:05:29.530> that<00:05:29.560> you<00:05:29.860> need<00:05:30.070> more<00:05:30.820> than<00:05:30.880> one

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
proof that you need more than one

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.090 
proof that you need more than one
screaming<00:05:31.990> serving<00:05:32.410> kids<00:05:32.560> there<00:05:32.860> should<00:05:33.010> be

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
screaming serving kids there should be

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.560 
screaming serving kids there should be
some<00:05:33.280> roller<00:05:33.550> coaster<00:05:35.790> well<00:05:36.790> custom<00:05:37.390> in-ear

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
some roller coaster well custom in-ear

ensberg and that's a far got and I ran

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.630 
ensberg and that's a far got and I ran
out<00:05:47.080> I'm<00:05:47.440> pretty<00:05:47.770> much<00:05:47.800> out<00:05:48.040> of<00:05:48.100> track<00:05:48.400> length

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.640 
out I'm pretty much out of track length

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:58.660 
out I'm pretty much out of track length
I'm<00:05:48.940> I<00:05:49.240> don't<00:05:49.840> have<00:05:49.990> enough<00:05:50.230> chain<00:05:50.530> oh<00:05:53.490> yeah

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:58.670 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.840
