chambers<00:04:33.790> for<00:04:33.970> the<00:04:34.060> project<00:04:34.510> so<00:04:34.720> he's

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
chambers for the project so he's

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.530 
chambers for the project so he's
bringing<00:04:35.919> up<00:04:36.190> the<00:04:36.310> echos<00:04:36.669> it's<00:04:36.940> very<00:04:37.270> very

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
bringing up the echos it's very very

bringing up the echos it's very very
minimal<00:04:37.960> EQ<00:04:38.380> it's<00:04:38.500> minus<00:04:38.889> 6<00:04:39.160> plus<00:04:39.340> 6<00:04:39.669> at<00:04:39.850> 100

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
minimal EQ it's minus 6 plus 6 at 100

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.590 
minimal EQ it's minus 6 plus 6 at 100

tricky<00:04:50.620> but<00:04:50.770> I<00:04:50.890> love<00:04:51.190> mixing<00:04:51.580> on<00:04:52.030> these<00:04:52.210> knobs

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
tricky but I love mixing on these knobs

it's<00:04:52.900> just<00:04:53.140> it's<00:04:53.560> really<00:04:53.950> a<00:04:53.979> giggle<00:04:54.400> because

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
it's just it's really a giggle because

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.159 
it's just it's really a giggle because

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
you don't get to just push them up and

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.890 
you don't get to just push them up and
down<00:04:56.350> you<00:04:56.530> got<00:04:56.650> to<00:04:56.680> turn<00:04:56.950> them<00:04:57.600> but<00:04:58.600> it's<00:04:58.750> just

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
down you got to turn them but it's just

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.810 
down you got to turn them but it's just
it<00:04:59.080> has<00:04:59.140> a<00:04:59.260> great<00:04:59.620> tone<00:04:59.890> to<00:05:00.130> it<00:05:00.160> and<00:05:00.490> set<00:05:00.789> a

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
it has a great tone to it and set a

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.659 
it has a great tone to it and set a
great<00:05:01.030> vibe<00:05:01.270> to<00:05:01.539> it

this<00:05:43.069> is<00:05:43.219> actually<00:05:43.909> don't<00:05:44.090> fund<00:05:44.270> it<00:05:44.330> was<00:05:44.449> very

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:44.629 
this is actually don't fund it was very

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:46.629 
this is actually don't fund it was very
first<00:05:44.930> impressive<00:05:45.590> em8<00:05:46.159> available

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 
first impressive em8 available
