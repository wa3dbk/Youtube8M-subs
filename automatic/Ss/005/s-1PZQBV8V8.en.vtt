let's<00:00:29.099> start<00:00:29.220> at<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.430> basic<00:00:29.759> setting<00:00:30.029> I'm<00:00:30.090> going

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
let's start at a basic setting I'm going

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.380 
let's start at a basic setting I'm going
to<00:00:30.270> turn<00:00:30.360> the<00:00:30.539> output<00:00:30.960> at<00:00:31.879> 12<00:00:32.879> o'clock<00:00:33.120> we'll

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
to turn the output at 12 o'clock we'll

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.540 
to turn the output at 12 o'clock we'll
do<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.750> gain<00:00:34.019> I'm<00:00:34.800> going<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.040> set<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.280> gain<00:00:35.430> up

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
do the gain I'm going to set the gain up

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.369 
do the gain I'm going to set the gain up
pretty<00:00:36.269> much<00:00:36.480> down<00:00:36.690> I'm<00:00:36.870> going<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.050> set<00:00:37.199> that

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
pretty much down I'm going to set that

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.310 
pretty much down I'm going to set that
switch<00:00:38.370> drive<00:00:38.790> switch<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.239> peak<00:00:39.420> down<00:00:40.050> we'll

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
switch drive switch and peak down we'll

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.060 
switch drive switch and peak down we'll
get<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.530> those<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.830> minute

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
I'm going to set that tone at 12 o'clock

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.290 
I'm going to set that tone at 12 o'clock
and<00:00:43.199> the<00:00:43.559> filter<00:00:43.949> at<00:00:44.040> 12<00:00:44.640> o'clock<00:00:44.850> here<00:00:45.120> and

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
and the filter at 12 o'clock here and

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:59.200 
and the filter at 12 o'clock here and
we'll<00:00:46.199> go<00:00:46.680> ahead<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:48.170> let's<00:00:49.170> clean<00:00:49.860> tone

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.860 

okay<00:00:59.930> this<00:01:00.860> thing<00:01:01.130> really<00:01:01.490> favors<00:01:02.090> the<00:01:02.360> low

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
okay this thing really favors the low

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.560 
okay this thing really favors the low

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.490 

obviously<00:01:17.660> we<00:01:17.780> can<00:01:17.900> turn<00:01:18.050> the<00:01:18.170> gain<00:01:18.290> all<00:01:18.440> the

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
obviously we can turn the gain all the

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:31.770 
obviously we can turn the gain all the
way<00:01:18.560> up

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.420 

I'm<00:01:32.380> going<00:01:32.530> to<00:01:32.590> go<00:01:32.650> ahead<00:01:32.710> and<00:01:32.890> leave<00:01:32.979> the<00:01:33.159> game

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
I'm going to go ahead and leave the game

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.340 
I'm going to go ahead and leave the game
knob<00:01:33.640> up<00:01:33.850> and<00:01:34.030> I'll<00:01:34.119> show<00:01:34.330> you<00:01:34.360> the<00:01:34.690> tone<00:01:35.020> and

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
knob up and I'll show you the tone and

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.140 
knob up and I'll show you the tone and
filter<00:01:35.740> knobs<00:01:35.920> these<00:01:36.430> two<00:01:36.670> tend<00:01:36.940> to<00:01:37.000> work

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
filter knobs these two tend to work

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.700 
filter knobs these two tend to work
together<00:01:37.330> I'm<00:01:37.750> going<00:01:37.840> to<00:01:37.900> turn<00:01:38.049> the<00:01:38.170> tone<00:01:38.440> knob

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
together I'm going to turn the tone knob

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.819 
together I'm going to turn the tone knob
up<00:01:38.950> and<00:01:39.820> let's<00:01:40.330> try

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:47.230 

okay<00:01:45.829> and<00:01:46.219> I'm<00:01:46.670> going<00:01:46.759> to<00:01:46.850> start<00:01:47.060> with<00:01:47.149> the

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
okay and I'm going to start with the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.340 
okay and I'm going to start with the
filter<00:01:47.539> all<00:01:47.689> the<00:01:47.719> way<00:01:47.840> down<00:01:47.990> I'll<00:01:48.140> move<00:01:48.319> that

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
filter all the way down I'll move that

00:01:48.350 --> 00:02:59.420 
filter all the way down I'll move that
up

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.190 

this<00:03:00.430> thing<00:03:00.640> gets<00:03:00.849> really<00:03:01.330> hard<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.660> palm<00:03:01.930> mute

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
this thing gets really hard to palm mute

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.229 
this thing gets really hard to palm mute
if<00:03:02.410> you've<00:03:02.560> got<00:03:02.770> the<00:03:02.890> gain<00:03:03.069> set<00:03:03.430> up<00:03:03.550> any<00:03:03.970> higher

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
if you've got the gain set up any higher

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:05.460 
if you've got the gain set up any higher
than<00:03:04.450> this<00:03:04.599> I'm<00:03:04.810> going<00:03:04.930> to<00:03:04.989> dial<00:03:05.110> the<00:03:05.319> gain

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
than this I'm going to dial the gain

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.990 
than this I'm going to dial the gain
back<00:03:05.709> here<00:03:05.980> and<00:03:06.129> try<00:03:06.310> to<00:03:06.340> Palm<00:03:06.580> you<00:03:06.700> with<00:03:06.849> it

we've<00:03:26.440> got<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:26.860> drive<00:03:27.280> switch<00:03:27.970> here<00:03:28.300> it's

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
we've got the drive switch here it's

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:37.150 
we've got the drive switch here it's
just<00:03:28.690> going<00:03:28.930> to<00:03:28.989> give<00:03:29.140> us<00:03:29.260> more<00:03:29.380> gain

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.670 

dial<00:03:37.820> this<00:03:38.090> tone<00:03:38.870> knob<00:03:39.080> back<00:03:39.260> a<00:03:39.320> little<00:03:39.500> bit

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
dial this tone knob back a little bit

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.140 
dial this tone knob back a little bit
and<00:03:39.950> we'll<00:03:40.190> leave<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:40.460> filter<00:03:40.700> at<00:03:40.880> the<00:03:41.000> same

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
and we'll leave the filter at the same

00:03:41.150 --> 00:04:09.500 
and we'll leave the filter at the same
place

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.280 

okay<00:04:10.510> then<00:04:10.750> we're<00:04:10.870> going<00:04:10.990> to<00:04:11.020> leave<00:04:11.170> that

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
okay then we're going to leave that

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.260 
okay then we're going to leave that
driving<00:04:11.680> up<00:04:11.770> up<00:04:12.070> and<00:04:12.520> I'm<00:04:12.790> going<00:04:12.880> to<00:04:12.970> turn<00:04:13.150> this

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
driving up up and I'm going to turn this

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.750 
driving up up and I'm going to turn this
peak<00:04:13.600> knob<00:04:13.900> up<00:04:14.290> and<00:04:14.620> it's<00:04:15.160> going<00:04:15.280> to<00:04:15.340> lose<00:04:15.730> a

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
peak knob up and it's going to lose a

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.250 
peak knob up and it's going to lose a
little<00:04:15.970> bit<00:04:16.060> of<00:04:16.180> gain<00:04:16.390> but<00:04:16.750> you'll<00:04:16.959> see<00:04:17.140> what

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
little bit of gain but you'll see what

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:33.510 
little bit of gain but you'll see what
happens<00:04:17.290> here

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.980 

okay<00:04:34.520> so<00:04:34.580> we've<00:04:34.790> got<00:04:34.820> the<00:04:35.120> expression<00:04:35.720> pedal

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
okay so we've got the expression pedal

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.140 
okay so we've got the expression pedal
input<00:04:36.170> let's<00:04:37.130> go<00:04:37.250> ahead<00:04:37.370> and<00:04:37.610> plug<00:04:37.790> that<00:04:37.970> in

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
input let's go ahead and plug that in
