00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
you have to you know sit there and

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.700 
you have to you know sit there and
fumble<00:00:34.600> looking<00:00:34.870> for<00:00:35.050> your<00:00:35.140> tender<00:00:35.500> in<00:00:35.590> the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
fumble looking for your tender in the

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.829 
fumble looking for your tender in the
dark<00:00:35.949> or<00:00:36.340> have<00:00:36.550> to<00:00:36.699> toss<00:00:36.879> your<00:00:37.089> guitar<00:00:37.449> off<00:00:37.659> to

dark or have to toss your guitar off to
the<00:00:37.929> guitar<00:00:38.229> tech<00:00:38.530> and<00:00:38.769> a<00:00:38.800> tight<00:00:39.039> pinch<00:00:39.339> now

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
the guitar tech and a tight pinch now

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:41.700 
the guitar tech and a tight pinch now
you've<00:00:40.539> got<00:00:40.629> control<00:00:40.839> you<00:00:41.229> can<00:00:41.379> just<00:00:41.530> sit

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
you've got control you can just sit

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.500 
you've got control you can just sit
there<00:00:41.859> and<00:00:42.039> do<00:00:42.190> it<00:00:42.339> really<00:00:42.579> fast<00:00:42.819> here<00:00:43.359> and

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
there and do it really fast here and

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.200 
there and do it really fast here and
this<00:00:43.569> is<00:00:43.719> how<00:00:43.839> it<00:00:43.989> works<00:00:44.139> it's<00:00:44.440> real<00:00:44.620> simple

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
this is how it works it's real simple

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.639 
this is how it works it's real simple
basically<00:00:46.210> it<00:00:46.300> works<00:00:46.420> on<00:00:46.690> a<00:00:46.719> push-pull<00:00:47.319> pot

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
basically it works on a push-pull pot

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.619 
basically it works on a push-pull pot
system<00:00:48.190> and<00:00:49.379> when<00:00:50.379> you<00:00:50.699> pull<00:00:51.699> up<00:00:51.760> the<00:00:52.210> volume

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
system and when you pull up the volume

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:58.270 
system and when you pull up the volume
knob<00:00:53.339> then<00:00:54.339> it<00:00:54.460> goes<00:00:54.609> into<00:00:54.639> true<00:00:55.030> bypass<00:00:55.510> mode

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.040 

now<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.550> intruder<00:01:00.059> mode<00:01:00.269> it<00:01:00.600> doesn't<00:01:00.929> matter

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
now it's intruder mode it doesn't matter

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.079 
now it's intruder mode it doesn't matter
where<00:01:01.320> your<00:01:01.500> volume<00:01:01.859> pot<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.309> or<00:01:02.760> where's

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.089 
where your volume pot is or where's

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:05.359 
where your volume pot is or where's
pickup<00:01:03.690> selector<00:01:03.839> switches<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:05.100> aren't<00:01:05.309> in

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
pickup selector switches you aren't in

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.139 
pickup selector switches you aren't in
bypass<00:01:05.820> mode<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.299> it's<00:01:06.420> nice<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.750> quiet<00:01:06.899> and

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
bypass mode and it's nice and quiet and

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:10.639 
bypass mode and it's nice and quiet and
one<00:01:09.149> thing<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.390> should<00:01:09.450> tell<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.840> obviously<00:01:10.530> of

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
one thing I should tell you obviously of

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:12.649 
one thing I should tell you obviously of
course<00:01:10.680> for<00:01:11.280> my<00:01:11.399> strat<00:01:11.759> for<00:01:12.000> demonstration

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
course for my strat for demonstration

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.779 
course for my strat for demonstration
purposes<00:01:13.170> we<00:01:13.530> took<00:01:13.680> out<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.159> regular<00:01:14.340> volume

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:14.789 
purposes we took out the regular volume

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:17.359 
purposes we took out the regular volume
and<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.299> two-tone<00:01:16.170> pots<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.950> just<00:01:17.190> went

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
and the two-tone pots and just went

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.310 
and the two-tone pots and just went
ahead<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.700> put<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.970> Entune<00:01:18.299> right<00:01:18.570> here<00:01:18.780> for

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
ahead and put the Entune right here for

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.690 
ahead and put the Entune right here for
whatever<00:01:19.500> reason<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.190> don't<00:01:20.280> know<00:01:20.430> we<00:01:20.580> just

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
whatever reason I don't know we just

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.210 
whatever reason I don't know we just
kind<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.000> did<00:01:21.180> just<00:01:21.450> for<00:01:21.570> fun<00:01:21.780> but<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.770> can<00:01:22.979> put

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
kind of did just for fun but you can put

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.359 
kind of did just for fun but you can put
the<00:01:23.460> volume<00:01:24.439> anywhere<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.470> want<00:01:26.039> in<00:01:26.310> your

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
the volume anywhere you want in your

e-flat the way this tuner works just a

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.259 
e-flat the way this tuner works just a
little<00:02:31.220> heads-up<00:02:31.579> is<00:02:31.790> you're<00:02:31.939> gonna<00:02:32.000> have<00:02:32.180> to

little heads-up is you're gonna have to
think<00:02:32.480> on<00:02:32.569> the<00:02:32.720> sharp<00:02:33.019> so<00:02:33.349> you're<00:02:33.470> not<00:02:33.560> going

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
think on the sharp so you're not going

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.679 
think on the sharp so you're not going
to<00:02:33.769> have<00:02:33.860> to<00:02:33.950> be<00:02:33.980> thinking<00:02:34.250> a<00:02:34.730> flat<00:02:35.480> you're

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:35.689 
to have to be thinking a flat you're

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.080 
to have to be thinking a flat you're
going<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:35.870> be<00:02:35.930> thinking<00:02:36.290> d<00:02:36.470> sharp<00:02:36.799> and<00:02:37.129> so<00:02:37.909> when

going to be thinking d sharp and so when

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.420 
going to be thinking d sharp and so when
you<00:02:38.209> play<00:02:38.420> a<00:02:38.450> d<00:02:38.720> sharp<00:02:38.989> or<00:02:39.319> E<00:02:39.560> flat<00:02:39.590> mind<00:02:40.250> you

you play a d sharp or E flat mind you
and<00:02:40.670> automatically<00:02:41.299> speaking<00:02:43.090> it's<00:02:44.090> going<00:02:44.360> to

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
and automatically speaking it's going to

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.149 
and automatically speaking it's going to
act<00:02:44.510> as<00:02:44.690> we<00:02:45.019> just<00:02:45.200> did<00:02:45.379> normally<00:02:45.829> you're<00:02:46.040> going

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
to get the note you're going to see if

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.849 
to get the note you're going to see if
that<00:02:48.519> bass<00:02:49.519> note<00:02:49.879> is<00:02:50.060> in<00:02:50.209> tune<00:02:50.239> and<00:02:51.230> also<00:02:51.620> that

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:51.859 
that bass note is in tune and also that

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:53.800 
that bass note is in tune and also that
you<00:02:51.920> have<00:02:52.129> a<00:02:52.159> second<00:02:52.790> light<00:02:53.000> to<00:02:53.180> negotiate

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
you have a second light to negotiate

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.069 
you have a second light to negotiate
which<00:02:54.049> is<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.349> sharp<00:02:55.030> so<00:02:56.030> it's<00:02:56.180> telling<00:02:56.540> us<00:02:56.659> d

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
which is the sharp so it's telling us d

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.530 
which is the sharp so it's telling us d
is<00:02:57.319> in<00:02:57.470> tune<00:02:57.709> and<00:02:58.099> it's<00:02:58.489> on<00:02:58.639> d<00:02:58.849> sharp<00:02:59.120> and<00:02:59.420> we're

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
is in tune and it's on d sharp and we're

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.690 
is in tune and it's on d sharp and we're
good<00:02:59.750> let's<00:03:00.139> say<00:03:00.319> if<00:03:00.440> we<00:03:00.560> are<00:03:00.590> on<00:03:00.769> a<00:03:00.859> c-sharp<00:03:01.340> it

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
good let's say if we are on a c-sharp it

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.300 
good let's say if we are on a c-sharp it
moves<00:03:01.879> down<00:03:02.000> to<00:03:02.239> C<00:03:03.250> and<00:03:05.079> C<00:03:06.079> sharp<00:03:06.470> see<00:03:06.829> that<00:03:07.010> hey

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
moves down to C and C sharp see that hey

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.300 
moves down to C and C sharp see that hey
easy<00:03:07.609> enough<00:03:08.079> so<00:03:09.079> obviously<00:03:09.739> you<00:03:09.980> want<00:03:10.129> to<00:03:10.220> get

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310

easy enough so obviously you want to get
your<00:03:10.430> sound<00:03:10.670> back<00:03:10.909> you<00:03:11.180> just<00:03:11.209> push<00:03:11.690> you<00:03:11.810> back

goes over the potentiometer which is
right<00:04:17.310> here<00:04:17.540> it's<00:04:18.540> a<00:04:18.570> little<00:04:18.780> push-pull<00:04:19.709> pot

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
right here it's a little push-pull pot

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.700 
right here it's a little push-pull pot
see<00:04:21.329> that<00:04:21.510> little<00:04:21.720> push<00:04:21.989> fold<00:04:22.260> got<00:04:22.590> the

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
coils or in this case actually i'm

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.279 
coils or in this case actually i'm
running<00:04:41.640> a<00:04:41.700> 500k<00:04:42.240> on<00:04:42.570> because<00:04:42.960> I've<00:04:43.080> got<00:04:43.260> a

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
running a 500k on because I've got a

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.200 
running a 500k on because I've got a
seymour<00:04:43.710> duncan<00:04:43.860> jeff<00:04:44.280> beck<00:04:44.490> jr<00:04:44.970> which

seymour duncan jeff beck jr which

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.260 
seymour duncan jeff beck jr which
requires<00:04:45.690> a<00:04:46.140> 500<00:04:47.070> kale<00:04:47.280> because<00:04:47.850> it's<00:04:48.180> a

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
requires a 500 kale because it's a

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.710 
requires a 500 kale because it's a
double<00:04:48.570> coil<00:04:48.780> in<00:04:49.229> a<00:04:49.380> single<00:04:49.740> coil<00:04:50.210> form<00:04:51.210> factor

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
double coil in a single coil form factor

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.260 
double coil in a single coil form factor
obviously<00:04:51.990> a<00:04:52.410> double<00:04:52.770> stack<00:04:53.090> so<00:04:54.090> that's

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
obviously a double stack so that's

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.080 
obviously a double stack so that's
really<00:04:54.479> about<00:04:54.690> it<00:04:55.140> I<00:04:55.169> mean<00:04:55.560> it's<00:04:56.550> not<00:04:56.760> rocket

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
really about it I mean it's not rocket

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.090 
really about it I mean it's not rocket
science<00:04:57.630> in<00:04:57.720> oil<00:04:57.990> well<00:04:58.110> the<00:04:58.200> technology<00:04:58.890> is

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
science in oil well the technology is

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.100 
science in oil well the technology is
inside<00:04:59.700> what's<00:04:59.940> making<00:05:00.240> this<00:05:00.330> work<00:05:00.570> but<00:05:00.870> for

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
inside what's making this work but for

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.430 
inside what's making this work but for
us<00:05:01.260> we<00:05:02.070> just<00:05:02.250> drop<00:05:02.520> it<00:05:02.700> in<00:05:02.910> and<00:05:03.150> we're<00:05:04.050> ready<00:05:04.289> to

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
us we just drop it in and we're ready to
