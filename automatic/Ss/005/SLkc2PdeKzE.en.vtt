I've<00:00:11.790> seen<00:00:12.150> so<00:00:12.420> many<00:00:12.509> reviews<00:00:12.929> here<00:00:13.139> on

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
I've seen so many reviews here on

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.660 
I've seen so many reviews here on
YouTube<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.679> when<00:00:13.860> I<00:00:13.920> see<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.340> bunch<00:00:14.580> of

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
YouTube and when I see a bunch of

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.250 
YouTube and when I see a bunch of
reviews<00:00:14.910> come<00:00:15.120> out<00:00:15.210> at<00:00:15.299> once<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.690> start<00:00:16.139> to

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
reviews come out at once I start to

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.380 
reviews come out at once I start to
wonder<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.650> think<00:00:16.890> if<00:00:17.070> it's<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.400> sponsorship

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
wonder and think if it's a sponsorship

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.450 
wonder and think if it's a sponsorship
or<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:19.500> know<00:00:19.619> if<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.830> lot<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:20.100> people<00:00:20.310> were<00:00:20.400> just

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
or you know if a lot of people were just

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.800 
or you know if a lot of people were just
getting<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.820> whole<00:00:21.000> bunch<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.240> free<00:00:21.420> products

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
getting a whole bunch of free products

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.170 
getting a whole bunch of free products
so<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:22.170> didn't<00:00:22.859> want<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.100> necessarily<00:00:23.250> do<00:00:24.150> a

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
so I didn't want to necessarily do a

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.790 
so I didn't want to necessarily do a
review<00:00:24.570> on<00:00:24.630> something<00:00:24.869> that's<00:00:25.140> been<00:00:25.289> done<00:00:25.500> but

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
review on something that's been done but

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.470 
review on something that's been done but
then<00:00:25.980> when<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.250> really<00:00:26.820> looked<00:00:27.029> at<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.269> videos

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
then when I really looked at the videos

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.480 
then when I really looked at the videos
and<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.630> watched<00:00:27.869> them<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.410> lot<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.189> people<00:00:29.429> were

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
and I watched them a lot of people were

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.359 
and I watched them a lot of people were
just<00:00:30.380> really<00:00:31.380> in<00:00:31.500> love<00:00:31.619> with<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.830> product<00:00:32.189> and

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
just really in love with the product and

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.580 
just really in love with the product and
I<00:00:32.940> think<00:00:33.329> most<00:00:33.660> people<00:00:33.750> actually<00:00:34.050> bought<00:00:34.440> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
I think most people actually bought the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.590 
I think most people actually bought the
product<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.579> not<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> lot<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.149> people<00:00:36.360> have<00:00:36.480> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.420 
product and not a lot of people have the
same<00:00:36.780> hair<00:00:37.290> textures<00:00:37.710> mind<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.129> wanted<00:00:38.370> to

a quarter of it yet which says a lot

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.830 
a quarter of it yet which says a lot

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
rinse out really well I suggest using

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.609 
rinse out really well I suggest using
the<00:01:06.420> coolest<00:01:06.810> water<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.290> can<00:01:07.439> tolerate

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
the coolest water that you can tolerate

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.740 
the coolest water that you can tolerate
because<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.430> want<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.670> seal<00:01:09.090> your<00:01:09.270> cuticles

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
because you want to seal your cuticles

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.149 
because you want to seal your cuticles
so<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.080> get<00:01:10.200> all<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.470> moisturizing

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
so that you get all the moisturizing

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.800 
so that you get all the moisturizing
inside<00:01:11.580> but<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:11.970> doesn't<00:01:12.270> kind<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.510> seep<00:01:12.659> out

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
inside but it doesn't kind of seep out

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.539 
inside but it doesn't kind of seep out
especially<00:01:13.470> if<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.680> are<00:01:13.830> going<00:01:13.950> from<00:01:14.189> curly

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
especially if you are going from curly

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.520 
especially if you are going from curly
to<00:01:14.580> straight<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.780> want<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.049> really<00:01:16.290> rinse

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
to straight and you want to really rinse

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.780 
to straight and you want to really rinse
it<00:01:16.650> out<00:01:16.770> if<00:01:16.920> you're<00:01:17.040> going<00:01:17.189> from<00:01:17.310> curly<00:01:17.670> to

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
it out if you're going from curly to

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.670 
it out if you're going from curly to
straight<00:01:17.820> because<00:01:18.299> there<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.689> light<00:01:19.320> film

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
straight because there is light film

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.550 
straight because there is light film
that<00:01:19.979> can<00:01:20.189> add<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:21.030> build<00:01:21.299> up<00:01:21.570> at<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.960> end<00:01:22.170> and

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
that can add to build up at the end and
