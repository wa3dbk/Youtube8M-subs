00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
a similar predicament a year ago and I
was<00:00:19.590> always<00:00:19.710> talked<00:00:20.039> about<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.460> possibility

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
was always talked about the possibility

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.179 
was always talked about the possibility
of<00:00:21.180> playing<00:00:21.390> over<00:00:21.810> age<00:00:21.990> given<00:00:22.529> who<00:00:22.830> might<00:00:23.039> be

of playing over age given who might be

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.040 
of playing over age given who might be
in<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.400> system<00:00:23.640> here<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.750> possibility

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
in the system here is that a possibility

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.130 
in the system here is that a possibility
in<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.769> back<00:00:25.920> of<00:00:26.130> your<00:00:26.310> mind<00:00:26.490> at<00:00:26.699> all<00:00:26.789> oh<00:00:27.140> I'm

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
in the back of your mind at all oh I'm

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.890 
in the back of your mind at all oh I'm
not<00:00:28.289> too<00:00:28.500> sure<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.949> think<00:00:29.189> it's<00:00:29.369> up<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.900> well

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
not too sure I think it's up to well

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.420 
not too sure I think it's up to well
it's<00:00:31.019> up<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.140> me<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.529> up<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.830> leaf<00:00:32.160> staff

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
it's up to me and up to the leaf staff

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.030 
it's up to me and up to the leaf staff
where<00:00:32.790> they<00:00:33.000> want<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.300> place<00:00:33.480> me<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.500> guess<00:00:34.680> I

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
where they want to place me so I guess I

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.790 
where they want to place me so I guess I
could<00:00:35.280> kind<00:00:36.120> of<00:00:36.300> make<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.780> difference<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.469> I

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
could kind of make a difference and I

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.130 
could kind of make a difference and I
let<00:00:38.460> my<00:00:38.579> play<00:00:38.820> kind<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.420> do<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.629> talking<00:00:40.020> I

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
let my play kind of do the talking I

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.709 
let my play kind of do the talking I
guess<00:00:40.399> you<00:00:41.399> know<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> terrific<00:00:41.969> second<00:00:42.329> half<00:00:42.540> of

move forward to the postseason yeah yeah

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.729 
move forward to the postseason yeah yeah
at<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.719> start<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.140> year<00:00:52.170> we<00:00:52.350> def<00:00:52.500> had<00:00:52.710> a

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
at the start of the year we def had a

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.939 
at the start of the year we def had a
tough<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.160> touch<00:00:53.640> start<00:00:54.739> when<00:00:55.739> things

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
tough you touch start when things

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.049 
tough you touch start when things
weren't<00:00:56.129> going<00:00:56.340> through<00:00:56.579> well<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.730> think<00:00:56.850> we

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
weren't going through well I think we

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.020 
weren't going through well I think we
stared<00:00:57.329> off<00:00:57.480> like<00:00:57.750> 2<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.340> 12<00:00:59.340> or<00:00:59.670> something

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
stared off like 2 and 12 or something

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.569 
stared off like 2 and 12 or something
crazy<00:01:00.180> like<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:01.079> we<00:01:01.620> definitely<00:01:01.829> were<00:01:02.460> in

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
crazy like that so we definitely were in

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.429 
crazy like that so we definitely were in
a<00:01:02.640> bit<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:03.090> tug<00:01:03.719> yourself<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:04.049> little<00:01:04.229> bit<00:01:04.350> of

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
a bit of a tug yourself a little bit of

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.010 
a bit of a tug yourself a little bit of
a<00:01:04.500> hole<00:01:04.680> but<00:01:04.949> after<00:01:05.939> getting<00:01:06.060> guys<00:01:06.330> back<00:01:06.630> and

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
a hole but after getting guys back and

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.359 
a hole but after getting guys back and
getting<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.320> little<00:01:07.470> bit<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.740> momentum<00:01:07.890> on<00:01:08.280> her

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
getting a little bit of momentum on her

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.520 
getting a little bit of momentum on her
side<00:01:08.580> he<00:01:08.670> definitely<00:01:08.939> find<00:01:09.840> out<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.320> and

whole<00:01:13.159> elaborate<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.549> skill<00:01:14.820> set<00:01:15.060> of

Brendan perlini Josh ho sang and how

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.670 
Brendan perlini Josh ho sang and how
they<00:01:17.670> made<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.119> better<00:01:18.330> as<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> player<00:01:18.780> yeah

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.520 
they made you better as a player yeah
yeah<00:01:20.070> well<00:01:20.750> obviously<00:01:21.750> they're<00:01:22.110> great

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
yeah well obviously they're great

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.020 
yeah well obviously they're great
players<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.159> they're<00:01:23.340> easy<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.670> play<00:01:23.820> with

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
players and they're easy to play with

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.530 
players and they're easy to play with
and<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.479> guess<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.920> played<00:01:26.520> mostly<00:01:27.299> with

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
and I guess I played mostly with

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.039 
and I guess I played mostly with
prettily<00:01:28.290> knee<00:01:28.350> which<00:01:29.600> he's<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.659> great<00:01:30.900> player

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
prettily knee which he's a great player

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.730 
prettily knee which he's a great player
big<00:01:31.560> speedy<00:01:31.890> winger<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.689> can<00:01:33.689> score<00:01:34.200> goals<00:01:34.229> so

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
big speedy winger and can score goals so

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.649 
big speedy winger and can score goals so
you<00:01:35.490> give<00:01:35.670> him<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.820> puck<00:01:36.000> he<00:01:36.119> can<00:01:36.270> put<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.540> in

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
you give him the puck he can put it in

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.649 
you give him the puck he can put it in
so<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.110> helps<00:01:37.320> out<00:01:37.470> for<00:01:37.710> sure<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.210> just<00:01:39.210> having

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
so it helps out for sure and just having

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.260 
so it helps out for sure and just having
those<00:01:39.900> guys<00:01:40.110> back<00:01:40.350> having<00:01:40.829> more<00:01:41.280> older

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
those guys back having more older

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.870 
those guys back having more older
players<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.229> guess<00:01:43.890> get<00:01:44.340> more<00:01:44.520> skilled

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
players and I guess get more skilled

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.330 
players and I guess get more skilled
players<00:01:45.149> than<00:01:45.479> having<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:46.049> lot<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.439> rookies<00:01:47.070> and

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
players than having a lot of rookies and

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.330 
players than having a lot of rookies and
the<00:01:47.369> lineup<00:01:47.909> I<00:01:48.149> guess<00:01:48.649> definitely<00:01:49.649> helps<00:01:50.220> the

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
the lineup I guess definitely helps the

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.819 
the lineup I guess definitely helps the
team<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.820> definitely<00:01:51.200> helped<00:01:52.200> us<00:01:52.350> in<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
team and definitely helped us in the

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.760 
team and definitely helped us in the
second<00:01:53.130> half<00:01:53.250> for<00:01:53.430> sure<00:01:53.610> being<00:01:54.329> named<00:01:54.540> captain

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
second half for sure being named captain

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.109 
second half for sure being named captain
mid-january<00:01:55.770> last<00:01:56.310> season<00:01:56.700> how<00:01:56.820> did<00:01:56.850> that

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
mid-january last season how did that

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.620 
mid-january last season how did that
impact<00:01:57.270> your<00:01:57.780> game<00:01:57.990> on<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.530> ice<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.979> off<00:01:59.630> well

impact your game on the ice and off well
uh<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:01.320> guess<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:03.110> it<00:02:04.110> didn't<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.710> felt<00:02:05.100> like<00:02:05.159> it

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
uh I guess is it didn't I felt like it

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.310 
uh I guess is it didn't I felt like it
didn't<00:02:05.579> do<00:02:06.030> too<00:02:06.060> much<00:02:06.240> because<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.810> thought<00:02:07.020> it

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
didn't do too much because I thought it

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.940 
didn't do too much because I thought it
was<00:02:07.860> always<00:02:08.160> kind<00:02:08.399> of

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
was always kind of

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.800 
was always kind of
I<00:02:09.009> always<00:02:09.429> kind<00:02:09.819> of<00:02:09.849> had<00:02:09.970> that<00:02:10.030> role<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.660> whole

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
I always kind of had that role the whole

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.229 
I always kind of had that role the whole
year<00:02:11.050> because<00:02:11.349> we<00:02:11.620> had<00:02:12.370> a<00:02:12.400> like<00:02:12.970> I<00:02:13.120> was

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
year because we had a like I was

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:14.430 
year because we had a like I was
probably<00:02:13.510> one<00:02:13.660> of<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:13.780> oldest<00:02:14.019> guys<00:02:14.200> on<00:02:14.379> the

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
probably one of the oldest guys on the

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.670 
probably one of the oldest guys on the
team<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:14.890> we<00:02:15.580> had<00:02:15.700> a<00:02:15.730> lot<00:02:15.910> of<00:02:16.050> young<00:02:17.050> guys<00:02:17.080> but

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.339 
team and we had a lot of young guys but

playing<00:03:35.139> different<00:03:35.350> roles<00:03:35.530> so<00:03:35.950> everyone

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
playing different roles so everyone

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.780 
playing different roles so everyone
bought<00:03:37.000> into<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.329> system<00:03:37.780> and<00:03:37.900> we<00:03:38.139> definitely

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
bought into the system and we definitely

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.879 
bought into the system and we definitely
definitely<00:03:39.790> overcame<00:03:40.420> some<00:03:40.780> obstacles<00:03:41.319> and<00:03:41.620> I

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
definitely overcame some obstacles and I

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:43.890 
definitely overcame some obstacles and I
guess<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.459> US<00:03:42.760> team<00:03:42.940> was<00:03:43.150> really<00:03:43.420> strong<00:03:43.660> team

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
guess the US team was really strong team

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.360 
guess the US team was really strong team
and<00:03:43.959> we<00:03:44.230> beat<00:03:44.410> him<00:03:44.500> in<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:44.650> finals<00:03:45.010> which<00:03:45.160> was

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
and we beat him in the finals which was

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.120 
and we beat him in the finals which was
really<00:03:45.489> nice<00:03:45.700> so<00:03:46.269> this<00:03:47.139> camp<00:03:47.380> specifically

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
really nice so this camp specifically

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.520 
really nice so this camp specifically
with<00:03:48.310> so<00:03:48.489> many<00:03:48.609> guys<00:03:48.910> you<00:03:49.420> always<00:03:50.200> have<00:03:50.350> to

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
with so many guys you always have to

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.559 
with so many guys you always have to
prove<00:03:50.739> yourself<00:03:50.769> but<00:03:51.489> it's<00:03:51.760> double<00:03:52.269> the<00:03:52.299> size

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
prove yourself but it's double the size

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.680 
prove yourself but it's double the size
that<00:03:52.840> you<00:03:53.019> were<00:03:53.380> part<00:03:54.220> of<00:03:54.310> last<00:03:54.519> year<00:03:55.030> just

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
that you were part of last year just

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.550 
that you were part of last year just
going<00:03:55.870> to<00:03:55.930> make<00:03:56.019> things<00:03:56.079> a<00:03:56.349> little<00:03:56.410> more

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
going to make things a little more

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.800 
going to make things a little more
challenging<00:03:57.280> dealing<00:03:57.609> yeah<00:03:58.209> I<00:03:58.239> think<00:03:58.480> so<00:03:58.780> i

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
challenging dealing yeah I think so i

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.960 
challenging dealing yeah I think so i
think<00:03:58.930> it's<00:03:59.260> just<00:03:59.920> a<00:03:59.980> lot<00:04:00.130> a<00:04:00.160> lot<00:04:00.280> more<00:04:00.700> guys

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
think it's just a lot a lot more guys

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.839 
think it's just a lot a lot more guys
and<00:04:01.000> I<00:04:01.630> guess<00:04:02.500> I<00:04:02.799> think<00:04:03.040> this<00:04:03.160> year's<00:04:03.430> camp<00:04:03.670> is

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
and I guess I think this year's camp is

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:05.970 
and I guess I think this year's camp is
a<00:04:03.880> little<00:04:04.150> model<00:04:04.510> towards<00:04:04.870> more<00:04:05.200> learning<00:04:05.530> and

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
a little model towards more learning and

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.870 
a little model towards more learning and
kind<00:04:06.970> of<00:04:07.090> getting<00:04:07.810> to<00:04:08.049> know<00:04:08.459> skills<00:04:09.459> and

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
kind of getting to know skills and

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.759 
kind of getting to know skills and
different<00:04:10.150> different<00:04:10.690> types<00:04:11.019> of<00:04:11.109> skills<00:04:11.410> and

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
different different types of skills and

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.370 
different different types of skills and
instead<00:04:12.370> of<00:04:12.400> playing<00:04:12.819> were<00:04:13.030> opposed<00:04:14.019> the<00:04:14.169> last

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
instead of playing were opposed the last

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.900 
instead of playing were opposed the last
year<00:04:14.620> I<00:04:14.650> think<00:04:14.769> we<00:04:15.040> played<00:04:15.220> more<00:04:15.400> games<00:04:15.430> and

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
year I think we played more games and

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.050 
year I think we played more games and
stuff<00:04:16.090> so<00:04:16.750> I<00:04:16.780> think<00:04:16.959> it's<00:04:17.500> going<00:04:17.650> to<00:04:17.709> be<00:04:17.859> good

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
stuff so I think it's going to be good

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.069 
stuff so I think it's going to be good
it's<00:04:19.060> exciting<00:04:19.479> right<00:04:19.510> now

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
it's exciting right now

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.680 
it's exciting right now
said<00:04:20.229> they<00:04:20.349> get<00:04:20.470> it<00:04:20.560> gone
