00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
collecting rainwater and also about how

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.870 
collecting rainwater and also about how
we<00:00:18.240> collect<00:00:18.510> grey<00:00:18.930> water<00:00:19.199> we<00:00:20.010> have<00:00:20.220> 10<00:00:20.550> rain

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
we collect grey water we have 10 rain

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.640 
we collect grey water we have 10 rain
barrels<00:00:21.270> now<00:00:21.510> scattered<00:00:21.990> around<00:00:22.080> our<00:00:22.410> house

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
barrels now scattered around our house

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.759 
barrels now scattered around our house
this<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.029> first<00:00:24.390> one<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.720> we<00:00:25.230> installed

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
this is the first one that we installed

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.890 
this is the first one that we installed
and<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.640> want<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.970> just<00:00:27.060> start<00:00:27.359> out<00:00:27.539> by<00:00:27.689> telling

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
and I want to just start out by telling

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.109 
and I want to just start out by telling
you<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.109> little<00:00:28.199> bit<00:00:28.529> about<00:00:28.800> how<00:00:29.670> much<00:00:29.849> rain

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
you a little bit about how much rain

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.089 
you a little bit about how much rain
water<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.840> can<00:00:30.990> actually<00:00:31.289> collect<00:00:31.500> in<00:00:31.890> rain

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
water you can actually collect in rain

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.630 
water you can actually collect in rain
barrels<00:00:33.050> so<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.079> went<00:00:34.649> on<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.010> internet<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.430> I

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
barrels so I went on the internet and I

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.100 
barrels so I went on the internet and I
did<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> little<00:00:36.059> bit<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.329> research<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:37.079> can

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
did a little bit of research you can

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.000 
did a little bit of research you can
actually<00:00:37.680> type<00:00:38.309> in<00:00:38.809> rainfall<00:00:39.809> calculator<00:00:40.680> and

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
actually type in rainfall calculator and

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.799 
actually type in rainfall calculator and
you<00:00:41.129> can<00:00:41.309> find<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.790> little<00:00:41.940> thing<00:00:42.570> where<00:00:42.600> you

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
you can find a little thing where you

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.569 
you can find a little thing where you
can<00:00:42.960> calculate<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.469> rainfall<00:00:43.950> for<00:00:44.219> yourself

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
can calculate the rainfall for yourself

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.650 
can calculate the rainfall for yourself
but<00:00:45.360> what<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:45.899> found<00:00:46.289> was<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.770> if<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.660> have

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
but what I found was that if you have

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.619 
but what I found was that if you have
one<00:00:49.140> inch<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.559> rain<00:00:49.829> falling<00:00:50.399> on<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.360> one

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
one inch of rain falling on a one

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.510 
one inch of rain falling on a one
thousand<00:00:52.020> square<00:00:52.230> foot<00:00:52.410> roof<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:53.070> will<00:00:53.100> have

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
thousand square foot roof you will have

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.479 
thousand square foot roof you will have
600<00:00:54.180> gallons<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.690> water<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:56.039> don't<00:00:56.280> want<00:00:56.399> to

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
600 gallons of water so I don't want to

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.529 
600 gallons of water so I don't want to
really<00:00:56.640> bore<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.059> with<00:00:57.090> all<00:00:57.420> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
really bore you with all the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.920 
really bore you with all the
calculations<00:00:57.870> but<00:00:58.800> if<00:00:59.180> you<00:01:00.180> take<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.570> garage

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
calculations but if you take this garage

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.990 
calculations but if you take this garage
and<00:01:01.260> we're<00:01:01.440> only<00:01:01.590> collecting<00:01:02.280> water<00:01:02.430> from<00:01:02.850> one

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
and we're only collecting water from one

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.310 
and we're only collecting water from one
half<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.750> roof<00:01:05.540> the<00:01:06.540> footprint<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
half of the roof the footprint of the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.820 
half of the roof the footprint of the
garage<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.890> about<00:01:08.130> 200<00:01:08.610> square<00:01:08.760> feet<00:01:09.260> so<00:01:10.260> we're

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
garage is about 200 square feet so we're

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.859 
garage is about 200 square feet so we're
collecting<00:01:11.310> water<00:01:11.460> off<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.939> 100<00:01:12.630> square

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
collecting water off of a 100 square

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.649 
collecting water off of a 100 square
feet<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.590> means<00:01:13.799> after<00:01:14.400> an<00:01:15.000> integrating

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
feet and that means after an integrating

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.600 
feet and that means after an integrating
at<00:01:15.750> about<00:01:15.930> 60<00:01:16.380> gallons<00:01:16.950> which<00:01:17.130> would<00:01:17.430> more

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
at about 60 gallons which would more

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.929 
at about 60 gallons which would more
than<00:01:17.640> fill<00:01:18.000> up<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.420> barrel<00:01:19.280> our<00:01:20.280> house<00:01:20.580> has<00:01:20.909> a

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
than fill up this barrel our house has a

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.840 
than fill up this barrel our house has a
footprint<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.659> about<00:01:21.979> 1,700<00:01:22.979> square<00:01:23.159> feet<00:01:23.340> and

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
footprint of about 1,700 square feet and

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.149 
footprint of about 1,700 square feet and
so<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.240> calculation<00:01:24.900> on<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.290> one<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.770> that

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
so the calculation on that one is that

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.480 
so the calculation on that one is that
an<00:01:26.400> inch<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:27.000> rain<00:01:27.110> will<00:01:28.110> actually<00:01:28.470> give<00:01:28.650> us<00:01:28.829> a

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
an inch of rain will actually give us a

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.730 
an inch of rain will actually give us a
little<00:01:30.060> over<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.360> thousand<00:01:30.869> gallons<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.500> water

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
little over a thousand gallons of water

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.039 
little over a thousand gallons of water
so<00:01:32.340> quite<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> bit<00:01:32.880> if<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.659> look<00:01:33.930> at<00:01:34.020> the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
so quite a bit if you look at the

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.830 
so quite a bit if you look at the
statistics<00:01:34.170> on<00:01:34.860> rainfall<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.430> Portland<00:01:35.880> it

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
statistics on rainfall in Portland it

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.679 
statistics on rainfall in Portland it
rains<00:01:37.140> about<00:01:37.380> 43<00:01:38.009> inches<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.430> year<00:01:38.549> here<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.360> our

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
rains about 43 inches a year here so our

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.580 
rains about 43 inches a year here so our
roof<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.939> receiving<00:01:41.939> about<00:01:42.560> 44,000<00:01:43.560> gallons

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
roof is receiving about 44,000 gallons

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.270 
roof is receiving about 44,000 gallons
of<00:01:44.130> water<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.759> year<00:01:45.590> so<00:01:46.590> part<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.040> problem

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
of water a year so part of the problem

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.330 
of water a year so part of the problem
is<00:01:47.640> how<00:01:48.570> do<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.869> deal<00:01:49.470> with<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:50.159> water

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
is how do you deal with the water

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.340 
is how do you deal with the water
shortage<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.030> summertime<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.780> how<00:01:52.290> do

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
shortage in the summertime and how do

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.749 
shortage in the summertime and how do
you<00:01:52.500> deal<00:01:52.680> with<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:53.130> fact<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.369> there's<00:01:53.579> way

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
you deal with the fact that there's way

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.399 
you deal with the fact that there's way
too<00:01:53.790> much<00:01:54.180> water<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.960> winter<00:01:57.200> so<00:01:58.200> these

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
too much water in the winter so these

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.950 
too much water in the winter so these
are<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.649> next<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.460> we<00:01:59.640> installed<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.780> in

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
are the next to that we installed and in

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.679 
are the next to that we installed and in
this<00:02:01.079> case<00:02:01.380> we<00:02:01.920> had<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.640> be<00:02:03.090> concerned<00:02:03.540> about

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
this case we had to be concerned about

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.330 
this case we had to be concerned about
the<00:02:03.930> fact<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.200> we<00:02:04.380> share<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.770> driveway<00:02:05.159> with

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
the fact that we share the driveway with

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.370 
the fact that we share the driveway with
our<00:02:05.490> neighbor<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:06.119> we<00:02:06.360> are<00:02:06.509> on<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.689> slope<00:02:07.110> and

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
our neighbor and we are on a slope and

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.990 
our neighbor and we are on a slope and
so<00:02:07.979> any<00:02:08.369> time<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:09.030> rains

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
so any time it rains

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.480 
so any time it rains
very<00:02:10.360> much<00:02:10.570> the<00:02:11.350> water<00:02:11.590> is<00:02:11.860> actually<00:02:12.370> flowing

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
very much the water is actually flowing

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.970 
very much the water is actually flowing
down<00:02:12.880> our<00:02:13.060> property<00:02:13.510> onto<00:02:13.810> that<00:02:14.350> driveway<00:02:14.650> and

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
down our property onto that driveway and

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.830 
down our property onto that driveway and
straight<00:02:15.220> into<00:02:15.430> our<00:02:15.520> neighbors<00:02:15.790> basement<00:02:16.060> so

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
straight into our neighbors basement so

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.290 
straight into our neighbors basement so
in<00:02:16.960> this<00:02:17.080> case<00:02:17.350> we<00:02:17.860> we<00:02:18.430> did<00:02:18.610> disconnect<00:02:19.210> the

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
in this case we we did disconnect the

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.370 
in this case we we did disconnect the
downspout<00:02:19.780> but<00:02:20.820> we<00:02:21.820> still<00:02:22.390> have<00:02:22.660> this<00:02:23.020> rain

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
downspout but we still have this rain

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.680 
downspout but we still have this rain
barrel<00:02:23.770> hooked<00:02:24.070> up<00:02:24.250> so<00:02:24.280> that<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:25.150> overflow

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
barrel hooked up so that the overflow

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.130 
barrel hooked up so that the overflow
goes<00:02:26.170> actually<00:02:27.100> into<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.520> sewer<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:28.140> that's

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
goes actually into the sewer and that's

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.960 
goes actually into the sewer and that's
the<00:02:29.350> only<00:02:29.709> place<00:02:29.890> in<00:02:30.130> our<00:02:30.250> house<00:02:30.430> that<00:02:30.760> water

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
the only place in our house that water

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.420 
the only place in our house that water
does<00:02:31.300> go<00:02:31.480> into<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.750> sewer<00:02:31.990> we<00:02:32.530> do<00:02:32.709> have<00:02:32.860> also

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
does go into the sewer we do have also

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.520 
does go into the sewer we do have also
on<00:02:33.640> this<00:02:33.880> one<00:02:34.120> a<00:02:34.390> little<00:02:34.540> overflow<00:02:34.930> so<00:02:35.350> that

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
on this one a little overflow so that

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.949 
on this one a little overflow so that
water<00:02:35.709> is<00:02:35.980> going<00:02:36.610> into<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.030> yard<00:02:37.180> but<00:02:37.480> most<00:02:37.750> of

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
water is going into the yard but most of

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.650 
water is going into the yard but most of
it<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.380> overflow<00:02:38.770> goes<00:02:39.550> into<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:39.940> sewer<00:02:42.660> this

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
it the overflow goes into the sewer this

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.140 
it the overflow goes into the sewer this
is<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.140> southeast<00:02:44.739> corner<00:02:45.130> of<00:02:45.160> our<00:02:45.430> house<00:02:45.700> and

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
is the southeast corner of our house and

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.990 
is the southeast corner of our house and
we<00:02:46.930> used<00:02:47.080> to<00:02:47.260> have<00:02:47.440> a<00:02:47.770> downspout<00:02:48.220> right<00:02:48.550> here

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
we used to have a downspout right here

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.620 
we used to have a downspout right here
and<00:02:49.180> for<00:02:49.900> many<00:02:49.989> many<00:02:50.200> years<00:02:50.350> we<00:02:51.150> this<00:02:52.150> spout

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
and for many many years we this spout

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.270 
and for many many years we this spout
actually<00:02:53.080> just<00:02:53.290> came<00:02:53.620> down<00:02:53.650> out<00:02:54.010> at<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.250> end

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
actually just came down out at the end

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.100 
actually just came down out at the end
of<00:02:54.520> these<00:02:54.640> steps<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.450> we<00:02:55.690> always<00:02:55.959> had

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
of these steps and we always had

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.140 
of these steps and we always had
flooding<00:02:56.440> in<00:02:56.530> our<00:02:56.650> basement<00:02:56.860> so<00:02:57.700> one<00:02:57.970> nice

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
flooding in our basement so one nice

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.880 
flooding in our basement so one nice
thing<00:02:58.180> about<00:02:58.450> installing<00:02:59.050> these<00:02:59.380> rain

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
thing about installing these rain

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.010 
thing about installing these rain
barrels<00:03:00.280> is<00:03:00.489> we<00:03:00.670> switch<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.360> downspout<00:03:01.810> over

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
barrels is we switch the downspout over

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.770 
barrels is we switch the downspout over
here<00:03:02.320> we<00:03:02.950> have<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.640> three<00:03:03.880> barrels<00:03:04.270> connected

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
here we have the three barrels connected

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.720 
here we have the three barrels connected
to<00:03:04.900> each<00:03:05.020> other<00:03:05.170> and<00:03:05.440> we<00:03:05.590> also<00:03:05.860> have<00:03:06.040> overflows

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
to each other and we also have overflows

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.390 
to each other and we also have overflows
that<00:03:07.420> are<00:03:07.540> now<00:03:07.690> going<00:03:07.989> into<00:03:08.440> a<00:03:08.470> constructed

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
that are now going into a constructed

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.390 
that are now going into a constructed
dry<00:03:09.730> creek<00:03:10.030> bed<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:10.709> that's<00:03:11.709> doing<00:03:12.070> a<00:03:12.130> great

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
dry creek bed and that's doing a great

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.050 
dry creek bed and that's doing a great
job<00:03:12.430> of<00:03:13.000> handling<00:03:13.810> all<00:03:14.080> the<00:03:14.230> water<00:03:14.440> that<00:03:14.739> comes

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
job of handling all the water that comes

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:21.180 
job of handling all the water that comes
down<00:03:16.060> this<00:03:16.269> spout

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.619 

now<00:03:22.190> I'm<00:03:22.370> going<00:03:22.550> toward<00:03:22.970> the<00:03:23.180> front<00:03:23.360> of<00:03:23.510> our

every day these two we put in last year
and<00:03:38.650> this<00:03:39.650> one<00:03:39.920> I<00:03:40.160> actually<00:03:40.400> cut<00:03:41.120> that<00:03:41.330> down

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.800 
installments in our rain barrel it's
probably<00:03:49.730> the<00:03:49.849> last<00:03:50.030> that<00:03:50.360> we're<00:03:50.480> going<00:03:50.629> to<00:03:50.720> be

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
probably the last that we're going to be

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.600 
probably the last that we're going to be
putting<00:03:51.080> in<00:03:51.470> and<00:03:51.830> these<00:03:52.040> are<00:03:52.099> the<00:03:52.430> really

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
fancy ones we have most of them are rain

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.770 
fancy ones we have most of them are rain

I'm just in the very beginning stages of

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.460

creating<00:04:16.760> a<00:04:16.820> rain<00:04:17.000> garden<00:04:17.180> in<00:04:17.419> the<00:04:17.479> front<00:04:17.810> what

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
creating a rain garden in the front what

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.580 
creating a rain garden in the front what
I<00:04:18.500> did<00:04:18.769> here<00:04:19.010> was<00:04:19.040> just<00:04:19.720> to<00:04:20.720> dig<00:04:20.959> out<00:04:21.109> the<00:04:21.320> path

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
I did here was just to dig out the path

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.830 
I did here was just to dig out the path
and<00:04:22.040> take<00:04:22.550> all<00:04:22.729> the<00:04:22.910> grass<00:04:23.120> and<00:04:23.389> pile<00:04:23.600> it<00:04:23.630> up

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
and take all the grass and pile it up

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.260 
and take all the grass and pile it up
side<00:04:24.320> down<00:04:24.350> on<00:04:24.979> top<00:04:25.190> of<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:25.460> other<00:04:25.550> graphs<00:04:25.910> and

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
side down on top of the other graphs and

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.200 
side down on top of the other graphs and
then<00:04:26.570> cover<00:04:27.380> it<00:04:27.500> with<00:04:27.760> newspaper<00:04:28.760> and<00:04:29.000> leaves

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
then cover it with newspaper and leaves

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.560 
then cover it with newspaper and leaves
and<00:04:30.370> so<00:04:31.370> it'll<00:04:31.610> be<00:04:31.639> a<00:04:31.729> while<00:04:31.940> before<00:04:32.180> this

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
and so it'll be a while before this

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.409 
and so it'll be a while before this
looks<00:04:33.169> the<00:04:34.039> way<00:04:34.130> I'd<00:04:34.250> like<00:04:34.490> to<00:04:34.700> have<00:04:35.090> it<00:04:35.240> look

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
looks the way I'd like to have it look
