00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
different well you know I think what we

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.869 
different well you know I think what we
did<00:00:56.660> is<00:00:56.809> we<00:00:56.840> focused<00:00:57.350> on<00:00:57.530> core<00:00:58.040> gameplay<00:00:58.309> first

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
did is we focused on core gameplay first

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.510 
did is we focused on core gameplay first
right<00:00:59.270> it's<00:00:59.480> about<00:00:59.809> making<00:01:00.620> a<00:01:00.890> great<00:01:01.129> shooter

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
right it's about making a great shooter

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.420 
right it's about making a great shooter
game<00:01:01.699> and<00:01:01.940> to<00:01:02.870> that<00:01:03.110> we<00:01:03.350> add<00:01:03.379> transformers<00:01:04.250> not

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
game and to that we add transformers not

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.590 
game and to that we add transformers not
the<00:01:04.610> other<00:01:04.760> way<00:01:04.910> around<00:01:04.940> which<00:01:05.330> is<00:01:05.449> I<00:01:05.540> think

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
the other way around which is I think

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.240 
the other way around which is I think
you<00:01:05.930> know<00:01:06.020> kind<00:01:06.229> of<00:01:06.260> the<00:01:06.350> license<00:01:06.740> trap<00:01:07.040> we've

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
you know kind of the license trap we've

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.250 
you know kind of the license trap we've
kind<00:01:07.430> of<00:01:07.460> jams<00:01:07.790> some<00:01:08.390> gameplay<00:01:08.810> into<00:01:09.080> your

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.630 
and so that you know started us running
we<00:02:24.260> were<00:02:24.320> able<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.530> run<00:02:24.799> from<00:02:25.070> the<00:02:25.220> first<00:02:25.400> day

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
we were able to run from the first day

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.640 
we were able to run from the first day
as<00:02:26.030> we<00:02:26.209> already<00:02:26.390> knew<00:02:26.630> how<00:02:26.660> to<00:02:26.840> use<00:02:26.989> the<00:02:27.140> engine

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
as we already knew how to use the engine

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.949 
as we already knew how to use the engine
through<00:02:27.980> its<00:02:28.099> paces<00:02:28.689> we<00:02:29.689> had<00:02:29.840> done

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
through its paces we had done

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.140 
through its paces we had done
multiplayer<00:02:30.560> on<00:02:30.860> dark<00:02:31.310> watch<00:02:31.459> before<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:32.060> so

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
multiplayer on dark watch before and so

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.809 
multiplayer on dark watch before and so
we<00:02:32.269> knew<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.420> bit<00:02:32.659> about<00:02:32.720> that<00:02:33.349> and<00:02:33.739> then<00:02:34.459> you

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
we knew a bit about that and then you

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.059 
we knew a bit about that and then you
know<00:02:34.939> both<00:02:35.780> of<00:02:35.810> those<00:02:36.110> games<00:02:36.349> had<00:02:36.709> I<00:02:36.980> think

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
know both of those games had I think

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.210 
know both of those games had I think
they<00:02:37.459> did<00:02:37.909> hit<00:02:38.209> some<00:02:38.590> experiential<00:02:39.590> moments

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
they did hit some experiential moments

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.890 
they did hit some experiential moments
of<00:02:40.310> moments<00:02:40.670> we<00:02:40.760> really<00:02:41.030> felt<00:02:41.360> like<00:02:41.450> you<00:02:41.599> were

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
of moments we really felt like you were

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.849 
of moments we really felt like you were
that<00:02:42.170> character<00:02:42.799> and<00:02:42.980> that<00:02:43.040> kind<00:02:43.819> of<00:02:43.909> design

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
that character and that kind of design

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.960 
that character and that kind of design
sensibility<00:02:45.859> maybe<00:02:46.250> is<00:02:46.400> best<00:02:46.609> way<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.760> put<00:02:46.909> it

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
sensibility maybe is best way to put it

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.080 
sensibility maybe is best way to put it
