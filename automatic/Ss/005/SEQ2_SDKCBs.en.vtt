00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:04.639
 all 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.130
 for name and jean-michel riparian and 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.110
 welcome to kraft kitchens could 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.980
 look awesome to serve a roast 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.930
 beef rib 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.180
 today I show how with a 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.950
 roast rib of beef with herbs and 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.570
 first of all what does it do 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.759
 the taste that this famous piece of 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.500
 meat is the great muscular being 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.880
 who will water the meat that sees there a 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.500
 very juicy during cooking 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.060
 then the others next to you 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.279
 can ask your butcher already 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.770
 taken or we'll remove the 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.840
 cut out at the end c hall gave 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.310
 a lot a lot of flavor to your 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.070
 piece of meat by action so me 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.210
 personally I prefer to keep them 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:47.680
 now I think of the sink or wash 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:49.450
 hands so next step I close 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.310
 marine and my piece becomes so I'm going 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.220
 use half a cup of vinegar and 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:58.080
 creamy Caesar and I'm going to beat yellow 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.080
 and my piece of meat on all sides 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.710
 The advantage with this tic dressing 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.780
 your tool will have a rich saverdun 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.159
 now I'm going to put on a fridge 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.159
 to marinate for an hour 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.040
 my life was well marinated and I 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.420
 transferred to a roaster six years 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.100
 did not have one at home anymore fans in 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.830
 any baking dish 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:22.620
 13 by nine lots I'm going to place at 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.620
 oven at 3 125 degrees for 1h45 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.600
 during that time I will prepare the 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.780
 sauce that will serve as crusts cushioned 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:36.210
 then in a bowl I will mix 1/4 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.210
 cup of vinegar and creamy Caesar 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.350
 I add rosemary thyme 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.560
 fresh chopped with garlic and I mix 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.240
 of everything I'm going to mix to get 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.229
 a beautiful consistency we could have 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.479
 do work with dried herbs 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:57.130
 in this case using three times 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:59.290
 less than now baste my 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.590
 meat with the preparation I made 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.590
 halak 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.060
 seven rescuers will allow me 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.340
 to have a nice crispy crust 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.940
 and it will bring a lot of flavor to 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.830
 montredon 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.200
 now i'm going to relocate will be baked 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.390
 for 30 to 40 minutes until a 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.920
 internal temperature of 150 degrees 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.420
 fahrenheit and for its value as needed 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.420
 to use your meat thermometer 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.930
 I left my piece of meat to rest 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.850
 about fifteen minutes that allowed him 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.890
 to finish leather is to achieve a 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.989
 internal temperature of 160 degrees 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.870
 fahrenheit it also allowed the meat 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.300
 to relax and within 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.730
 divide in the same room 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.440
 so now we are ready or the 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.910
 cutting 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.830
 then here we have the increases are 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.480
 just sit there I'm going to use a 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.430
 pair of pliers rather than a 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.860
 meat fork to avoid doing 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.870
 get out the blood so see you here we 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.000
 see the muscle that breaks we'll do them 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.370
 unissions with the knife and we're going 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.989
 pass along the waters to reach 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.500
 the bot like this one so I have the room 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.590
 of meat 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.510
 now at the water level 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.769
 we can recover them because the 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.940
 ratings are not fast in the presentation 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.810
 and are very good too 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:28.660
 then we have one step is the knife the 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:30.940
 along the waters like that 7 6 and then we 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.580
 will come to cut right in the center of our 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.260
 two ribs 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.570
 I will now be the waters of 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.030
 side like this and I'll get you to 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.620
 slice my piece of meat for that I 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.209
 am going to use a knife and slimming 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.739
 obviously well honed it's very 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.700
 important 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:51.180
 so I'm going to grab my piece of meat 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.180
 and I will make thin slices 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:59.800
