00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.830
 I was at a friend's house or I had 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.140
 I went to the market when I got back 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.470
 they did not let in they closed 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.570
 door speak or does not make my eyes 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.900
 I closed my eyes, he's about to write. 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.150
 mep on my forehead and began to see the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.789
 scene one still suffers with the glaring 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.850
 when you should study time 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.460
 all the way up there all day long there 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.250
 polyhedron but one thing that was very 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.829
 It was important to know how to relax 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.199
 a little sometimes the afternoon is going to go 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.090
 have juice with your friends or eat 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:47.890
 something late because you need 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.570
 moments of relaxation in the middle of 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.510
 studies and can not just study 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.210
 you become crazy is always important 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.070
 family support friends 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.539
 they are always there talking, it is not going away 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.309
 spend you will be staying here in sÃ£o paulo 

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:04.960
 You are going to leave here and go hard 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.030
 friends of the class I think are the most 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.130
 fundamental because they are living the 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.259
 same thing you're hard enough you 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.990
 Are you there every day for the 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:17.049
 study to stay the full time arrives at 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.270
 end of the year and only takes pump that does not 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:22.479
 You know where you are and it's on a list. 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.630
 of waiting there are 20 people away and 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:27.430
 stopping 10 if you frustrate you do not know the 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.399
 What to do but you come so close that 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.229
 You do not want to stop school, do not I? 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.630
 to continue another year let's go there 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.020
 get and get one hour you 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.090
 I get the simulations I found very good. 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.360
 You make yourself stay in this routine. 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.369
 always of study and concealed because 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.170
 you do he knows your time you have 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.210
 notion of what you can do better in 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.460
 middle of the test I know the nervous goes 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.420
 be an absurd differential on the 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.810
 proof 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.490
 I had proof of the polyhedron in three hours 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.250
 I left a quiet time and I did not eat 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.740
 nothing on test day do not carry bags 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.439
 of huge food and a combined 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.659
 first I will try there have had 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.910
 wonderful teachers in you 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.400
 get there wanting to cry and he does not think 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.300
 now come here you need he was 1 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.740
 to 1 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:20.860
 Of course I recommend it was very good support 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.170
 is total and claw strength and follow your dream 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.960
 why stop halfway 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.790
 while you can still follow is a 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.400
 thing I recommend you have to follow 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.950
 behind goes to the end goes to where you 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.950
 want to arrive and wishes is the limit
