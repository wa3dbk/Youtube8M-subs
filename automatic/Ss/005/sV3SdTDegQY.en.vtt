00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 Of course I'm not a net weather 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.350
 I really wanted to do something 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.900
 what everyone makes me and I wanted 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.400
 Attention to math and physics 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.019
 I know but I always like 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.219
 made 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.470
 yes and then I'm by a stupid 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.060
 come by chance on meteorology and 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.529
 I just started that on the 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.330
 uni bonn has to study me 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.740
 actually thrown himself into the water 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.910
 did not really know what was on me 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.930
 but in 2008 I will have mine 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.490
 completed 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.369
 then I started on the radio at 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.050
 1live as a weather lady and shortly afterwards 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.340
 I already landed at meteomedia and 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.920
 was there then the last six years 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.690
 media meteorologist and weather moderator 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.149
 and especially in the radio 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.180
 I am a mountain child, to be more precise 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:48.309
 a true Wuppertal child so 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.860
 come to the world with the umbrella 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.949
 As a kid, I really was really scared 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.539
 before thunderstorm so it was really only 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.070
 under the pillow but the blanket over it 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:59.240
 and hope that it will be fast 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.700
 passes 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.980
 I always say I'm not weather 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.140
 but stupid as soon as the outside 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.870
 post go be it with rain with wind 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.520
 I speak with thunderstorms immediately 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.050
 windows maybe even out or 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.740
 Let's look at the radar image 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:18.200
 Of course I 'm approaching a weather 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.020
 if i can work anything possible 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.390
 be no be current no 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.210
 snow can be a lot of rain 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.250
 thunderstorms are also all heat yet 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.310
 exciting is so what happens so please 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.100
 no three weeks power up nothing 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.750
 changes or such a fork position in the fall 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.899
 Never talk like that is not so 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.899
 exciting 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.860
 I love other people from the weather 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.990
 to explain why why 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.420
 why is that really so and 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.550
 maybe a little something from 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.060
 to give up my enthusiasm 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.740
 since the end of 2014 i live now in the usa 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.840
 peep me the weather a little bit 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.530
 of course, and of course, too 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.530
 tell them
