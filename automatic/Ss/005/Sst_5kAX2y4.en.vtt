00:03:17.305 --> 00:03:34.612
Glitch cities have no rules, any tile can appear anywhere on the map. Because of that, glitch cities make it possible to catch Pokemon with index numbers greater than 199, without trading/hacking/Johto guard glitching.

00:04:25.512 --> 00:04:38.800
And I got my Charizard 'M. It works perfectly, and allows me to make dem hybrids.

00:04:40.735 --> 00:04:41.946
Another glitch city example.

00:04:41.946 --> 00:04:48.685

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:54.000
Another glitch city example.

00:05:16.123 --> 00:05:33.430
An that's our Pokemon. It doesn't even have a pronounceable name ;p

00:05:37.605 --> 00:05:46.145
And yeah, it also knows Super Glitch, and I didn't know about that. Crash, game over.
