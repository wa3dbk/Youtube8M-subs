00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.310
 during the panel in gel or in pax prime 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.680
 Industries 343 revealed new 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.900
 force characteristics and fixes that 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.210
 will be presented at the o2 anniversary 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.969
 including more than 10 new elements of 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.190
 force fixed a couple of things there 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.110
 new force maps and apparently the 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.140
 halo zoom reach is back 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.290
 then for new generation or a 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.300
 simple copy of a force or previous 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:31.110
 huizache 09 and I bring you another video in 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.179
 hd and without anything else to say let's start the 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.910
 o2 anniversary will have three maps 

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:37.920
 specifically made to force though 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.079
 good will be empty spaces for 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.050
 our creations in force calls 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.570
 skybox that will allow players 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.909
 create maps from scratch using only 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.620
 pieces of forge this has been a great 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.989
 demand of the players from forcing 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.429
 was revealed for halo 3 as well as 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.100
 some arrangements for some of the 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:58.559
 halo problems 4 this kind of maps 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.120
 it's like the halo map 3 sandbox 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.789
 what could I say to a teleporter 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.010
 and you're off the map in a space of 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.870
 force like this would more or less 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.700
 of maps with beautiful backgrounds 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.500
 The new force also includes the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.630
 ability to zoom in as 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.720
 monitor and bring back the precision 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.640
 of editing that halo reach introduced 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.430
 343 industries I also fix the option 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.680
 of magnetism and reorganized the menu 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.570
 of all the objects that way the 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.510
 player can look for any weight of 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.250
 subtle and effective way as you can see 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.500
 in this image force gift 2 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.110
 anniversary is very similar to the forge mode 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.390
 of halo 4 a wide range of objects 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.940
 will be available including structures 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.470
 natural and terrain options this 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.270
 also it makes a great demand for 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.700
 Force mode for a long time 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.560
 they also got rid of the budget 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.750
 in fort and there is only one limit of objects 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.820
 within the map this could have been 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.520
 replaced by the performance meter 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.230
 mentioned in a previous image the 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.300
 performance meter as seen in 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.550
 this image will allow the players of 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.470
 see that your map will also be made and 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.530
 if you can play in a fluid way or 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.420
 not also the new elements includes 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.170
 the option to reflect objects on one side 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.260
 to another connect objects to the ground 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.450
 objects on the floor warehouse options 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.720
 of tools cleaner structures 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.880
 or smooth commands for meter objects 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.310
 performance object count instead of 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.440
 budget and sports maps 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.450
 the simplest the most interesting since 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.060
 my point of view is the new option of 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.560
 put commands to certain objects and opined 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.810
 that would be something similar to objects 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.480
 dynamics in the remastered maps 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.180
 as the shield of ascension the water in 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.730
 sanctuary or ice in enclosure though 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.319
 honestly I'm not sure maybe it's 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.569
 a command line to move objects 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.940
 during the game another interesting thing 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.860
 from my point of view it is the warehouse 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.810
 for the tool options that 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.380
 you use, I speculate that it would be something like 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.060
 a warehouse of pieces that have a map 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.650
 you can move or copy them to other maps 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.150
 force you have done 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.069
 honestly I'm not sure has not 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.510
 showed nothing and even though a 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.209
 little solution before there is no 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.860
 shown nothing about it is interesting 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.720
 this new list of new items and 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.180
 forceful characteristics and the two 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.890
 anniversary will have from my point of 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.630
 view this is because if it is force of 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.440
 next generation what do you think of the 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.910
 respect 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.680
 because I think I will become one of 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.020
 the people that creates pure map by itself 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.810
 you like these new elements or not 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.540
 because in the end I hope you like this 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.250
 video if you liked it please give it a like and 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.890
 remember to subscribe if you have not done 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:34.150
 comment on this what do you think about this 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:37.420
 new good forum I am at 709 and see you 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.420
 black berguÃ©s
