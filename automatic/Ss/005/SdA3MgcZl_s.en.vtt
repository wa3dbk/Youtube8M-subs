00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.400
 to make this very fine we are going to 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.789
 need colored polymer asia 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.910
 white another dark color in this case a 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.980
 brown and an intermediate color the color 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.489
 intermediate we can get it by mixing 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.519
 the white one third of the white's and 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:43.150
 one third of the dark color we mix 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:46.210
 and we get or the intermediate color in 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.150
 this case I'm going to use brown white and 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.450
 beige 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:55.910
 we started making a thick cylinder 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.910
 with each of the clay colors 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:05.850
 It has to be of a thickness that fits us 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.850
 in the extruder 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:22.320
 we introduce the cylinder of each color 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.320
 in the extruder 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.090
 and we are going to use the square disk 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.020
 we do the same with each of the 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.020
 three colors 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.180
 we will obtain these three square strips 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.060
 of the same size and we are going to have to 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.390
 cut each one into eight equal parts 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:59.049
 for this I for example I cut the part 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.630
 white in two halves and then with that 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:04.090
 measure cut the other colors 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.219
 I fold it again in half and it's already taken 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.789
 the measure to cut the other two 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:10.090
 colors 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.850
 in this way we will get eight parts 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.240
 of each colour 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.790
 we start by putting the squares 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.870
 whites interspersed with squares of 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.100
 intermediate color and other strip 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.060
 interspersing the dark color with the 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.060
 intermediate color 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.070
 and we are going to place a strip on top of the 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.070
 other 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.370
 trying to make the colors do not match 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.549
 that is to say that the beige color does not remain 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.349
 on top of another beige square 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:52.200
 we make another strip interspersed 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:56.180
 white and beige squares and we put it 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.180
 on top of the previous 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:04.000
 and finally 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:07.760
 another one of brown and beige and we return it to 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.510
 put on top of the previous 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.310
 in this way we will have a square of 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.549
 4 squares on each side 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.069
 let's press our donkey well 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.770
 so that the different 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.930
 squares 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.740
 and at the same time that we are going to press 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:31.620
 stretching a bit to lengthen the size 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.620
 if necessary we pass the roller 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:58.370
 we cut in half 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:02.800
 and we put one of the squares next 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.800
 from the other one, make sure the drawing fits 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:10.570
 we cut again in half and 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:14.920
 we put back next to each other 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.920
 following the same color scheme 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:26.920
 and now we can only reduce until 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.920
 get our boring 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.150
 and this is a necklace that I've made 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:37.370
 using the burrin I hope you have 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.370
 liked and see you in the next video
