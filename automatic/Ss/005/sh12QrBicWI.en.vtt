stated<00:02:26.780> by<00:02:26.900> sites<00:02:27.200> Chelsea's<00:02:27.800> it's<00:02:28.490> a<00:02:28.670> very

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
stated by sites Chelsea's it's a very

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.480 
stated by sites Chelsea's it's a very
nice<00:02:29.360> stadium<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:30.260> say<00:02:30.410> I<00:02:30.440> think<00:02:30.770> from<00:02:31.280> the

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
nice stadium to say I think from the

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.550 
nice stadium to say I think from the
aesthetic<00:02:32.030> looks<00:02:32.570> I<00:02:32.810> think<00:02:32.840> about<00:02:33.200> that<00:02:33.380> build

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
aesthetic looks I think about that build

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.870 
aesthetic looks I think about that build
the<00:02:33.710> Emirates<00:02:34.040> cuz<00:02:34.190> it<00:02:34.310> looks<00:02:34.340> better<00:02:34.640> but

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
the Emirates cuz it looks better but

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.000 
the Emirates cuz it looks better but
then<00:02:35.060> again<00:02:35.150> I<00:02:35.330> can't<00:02:35.570> say<00:02:35.750> that<00:02:35.960> because<00:02:36.110> you

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
then again I can't say that because you

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.180 
then again I can't say that because you
know<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:38.260> just<00:02:39.260> can't<00:02:40.150> disrespect<00:02:41.260> who<00:02:42.260> we<00:02:43.040> go
