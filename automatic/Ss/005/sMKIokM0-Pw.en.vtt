focus punch yeah I don't know trailers

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.580 
focus punch yeah I don't know trailers
with<00:02:55.670> focus<00:02:56.030> bundchen<00:02:56.450> like<00:02:56.810> Indian<00:02:57.260> traders

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
with focus bundchen like Indian traders

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.590 
with focus bundchen like Indian traders
to<00:02:57.680> focus<00:02:58.010> punch<00:02:58.220> they<00:02:58.760> just<00:02:58.970> love<00:02:59.180> focus

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
to focus punch they just love focus

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.150 
to focus punch they just love focus
punching<00:02:59.959> everything<00:03:00.560> like<00:03:00.739> they<00:03:00.860> focus

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
punching everything like they focus

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.710 
punching everything like they focus
punch<00:03:01.310> on<00:03:01.430> every<00:03:01.640> turn<00:03:01.790> now<00:03:01.970> they<00:03:02.569> don't

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
punch on every turn now they don't

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.210 
punch on every turn now they don't
predict<00:03:02.959> anything<00:03:03.200> they<00:03:03.620> weren't<00:03:03.950> you<00:03:04.040> dumb

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
predict anything they weren't you dumb

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.699 
predict anything they weren't you dumb
because<00:03:04.400> focus<00:03:04.819> much<00:03:05.230> arguably<00:03:06.230> out<00:03:06.410> of<00:03:06.530> any

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
because focus much arguably out of any

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.920 
because focus much arguably out of any
move<00:03:06.950> takes<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.489> most<00:03:07.610> prediction<00:03:08.239> I<00:03:08.420> guess

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
move takes the most prediction I guess

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.780 
move takes the most prediction I guess
let's<00:03:09.050> keep<00:03:09.319> it<00:03:09.470> with<00:03:09.560> me<00:03:10.930> so<00:03:11.930> an<00:03:12.519> in-game<00:03:13.519> they

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
let's keep it with me so an in-game they

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.420 
let's keep it with me so an in-game they
don't<00:03:13.970> get<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.239> traders<00:03:14.600> enough<00:03:14.930> from<00:03:15.140> AI<00:03:15.920> as

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
don't get the traders enough from AI as

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.250 
don't get the traders enough from AI as
they<00:03:16.610> call<00:03:16.820> it<00:03:16.850> the<00:03:17.060> automatic<00:03:17.570> intelligence

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
they call it the automatic intelligence

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.580 
they call it the automatic intelligence
to<00:03:18.560> really<00:03:18.829> work<00:03:19.310> that<00:03:19.519> focus<00:03:19.940> punched<00:03:20.299> by

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
efficient thing yeah so that thing is

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.120 
efficient thing yeah so that thing is
