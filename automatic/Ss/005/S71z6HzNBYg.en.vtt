00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.670

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.600

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.209
 society that wants to be next 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.060
 season contesting European competition 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:20.010
 Valladolid fighting to stay in 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.840
 the elite of Spanish football to stay 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.420
 in the first division this is the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.820
 first play of the match the appearance 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.990
 on the right side and the final shot 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.960
 of seferovic that collided with jaime 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.219
 occupying again the goal of the real 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.929
 Valladolid for the second match 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.170
 consecutive headline leaving in the 

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:42.149
 bench to mariño very clear that first 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.829
 action that had seferovic in the second 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.979
 the goal of the real society came the goal 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.170
 this authentic goal of Carlos sailing in 

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:52.229
 the minute 23 receiving a pass yet 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.269
 Rubén pardo was pointing at them 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:56.129
 candle and had reasons to do it because 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.499
 see what ball he put on 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.120
 midfielder txuri urdin after that 

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:04.440
 yes the Mexican marvel defined 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.800
 Carlos sailing above Jaime 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:11.130
 more chances for the home team 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.020
 direct center of sergio channels that 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.510
 missing in which surprised everyone 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.550
 I was waiting for the ball to the area but 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.940
 He saw that he was a little bit ahead 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.100
 Jaime rectified his position well the former 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.420
 goalkeeper of the elche ended up saving the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.030
 that could have been the second goal of the 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.340
 meeting wanted to replicate the real 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.680
 Valladolid in this action that starts 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.780
 rukavina ends up falling to javi guerra 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.980
 but his shot goes high by 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.230
 above the goal of claudio bravo 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.720
 the top scorer of Valladolid with 13 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.360
 targets this season could not score in 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.850
 anoeta although they were not for in the 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.070
 clearer occasions of the set of 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.960
 puce these would arrive in the second 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.390
 part and sign them to oscar we'll see 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.790
 then there goes the shot from outside the 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.200
 area of ​​sergio channels goes away 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.190
 deviated and without any danger 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.250
 for jaime 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.340
 the repetition is seen how the ball 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.950
 is leaving the target just going 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.620
 out more chances in the first half 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.630
 more chances for the local team 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.470
 griezmann releasing the for carlos vela 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.630
 but there the duel is won by that hand 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.480
 by hand with the Mexican he finishes it 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.220
 wearing the goalkeeper of the real 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.740
 Valladolid could score his second goal in 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.370
 the party the Mexican carlos watches 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.810
 Griezmann's pass was very good but 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.750
 did not succeed to overcome the keeper 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.000
 visitor images already of the second 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.740
 half but more images of attacks from the 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.930
 real society that of course was the 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.150
 team that insisted most to achieve that 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.860
 second goal seferovic's shot 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.860
 saved jaime 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.830
 another more merit intervention 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.480
 of the Real Valladolid goalkeeper in this 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.659
 counterattack enjoyed its best 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.439
 opportunity the visitor set the 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:03.959
 larsson ball for oscar and oscar no 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:05.459
 manages to overcome claudio bravo just 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.140
 the Chilean had work during all the 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.849
 party but of course this 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.700
 counterattack of equipment manual 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:15.210
 juan ignacio martínez ay yes intervened 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.880
 wonder the house keeper 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.100
 more chances for the real Valladolid and 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.560
 again look with that shot from the 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.410
 penalty point that went back to march 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.700
 high we see in the repetition as the 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.530
 ball that we find to give it in 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.510
 first palms but leaves 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.129
 deflected the shot of víctor pérez 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.709
 that escapes to the right of the 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:38.599
 Claudio Bravo's goal, of course, 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.510
 Real Valladolid played more in the second 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:43.610
 half in the first part just 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.409
 intervened in the offensive facet and this 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.180
 it was the absurd play of the meeting that 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:50.299
 pass back of josé ángel grabs the ball 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.590
 claudio bravo did not understand both 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:54.170
 football players 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.760
 a misunderstanding that ended with a free 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.760
 indirect within the area in the minute 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:01.849
 91 are images of the time of addition and 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.079
 there he could mark the real Valladolid but 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:05.379
 the ball went bounced and went to 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:05.379
 corner 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.939
 at the end of the game he took the three 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.069
 points the real partnership with that goal in 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:14.159
 the 23rd minute is still struggling to be in 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:14.159
 Europe
