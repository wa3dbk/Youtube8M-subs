frost<00:00:22.460> deadlines<00:00:22.880> on<00:00:23.150> the<00:00:24.050> top-tier<00:00:24.410> talent<00:00:24.650> I

frost deadlines on the top-tier talent I

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.210 
frost deadlines on the top-tier talent I
took<00:00:25.189> unholy<00:00:25.880> blight<00:00:26.860> just<00:00:27.860> for<00:00:28.010> the<00:00:28.100> reason

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
took unholy blight just for the reason

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.920 
took unholy blight just for the reason
that<00:00:28.460> sometimes<00:00:28.970> it's<00:00:29.150> easier<00:00:29.449> for<00:00:29.480> me<00:00:29.660> just

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
that sometimes it's easier for me just

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.760 
that sometimes it's easier for me just
to<00:00:29.990> pop<00:00:30.199> this<00:00:30.440> and<00:00:30.770> get<00:00:31.400> my<00:00:31.550> diseases<00:00:32.119> back<00:00:32.300> on

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
to pop this and get my diseases back on

to pop this and get my diseases back on
then<00:00:33.770> on<00:00:34.160> the<00:00:34.220> second<00:00:35.120> tier<00:00:35.210> talat<00:00:35.660> I<00:00:35.840> took

Lich<00:00:36.710> born<00:00:37.040> and<00:00:37.309> for<00:00:37.340> me<00:00:37.790> I<00:00:38.030> think<00:00:38.239> which<00:00:38.629> board

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
Lich born and for me I think which board

Lich born and for me I think which board
is<00:00:39.080> over<00:00:39.350> all<00:00:39.470> the<00:00:39.620> best<00:00:39.860> talent<00:00:40.129> in<00:00:40.989> the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
second tier talent tree because M amz is

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.079 
second tier talent tree because M amz is
situational<00:00:48.290> and<00:00:48.530> it<00:00:49.129> to<00:00:49.400> me<00:00:49.519> it's<00:00:49.729> not<00:00:49.820> very

situational and it to me it's not very

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:51.670 
situational and it to me it's not very
good<00:00:50.330> anymore<00:00:50.510> since<00:00:50.870> it<00:00:50.989> goes<00:00:51.080> down<00:00:51.320> after

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
good anymore since it goes down after

paladin tattoos or even in three is fun

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.530

running with a warrior that's running

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.880 
running with a warrior that's running
with<00:01:08.690> control<00:01:09.049> spec<00:01:09.290> and<00:01:10.150> on<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:12.350> fourth<00:01:12.650> tier

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.670 
with control spec and on the fourth tier
talent<00:01:13.369> I<00:01:13.549> took<00:01:13.970> that<00:01:14.210> fact<00:01:14.659> just<00:01:15.439> because

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
talent I took that fact just because

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.270 
talent I took that fact just because
where<00:01:15.890> I'm<00:01:15.979> frost<00:01:16.750> conversion<00:01:17.750> it<00:01:18.189> wastes<00:01:19.189> my

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
where I'm frost conversion it wastes my

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.069 
where I'm frost conversion it wastes my
routing<00:01:19.609> power<00:01:19.759> so<00:01:20.090> it's<00:01:20.390> less<00:01:20.600> frost<00:01:20.869> right

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079 
routing power so it's less frost right

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:23.529 
routing power so it's less frost right
so<00:01:21.289> less<00:01:21.439> damage<00:01:21.859> and<00:01:22.130> death<00:01:22.609> pact<00:01:22.850> me<00:01:23.030> I<00:01:23.180> think

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
so less damage and death pact me I think

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.569 
so less damage and death pact me I think
this<00:01:23.840> patch<00:01:24.079> is<00:01:24.109> a<00:01:24.320> little<00:01:24.590> bit<00:01:24.710> better<00:01:24.890> than

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:25.579 
this patch is a little bit better than

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:27.609 
this patch is a little bit better than
conversion<00:01:26.210> I<00:01:26.420> think<00:01:26.689> it<00:01:26.780> pulls<00:01:26.960> ahead<00:01:27.079> just<00:01:27.530> a

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
conversion I think it pulls ahead just a

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.029 
conversion I think it pulls ahead just a
little<00:01:27.649> bit<00:01:27.979> and<00:01:28.899> on<00:01:29.899> the<00:01:30.170> fifth<00:01:30.320> tier<00:01:30.590> talent

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
little bit and on the fifth tier talent

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:36.039 
little bit and on the fifth tier talent
I<00:01:31.219> took<00:01:31.929> runic<00:01:32.929> empowerment<00:01:33.759> now<00:01:34.869> the<00:01:35.869> reason

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
I took runic empowerment now the reason

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.050 
I took runic empowerment now the reason
why<00:01:36.289> I<00:01:36.320> took<00:01:36.469> this<00:01:36.799> is<00:01:37.070> it's<00:01:37.520> one<00:01:37.640> less<00:01:37.850> thing

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
why I took this is it's one less thing

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.989 
why I took this is it's one less thing

that<00:02:47.790> but<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.910> next<00:02:49.150> clip<00:02:49.330> i<00:02:49.480> use<00:02:49.720> is<00:02:50.050> blip<00:02:50.440> of

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
that but the next clip i use is blip of

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.220 
that but the next clip i use is blip of
shifting<00:02:50.950> presences<00:02:51.480> this<00:02:52.480> clip<00:02:52.690> i<00:02:52.840> think<00:02:53.110> is

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
shifting presences this clip i think is

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.930 
shifting presences this clip i think is
probably<00:02:53.860> one<00:02:54.130> of<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.280> best<00:02:54.400> glyphs<00:02:54.670> you<00:02:54.790> can

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
probably one of the best glyphs you can

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.940 
probably one of the best glyphs you can
have<00:02:55.120> just<00:02:56.110> for<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.290> simple<00:02:56.620> reason<00:02:56.650> that

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
have just for the simple reason that

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.559 
have just for the simple reason that
you're<00:02:57.280> going<00:02:57.459> to<00:02:57.519> be<00:02:57.580> shifting<00:02:58.030> presences<00:02:58.510> a

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
you're going to be shifting presences a

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.650 
you're going to be shifting presences a
lot<00:02:58.840> as<00:02:59.049> a<00:02:59.080> DK<00:02:59.830> when<00:03:00.760> people<00:03:01.120> focus<00:03:01.420> you<00:03:01.540> you

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
lot as a DK when people focus you you

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.940 
lot as a DK when people focus you you
want<00:03:01.840> a<00:03:01.900> social<00:03:02.230> blood<00:03:02.380> presence<00:03:02.769> when

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
want a social blood presence when

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.590 
want a social blood presence when
they're<00:03:03.040> not<00:03:03.190> focusing<00:03:03.640> you<00:03:03.790> you<00:03:04.360> want<00:03:04.510> to

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:09.099 
your spec and then the next clip i use

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:10.620 
your spec and then the next clip i use
that<00:03:09.370> I<00:03:09.400> think<00:03:09.790> it's<00:03:10.060> probably<00:03:10.239> one<00:03:10.510> of<00:03:10.540> the
