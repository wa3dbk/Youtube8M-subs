00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
I'll shut up it goes in the same i guess

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.039 
I'll shut up it goes in the same i guess
it<00:01:49.990> like<00:01:50.140> worked<00:01:50.380> itself<00:01:50.860> into<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.370> idea<00:01:51.909> that

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
it like worked itself into the idea that

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.840 
it like worked itself into the idea that
when<00:01:53.049> stuff<00:01:53.500> is<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:53.920> mother<00:01:54.159> cuz<00:01:54.490> she<00:01:54.670> would

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
when stuff is the mother cuz she would

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.300 
when stuff is the mother cuz she would
name<00:01:55.120> her<00:01:55.360> daughter<00:01:55.720> after<00:01:56.170> her

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
name her daughter after her

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:07.800 
name her daughter after her
so<00:01:59.700> that<00:02:00.700> happens<00:02:04.740> her<00:02:05.740> destined<00:02:06.509> rival<00:02:07.509> in

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
so that happens her destined rival in

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.160 
so that happens her destined rival in
the<00:02:07.869> entire<00:02:08.429> quick<00:02:09.429> play<00:02:09.700> option<00:02:09.880> is<00:02:10.569> john

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
the entire quick play option is john

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.410 
the entire quick play option is john
wall<00:02:11.470> which<00:02:11.800> makes<00:02:12.130> sense<00:02:12.489> cuz<00:02:12.880> her<00:02:13.150> fighting

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
wall which makes sense cuz her fighting

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.660 
wall which makes sense cuz her fighting
style<00:02:13.660> is<00:02:13.930> basically<00:02:14.470> jean<00:02:14.769> Mars<00:02:15.099> she<00:02:15.459> has<00:02:15.580> the
