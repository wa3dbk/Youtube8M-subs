this so what has the coach opposed to

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.880 
this so what has the coach opposed to
changing<00:02:19.870> its<00:02:20.470> supposed<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.739> become<00:02:20.950> a<00:02:21.040> green

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
changing its supposed to become a green

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.160 
changing its supposed to become a green
blue<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:23.920> yellow<00:02:24.370> supposed<00:02:25.299> to<00:02:25.390> make<00:02:25.510> green

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.039 

smells<00:02:29.170> really<00:02:29.380> sweet<00:02:30.239> okay<00:02:31.239> became<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:31.720> sky

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
smells really sweet okay became a sky

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:33.839 
smells really sweet okay became a sky
blue<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.680> I'm<00:02:32.980> assuming<00:02:33.310> that's<00:02:33.549> what<00:02:33.760> it

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
blue and I'm assuming that's what it

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.580 
blue and I'm assuming that's what it
means<00:02:33.880> by<00:02:34.209> color<00:02:34.480> change<00:02:36.329> now<00:02:37.329> this<00:02:37.630> is<00:02:37.690> just

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
means by color change now this is just

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.690 
means by color change now this is just
like<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:39.720> slightly<00:02:41.220> more<00:02:42.220> dense<00:02:42.549> than

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
like the slightly more dense than

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.119 
like the slightly more dense than
pancake<00:02:43.420> though<00:02:43.690> I<00:02:44.160> think<00:02:45.160> Oh<00:02:46.829> number<00:02:47.829> three

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
pancake though I think Oh number three

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.720 
pancake though I think Oh number three
this<00:02:48.610> is<00:02:48.819> supposed<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:49.900> be<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.430> Japanese<00:02:51.430> call

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
this is supposed to be the Japanese call

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.509 
this is supposed to be the Japanese call
it<00:02:51.879> dumb<00:02:52.780> in<00:02:52.959> it<00:02:53.079> I<00:02:53.260> think<00:02:53.470> it's<00:02:53.560> in<00:02:53.860> English<00:02:54.340> it

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
it dumb in it I think it's in English it

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.089 
it dumb in it I think it's in English it
translates<00:02:54.700> to<00:02:55.360> something<00:02:55.510> like<00:02:56.099> soda

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
translates to something like soda

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.629 
translates to something like soda
crystals<00:02:57.599> wow<00:02:58.599> it<00:02:58.870> smells<00:02:59.609> it<00:03:00.609> smells
