00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.660
 since the completion of the guizhou trilogy 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.440
 O fans want to know what the future of 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.299
 series 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.830
 What happened after the end of the war? 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.930
 against profits 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.150
 however, contrary to all 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.100
 expectations stated who will decide 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.380
 come back and present a story 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:30.869
 previous to the facts seen in the first 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:33.570
 game and this is the biggest challenge to spawn 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.030
 before even leaving aside its greatest 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.829
 protagonist the title manages to explore 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.079
 characters seen as supporting 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.390
 to tell us other stories of 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.370
 war and of deeper deeper 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.450
 some elements of the rich backdrop 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.450
 of the entire series 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.809
 and it is exactly in the plot that the game has 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.269
 its main highlight 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.040
 different from its predecessors. 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.640
 administration a differentiated narrative 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.800
 and holding the player from start to finish 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.290
 we are introduced to the 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.630
 lieutenant berg and his squad 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.390
 however, whoever believes that 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.430
 they are heroes as you soon discover 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.560
 the group is accused of committing some crime 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.840
 kuhn and that's where things start to 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.330
 stay interesting 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.380
 you just do not know what 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.750
 It happened 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.640
 the dissemination material and the 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.009
 openness makes it clear that the last 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.910
 mission of the squadron had some kind of 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.460
 problem 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.560
 but everything is still very foggy what 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.500
 encourages the player to advance to 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.229
 discover the truth and to leave the 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.270
 even more interesting things each 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.369
 of the accused counts his version of 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.640
 events that cause you to 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.350
 watch everything from perspectives 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.909
 different books have been 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.580
 wreck of a girl 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.280
 based on this gears of war z administer 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.900
 a different system of challenges such as 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.790
 we are before a jury 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.280
 you have the option to narrate the version 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.560
 official statement of facts or tell 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.230
 really happened revealing details 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.989
 until then confidential 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.030
 this artifice allowed the popcorn 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.489
 the player has the option of deciding 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.170
 whether or not to place a modifier 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.390
 difficulty in the campaign 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.940
 with this you can add a 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.950
 restriction of time limit or 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.329
 a mist that hinders your vision in the 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.940
 battle field 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:37.130
 they are small changes but they make 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.459
 the difference mainly in their 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.459
 punctuation 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.180
 and this peculiar narrative also in 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:47.730
 let's know a little more 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.769
 the new members of the kilo squadron 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.480
 both sofia income while war one 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.640
 priests who are new to the 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.810
 player's interest in their desires and 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.700
 motivations 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.650
 in addition they also serve to 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.290
 to go deeper into the facts that 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:05.220
 before the imam said day revealing more 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.439
 some details of the mors pendulum in the 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.510
 however it is in multiplayer that novices 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:12.540
 really make a difference 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.579
 the main action of spawning johnson is the 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.129
 system of classes present in several 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.349
 modes with the proposal to enhance the 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.569
 teamwork each of the 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.370
 characters has an ability 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:26.010
 specific and fundamental in the 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.200
 against the losers is the engineer who 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.239
 creates sentries and repairs units 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.060
 while the gift and for that care of the 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.950
 brutal part of the fighting, however 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.780
 none of these skills work 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.900
 sofia doctors are not 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.269
 available and the importance of these 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.379
 become even more apparent in the new 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.449
 invasion 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:48.180
 humans need to defend 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:50.489
 some units of the attack of the crazy ones and 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.260
 for this they must build barriers and 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.879
 keep enemies as far as possible 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.799
 of its base 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:58.319
 it is here that teamwork is 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.569
 tested that it is not a single 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.430
 soldier who wins the war but the union 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.319
 of what is best in each one 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.659
 their 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.340
 the other modules are still as 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:10.019
 fun as before 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.359
 the class system was also 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.040
 incorporated into survival by leaving 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.090
 fight against the hordes much more 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.359
 strategic 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.940
 already the all against all domination and kills 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.800
 kills as a team brings classic fighting 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.330
 for those who just want to give some titles 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.510
 they closed the opponent 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.610
 finally spawning daily brings other 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.500
 minor novelties but leave the 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.330
 experience even better 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.669
 some elements of multiplayer 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.000
 previous games appear in the campaign 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:40.830
 bringing a new type of difficulty 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.530
 new weapons and monsters also help 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.139
 create a differentiated scenario and everything 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.820
 this packaged an excellent dubbing that 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.830
 can recreate the spirit of 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.110
 characters without falling into the mistakes 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.650
 other games they commit by bringing voices 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.650
 in our language 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:06.630
 still ahead brings me some 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:08.969
 problems in their design that 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:12.210
 little of your shine are small things 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:14.099
 but that annoying throughout the game is the 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.770
 case of artificial intelligence of 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:18.360
 enemies and allies that leaves 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.430
 in several respects 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.500
 so do not strange to see a madman 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.750
 ignore his presence when he could kill 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.930
 or that your companion who loves 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.180
 if you play in front of your shots and 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.610
 more instigating than the plot of the new says 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.710
 the value is it can not avoid the 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.800
 frustration of knowing that at the end of everything 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.930
 still have a badly built villain the 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.580
 so feared general sheep played in the 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.349
 history so little worked that the 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.180
 final battle becomes just one more 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:47.210
 confrontation between so many 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.740
 of course this is a very 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.560
 subjective but it is impossible not to be 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.719
 That face is just that 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.560
 after all the squad that did not 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:57.560
 deserved much more 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.920
 we can say that epic games bet 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.630
 high after a successful trilogy 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.190
 the company not only abandoned its 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.960
 protagonist as well as left the 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.090
 peak in the hands of another 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.700
 something that could have given a lot of 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:23.010
 however wrong after by those who will 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:26.310
 was able to hold the bar and brought a 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:28.370
 great title for xbox 360 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.990
 more than keeping the original shape 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:33.330
 intact spawning of food renews 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.830
 series by introducing new elements that 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.320
 work very well 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.000
 is the case of the class system that leaves 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.460
 multiplayer games much more 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.610
 strategic and job- dependent 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.620
 team creating a new dynamic at the end 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:50.100
 of accounts directly proves that 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:51.840
 invention and boldness go hand in hand by 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.540
 riskier that has been abandoned 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.460
 the figure of marcus fenix go beyond the 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.650
 character opens doors to new 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.740
 stories and a new future for your 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.740

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.250
 bajaki games and until our next
