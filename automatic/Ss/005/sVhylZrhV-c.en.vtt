00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.590
 we continue in galicia in this twelfth 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.240
 stage of the return of 185 kilometers of 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.510
 Travel near the Atlantic coast 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.550
 between vilagarcía de arousa and dumbría a 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.859
 flat course but that ends 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.749
 with surprise the lookout of ézaro a 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.609
 rise of 2.5 kilometers with one 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:25.609
 Average slope of 10% 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.960
 Y 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.360
 the pace is slow the runners should 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:41.980
 be reserving forces for what they 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:45.960
 wait for a cyclist's hat 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.960
 it's good it's good it's opening a hole 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.390
 at the moment the runners are doing 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.390
 the minimum effort 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.970
 go level go to change of pace 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.400
 the escapees have decided to surrender and 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.240
 are going to be absorbed by the peloton what 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.240
 backward option 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.689
 ah 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.720
 and has launched a devastating attack for 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.720
 go solo 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.920
 squad has raised the foot a little 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.090
 The leader's team should not be too 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.090
 worried about the break 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.799
 there is a runner trying to leave the 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.570
 group we are halfway to the 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.869
 leaders are gaining positions in the 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.869
 platoon 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.250
 and does not try to leave the group in these 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.250
 moments 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.370
 It seems that several directors have 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.290
 agreed to take down the 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.240
 get away and have put in several men 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.770
 in front of the group the squad is 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.630
 reducing its disadvantage with the 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.120
 escaped the group has reached the 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.920
 height of the escaped but towards the 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.610
 calm for these fighters who decide 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.610
 prove the leak 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.500
 the getaway has not been to the taste of everything 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:25.700
 the world and the peloton has increased the 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.859
 march to hunt them 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.870
 Carrara does not think about it and throws a 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:31.549
 squad attack has awakened and is 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.859
 beginning to reduce advantage and 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.859
 hoogerland is shot at his wheel 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.910
 attack by nicola rosso 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.390
 attention that alexandre vinokurov is 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.390
 attacking 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.190
 ah 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.190
 10 km the finish line 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.019
 the brokers are entering the 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.240
 last five kilometers the disadvantage 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.950
 of the peloton has been reduced 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.440
 this run theme that will do a lot of damage 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.120
 of the group the imposed rhythm is very high 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.250
 and very few brokers will come with 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.320
 options at the end of the stage the 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.069
 runners see you this climb has a 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.140
 half chilling percentage 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.700
 good very nice while it lasted for the 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.129
 escaped but the squad does not give them the 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.170
 option starts the final sprint go 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:43.889
 fight the nervousness of the group has 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.889
 caused this fall 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.020
