show<00:00:09.929> you<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.110> different<00:00:10.469> jigs<00:00:10.679> I<00:00:10.889> used<00:00:11.219> and

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.080 
show you the different jigs I used and

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.279 
show you the different jigs I used and
made<00:00:14.030> ideas<00:00:15.030> from<00:00:15.210> others<00:00:15.420> some<00:00:15.900> might<00:00:16.109> have

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
made ideas from others some might have

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.189 
made ideas from others some might have
an<00:00:16.350> idea<00:00:16.470> for<00:00:17.210> the<00:00:18.210> table<00:00:18.600> saw

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
an idea for the table saw

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.710 
an idea for the table saw
the<00:00:20.130> first<00:00:20.400> one<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:21.180> aids<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:23.240> jig<00:00:24.240> for<00:00:24.449> making

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
the first one is aids a jig for making

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.410 
the first one is aids a jig for making
splines<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:26.070> spline<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:28.369> simply<00:00:29.369> this<00:00:30.210> is

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
splines and the spline I simply this is

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.780 
splines and the spline I simply this is
said<00:00:30.630> about<00:00:30.890> 45<00:00:31.890> degree<00:00:32.870> to<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.020> edge<00:00:34.550> you<00:00:35.550> put

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
said about 45 degree to the edge you put

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.110 
said about 45 degree to the edge you put
it

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
it

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.709 
it
we<00:00:36.630> need<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.899> shove<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.290> through<00:00:38.510> yeah<00:00:39.510> that's

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
we need to shove it through yeah that's

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.200 
we need to shove it through yeah that's
how<00:00:39.899> we<00:00:39.930> make<00:00:40.260> these<00:00:40.469> decorative<00:00:41.210> reinforced

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
how we make these decorative reinforced

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.830 
how we make these decorative reinforced
splines<00:00:43.050> for<00:00:43.530> boxes<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:45.829> if<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:47.039> use<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.840> 1/8

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
splines for boxes and if you use a 1/8

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.569 
splines for boxes and if you use a 1/8
inch<00:00:48.870> saw<00:00:49.350> blade<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.950> just<00:00:50.160> buy<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.430> one

it's<00:01:11.250> fun<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.640> learn<00:01:11.700> we're<00:01:11.939> working<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.510> jigs

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
it's fun to learn we're working the jigs

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.690 
it's fun to learn we're working the jigs
are<00:01:15.080> just<00:01:16.080> trying<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.409> figure<00:01:16.590> things<00:01:16.890> out<00:01:18.380> the

right<00:01:39.000> at<00:01:39.210> 3/4<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:39.930> an<00:01:40.110> inch<00:01:40.579> and<00:01:41.579> it's<00:01:41.880> used<00:01:42.090> to

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
right at 3/4 of an inch and it's used to

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.560 
right at 3/4 of an inch and it's used to
make<00:01:43.759> items<00:01:44.759> like<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.560> now<00:01:47.210> I'm<00:01:48.210> going<00:01:48.420> to

of the 3/4 dado and I use that on these

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.140 
of the 3/4 dado and I use that on these
cedar<00:02:03.149> tables

the Adirondack chair we just finished

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.520 
the Adirondack chair we just finished
they're<00:02:37.150> going<00:02:37.420> it<00:02:37.540> takes<00:02:37.780> quite<00:02:38.019> a<00:02:38.140> bit<00:02:38.230> as

they're going it takes quite a bit as
more<00:02:38.739> would<00:02:38.950> say<00:02:39.160> fussing<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.880> get<00:02:40.030> this

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
more would say fussing to get this

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.259 
more would say fussing to get this
exactly<00:02:40.780> three<00:02:41.050> corner<00:02:44.880> fussing<00:02:45.880> is<00:02:45.970> part<00:02:46.209> of

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
exactly three corner fussing is part of

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:47.840 
exactly three corner fussing is part of
the<00:02:46.360> fun

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
the fun

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:55.850 
the fun
then<00:02:48.850> we<00:02:48.970> have<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.300> standard<00:02:53.910> just<00:02:54.910> tell<00:02:55.750> us

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
then we have the standard just tell us

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.370 
then we have the standard just tell us
where<00:02:56.860> safety<00:02:57.160> is<00:02:58.140> this<00:02:59.140> jig<00:02:59.440> here<00:03:01.380> should

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
where safety is this jig here should

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:12.270 
where safety is this jig here should
call<00:03:02.650> to<00:03:02.920> make<00:03:03.190> up<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.370> lot<00:03:03.610> of<00:03:03.670> room<00:03:03.910> jig<00:03:11.250> what<00:03:12.250> a

from them the blade easy to make you

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:35.069 
from them the blade easy to make you
just<00:03:29.370> areas<00:03:30.370> like<00:03:30.579> this<00:03:30.730> where<00:03:33.900> they<00:03:34.900> it's

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
just areas like this where they it's

just areas like this where they it's
simpler<00:03:35.500> one<00:03:41.549> for<00:03:42.549> cutting<00:03:42.820> 45

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.180 

and<00:03:48.180> you<00:03:48.360> think<00:03:48.630> your<00:03:48.750> time<00:03:48.960> this<00:03:49.410> and<00:03:49.830> set

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
and you think your time this and set

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:58.150 
and you think your time this and set
this<00:03:50.340> up<00:03:50.580> correctly<00:03:50.610> it<00:03:51.270> is<00:03:51.450> very<00:03:51.990> accurate

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.860 

we<00:03:59.160> have<00:03:59.280> a<00:03:59.310> standard<00:03:59.790> tapering<00:04:00.240> jig<00:04:00.360> which

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
we have a standard tapering jig which

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.960 
we have a standard tapering jig which
there's<00:04:01.740> a<00:04:01.830> lot<00:04:01.950> of<00:04:02.190> different<00:04:02.520> plans<00:04:02.760> for

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
there's a lot of different plans for

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.650 
there's a lot of different plans for
these<00:04:03.330> or<00:04:03.990> on<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.290> Internet

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
these or on the Internet

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:13.910 
these or on the Internet
I<00:04:09.140> used<00:04:10.140> it<00:04:10.350> to<00:04:10.650> make<00:04:10.680> these<00:04:12.560> papers<00:04:13.560> on<00:04:13.740> this

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
I used it to make these papers on this

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.759 
I used it to make these papers on this
leg<00:04:14.250> you<00:04:15.210> can<00:04:15.360> do<00:04:15.480> it<00:04:15.600> freehand<00:04:15.870> but<00:04:16.440> when<00:04:16.650> you

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
leg you can do it freehand but when you

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.590 
leg you can do it freehand but when you
set<00:04:17.370> up<00:04:17.400> like<00:04:17.700> this<00:04:18.000> they're<00:04:18.269> all<00:04:18.420> the<00:04:18.570> same

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600
