00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:10.090
 4 Let's learn about arpeggios in this episode. 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:15.880
 Kyobo did you see how good the play a Gray Cast 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:19.199
 Here are three great benefits that have flowed into the picture with it once 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.199
 I'll show you a video. 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:28.980
 The arpeggio plays a normal note with your thumb 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:35.720
 The other 123 i got the damage. 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.720
 I did not play a line in my study three times. 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.800
 U 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.839
 Turn off the heat equal to a minor step to give 5 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:53.050
 I have to die. 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:55.840
 There are three 5-laps here. 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:03.160
 Photograph and write comparison like 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:08.200
 When the thumb comes in so close to where it moves 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:11.650
 It 's a lot of playboys in p. 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:16.720
 When you hit the curing Got a minute in hand so that the day Sheikh 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:20.140
 So when I realized the crime, I inserted it into the post and I adapted it. 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.539
 I have to get it out again. 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.899
 We can save Suzhou . 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:27.130
 If this is a spectacle to kick tread, because it takes a lot of time semester 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:31.899
 It's difficult. 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:36.310
 And if you hit the arpeggius like this, your wrist here will be broken by Uiga. 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:40.660
 I'm going to play it softly because I'm going to have a really big wrist . 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:47.050
 So when you play the abandonment yourself, 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:52.570
 Gets the back of the hand is always tops and maintain a level that it is looking at how risk 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:55.900
 Can you burn it to a location of the memories do you have a far 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:02:02.530
 The thumb on the outside so I did not go into that to play 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:08.140
 I have a lot of intellects like this . 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:11.560
 It's not that the thumb nail is in the middle 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:16.080
 Examples of the base line side iteusijyo 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:20.140
 That's why you have to be so serious . 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:25.030
 So when I look for Vita, the gun looks like this. 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:29.170
 As you can see in the picture together so things are so far one study 11 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.010
 And it is keen to see some form of do me a big oh so little 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.170
 What 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.170
 Shinan-gun Then, 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:44.010
 I want to go to a couple 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.349
 We also come out beautifully . 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.560
 You should not go into this in your attention. 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:54.299
 This is the second. 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.610
 Since arpeggios are somehow smaller than the sound of a guitar in hand 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:00.000
 To enrich your sound 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:05.400
 When this weight is 5 insulation 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:11.609
 Cycle It depends very much on how you use the joints of your fingers 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:16.290
 Usually , if the number 1 joint near the nail here is 2 or 3 times 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:19.500
 You use a number 1 joint to mean a lot like this. 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:24.090
 That beat look at the catch sheds no power sound 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.220
 Of course, if we deliberately playing it even now, but still sub sound 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.090
 To make math better 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:35.879
 When you move your child, it feels like no. 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:40.919
 It is here that using it in the joints and the joints and Chuo part 3 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:45.810
 It's not like the lines are so lukewarm in the industry 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:48.840
 This greatly upon moving here in the sense of having a larger line 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:52.889
 That if we are to move normal 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:58.019
 There's a fist on the line here . 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:04:00.900
 So here is the line'm feeling the axis of the support plate chisyeo also yoreotge 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:07.230
 Drink and b do so like this 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:12.269
 If you look at the difference, the first or second will use Nirvana. 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:15.080
 Well, I 've been working on joints for a long time, so I want all of the joints in the world 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.080
 If you hit me 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:23.790
 wow 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:27.240
 I do not want to use this whole jewel to move like this 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:30.600
 This feeling of moving does not break down. 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:37.620
 And then I got the visual insulation. 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:42.720
 After less than two weeks from the vertical direction, so grab the right, as you have so so 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:45.479
 Did they have to do this thoroughly, so always gotta look at self 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:50.580
 When you're in the Arte, 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:51.030
 This water vertically Yeah ride to be healed in this sense, as that's down 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.410
 It's 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:05:01.650
 Yes, with your thumb. 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:05.970
 Now get out there trying to clean the line when you vary director 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:09.560
 I do not feel like I need it. 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.560
 The same is true when stock prices move one by one . 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:17.000
 I 'm almost here with all of the joint joints. 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.000
 Four 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:27.390
 The sound of Lopez can be a much more beautiful and the sound that somehow next 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:33.810
 If you do not have a lot of menstruation by the stars, 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:36.840
 In order to prevent that, I have to take the slip of that shoe to the drinking of the walnut Mart 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:42.120
 Continue until the stain is likely to be used 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:47.700
 If you do not, you will not feel it, but you will end up with difficulty. 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:53.430
 I've continued to live as believers said two people have high altitude 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:06:01.010
 You hear it. I like it a little bit harder. 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:06:01.010
 For those who talk 7 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:09.540
 2a paejugo come on when to pass on the Tosa is the civic silver 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:14.400
 I do not want to go to the shoes, little by little 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:17.690
 If you get off this way, you have an incision in Bumin Minis. 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.690
 Neither is honorable 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:23.729
 Let's rock 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:27.350
 You have to move and buy it. 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:32.230
 Even if the day is dry 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.230
 One day you feel the person. 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:38.160
 U 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:41.340
 If you pay attention to this, 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:44.730
 Just to be pretty sound and configure the Daejeo 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:48.530
 You can get more information in the book while looking at the picture 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.530
 I think you'll follow.
