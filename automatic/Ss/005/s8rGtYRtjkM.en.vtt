with the red lights from McEwen and

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.390 
with the red lights from McEwen and
Sorokin<00:02:50.840> hit<00:02:51.380> let<00:02:51.590> it<00:02:51.709> where<00:02:51.859> I<00:02:51.920> was<00:02:52.100> able<00:02:52.370> to

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:54.079 
save the best for the last

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.930 
save the best for the last
now<00:02:54.440> that<00:02:54.620> Don<00:02:54.829> Garlits<00:02:55.100> told<00:02:55.519> the<00:02:55.700> press

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
radio and television what he sees in the

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.190 
radio and television what he sees in the
future<00:03:00.609> well<00:03:01.609> like<00:03:01.819> I<00:03:01.940> say<00:03:02.120> we're<00:03:02.299> going<00:03:02.510> to<00:03:02.600> go

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
future well like I say we're going to go

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.690 
future well like I say we're going to go
home<00:03:03.410> we've<00:03:03.590> learned<00:03:03.799> a<00:03:03.920> lot<00:03:04.040> from<00:03:04.100> this<00:03:04.459> race

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
home we've learned a lot from this race

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.729 
home we've learned a lot from this race
this<00:03:04.940> car<00:03:05.180> has<00:03:05.329> been<00:03:05.480> great<00:03:05.780> but<00:03:05.930> I<00:03:05.989> think<00:03:06.079> it's

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
this car has been great but I think it's

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.559 
this car has been great but I think it's
just<00:03:06.950> a<00:03:07.040> start<00:03:07.340> on<00:03:07.459> a<00:03:07.519> certain<00:03:07.970> design<00:03:08.299> as<00:03:08.480> you

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
just a start on a certain design as you

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:10.059 
just a start on a certain design as you
can<00:03:08.750> tell<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:09.049> car<00:03:09.260> doesn't<00:03:09.590> look<00:03:09.620> exactly

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
can tell the car doesn't look exactly

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.430 
can tell the car doesn't look exactly
like<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.609> other<00:03:10.790> cars<00:03:11.090> we're<00:03:11.840> going<00:03:12.019> to<00:03:12.109> go<00:03:12.230> on

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
like the other cars we're going to go on

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.379 
like the other cars we're going to go on
with<00:03:12.650> this<00:03:12.739> design<00:03:13.130> and<00:03:13.459> some<00:03:13.790> improvements

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:14.389 
with this design and some improvements

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:16.360 
with this design and some improvements
and<00:03:14.420> I<00:03:14.540> think<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:15.590> next<00:03:15.829> one<00:03:15.920> will<00:03:16.010> even<00:03:16.220> be

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
and I think the next one will even be

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.940 
and I think the next one will even be
faster
