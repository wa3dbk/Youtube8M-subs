00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.990 
each other and bend bows and tie at each
other<00:01:18.640> so<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:20.170> know<00:01:20.290> surely<00:01:20.680> they<00:01:21.520> needed

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
other so you know surely they needed

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.399 
other so you know surely they needed
water<00:01:22.150> too<00:01:22.509> and<00:01:22.540> yet<00:01:22.720> we<00:01:22.810> never<00:01:22.900> see<00:01:23.170> water

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
water too and yet we never see water

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.590 
water too and yet we never see water
bottles<00:01:23.830> on<00:01:23.979> any<00:01:24.729> of<00:01:24.909> the<00:01:25.000> soldiers<00:01:25.330> sounds

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
bottles on any of the soldiers sounds

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.480 
bottles on any of the soldiers sounds
reasonable<00:01:25.840> to<00:01:26.290> imagine<00:01:26.380> but<00:01:26.920> actually<00:01:27.400> a<00:01:27.430> lot

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
reasonable to imagine but actually a lot

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.399 
reasonable to imagine but actually a lot
of<00:01:27.640> them<00:01:27.759> did<00:01:28.060> carry<00:01:28.360> water<00:01:28.659> now<00:01:29.259> it's

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
of them did carry water now it's

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.880 
of them did carry water now it's
possible<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:31.180> not<00:01:31.600> all<00:01:31.810> of<00:01:31.930> them<00:01:32.049> had<00:01:32.259> water

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
possible that not all of them had water

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.230 
possible that not all of them had water
bottles<00:01:33.280> it<00:01:33.460> cursed<00:01:33.610> me<00:01:33.759> for<00:01:33.790> instance<00:01:34.090> that

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
bottles it cursed me for instance that

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.510 
bottles it cursed me for instance that
you<00:01:34.360> might<00:01:34.509> there<00:01:34.840> might<00:01:34.960> have<00:01:34.990> been<00:01:35.079> some

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
you might there might have been some

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.590 
you might there might have been some
regime<00:01:36.520> but<00:01:36.640> we<00:01:36.729> don't<00:01:36.909> know<00:01:37.060> about<00:01:37.180> it's<00:01:37.479> not

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
regime but we don't know about it's not

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.640 
regime but we don't know about it's not
in<00:01:37.720> any<00:01:37.869> of<00:01:37.900> the<00:01:37.990> literal<00:01:38.259> this<00:01:38.350> is<00:01:38.470> pure

in any of the literal this is pure

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.460 
in any of the literal this is pure
speculation<00:01:38.740> where<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.750> guys<00:01:40.960> in<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.290> first

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
speculation where the guys in the first

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.590 
speculation where the guys in the first
two<00:01:41.770> ranks<00:01:42.280> for<00:01:42.549> instance<00:01:42.880> in<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.090> formation

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
two ranks for instance in the formation

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.300 
two ranks for instance in the formation
they<00:01:43.750> didn't<00:01:44.049> have<00:01:44.200> water<00:01:44.470> bottles<00:01:44.650> and<00:01:44.950> then

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
they didn't have water bottles and then
