another<00:01:39.030> point<00:01:39.420> this<00:01:39.840> end<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.229> video

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
another point this end of this video

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.069 
another point this end of this video
which<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.729> basically<00:01:42.119> why<00:01:42.479> isn't<00:01:42.869> talking

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
which is basically why isn't talking

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.410 
which is basically why isn't talking
about<00:01:43.520> people<00:01:44.520> are<00:01:44.610> saying<00:01:44.790> oh<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.210> South

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
about people are saying oh the South

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.149 
about people are saying oh the South
process<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:46.110> it's<00:01:46.500> very<00:01:46.680> hard<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.950> develop

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
process of it's very hard to develop

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.880 
process of it's very hard to develop
games<00:01:47.520> for<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.299> now<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.290> got<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.619> game's

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
games for it and now you got the game's

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.469 
games for it and now you got the game's
operation<00:01:50.310> 3<00:01:50.490> all<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.759> sudden<00:01:51.030> it's<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.240> easy

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
operation 3 all of a sudden it's so easy

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.080 
operation 3 all of a sudden it's so easy
to<00:01:51.780> make<00:01:52.049> them<00:01:52.530> onto<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.799> person<00:01:53.130> for<00:01:53.369> yet

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
to make them onto the person for yet

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.850 
to make them onto the person for yet
couple<00:01:54.540> months<00:01:54.780> ago<00:01:55.020> they<00:01:55.320> were<00:01:55.350> saying<00:01:55.710> that

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
couple months ago they were saying that

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.109 
couple months ago they were saying that
it's<00:01:56.009> hard<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.369> bring<00:01:56.549> those<00:01:56.700> places<00:01:56.969> and

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
it's hard to bring those places and

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.429 
it's hard to bring those places and
three<00:01:57.360> experience<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.049> president<00:01:58.409> for

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
three experience to the president for

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.679 
three experience to the president for
and<00:01:58.799> that's<00:01:59.100> why<00:01:59.430> they<00:01:59.969> don't<00:02:00.090> have<00:02:00.270> backwards

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
and that's why they don't have backwards

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.510 
and that's why they don't have backwards
compatibility<00:02:01.409> now<00:02:01.860> all<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.159> sudden<00:02:02.460> these

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
compatibility now all of a sudden these

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.310 
compatibility now all of a sudden these
guys<00:02:02.729> can<00:02:02.939> change<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.479> from<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.750> game<00:02:03.930> has<00:02:04.110> made

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
guys can change it from a game has made

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.840 
guys can change it from a game has made
the<00:02:04.500> Cell<00:02:04.740> processor<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:05.460> work<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:05.759> the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
the Cell processor to work in the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.210 
the Cell processor to work in the
patient<00:02:06.210> for<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.540> easily<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:07.170> find<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.860> problem

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
patient for so easily I find a problem

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.619 
patient for so easily I find a problem
there<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.610> also<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.239> need<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.390> ask<00:02:09.479> yourself

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
there and also you need to ask yourself

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.229 
there and also you need to ask yourself
this<00:02:09.899> question<00:02:09.989> if<00:02:10.709> it's<00:02:11.550> so<00:02:11.670> easy<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:12.030> be

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
this question if it's so easy to be

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.760 
this question if it's so easy to be
parted<00:02:12.660> on<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.900> position<00:02:13.050> for

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
parted on to the position for

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.410 
parted on to the position for
then<00:02:13.980> why<00:02:14.220> were<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.610> most<00:02:14.850> of<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.090> places<00:02:15.270> in

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
then why were the most of the places in

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.300 
then why were the most of the places in
three<00:02:15.690> games<00:02:15.900> able<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.500> be<00:02:16.590> ported<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:16.920> pc<00:02:17.270> why

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
three games able to be ported to pc why

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.310 
three games able to be ported to pc why
