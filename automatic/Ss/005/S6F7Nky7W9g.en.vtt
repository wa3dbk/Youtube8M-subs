bunker rush well be her undoing unit but

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.419 
bunker rush well be her undoing unit but
that<00:00:06.029> she<00:00:06.180> was<00:00:06.299> able<00:00:06.450> to<00:00:06.750> sustain<00:00:07.620> herself<00:00:08.040> and

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
that she was able to sustain herself and

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:09.950 
that she was able to sustain herself and

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
not just get instantly taken out and all

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.049 
not just get instantly taken out and all
heard<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.410> glass<00:00:10.530> have<00:00:10.950> not<00:00:11.219> arrived<00:00:11.550> yet<00:00:11.730> and

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
heard the glass have not arrived yet and

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.060 
heard the glass have not arrived yet and
those<00:00:12.420> tanks<00:00:12.870> are<00:00:12.990> just<00:00:13.320> being<00:00:13.530> picked<00:00:13.889> up

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
those tanks are just being picked up

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.369 
those tanks are just being picked up
maybe<00:00:14.400> she<00:00:14.639> would<00:00:14.849> want<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.179> just<00:00:15.389> there<00:00:15.690> you

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
maybe she would want to just there you

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.260 
maybe she would want to just there you
know<00:00:16.500> move<00:00:16.770> them<00:00:16.980> in<00:00:17.100> help<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.609> glory<00:00:17.850> anyway

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
know move them in help of glory anyway

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.880 
know move them in help of glory anyway
and<00:00:18.539> maybe<00:00:18.720> do<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.109> try<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:19.529> linked<00:00:19.710> to

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
and maybe do it a try and it linked to

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.590 
and maybe do it a try and it linked to
some<00:00:20.100> sort<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.430> mind<00:00:20.699> drag<00:00:20.970> with<00:00:21.180> them<00:00:21.330> just

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
some sort of a mind drag with them just

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.840 
some sort of a mind drag with them just
so<00:00:21.840> they're<00:00:22.080> just<00:00:22.949> so<00:00:23.100> they<00:00:23.250> don't<00:00:23.279> just<00:00:23.609> stand

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
so they're just so they don't just stand

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.970 
so they're just so they don't just stand
there<00:00:24.000> getting<00:00:24.359> wiped<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.779> oblivion<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.529> now

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
there getting wiped to oblivion and now

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.980 
there getting wiped to oblivion and now
it<00:00:26.099> looks<00:00:26.250> like<00:00:26.490> up<00:00:27.180> magic<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.689> going<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.900> do

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
it looks like up magic is going to do

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.470 
it looks like up magic is going to do
exactly<00:00:28.140> what<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.920> toss<00:00:29.490> Celtic<00:00:29.910> before<00:00:30.269> and

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
exactly what a toss Celtic before and

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.049 
exactly what a toss Celtic before and
use<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.140> maps<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.439> little<00:00:31.650> side<00:00:31.890> bit<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.309> rush

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
use the maps a little side bit to a rush

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.049 
use the maps a little side bit to a rush
round<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.719> then<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.079> not<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.370> quad<00:00:35.370> us<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.910> he's

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
round and then is not a quad us and he's

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.030 
round and then is not a quad us and he's
going<00:00:36.360> around<00:00:36.540> there<00:00:36.840> as<00:00:36.960> well<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.500> transfer

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
going around there as well to transfer

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.030 
going around there as well to transfer
to<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.190> new<00:00:38.280> base<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.030> we<00:00:39.120> see<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.860> you<00:00:40.860> see

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
to the new base and we see the you see

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.020 
to the new base and we see the you see
the<00:00:41.160> minimal<00:00:41.460> line<00:00:41.610> they're<00:00:41.790> getting

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
the minimal line they're getting

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.420 
the minimal line they're getting
attacked<00:00:42.329> by<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.719> by<00:00:43.530> those<00:00:43.739> vultures<00:00:43.980> there

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
attacked by the by those vultures there

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.880 
attacked by the by those vultures there
and<00:00:44.670> now<00:00:45.239> we<00:00:45.300> have<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.899> rights<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.620> base

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
and now we have the rights in the base

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.049 
and now we have the rights in the base
of<00:00:48.140> Tosca<00:00:49.140> really<00:00:49.649> really<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.190> our<00:00:50.460> mineral

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
of Tosca really really on our mineral

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.549 
of Tosca really really on our mineral
line<00:00:51.210> getting<00:00:51.449> attacked<00:00:51.780> by<00:00:51.930> those<00:00:52.230> right

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
line getting attacked by those right

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.220 
line getting attacked by those right
really<00:00:53.340> not<00:00:53.610> good<00:00:53.820> for<00:00:53.969> her<00:00:54.090> she<00:00:54.120> needs<00:00:54.629> more

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
really not good for her she needs more

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.090 
really not good for her she needs more
of<00:00:55.289> those<00:00:55.440> glides<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.100> get<00:00:56.340> out<00:00:56.460> pretty<00:00:56.910> sick

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.439 

yeah<00:01:02.100> she<00:01:02.309> actually<00:01:02.399> went<00:01:02.699> for<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> fairly

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449

yeah she actually went for a fairly
flashy<00:01:03.930> bills<00:01:04.320> relying<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:04.920> those<00:01:05.070> collapse

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
flashy bills relying on those collapse

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.950 
flashy bills relying on those collapse
to<00:01:05.909> deal<00:01:06.780> with<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> rape<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:07.590> hook<00:01:07.979> kind<00:01:08.460> of

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
to deal with the rape so hook kind of

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.350 
to deal with the rape so hook kind of
use<00:01:09.960> mobile<00:01:10.439> turret<00:01:11.159> then<00:01:11.430> just<00:01:11.670> plant<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.210> lot

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
use mobile turret then just plant a lot

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.630 
use mobile turret then just plant a lot
of<00:01:12.479> turns<00:01:12.689> around<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.140> map<00:01:13.320> but<00:01:14.040> really<00:01:14.610> the

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
of turns around the map but really the

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.550 
of turns around the map but really the
problem<00:01:14.970> for<00:01:15.420> her<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.869> up<00:01:16.080> magic<00:01:16.439> is

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
problem for her is that up magic is

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.830 
problem for her is that up magic is
really<00:01:16.799> macaron<00:01:17.220> up<00:01:17.400> right<00:01:17.610> now<00:01:17.790> he<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.750> i

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
really macaron up right now he is i

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.170 
really macaron up right now he is i
believe<00:01:19.020> at<00:01:19.740> least<00:01:19.799> one<00:01:20.430> base<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.939> i<00:01:20.970> cannot

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
believe at least one base and i cannot

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.910 
believe at least one base and i cannot
tell<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.720> mini-map<00:01:21.960> because<00:01:22.439> we<00:01:22.619> haven't

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
tell on the mini-map because we haven't

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.440 
tell on the mini-map because we haven't
seen<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.100> lot<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.369> what<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.790> going<00:01:23.909> on<00:01:24.150> on<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
seen a lot of what is going on on the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.450 
seen a lot of what is going on on the
right<00:01:25.049> side<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.530> map<00:01:25.710> but<00:01:25.860> i<00:01:25.920> believe<00:01:26.040> he

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
right side of the map but i believe he

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.280 
right side of the map but i believe he
definitely<00:01:26.850> had<00:01:27.119> at<00:01:27.240> least<00:01:27.390> one<00:01:27.720> expansion

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
definitely had at least one expansion

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.429 
definitely had at least one expansion
there<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:29.509> he<00:01:30.509> was<00:01:30.540> really<00:01:30.869> getting<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.290> much

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
there and he was really getting so much

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.340 
there and he was really getting so much
gas<00:01:31.710> from<00:01:32.549> these<00:01:32.729> expansions<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:34.200> is

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
gas from these expansions and this is

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.920 
gas from these expansions and this is
putting<00:01:34.619> him<00:01:34.909> further<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.270> further<00:01:36.450> ahead<00:01:36.750> in

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
putting him further and further ahead in

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.830 
putting him further and further ahead in
the<00:01:37.140> game<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.470> really<00:01:37.850> by<00:01:38.850> just<00:01:39.150> turning<00:01:39.329> back

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
the game so really by just turning back

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.929 
the game so really by just turning back
as<00:01:40.079> she<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.350> doing<00:01:40.680> right<00:01:40.890> now<00:01:41.100> i<00:01:41.369> don't<00:01:41.610> think

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
as she is doing right now i don't think

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.670 
as she is doing right now i don't think
that<00:01:42.119> posture<00:01:42.659> will<00:01:42.869> achieve<00:01:43.170> absolutely

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
that posture will achieve absolutely

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.170 
that posture will achieve absolutely
anything<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.130> she<00:01:44.280> knows<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.460> herself<00:01:44.909> so

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
anything and she knows it herself so

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.940 
anything and she knows it herself so
what<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.810> should<00:01:45.990> do<00:01:46.140> right<00:01:46.170> now<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.619> really

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
what you should do right now is really

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.460 
what you should do right now is really
built<00:01:47.280> for<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.460> very<00:01:47.729> aggressive<00:01:48.390> Bold<00:01:48.960> maybe

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
built for a very aggressive Bold maybe

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.499 
built for a very aggressive Bold maybe
even<00:01:49.710> all<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.280> tactic<00:01:50.790> but<00:01:50.970> it's<00:01:51.180> better<00:01:51.390> than

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
even all in tactic but it's better than

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.980 
even all in tactic but it's better than
just<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.140> wait<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.890> out<00:01:53.009> for<00:01:53.430> for<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.869> magic<00:01:54.869> to

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
just to wait it out for for a magic to

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.590 
just to wait it out for for a magic to
simply<00:01:55.259> roll<00:01:55.500> over<00:01:55.829> her<00:01:55.979> he<00:01:56.939> should<00:01:57.149> she

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
simply roll over her he should she

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.480 
simply roll over her he should she
should<00:01:57.780> just<00:01:57.810> try<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.950> know<00:01:58.979> attack<00:01:59.340> one

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
should just try to you know attack one

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.240 
should just try to you know attack one
of<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.700> expansions<00:02:00.270> or<00:02:00.649> try<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.710> start<00:02:02.040> maybe

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
of the expansions or try to start maybe

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.490 
of the expansions or try to start maybe
dropping<00:02:02.719> something<00:02:03.719> whatever<00:02:04.140> but<00:02:04.469> just

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
dropping something whatever but just

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.140 
dropping something whatever but just
dots<00:02:05.100> stay<00:02:05.490> there<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:05.939> do<00:02:06.149> nothing

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.150 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.250 

yeah<00:02:11.150> you're<00:02:11.330> definitely<00:02:11.600> right<00:02:11.959> there<00:02:12.230> I

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
yeah you're definitely right there I

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.260 
yeah you're definitely right there I
think<00:02:12.650> she's<00:02:12.890> actually<00:02:13.100> here<00:02:13.520> she<00:02:14.120> might

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
think she's actually here she might

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.300 
think she's actually here she might
actually<00:02:14.450> going<00:02:14.870> for<00:02:14.990> a<00:02:15.200> double<00:02:15.560> expand<00:02:16.130> at

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
actually going for a double expand at

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.860 
actually going for a double expand at
the<00:02:16.430> moment<00:02:16.790> I<00:02:16.850> think<00:02:16.910> she<00:02:17.209> might<00:02:17.360> be<00:02:17.420> working

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
the moment I think she might be working

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.710 
the moment I think she might be working
on<00:02:17.959> to<00:02:18.670> command<00:02:19.670> centers<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.209> could<00:02:20.420> be<00:02:20.540> wrong

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
on to command centers I could be wrong

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.120 
on to command centers I could be wrong
about<00:02:20.780> spoiling<00:02:21.350> that<00:02:21.560> for<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.770> did<00:02:21.980> look

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
about spoiling that for the did look

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.390 
about spoiling that for the did look
lugs<00:02:22.370> yet<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:22.790> and<00:02:22.970> worse<00:02:23.180> I<00:02:27.040> know<00:02:28.040> yeah<00:02:28.340> you

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
lugs yet to and worse I know yeah you

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.160 
lugs yet to and worse I know yeah you
can<00:02:28.700> see<00:02:28.880> on<00:02:29.000> her<00:02:29.090> face<00:02:29.120> there<00:02:29.569> she<00:02:29.810> definitely

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
can see on her face there she definitely

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.440 
can see on her face there she definitely
doesn't<00:02:30.830> look<00:02:31.010> happy<00:02:31.340> about<00:02:31.580> what's<00:02:32.000> going<00:02:32.239> on

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
doesn't look happy about what's going on

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.570 
doesn't look happy about what's going on
and<00:02:32.600> especially<00:02:32.989> with<00:02:33.350> those<00:02:33.560> earth<00:02:33.920> kluh

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
and especially with those earth kluh

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.640 
and especially with those earth kluh
great<00:02:34.910> rates<00:02:35.480> in<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:35.989> area<00:02:36.350> and<00:02:36.440> she's

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
great rates in the area and she's

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.979 
great rates in the area and she's
clearly<00:02:36.950> a<00:02:37.130> further<00:02:38.000> away<00:02:38.300> from<00:02:38.450> getting<00:02:38.780> any

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
clearly a further away from getting any

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.949 
clearly a further away from getting any
science<00:02:39.500> vessels<00:02:39.920> out<00:02:40.100> so<00:02:40.790> now<00:02:41.030> we<00:02:41.660> have<00:02:41.690> some

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
science vessels out so now we have some

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.570 
science vessels out so now we have some
more<00:02:42.200> siege<00:02:42.470> tanks<00:02:42.830> they're<00:02:43.010> just<00:02:43.190> stopping

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
more siege tanks they're just stopping

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.340 
more siege tanks they're just stopping
this<00:02:43.700> expansion<00:02:44.180> although<00:02:44.750> I<00:02:44.780> toss<00:02:45.080> girls

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
this expansion although I toss girls

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.110 
this expansion although I toss girls
from<00:02:45.680> going<00:02:45.950> up<00:02:46.100> so<00:02:46.340> she<00:02:46.400> is<00:02:46.640> stuck<00:02:46.970> on

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
from going up so she is stuck on

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.890 
from going up so she is stuck on
hysteria<00:02:47.510> to<00:02:48.319> basic<00:02:48.709> on<00:02:48.860> me<00:02:49.010> four<00:02:49.280> times<00:02:52.900> yeah

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
hysteria to basic on me four times yeah

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.990 
hysteria to basic on me four times yeah
Julio<00:02:54.170> and<00:02:54.650> now<00:02:54.769> her<00:02:54.950> refinery<00:02:55.640> getting

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
Julio and now her refinery getting

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.770 
Julio and now her refinery getting
shells<00:02:56.300> from<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:56.750> Ridge<00:02:56.989> tab<00:02:57.470> I<00:02:58.780> don't

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
shells from that Ridge tab I don't

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.509 
shells from that Ridge tab I don't
really<00:02:59.900> know<00:03:00.140> what<00:03:00.709> she<00:03:00.830> was<00:03:00.920> thinking<00:03:00.980> when

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
really know what she was thinking when

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.390 
really know what she was thinking when
she<00:03:01.670> took<00:03:01.880> nine<00:03:02.330> o'clock<00:03:02.720> because<00:03:02.989> I<00:03:03.500> think

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
she took nine o'clock because I think

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.770 
she took nine o'clock because I think
she<00:03:04.489> should<00:03:04.519> have<00:03:04.700> realized<00:03:05.120> that<00:03:05.239> it<00:03:05.630> was

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
she should have realized that it was

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.520 
she should have realized that it was
simply<00:03:06.140> not<00:03:06.290> defendable<00:03:06.950> not<00:03:07.630> with<00:03:08.630> all<00:03:09.350> the

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
simply not defendable not with all the

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.620 
simply not defendable not with all the
forces<00:03:09.769> that<00:03:09.890> of<00:03:10.160> magic<00:03:10.580> hesitation<00:03:11.120> so<00:03:11.330> close

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
forces that of magic hesitation so close

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.759 
forces that of magic hesitation so close
to<00:03:11.780> nine<00:03:11.959> o'clock<00:03:12.320> and<00:03:13.870> of<00:03:14.870> course<00:03:14.930> she<00:03:15.200> needed

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
to nine o'clock and of course she needed

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.970 
to nine o'clock and of course she needed
a<00:03:15.860> new<00:03:16.010> expansion<00:03:16.640> but<00:03:16.820> I<00:03:17.410> don't<00:03:18.410> think<00:03:18.860> that

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
a new expansion but I don't think that

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.470 
a new expansion but I don't think that
that<00:03:19.130> was<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.610> way<00:03:19.730> to<00:03:19.760> go<00:03:19.940> she<00:03:20.120> should<00:03:20.360> have

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
that was the way to go she should have

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.289 
that was the way to go she should have
gone<00:03:20.660> for<00:03:21.049> just<00:03:21.890> building<00:03:22.430> more<00:03:22.610> units<00:03:22.940> off<00:03:23.090> to

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
gone for just building more units off to

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.900 
gone for just building more units off to
bases<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:23.959> then<00:03:24.350> try<00:03:24.590> to<00:03:24.620> go<00:03:24.890> very<00:03:25.370> aggressive

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
bases and then try to go very aggressive

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.060 
bases and then try to go very aggressive
and<00:03:26.060> try<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.630> go<00:03:26.750> for<00:03:26.930> a<00:03:27.200> good<00:03:27.410> attack<00:03:27.680> against

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
and try to go for a good attack against

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:33.340 
and try to go for a good attack against
up<00:03:28.190> magic<00:03:28.519> I<00:03:28.640> guess<00:03:31.570> yeah<00:03:32.570> I<00:03:32.600> think<00:03:32.930> maybe<00:03:33.170> she

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
up magic I guess yeah I think maybe she

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.650 
up magic I guess yeah I think maybe she
was<00:03:33.620> just<00:03:33.650> thinking<00:03:34.340> that<00:03:34.370> magic<00:03:35.269> wouldn't<00:03:35.570> be

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
was just thinking that magic wouldn't be

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.720 
was just thinking that magic wouldn't be
expecting<00:03:35.959> it<00:03:36.470> and<00:03:36.590> was<00:03:36.709> hoping<00:03:36.890> that<00:03:37.430> she<00:03:37.700> can

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
expecting it and was hoping that she can

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.789 
expecting it and was hoping that she can
maybe<00:03:38.000> time<00:03:38.420> up<00:03:38.660> in<00:03:38.840> the<00:03:38.930> middle<00:03:39.140> ground<00:03:39.470> and

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
maybe time up in the middle ground and

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.250 
maybe time up in the middle ground and
so<00:03:40.010> that<00:03:40.160> he<00:03:40.250> wouldn't<00:03:40.600> notice<00:03:41.600> that<00:03:42.049> the

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
so that he wouldn't notice that the

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.770 
so that he wouldn't notice that the
expansion<00:03:42.620> was<00:03:43.160> trying<00:03:43.519> to<00:03:43.640> go<00:03:43.730> up<00:03:43.760> on<00:03:44.150> ya<00:03:44.570> but

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
expansion was trying to go up on ya but

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.300 
expansion was trying to go up on ya but

you're right i'm not entirely sure what

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.930 
you're right i'm not entirely sure what
she<00:03:46.519> was<00:03:47.239> thinking<00:03:47.450> on<00:03:50.170> and<00:03:51.400> yeah<00:03:52.400> you<00:03:52.459> see<00:03:52.760> she

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
she was thinking on and yeah you see she

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.430 
she was thinking on and yeah you see she
may<00:03:53.239> actually<00:03:53.420> be<00:03:53.840> now<00:03:53.959> thinking<00:03:54.320> of

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
may actually be now thinking of

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.349 
may actually be now thinking of
expanding<00:03:54.799> Greg<00:03:55.190> oh<00:03:55.310> yeah<00:03:55.519> she<00:03:55.760> actually<00:03:55.910> did

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
expanding Greg oh yeah she actually did

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.150 
expanding Greg oh yeah she actually did
I<00:03:56.600> didn't<00:03:57.230> I<00:03:57.410> didn't<00:03:57.650> see<00:03:57.739> this<00:03:57.890> I<00:03:58.040> was

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
I didn't I didn't see this I was

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.770 
I didn't I didn't see this I was
actually<00:03:58.459> wondering<00:03:58.790> why<00:03:59.150> she<00:03:59.329> went<00:03:59.450> for<00:03:59.600> nine

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
actually wondering why she went for nine

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.199 
actually wondering why she went for nine
o'clock<00:04:00.109> and<00:04:00.320> not<00:04:00.980> for<00:04:01.370> five<00:04:01.700> o'clock<00:04:01.940> right

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
o'clock and not for five o'clock right

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.880 
o'clock and not for five o'clock right
there<00:04:02.390> where<00:04:02.570> you<00:04:02.690> saw<00:04:02.930> that<00:04:03.109> a<00:04:03.320> command

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
there where you saw that a command

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.440 
there where you saw that a command
centered<00:04:04.250> having<00:04:04.519> landed<00:04:04.760> because<00:04:05.150> it's<00:04:05.299> so

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
centered having landed because it's so

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.259 
centered having landed because it's so
much<00:04:05.600> closer<00:04:05.870> to<00:04:06.049> her<00:04:06.319> and<00:04:07.220> a<00:04:07.489> lot<00:04:07.850> easier<00:04:08.030> to

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
much closer to her and a lot easier to

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.930 
much closer to her and a lot easier to
defend<00:04:08.540> as<00:04:08.750> well<00:04:08.930> and<00:04:09.430> finally<00:04:10.430> she<00:04:10.579> manages

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
defend as well and finally she manages

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.820 
defend as well and finally she manages
to<00:04:11.090> get<00:04:11.209> rid<00:04:11.420> of<00:04:11.450> a<00:04:11.630> couple<00:04:11.750> of<00:04:11.930> race<00:04:12.140> there

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.470 

so<00:04:15.830> yeah<00:04:16.010> it<00:04:16.160> was<00:04:16.370> a<00:04:16.400> right<00:04:16.820> earlier<00:04:17.209> was<00:04:17.450> that

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
so yeah it was a right earlier was that

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.300 
so yeah it was a right earlier was that
that<00:04:17.900> was<00:04:17.930> it<00:04:18.200> that<00:04:18.350> she<00:04:18.380> was<00:04:18.650> going<00:04:18.829> for<00:04:18.950> a

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
that was it that she was going for a

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.490 
that was it that she was going for a
double<00:04:19.609> expanded<00:04:20.420> maybe<00:04:20.630> then<00:04:20.870> trying<00:04:21.200> to

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
double expanded maybe then trying to

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.980 
double expanded maybe then trying to
take<00:04:22.100> the<00:04:22.250> economy<00:04:22.700> advantage<00:04:23.210> or<00:04:23.600> at<00:04:23.810> least

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
take the economy advantage or at least

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.800 
take the economy advantage or at least
then<00:04:24.170> I<00:04:24.260> suppose<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:24.860> kids<00:04:25.130> are<00:04:25.540> because<00:04:26.540> of

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
then I suppose the kids are because of

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.540 
then I suppose the kids are because of
magic<00:04:27.020> was<00:04:27.320> taking<00:04:27.710> down<00:04:27.890> nine<00:04:28.250> o'clock

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
magic was taking down nine o'clock

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.610 
magic was taking down nine o'clock
expansion<00:04:29.210> obviously<00:04:29.600> that<00:04:29.780> means<00:04:29.810> that<00:04:30.380> the

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
expansion obviously that means that the

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.159 
expansion obviously that means that the
five<00:04:31.400> o'clock<00:04:31.669> one<00:04:31.940> has<00:04:32.150> gone<00:04:32.480> without<00:04:32.720> being

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
five o'clock one has gone without being

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:34.810 
five o'clock one has gone without being
harassed<00:04:33.380> at<00:04:33.830> least<00:04:34.100> it's<00:04:34.310> allowed<00:04:34.580> her<00:04:34.790> to

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
harassed at least it's allowed her to

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.060 
harassed at least it's allowed her to
get<00:04:35.030> one<00:04:35.210> and<00:04:35.690> that<00:04:35.990> looks<00:04:36.200> like<00:04:36.470> definitely

be<00:04:55.910> doing<00:04:56.210> that<00:04:56.330> bad<00:04:56.690> and<00:04:56.900> the<00:04:57.080> game<00:04:57.260> would

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
be doing that bad and the game would

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.200 
be doing that bad and the game would
last<00:04:57.650> a<00:04:57.830> long<00:04:57.980> time<00:04:58.040> we<00:04:58.580> may<00:04:58.760> actually<00:04:58.940> even

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
last a long time we may actually even

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.140 
last a long time we may actually even
see<00:04:59.660> battle<00:05:00.500> cruisers<00:05:00.950> from<00:05:01.250> up<00:05:01.460> magic<00:05:01.940> but

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
see battle cruisers from up magic but

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.850 
see battle cruisers from up magic but
it's<00:05:02.390> so<00:05:04.540> close<00:05:05.540> right<00:05:05.840> here<00:05:06.110> that<00:05:06.260> that<00:05:06.560> toss

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
it's so close right here that that toss

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.440 
it's so close right here that that toss
girl<00:05:07.130> would<00:05:07.310> will<00:05:07.790> simply<00:05:08.060> get<00:05:08.180> eliminated

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
girl would will simply get eliminated

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.000 
girl would will simply get eliminated
that<00:05:08.750> unfortunately<00:05:09.290> we<00:05:09.440> won't<00:05:09.560> see<00:05:09.830> those

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
that unfortunately we won't see those

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.610 
that unfortunately we won't see those
those<00:05:10.640> behemoth<00:05:11.270> ships<00:05:11.600> flying<00:05:12.320> over

those behemoth ships flying over

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.770 
those behemoth ships flying over
destination<00:05:13.250> and<00:05:13.430> you<00:05:14.000> see<00:05:14.180> she<00:05:14.300> simply<00:05:14.540> gets

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
destination and you see she simply gets

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.260 
destination and you see she simply gets
annihilated<00:05:15.050> because<00:05:15.800> he<00:05:16.340> has<00:05:16.430> micro<00:05:16.820> top<00:05:17.000> so

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
annihilated because he has micro top so

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.090 
annihilated because he has micro top so
strongly<00:05:17.660> and<00:05:17.960> he's<00:05:18.080> so<00:05:18.380> far<00:05:18.680> ahead<00:05:18.710> in

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
strongly and he's so far ahead in

strongly and he's so far ahead in
economy<00:05:19.640> and<00:05:20.110> everything<00:05:21.110> that<00:05:21.560> she<00:05:21.620> tried<00:05:21.919> to

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
economy and everything that she tried to

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
do as far as her ass she didn't she

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.540 
do as far as her ass she didn't she

didn't even really her ass a lot that

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.070 
didn't even really her ass a lot that
she<00:05:26.150> should<00:05:26.330> have<00:05:26.419> probably<00:05:26.570> been<00:05:26.810> a<00:05:26.870> little

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
she should have probably been a little

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.070 
she should have probably been a little
bit<00:05:27.229> more<00:05:27.380> aggressive<00:05:27.500> and<00:05:27.979> and<00:05:28.490> the<00:05:29.210> attempt

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
bit more aggressive and and the attempt

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.980 
bit more aggressive and and the attempt
of<00:05:30.140> her<00:05:30.320> to<00:05:30.530> maybe<00:05:31.100> run<00:05:32.090> by<00:05:32.330> with<00:05:32.600> a<00:05:32.630> couple<00:05:32.930> of

kicked<00:06:13.669> his<00:06:13.850> ass<00:06:14.000> Daniel<00:06:14.600> Lee<00:06:14.780> probably<00:06:15.320> the

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 
kicked his ass Daniel Lee probably the

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.620 
kicked his ass Daniel Lee probably the

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:26.040 
all in all a good play and I think that
we<00:06:23.090> can<00:06:23.240> definitely<00:06:23.810> wait<00:06:24.680> a<00:06:24.740> lot<00:06:25.010> more<00:06:25.430> from
