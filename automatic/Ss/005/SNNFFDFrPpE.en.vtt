bids<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.059> till<00:00:36.870> an<00:00:36.989> option<00:00:37.290> came<00:00:37.530> up<00:00:37.739> where

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
bids and till an option came up where

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.680 
bids and till an option came up where
there<00:00:38.430> wasn't<00:00:38.670> too<00:00:38.760> many<00:00:38.879> other<00:00:39.090> bidders<00:00:39.480> and

there wasn't too many other bidders and

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.360 
there wasn't too many other bidders and

so I got the low price so that's

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.410 
so I got the low price so that's
probably<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.760> way<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:41.940> go

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420

has<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.650> triple<00:01:13.920> layer<00:01:14.189> here<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:15.330> leathers

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
has a triple layer here so the leathers

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.359 
has a triple layer here so the leathers
fold<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.140> over<00:01:16.259> onto<00:01:16.650> itself<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.040> then<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.280> has

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
fold it over onto itself and then it has

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.039 
fold it over onto itself and then it has
an<00:01:17.460> extra<00:01:17.729> layer<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.000> leather<00:01:18.659> down<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
an extra layer of leather down the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.140 
an extra layer of leather down the
center<00:01:19.380> there<00:01:19.530> what<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.830> means<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.310> within

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
center there what that means is within

with light sandpaper when I got it just

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.030 
with light sandpaper when I got it just
take<00:02:00.450> off<00:02:00.630> just<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.439> bring<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.680> down<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> little

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
take off just to bring it down a little

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.469 
take off just to bring it down a little
bit<00:02:02.189> as<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.340> bit<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.490> an<00:02:02.640> open<00:02:02.729> sort<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.240> grain

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
inch now it weighs um 165 grams so there

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.550 
inch now it weighs um 165 grams so there
are<00:02:51.310> some<00:02:51.459> major<00:02:51.910> differences<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:53.230> this<00:02:53.319> model

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
are some major differences to this model

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.789 
are some major differences to this model
to<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.250> old<00:02:55.079> model<00:02:56.280> Condor<00:02:57.280> Bush<00:02:57.489> law<00:02:57.700> and

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
to the old model Condor Bush law and

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.849 
to the old model Condor Bush law and
main<00:02:59.799> differences<00:03:00.220> are<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:01.750> think<00:03:02.650> it<00:03:02.769> was

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
main differences are I think it was

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.860 
main differences are I think it was
almost<00:03:03.040> 5<00:03:03.489> mil<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.940> other<00:03:04.060> one<00:03:04.239> I<00:03:04.269> had<00:03:04.629> one<00:03:04.780> of

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
almost 5 mil the other one I had one of

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.330 
almost 5 mil the other one I had one of
the<00:03:04.930> other<00:03:05.049> ones<00:03:05.260> and<00:03:05.590> I<00:03:05.829> did<00:03:06.010> have<00:03:06.129> to<00:03:06.220> do<00:03:06.310> a

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
the other ones and I did have to do a

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.500 
the other ones and I did have to do a
lot<00:03:06.489> of<00:03:06.519> work<00:03:06.730> on<00:03:06.879> it<00:03:07.000> because<00:03:07.180> it<00:03:07.239> was<00:03:07.329> such<00:03:07.480> a

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
lot of work on it because it was such a

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.150 
lot of work on it because it was such a
thick<00:03:07.840> blade<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:09.280> other<00:03:09.400> difference<00:03:09.910> is<00:03:10.090> that

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
thick blade the other difference is that

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.280 
thick blade the other difference is that
the<00:03:12.160> grind<00:03:12.549> stopped<00:03:13.150> about<00:03:13.480> here<00:03:13.780> so<00:03:14.079> you<00:03:14.139> had

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
the grind stopped about here so you had

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.890 
the grind stopped about here so you had
all<00:03:14.410> of<00:03:14.440> this<00:03:14.620> area<00:03:14.859> here<00:03:15.569> there<00:03:16.569> was<00:03:16.690> a<00:03:16.720> non

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
all of this area here there was a non

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.199 
all of this area here there was a non
cutting<00:03:17.290> area<00:03:17.620> so<00:03:18.040> don't<00:03:18.700> know<00:03:18.760> why<00:03:18.790> they<00:03:19.060> did

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
cutting area so don't know why they did

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.190 
cutting area so don't know why they did
that<00:03:19.239> maybe<00:03:19.510> there<00:03:19.630> was<00:03:19.720> a<00:03:19.780> cost<00:03:19.930> cutting

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
that maybe there was a cost cutting

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.089 
that maybe there was a cost cutting
thing<00:03:20.440> but<00:03:20.590> it<00:03:20.650> was<00:03:20.739> one<00:03:20.829> of<00:03:20.859> the<00:03:20.980> big

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
thing but it was one of the big

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:22.379 
thing but it was one of the big
complaints<00:03:21.549> about<00:03:21.579> the<00:03:21.819> old<00:03:21.940> one<00:03:22.060> so<00:03:22.209> I<00:03:22.239> had<00:03:22.329> to

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
complaints about the old one so I had to

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:24.360 
complaints about the old one so I had to
do<00:03:22.510> a<00:03:22.540> lot<00:03:22.690> of<00:03:22.720> work<00:03:22.989> also<00:03:23.680> because<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.130> was<00:03:24.220> so

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
do a lot of work also because it was so

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.890 
do a lot of work also because it was so
thick<00:03:24.609> I<00:03:24.730> took<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:25.000> grind<00:03:25.239> all<00:03:25.419> the<00:03:25.569> way<00:03:25.690> back

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
thick I took the grind all the way back

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.509 
thick I took the grind all the way back
up<00:03:26.430> into<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:28.299> knife<00:03:28.450> itself<00:03:29.220> and<00:03:30.220> it's<00:03:30.370> just

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
up into the knife itself and it's just

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.009 
up into the knife itself and it's just
it's<00:03:30.730> just<00:03:30.760> always<00:03:31.030> felt<00:03:31.389> I've<00:03:31.510> passed<00:03:31.750> it<00:03:31.900> on

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
it's just always felt I've passed it on

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.780 
it's just always felt I've passed it on
to<00:03:32.169> someone<00:03:32.380> now<00:03:32.590> it's<00:03:32.709> always<00:03:32.829> felt<00:03:33.700> a<00:03:33.760> little

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
to someone now it's always felt a little

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.580 
to someone now it's always felt a little
bit<00:03:34.060> overkill<00:03:34.599> for<00:03:34.660> me<00:03:34.930> that<00:03:35.079> knife<00:03:35.230> it's<00:03:35.410> very

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
bit overkill for me that knife it's very

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.930 
bit overkill for me that knife it's very
very<00:03:35.739> thick<00:03:35.950> I<00:03:36.099> know<00:03:36.220> some<00:03:36.400> people<00:03:36.549> do<00:03:36.730> like

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
very thick I know some people do like

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.819 
very thick I know some people do like
them<00:03:37.120> and<00:03:37.239> if<00:03:37.329> you<00:03:37.450> you<00:03:37.630> know<00:03:37.750> you<00:03:38.200> can<00:03:38.349> do<00:03:38.470> very

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
them and if you you know you can do very

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.409 
them and if you you know you can do very
very<00:03:39.280> heavy<00:03:39.579> work<00:03:39.790> with<00:03:39.970> a<00:03:40.000> knife<00:03:40.180> then

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:40.419 
very heavy work with a knife then

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.569 
very heavy work with a knife then
something<00:03:41.139> like<00:03:41.260> that<00:03:41.410> maybe<00:03:41.650> it's<00:03:42.040> okay<00:03:42.340> but

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
something like that maybe it's okay but

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.039 
something like that maybe it's okay but
just<00:03:42.609> just<00:03:43.150> for<00:03:43.269> me<00:03:43.389> it<00:03:43.510> didn't<00:03:43.720> really<00:03:43.840> feel

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
just just for me it didn't really feel

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.870 
just just for me it didn't really feel
never<00:03:44.440> felt<00:03:44.709> too<00:03:44.919> great<00:03:45.190> for<00:03:45.370> doing<00:03:45.430> carving

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
never felt too great for doing carving

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.330 
never felt too great for doing carving
and<00:03:46.000> stuff<00:03:46.470> now<00:03:47.470> this<00:03:47.620> one<00:03:47.769> I<00:03:47.799> think<00:03:47.889> is<00:03:48.099> a<00:03:48.130> vast

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
and stuff now this one I think is a vast

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.860 
and stuff now this one I think is a vast
improvement<00:03:48.549> what<00:03:49.030> they've<00:03:49.180> done<00:03:49.359> the<00:03:49.599> finish

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
improvement what they've done the finish

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.610 
improvement what they've done the finish
is<00:03:49.989> much<00:03:50.169> better<00:03:50.349> also<00:03:52.200> know<00:03:53.200> a<00:03:53.230> couple<00:03:53.500> of

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
is much better also know a couple of

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.720 
is much better also know a couple of
things<00:03:53.739> the<00:03:53.919> other<00:03:54.040> difference<00:03:54.370> is<00:03:54.489> though<00:03:54.609> if

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
things the other difference is though if

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:55.979 
things the other difference is though if
you<00:03:54.790> want<00:03:54.879> to<00:03:55.000> identify<00:03:55.060> one<00:03:55.629> of<00:03:55.660> the<00:03:55.750> new<00:03:55.870> ones

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
you want to identify one of the new ones

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.650 
you want to identify one of the new ones
to<00:03:56.169> the<00:03:56.260> old<00:03:56.379> ones<00:03:56.500> just<00:03:56.590> looking<00:03:57.190> quickly<00:03:57.660> it

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
to the old ones just looking quickly it

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.150 
to the old ones just looking quickly it
has<00:03:58.780> condor<00:03:59.139> action<00:03:59.379> into<00:03:59.530> the<00:03:59.620> blade<00:03:59.799> along

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
has condor action into the blade along

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.670 
has condor action into the blade along
here<00:04:00.400> now<00:04:00.609> it<00:04:01.120> used<00:04:01.299> to<00:04:01.419> have<00:04:01.540> it<00:04:01.660> itched<00:04:01.870> along

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
here now it used to have it itched along

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.550 
here now it used to have it itched along
this<00:04:03.010> area<00:04:03.510> also<00:04:04.510> the<00:04:04.750> finish<00:04:05.019> is<00:04:05.139> much<00:04:05.349> much

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
this area also the finish is much much

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.770 
this area also the finish is much much
better<00:04:05.799> on<00:04:05.949> this<00:04:06.069> the<00:04:06.250> other<00:04:06.370> one<00:04:06.780> nothing

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
better on this the other one nothing

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.750 
better on this the other one nothing
really<00:04:07.900> fit<00:04:08.230> too<00:04:08.440> well<00:04:08.470> I<00:04:08.709> think<00:04:09.160> was<00:04:09.370> a<00:04:09.400> common

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
really fit too well I think was a common

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.539 
really fit too well I think was a common
complaint<00:04:10.000> for<00:04:10.329> people<00:04:11.069> yeah<00:04:12.069> things<00:04:12.430> were

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
complaint for people yeah things were

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.330 
complaint for people yeah things were
proud<00:04:12.940> that<00:04:13.620> just<00:04:14.620> nothing<00:04:14.980> was<00:04:15.099> really

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
proud that just nothing was really

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.130 
proud that just nothing was really
didn't<00:04:15.970> have<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.180> level<00:04:16.389> of<00:04:16.510> quality<00:04:16.870> control

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
didn't have the level of quality control

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.770 
didn't have the level of quality control
but<00:04:17.500> this<00:04:17.680> one<00:04:18.000> everything<00:04:19.000> is<00:04:19.180> completely

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
but this one everything is completely

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:20.729 
but this one everything is completely
smooth<00:04:20.200> to<00:04:20.409> touch

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
smooth to touch

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.890 
smooth to touch
and<00:04:20.949> it's<00:04:21.549> pretty<00:04:21.850> perfect<00:04:22.150> I<00:04:22.509> want<00:04:22.660> to<00:04:22.720> finish

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
and it's pretty perfect I want to finish

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.770 
and it's pretty perfect I want to finish
on<00:04:23.139> it<00:04:23.259> it's<00:04:25.020> this<00:04:26.020> is<00:04:26.199> in<00:04:26.319> focus<00:04:27.479> as<00:04:28.479> you<00:04:28.630> can

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
on it it's this is in focus as you can

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.040 
on it it's this is in focus as you can

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
see it's you know it's spot on I can't

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.300 
see it's you know it's spot on I can't
really<00:04:32.169> fault<00:04:32.470> that<00:04:32.620> at<00:04:32.710> all<00:04:32.860> and<00:04:33.009> it<00:04:33.069> feels

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
really fault that at all and it feels

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.600 
really fault that at all and it feels
great<00:04:33.520> in<00:04:33.759> the<00:04:33.789> hand<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:35.590> knife<00:04:35.710> itself<00:04:36.069> you

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
great in the hand the knife itself you

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.860 
great in the hand the knife itself you
do<00:04:36.729> have<00:04:36.849> to<00:04:36.940> kind<00:04:37.060> of<00:04:37.150> view<00:04:37.360> these<00:04:37.479> because<00:04:37.780> it

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
do have to kind of view these because it

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.589 
do have to kind of view these because it
is<00:04:37.900> a<00:04:38.099> cheaper<00:04:39.099> knife<00:04:39.250> and<00:04:39.550> they're<00:04:40.360> made<00:04:40.479> in

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:40.599 
is a cheaper knife and they're made in

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:41.909 
is a cheaper knife and they're made in
El<00:04:40.690> Salvador<00:04:41.229> and<00:04:41.319> the<00:04:41.380> quality<00:04:41.710> control

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
El Salvador and the quality control

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.650 
El Salvador and the quality control
isn't<00:04:42.160> all<00:04:42.370> there<00:04:42.550> and<00:04:42.789> to<00:04:43.180> be<00:04:43.300> honest<00:04:43.509> when<00:04:43.569> I

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
isn't all there and to be honest when I

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.719 
isn't all there and to be honest when I
got<00:04:43.840> this<00:04:43.990> you<00:04:44.949> have<00:04:45.069> to<00:04:45.190> think<00:04:45.340> of<00:04:45.400> it<00:04:45.490> as<00:04:45.580> like

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
got this you have to think of it as like

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.330 
got this you have to think of it as like
a<00:04:45.759> knife<00:04:46.000> blank<00:04:46.330> when<00:04:46.539> it<00:04:46.630> came<00:04:47.160> sorry<00:04:48.160> about

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
a knife blank when it came sorry about

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.510 
a knife blank when it came sorry about
that

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
that

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.450 
that
when<00:04:48.880> it<00:04:48.970> came<00:04:49.319> this<00:04:50.319> it<00:04:50.770> was<00:04:50.919> just<00:04:50.949> a<00:04:51.160> blunt

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
when it came this it was just a blunt

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.029 
when it came this it was just a blunt
knife<00:04:52.240> basically<00:04:52.930> and<00:04:53.349> he<00:04:53.680> said<00:04:53.830> it<00:04:53.919> had<00:04:54.009> a

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039 
knife basically and he said it had a

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:56.010 
knife basically and he said it had a
Scandinavian<00:04:54.729> grind<00:04:55.000> but<00:04:55.180> what<00:04:55.330> it<00:04:55.449> had<00:04:55.660> was<00:04:55.990> a

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
Scandinavian grind but what it had was a

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.600 
Scandinavian grind but what it had was a
Scandinavian<00:04:56.680> grind<00:04:56.919> with<00:04:57.039> like<00:04:57.160> a<00:04:57.190> secondary

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
Scandinavian grind with like a secondary

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.909 
Scandinavian grind with like a secondary
convex<00:04:58.060> grind<00:04:58.210> here<00:04:58.539> so<00:04:59.199> what<00:04:59.320> I've<00:04:59.410> done<00:04:59.650> put

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
convex grind here so what I've done put

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:01.560 
convex grind here so what I've done put
quite<00:05:00.070> a<00:05:00.130> lot<00:05:00.280> of<00:05:00.310> work<00:05:00.520> in<00:05:00.729> not<00:05:00.910> really

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
quite a lot of work in not really

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.659 
quite a lot of work in not really
profile<00:05:02.080> this<00:05:02.349> completely<00:05:02.919> so<00:05:03.250> it's<00:05:03.400> a<00:05:03.520> flat

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
profile this completely so it's a flat

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.089 
profile this completely so it's a flat
bevel<00:05:04.120> Scandinavian<00:05:04.900> grind<00:05:05.229> the<00:05:05.800> other<00:05:05.919> thing

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:06.099 
bevel Scandinavian grind the other thing

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:07.980 
bevel Scandinavian grind the other thing

a<00:05:29.110> bit<00:05:29.289> of<00:05:29.320> work<00:05:29.500> on<00:05:29.680> I've<00:05:29.800> also<00:05:29.949> put<00:05:30.250> a<00:05:30.280> bit<00:05:30.430> of

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
a bit of work on I've also put a bit of

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.159 
a bit of work on I've also put a bit of
a<00:05:30.610> flattened<00:05:31.509> that<00:05:31.599> off<00:05:31.720> a<00:05:31.750> bit<00:05:31.990> there<00:05:32.139> so

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
a flattened that off a bit there so

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:35.129 
a flattened that off a bit there so
it'll<00:05:32.530> shoot<00:05:32.800> a<00:05:32.919> spark<00:05:33.250> off<00:05:33.460> a<00:05:33.690> steel<00:05:34.690> a<00:05:34.720> little

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.139 
it'll shoot a spark off a steel a little

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:37.860 
it'll shoot a spark off a steel a little
bit<00:05:35.259> easier<00:05:36.090> and<00:05:37.090> all<00:05:37.300> I've<00:05:37.449> done<00:05:37.479> here<00:05:37.630> is

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
bit easier and all I've done here is

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.110 
bit easier and all I've done here is
yeah<00:05:37.990> just<00:05:38.229> gave<00:05:38.380> it<00:05:38.500> a<00:05:38.530> very<00:05:38.680> light<00:05:38.860> sand<00:05:39.250> but

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
yeah just gave it a very light sand but

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.409 
yeah just gave it a very light sand but
what<00:05:40.419> we've<00:05:40.570> got<00:05:40.719> now<00:05:40.930> is<00:05:40.960> I<00:05:41.590> think<00:05:42.490> a<00:05:42.849> really

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
what we've got now is I think a really

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.350 
what we've got now is I think a really
decent<00:05:43.599> knife<00:05:43.960> it's<00:05:44.289> um<00:05:44.880> feels<00:05:45.880> completely

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
decent knife it's um feels completely

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.610 
decent knife it's um feels completely
different<00:05:46.449> it's<00:05:46.840> much<00:05:46.930> lighter<00:05:47.199> than<00:05:47.469> the

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
different it's much lighter than the

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.709 
different it's much lighter than the
other<00:05:47.770> one<00:05:47.979> and<00:05:48.400> they're<00:05:49.330> saying<00:05:49.539> you<00:05:49.659> know

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:49.719 
other one and they're saying you know

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:51.390 
other one and they're saying you know
it's<00:05:49.930> a<00:05:50.050> it's<00:05:50.229> a<00:05:50.320> wood<00:05:50.500> law<00:05:50.680> clone<00:05:50.979> I<00:05:51.009> mean<00:05:51.310> the

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
it's a it's a wood law clone I mean the

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.740 
it's a it's a wood law clone I mean the
fact<00:05:51.610> that<00:05:51.639> they've<00:05:51.849> chosen<00:05:52.090> the<00:05:52.330> name<00:05:52.479> Bush

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
fact that they've chosen the name Bush

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.420 
fact that they've chosen the name Bush
law<00:05:52.990> is<00:05:53.110> obviously<00:05:53.440> to<00:05:53.590> keep<00:05:53.740> the<00:05:53.889> wood<00:05:54.039> law<00:05:54.219> in

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
law is obviously to keep the wood law in

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.279 
law is obviously to keep the wood law in
mind<00:05:54.639> it's<00:05:55.210> not<00:05:55.419> really<00:05:55.599> a<00:05:55.630> wood<00:05:55.810> law<00:05:55.960> clone<00:05:56.259> I

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:56.289 
mind it's not really a wood law clone I

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:57.930 
mind it's not really a wood law clone I
mean<00:05:56.530> there's<00:05:56.710> a<00:05:56.770> wood<00:05:57.099> laws<00:05:57.280> of<00:05:57.430> wood<00:05:57.550> law<00:05:57.759> you

tested it a fair bit and with the

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.520 
tested it a fair bit and with the
resurfacing<00:06:36.500> that<00:06:36.890> I've<00:06:36.980> done<00:06:38.200> it's<00:06:39.200> come<00:06:39.410> up

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:39.530 
resurfacing that I've done it's come up

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.080 
resurfacing that I've done it's come up
really<00:06:39.800> you<00:06:40.070> know<00:06:40.190> it's<00:06:40.430> come<00:06:40.580> up<00:06:40.670> quit<00:06:40.850> I<00:06:40.940> just

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.150 
really you know it's come up quit I just
get<00:06:41.180> a<00:06:41.210> bit<00:06:41.330> of<00:06:41.420> paper<00:06:41.600> and<00:06:41.870> show<00:06:42.050> you<00:06:42.110> now<00:06:42.980> this

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 
get a bit of paper and show you now this

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.830 
get a bit of paper and show you now this
will<00:06:43.280> probably<00:06:43.430> need<00:06:43.910> I<00:06:43.970> have<00:06:44.360> used<00:06:44.600> it<00:06:44.750> quite

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 
will probably need I have used it quite

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.390 
will probably need I have used it quite
a<00:06:44.930> bit<00:06:45.020> so<00:06:45.290> probably<00:06:45.560> just<00:06:45.650> a<00:06:45.950> little<00:06:46.190> bit<00:06:46.280> of

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
a bit so probably just a little bit of

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.760 
a bit so probably just a little bit of
aid<00:06:47.090> you<00:06:47.180> were<00:06:47.360> put<00:06:47.660> on<00:06:47.780> it<00:06:47.930> but<00:06:48.110> you<00:06:48.410> know<00:06:49.060> it's

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:50.770 
aid you were put on it but you know it's

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.990 
aid you were put on it but you know it's
obviously<00:06:51.770> there<00:06:51.980> sweet<00:06:52.280> spots<00:06:52.580> in<00:06:52.730> the<00:06:52.790> blade

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.000 
obviously there sweet spots in the blade

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.730
