of<00:02:37.530> surface<00:02:38.069> boundary<00:02:38.550> comes<00:02:38.910> in<00:02:39.120> here<00:02:39.390> but

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
of surface boundary comes in here but

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.400 
of surface boundary comes in here but
there's<00:02:40.319> no<00:02:40.530> upper<00:02:40.890> support<00:02:42.019> the<00:02:43.019> air<00:02:43.200> is

relatively stable with warm air aloft
and<00:02:45.810> really<00:02:46.230> I<00:02:46.470> don't<00:02:46.739> expect<00:02:47.370> much<00:02:47.549> more<00:02:47.610> than

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
and really I don't expect much more than

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.789 
and really I don't expect much more than
widely<00:02:48.480> scattered<00:02:48.540> showers<00:02:49.350> I<00:02:49.530> think<00:02:49.739> a

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
widely scattered showers I think a

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.710 
widely scattered showers I think a
decent<00:02:50.220> part<00:02:50.400> of<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.580> day<00:02:50.730> tomorrow<00:02:50.940> will<00:02:51.600> be

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
decent part of the day tomorrow will be

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.650 
decent part of the day tomorrow will be
dry<00:02:52.019> this<00:02:52.080> is<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.709> high<00:02:53.640> res<00:02:53.910> name<00:02:54.269> the<00:02:54.480> four

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
dry this is the high res name the four

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.300 
dry this is the high res name the four
kilometer<00:02:55.170> name<00:02:55.350> at<00:02:55.500> seven<00:02:55.799> o'clock<00:02:55.890> not

showing<00:02:56.670> much<00:02:56.850> at<00:02:57.030> all<00:02:57.150> so<00:02:57.569> we'll<00:02:58.500> say<00:02:58.650> a

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
showing much at all so we'll say a

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.320 
showing much at all so we'll say a
mixture<00:02:59.040> of<00:02:59.130> clouds<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.610> sunshine<00:02:59.910> with

widely<00:03:00.660> scattered<00:03:00.959> showers<00:03:01.830> tomorrow<00:03:02.360> and

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
widely scattered showers tomorrow and

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.559 
widely scattered showers tomorrow and
again<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.720> high<00:03:03.840> should<00:03:04.049> be<00:03:04.140> in<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.349> mid<00:03:04.500> 80s

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
again the high should be in the mid 80s

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.780 
again the high should be in the mid 80s
Wednesday<00:03:06.569> we<00:03:06.930> get<00:03:07.170> into<00:03:07.410> dry<00:03:07.739> air<00:03:08.010> Wednesday

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
Wednesday we get into dry air Wednesday

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.400 
Wednesday we get into dry air Wednesday
should<00:03:08.970> feature<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.299> good<00:03:09.510> supply<00:03:09.810> of<00:03:09.840> sunshine

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
should feature a good supply of sunshine

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.490 
should feature a good supply of sunshine
with<00:03:10.590> mid<00:03:10.799> 80s<00:03:11.390> and<00:03:12.390> really<00:03:12.840> Thursday<00:03:13.290> looks

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
with mid 80s and really Thursday looks

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.240 
with mid 80s and really Thursday looks
pretty<00:03:13.830> dry<00:03:15.349> you<00:03:16.349> might<00:03:16.530> mention<00:03:16.769> a<00:03:16.980> slight

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
pretty dry you might mention a slight

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.740 
pretty dry you might mention a slight
chance<00:03:17.549> of<00:03:17.700> a<00:03:17.790> shower<00:03:17.820> but<00:03:18.329> this<00:03:18.570> is

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
chance of a shower but this is

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.580 
chance of a shower but this is
suggesting<00:03:19.410> not<00:03:19.709> really<00:03:20.160> necessary<00:03:21.590> partly

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
suggesting not really necessary partly

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.259 
suggesting not really necessary partly
sunny<00:03:22.620> with<00:03:23.070> mid<00:03:23.250> 80s<00:03:23.870> same<00:03:24.870> thing<00:03:25.109> on<00:03:25.260> Friday

so<00:03:27.269> really<00:03:27.420> after<00:03:27.980> tomorrow<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.280> chance<00:03:29.549> of

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
so really after tomorrow the chance of

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.400 
so really after tomorrow the chance of
rain<00:03:29.910> is<00:03:30.090> so<00:03:30.269> small<00:03:30.569> I<00:03:30.630> just<00:03:30.930> don't<00:03:31.109> think<00:03:31.290> it's

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
rain is so small I just don't think it's

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.559 
rain is so small I just don't think it's

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.660 
to the west let's hope that doesn't hold
up<00:05:07.410> through<00:05:07.620> the<00:05:07.710> summer<00:05:07.920> because<00:05:08.280> if<00:05:08.490> that

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
up through the summer because if that

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.520 
up through the summer because if that
does<00:05:08.910> get<00:05:09.120> could<00:05:09.480> be<00:05:09.630> pretty<00:05:09.810> nasty<00:05:10.080> around

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
does get could be pretty nasty around

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.500 
does get could be pretty nasty around
here<00:05:10.680> by<00:05:10.800> August<00:05:11.250> but<00:05:12.060> there's<00:05:12.210> plenty<00:05:12.270> of

here by August but there's plenty of
time<00:05:12.690> for<00:05:12.840> that<00:05:12.870> to<00:05:13.050> change<00:05:13.080> that's<00:05:13.800> it<00:05:13.920> for
