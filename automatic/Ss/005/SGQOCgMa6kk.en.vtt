00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
this is a limited edition one of three

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.850 
this is a limited edition one of three
thousand<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:34.550> believe<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:36.000> one's<00:00:36.770> remember

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.389 

try<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.920> be<00:00:41.070> very<00:00:41.309> careful<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:41.940> my<00:00:42.030> case<00:00:42.329> boxes

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
try to be very careful in my case boxes

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.600 
try to be very careful in my case boxes
because<00:00:44.399> as<00:00:45.059> most<00:00:45.360> people<00:00:45.809> matter<00:00:46.370> this<00:00:47.370> is

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
because as most people matter this is

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.569 
because as most people matter this is
where<00:00:47.850> nice<00:00:48.149> if<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.050> put<00:00:49.289> your<00:00:49.469> pasta<00:00:52.370> this<00:00:53.370> is

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
where nice if you put your pasta this is

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:07.490 
where nice if you put your pasta this is
my<00:00:54.289> GP<00:00:55.289> and<00:01:00.050> the<00:01:01.050> value<00:01:01.910> increases<00:01:06.229> this<00:01:07.229> is

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
my GP and the value increases this is

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.890 
my GP and the value increases this is
actually<00:01:08.310> an<00:01:08.490> unboxing<00:01:08.850> because<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:09.659> has

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
actually an unboxing because this has

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:19.120 
actually an unboxing because this has
never<00:01:10.439> been<00:01:11.130> opened<00:01:11.340> before<00:01:12.110> so

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.160 

this<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.310> beautiful

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
this is beautiful

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.210 
this is beautiful
I've<00:01:22.170> had<00:01:22.440> this<00:01:22.620> knife<00:01:22.920> here<00:01:23.310> for<00:01:23.700> about<00:01:24.030> a

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
I've had this knife here for about a

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.730 
I've had this knife here for about a
year<00:01:26.220> but<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.630> reason<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.170> one<00:01:28.350> hasn't<00:01:28.530> been

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
year but the reason this one hasn't been

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.300 
year but the reason this one hasn't been
opened<00:01:29.190> is<00:01:29.970> because<00:01:30.540> when<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.320> bought<00:01:31.680> them<00:01:31.920> we

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
opened is because when I bought them we

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.870 
opened is because when I bought them we
bought<00:01:32.550> three<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.390> them<00:01:33.950> one<00:01:34.950> for<00:01:35.010> me<00:01:35.340> one<00:01:35.850> for

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.060 
and amber was produced in the 13th knife
they<00:02:57.190> made<00:02:58.440> so<00:02:59.440> they're<00:02:59.950> handcrafted<00:03:00.340> since

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
they made so they're handcrafted since

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.690 
they made so they're handcrafted since
1889<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:05.530> see<00:03:05.800> if<00:03:05.860> we<00:03:06.010> can't<00:03:06.280> get<00:03:06.400> y'all<00:03:06.670> a

better view of this barn amber you get a

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:23.670 
better view of this barn amber you get a
little<00:03:11.380> focus<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:20.290> patterns<00:03:22.140> are<00:03:23.140> always

little focus the patterns are always

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.970 
little focus the patterns are always

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
one of them is handcrafted so like if
