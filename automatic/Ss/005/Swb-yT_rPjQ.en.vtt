00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
so in this section we'll be looking at

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.570 
so in this section we'll be looking at
settings<00:00:06.809> that<00:00:07.080> you<00:00:07.109> can<00:00:07.349> apply<00:00:07.559> to<00:00:07.649> your<00:00:07.919> DSLR

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
settings that you can apply to your DSLR

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.459 
settings that you can apply to your DSLR
before<00:00:09.389> you<00:00:09.510> actually<00:00:09.660> go<00:00:09.959> into<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.289> field

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
before you actually go into the field

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.670 
before you actually go into the field
just<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:10.950> make<00:00:11.519> sure<00:00:11.549> that<00:00:11.910> you<00:00:12.030> get<00:00:12.180> the<00:00:12.360> best

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:12.680 
just to make sure that you get the best

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.920 
just to make sure that you get the best
possible<00:00:13.680> image<00:00:14.160> out<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.639> your<00:00:14.879> DSLR<00:00:15.270> for<00:00:15.779> the

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:15.930 
possible image out of your DSLR for the

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.779 
possible image out of your DSLR for the
later<00:00:16.109> grading<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:16.830> color<00:00:17.130> or<00:00:17.340> in<00:00:17.400> front<00:00:17.730> of

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
later grading in color or in front of

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.120 
later grading in color or in front of
that<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.240> so<00:00:19.230> here<00:00:19.410> I've<00:00:19.470> got<00:00:19.529> an<00:00:19.710> image<00:00:19.859> of

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
that and so here I've got an image of

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.599 
that and so here I've got an image of
the<00:00:20.609> dsi<00:00:21.269> we<00:00:21.419> used<00:00:21.630> which<00:00:21.839> is<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:21.990> canon<00:00:22.410> t2i<00:00:23.070> or

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609

the dsi we used which is a canon t2i or
Canon<00:00:24.269> 550d<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.339> and<00:00:26.339> as<00:00:26.429> you<00:00:26.550> can<00:00:26.699> see<00:00:26.730> we

went into the picture style settings and
into<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.329> neutral<00:00:30.720> settings<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.890> change

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160

change them with it I'm just going to

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.900 
change them with it I'm just going to
show<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.960> why<00:00:34.440> we<00:00:34.649> did<00:00:34.800> this<00:00:34.950> no<00:00:35.670> here<00:00:35.850> I've

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
show you why we did this no here I've

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.870 
show you why we did this no here I've
got<00:00:35.970> an<00:00:36.180> image<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.720> comes<00:00:37.410> up<00:00:37.620> on<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.610> on<00:00:38.820> the

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:38.880 
got an image that comes up on the on the

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.180 
got an image that comes up on the on the
back<00:00:39.060> of<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.450> DSLR<00:00:39.900> which<00:00:40.050> shows<00:00:40.650> you<00:00:40.680> how<00:00:41.130> the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
back of the DSLR which shows you how the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.430 
back of the DSLR which shows you how the
whites<00:00:42.000> are<00:00:42.450> clipped<00:00:42.720> on<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.140> histogram

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
whites are clipped on this histogram

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.440 
whites are clipped on this histogram
here<00:00:43.590> on<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.160> right<00:00:44.310> side<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:45.120> see<00:00:45.330> this

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
here on the right side you see this

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.780 
here on the right side you see this
Speight<00:00:46.080> white<00:00:46.500> line<00:00:46.740> which<00:00:46.950> represents<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
Speight white line which represents the

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.720 
Speight white line which represents the
white<00:00:48.120> sky<00:00:48.600> here<00:00:48.870> on<00:00:48.960> top<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.460> so<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.610> is

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
white sky here on top and so this is

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.300 
white sky here on top and so this is
overexposed<00:00:51.330> which<00:00:51.840> means<00:00:52.080> there's<00:00:52.530> no

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.310 
overexposed which means there's no

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.280 
overexposed which means there's no
information<00:00:53.970> in<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.600> part<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.200> image

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
information in this part of the image

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.190 
information in this part of the image
which<00:00:56.250> makes<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:57.030> impossible<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.600> work<00:00:58.140> with

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
which makes it impossible to work with

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.070 
which makes it impossible to work with
in<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.490> the<00:00:59.850> color<00:01:00.120> sweet<00:01:00.420> on<00:01:00.540> Final<00:01:00.960> Cut

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
in the in the color sweet on Final Cut

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.230 
in the in the color sweet on Final Cut
Pro<00:01:01.140> em<00:01:01.470> in<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.010> color<00:01:02.220> grading<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:02.880> ideally

Pro em in the color grading so ideally

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.899 
Pro em in the color grading so ideally
what<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.510> what<00:01:03.810> you're<00:01:03.960> aiming<00:01:04.079> for<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.589> and

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
what you what you're aiming for is and

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.600 
what you what you're aiming for is and
to<00:01:05.909> expose<00:01:06.420> your<00:01:06.689> image<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.009> doesn't

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
to expose your image and so it doesn't

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.120 
to expose your image and so it doesn't
clip<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.000> whites<00:01:09.210> which<00:01:09.810> mr.<00:01:10.590> Casey<00:01:10.770> so

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
clip the whites which mr. Casey so

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.130 
clip the whites which mr. Casey so
specially<00:01:11.730> the<00:01:11.850> same<00:01:12.030> image<00:01:12.330> properly

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
specially the same image properly

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.810 
specially the same image properly
exposed<00:01:13.970> without<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.300> white<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.480> flipping<00:01:15.930> so

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
exposed without the white is flipping so

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.790 
exposed without the white is flipping so
it<00:01:17.820> spikes<00:01:18.150> here<00:01:18.450> but<00:01:18.780> as<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.440> can<00:01:19.560> see<00:01:19.680> it

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
it spikes here but as you can see it

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.530 
it spikes here but as you can see it
comes<00:01:20.040> down<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.610> curve<00:01:20.820> it's<00:01:21.060> not<00:01:21.210> just<00:01:21.390> a

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
comes down in a curve it's not just a

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.300 
comes down in a curve it's not just a
line<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.990> goes<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.530> edge<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.040> inside

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
line that goes to the edge of the inside

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.950 
line that goes to the edge of the inside
of<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.550> histogram<00:01:23.940> in<00:01:24.120> and<00:01:24.300> cuts<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.870> off

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
of the histogram in and cuts it off

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.899 
of the histogram in and cuts it off
which<00:01:25.620> means<00:01:25.650> we've<00:01:26.130> got<00:01:26.159> something<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.760> work

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
which means we've got something to work

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.880 
which means we've got something to work
with<00:01:26.940> the<00:01:27.300> end<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.570> color<00:01:27.840> because<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.620> end<00:01:28.770> of

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
with the end in color because the end of

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.110 
with the end in color because the end of
the<00:01:28.979> histogram<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.430> actually<00:01:29.820> right<00:01:30.060> here

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
the histogram is actually right here

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.360 
the histogram is actually right here
where<00:01:30.720> my<00:01:30.750> hand<00:01:31.050> is<00:01:31.140> not<00:01:31.350> it's<00:01:31.770> not<00:01:31.920> over<00:01:32.159> here

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
where my hand is not it's not over here

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.010 
where my hand is not it's not over here
for<00:01:33.030> this<00:01:33.090> compare<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.570> took<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.870> one

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
for this compare that took the one

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.160 
for this compare that took the one
before<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.620> see<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.790> spike<00:01:36.060> there<00:01:36.360> also

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
before and see the spike there also

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.390 
before and see the spike there also
indicated<00:01:37.650> by<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.860> black<00:01:38.330> in<00:01:39.440> the<00:01:40.440> sky<00:01:40.650> means

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
indicated by the black in the sky means

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.310 
indicated by the black in the sky means
that's<00:01:41.580> club<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.150> just<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.659> properly<00:01:42.960> expose

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
that's club and just the properly expose

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.969 
that's club and just the properly expose
one<00:01:44.270> looks<00:01:45.270> like<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:46.380> what<00:01:46.530> we<00:01:46.620> did<00:01:46.770> we

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
one looks like that so what we did we

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.830 
one looks like that so what we did we
went<00:01:47.130> into<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.490> picture<00:01:48.210> style<00:01:48.450> settings

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
went into the picture style settings

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.960
