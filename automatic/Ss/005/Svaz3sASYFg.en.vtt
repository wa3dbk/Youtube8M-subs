 something incredible happened to the shore 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.120
 threw one of the most mysterious fish

 the snake of this monster has many names

 unique fish according to ichthyologists 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.170
 can be up to 20 meters in length, most 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.039
 unbelievable in the middle king is his 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.980
 structure 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.590
 this is the world's longest bone fish you 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.660
 just think how elastic and 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.059
 flexible must be a skeleton of such 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.939
 animal according to scientists catch 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.010
 single king is almost impossible he 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.729
 lives on the bottom and rarely pops up on 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.950
 surface 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.560
 the giant moves with data 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.560
 currents and in the hands of people only 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.600
 then when he is thrown ashore 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.090
 can be counted on the fingers of the case 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.130
 when the sea â€‹â€‹serpent hit us and how 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.110
 the rule we find only dead individuals 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.780
 this is a little studied fish 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.369
 We are of course well-known and physiology but 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.130
 some aspect of life so far 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.560
 mystery is not clear for example exactly how 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.570
 such fish are generally preserved as species 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.909
 because with their length and dependence on 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.939
 currents they must be easy prey 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.950
 for predators scant information sitting house 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.939
 King and his unusual appearance 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.280
 spawned 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.649
 a huge number of legends ichthyologists 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.459
 suggest that ancient marine myths 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.319
 monsters 

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:57.299
 connected with this creature now 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.310
 giant fish sent to one of 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.319
 los angeles laboratories she is alive 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.110
 so scientists expect to get 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.709
 new information about the life and habits of these 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.470
