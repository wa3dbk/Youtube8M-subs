00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
then you can add four weeks of that

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.410 
then you can add four weeks of that
before<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.190> give<00:00:38.339> that<00:00:38.550> following<00:00:39.030> booster

six months before they given the rabies

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.020 
six months before they given the rabies
vaccine<00:01:07.530> some<00:01:08.130> people<00:01:08.369> will<00:01:08.490> give<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.700> earlier

vaccine some people will give it earlier

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.539 
vaccine some people will give it earlier
I<00:01:09.899> think<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:10.920> better<00:01:11.040> for<00:01:11.159> their<00:01:11.340> immune

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
I think it's better for their immune

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.069 
I think it's better for their immune
