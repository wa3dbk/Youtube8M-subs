warfare two mono work for two so um yeah

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.440 
warfare two mono work for two so um yeah
I<00:03:16.169> think<00:03:16.319> that's<00:03:16.620> it<00:03:17.120> most<00:03:18.120> of<00:03:18.329> you<00:03:18.419> probably

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
I think that's it most of you probably

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.270 
I think that's it most of you probably
got<00:03:18.840> black<00:03:19.049> ops<00:03:19.230> 2<00:03:19.470> today<00:03:19.769> for<00:03:20.280> Christmas<00:03:20.730> so

got black ops 2 today for Christmas so

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.860 
got black ops 2 today for Christmas so
that's<00:03:23.280> why<00:03:23.459> I'm<00:03:23.609> only<00:03:23.760> asking<00:03:24.269> for<00:03:24.299> four<00:03:24.840> or

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
that's why I'm only asking for four or

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.770 
that's why I'm only asking for four or
more<00:03:25.260> black<00:03:25.560> ops<00:03:25.799> 2<00:03:25.980> trick<00:03:26.190> shots<00:03:26.400> for<00:03:26.579> now

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
more black ops 2 trick shots for now

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.059 
more black ops 2 trick shots for now
maybe<00:03:27.780> later<00:03:28.109> i'm<00:03:28.380> going<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.709> change<00:03:28.919> it

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
maybe later i'm going to change it

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.650 
maybe later i'm going to change it
higher<00:03:29.220> so<00:03:29.639> if<00:03:29.790> i<00:03:29.940> were<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.060> i<00:03:30.150> go<00:03:30.389> ahead<00:03:30.510> and

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
higher so if i were you i go ahead and

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.180 
higher so if i were you i go ahead and
start<00:03:31.200> getting<00:03:31.349> clips<00:03:31.709> on<00:03:31.859> that<00:03:32.329> i<00:03:34.190> think

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
start getting clips on that i think

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.479 
start getting clips on that i think
that's<00:03:35.430> really<00:03:35.910> all<00:03:36.180> I<00:03:36.209> have<00:03:36.419> to<00:03:36.569> stay<00:03:37.489> don't

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
that's really all I have to stay don't

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.759 
that's really all I have to stay don't
forget<00:03:38.760> to<00:03:38.970> like<00:03:39.150> my<00:03:39.180> episode<00:03:39.810> 5<00:03:40.139> it<00:03:40.620> was<00:03:40.739> a

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.110 
forget to like my episode 5 it was a
Christmas<00:03:41.069> special<00:03:41.310> i<00:03:41.639> think<00:03:41.849> it<00:03:41.910> was<00:03:42.000> pretty

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120
