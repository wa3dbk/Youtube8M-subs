00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.200
 Hello everyone 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.960
 Every year at the end of the year 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.680
 Often everyone will have some Christmas parties 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.120
 Or this New Year’s party 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.240
 Do you have such an opportunity? 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.220
 Is it time to join these parties? 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.830
 This activity requires you 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.360
 Prepare one or two snacks? 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.373
 Then we feel 

00:00:22.373 --> 00:00:24.060
 It’s a headache to make it yourself. 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.680
 In this busy business and industry society喔

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.420
 What method does Mom and Dad use? 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.260
 Easy to make 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.180
 These party snacks 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.180
 I am going to share one today. 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.100
 Muffin Cup Cake 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.360
 Cup cakes have been popular in Taiwan for a while 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.660
 But the taste has different formulas. 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.320
 Some are solid and some are soft. 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.300
 Then the first thing I want to share today is 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.840
 More solid Muffin cup cake 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.180
 Other kinds of recipes for this cup cake 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.120
 We will introduce you again next time. 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.780
 This muffin cup cake is eaten up 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.420
 Milky and full-bodied 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.720
 I like it very much. 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.420
 That the whole process 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.880
 How to make this muffin cup cake 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.320
 Let's take a look together 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.700
 First to prepare the materials 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.380
 We have prepared these two whole eggs. 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.860
 The other is this low-gluten flour 喔

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.180
 We have to prepare this 220 grams 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.111
 Then we are after 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.160
 To sift this low-gluten flour 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.240
 Ok, brother, you have to see 喔

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.440
 Ok, then you have to be quiet. 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.740
 This is this baking powder 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.180
 Two tsp of baking powder 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.900
 We prepare this fresh milk, full fat fresh milk 80C.C 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.880
 This lollipop, or you use a granulated sugar 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.580
 We are preparing 100 grams 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.280
 Isometric, 100 grams of this cream 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.900
 To understand the sweetness of the cup cake 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.900
 We have to add 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.480
 Such a spoonful of salt 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.950
 We will put it directly 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.840
 Inside of this low-gluten flour 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.660
 This baking powder, with low-gluten flour, and this salt 喔

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.040
 We all have a sieve 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.260
 Then we are general 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.140
 It would be better to sift twice. 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.240
 It’s the first time 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.170
 Let's put this again at room temperature 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.600
 Butter that has been slightly softened 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.760
 Sugar should be divided into several times 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.180
 Send this cream 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.700
 We will hit this way 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.160
 The entire state of the cream 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.700
 Then the sugar is melted in this 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.400
 This cream is inside 喔

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.900
 Now such a state 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.600
 We have to take this egg in grades. 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.740
 You can take two or three times. 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.280
 We don’t want to stir it all in one brain. 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.160
 Will not succeed 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.584
 Every time we put it in 

00:03:16.584 --> 00:03:18.320
 Have to hit it evenly 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.400
 Blended together, no separation 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.700
 Let's add another time 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.120
 Eggs go in three times 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.920
 Then we continue 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.720
 The second round of integration 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.040
 Probably like this 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.224
 Then we can continue 

00:03:36.224 --> 00:03:38.100
 Put the last egg 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.560
 Then we have to prepare to mix low-gluten flour 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.980
 With this milk 喔

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.300
 At this time, let's preheat the oven first. 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.920
 Is the temperature of 180 degrees 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.720
 Let's warm it up first 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.880
 Put half of the powder first 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.620
 Sift twice the powder 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.920
 Half first join 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.380
 At this time we use the way of pressing 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.240
 Don't overdo this mixing 喔

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.600
 Because we are afraid that it will be ribbed 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.560
 We use the way of pressing 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.260
 Even with cut 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.540
 That is, we don’t want it to produce a lot of tendons. 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.300
 At this time, put half of the milk again. 

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.840
 Join again 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.980
 Feeling like a feeling of cut, the way of pressing 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.940
 Ok, then we will pour the remaining powder again. 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.320
 Remember to use this cut way喔

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.580
 Then you can put the last milk in. 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.480
 Try not to use a blender at this time. 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.400
 Because the mixing opportunity makes this gluten 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.746
 Then this cake will not have 

00:04:47.746 --> 00:04:49.760
 This soft feeling 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.920
 Will become this tendon 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.980
 The cake paste has been mixed 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.780
 In order to make the meeting better 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.560
 We are looking for a simple, clean plastic bag 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.160
 We put this batter through 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.260
 Both fell in this plastic bag 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.140
 What are our filled batters? 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.020
 Made in this way, this will be better squeezed 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:18.720
 Let's cut this scissors again. 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.020
 Because this batter is a bit more paste 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.980
 So we may have to be a little 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.200
 Let it be smoothed out 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.380
 180 degrees of warm-up has arrived. 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.940
 Then we put the cakes in. 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.160
 Then I am using a baking mold. 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.680
 Ok, then we have to prepare for 25 minutes. 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.060
 Then we will start 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.680
 Time is up, let’s see how it’s baked. 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.580
 There are probably more than 10 minutes left now. 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.740
 We can observe this time. 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.060
 What is the color inside? 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.380
 Then let me pause it first. 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.360
 Ok, let's take a look. 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.820
 Like my stove, it is also in the rear. 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.820
 It seems that the color is a bit darker. 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.000
 So I may have to adjust it. 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.080
 Its location 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.200
 Then I put this whole baking tray 

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:17.320
 Falling in one direction 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.240
 Let the inside become this outside 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.980
 Then we continue this 10 minutes? 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.160
 We will continue to let it complete this trip. 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.400
 Like this just put the color inside 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.840
 It’s very deep 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.420
 Ok, then let's adjust its position a little. 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.120
 Put the rest of the trip, 10 minutes to finish running 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.380
 Time is up 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.120
 We put all the cup cakes 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.000
 Moved out of the oven 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.240
 This is what we are demonstrating for you today. 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.240
 Basic muffin cake 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.480
 Very simple muffin cake 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.440
 It’s worth your weekend to try it out 喔
