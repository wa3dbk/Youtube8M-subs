00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
testing over at sony us now here's what

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.410 
testing over at sony us now here's what
I'm<00:00:28.439> thinking<00:00:28.980> this<00:00:29.160> is<00:00:29.250> my<00:00:29.369> prediction<00:00:29.640> here

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
I'm thinking this is my prediction here

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.260 
I'm thinking this is my prediction here
my<00:00:31.140> prediction<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.099> perhaps<00:00:32.579> maybe

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
my prediction is that perhaps maybe

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.979 
my prediction is that perhaps maybe
possibly<00:00:34.079> Sony<00:00:35.010> us<00:00:35.550> was<00:00:36.270> thinking<00:00:36.719> somewhere

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
possibly Sony us was thinking somewhere

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.080 
possibly Sony us was thinking somewhere
along<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.559> lines<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:38.100> releasing<00:00:38.670> this<00:00:38.820> for

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
along the lines of releasing this for

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.260 
along the lines of releasing this for
Christmas<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.920> then<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.640> when<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> Europe<00:00:42.090> was

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
Christmas and then so when a Europe was

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.360 
Christmas and then so when a Europe was
like<00:00:42.480> yeah<00:00:42.930> we're<00:00:43.230> kind<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.530> done<00:00:43.710> testing<00:00:44.190> so

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
like yeah we're kind of done testing so

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.190 
like yeah we're kind of done testing so
we're<00:00:44.489> gonna<00:00:44.579> release<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:45.210> like<00:00:45.510> right<00:00:46.050> this

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
we're gonna release this like right this

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.380 
we're gonna release this like right this
very<00:00:46.260> second<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.280> think<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.820> was<00:00:47.940> something

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
very second so I think it was something

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.479 
very second so I think it was something
like<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:49.020> in<00:00:49.170> my<00:00:49.410> mind<00:00:49.440> I'm<00:00:50.039> still

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
like that so in my mind I'm still

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.569 
like that so in my mind I'm still
thinking<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.600> title<00:00:52.170> update<00:00:52.320> 19<00:00:52.920> might<00:00:53.309> be

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
thinking that title update 19 might be

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.510 
thinking that title update 19 might be
out<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:53.789> Christmas<00:00:54.360> Day<00:00:54.840> however<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:56.280> also

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
out on Christmas Day however I also

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.389 
out on Christmas Day however I also
think<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.780> very<00:00:58.170> possible<00:00:58.559> for<00:00:59.309> it

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
think that this is very possible for it

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.189 
think that this is very possible for it
to<00:00:59.430> come<00:00:59.609> out<00:00:59.730> before<00:01:00.030> Christmas<00:01:00.840> Day<00:01:01.020> because

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
to come out before Christmas Day because

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.479 
to come out before Christmas Day because
maybe<00:01:01.500> they're<00:01:01.770> thing<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.039> their<00:01:02.160> stuff<00:01:02.340> what

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
maybe they're thing to their stuff what

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.219 
maybe they're thing to their stuff what
dang<00:01:02.699> we<00:01:02.850> gotta<00:01:03.030> hurry<00:01:03.149> up<00:01:03.300> now<00:01:03.600> because<00:01:04.080> it's

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229
