00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:51.029 
me slick down so I used a slick down
slick<00:05:49.210> down<00:05:49.360> and<00:05:49.719> it<00:05:49.779> worked<00:05:49.990> and<00:05:50.680> I<00:05:50.800> did

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 
slick down and it worked and I did

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:54.420 
slick down and it worked and I did
notice<00:05:51.939> that<00:05:52.719> on<00:05:52.870> my<00:05:53.110> sides<00:05:53.409> and<00:05:53.919> like<00:05:54.129> on<00:05:54.279> this

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
notice that on my sides and like on this

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.469 
notice that on my sides and like on this
side<00:05:54.669> it's<00:05:54.939> very<00:05:55.060> frizzy<00:05:55.539> so<00:05:56.610> it<00:05:57.610> doesn't<00:05:57.969> look

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 
side it's very frizzy so it doesn't look

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:05.839 
side it's very frizzy so it doesn't look
that<00:05:58.569> good<00:06:01.469> all<00:06:02.469> right<00:06:02.710> what<00:06:03.490> you<00:06:04.210> did<00:06:04.419> okay

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:05.849 
that good all right what you did okay

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:07.950 
that good all right what you did okay
that's<00:06:06.849> like<00:06:06.969> I<00:06:07.029> tell<00:06:07.270> my<00:06:07.389> hair<00:06:07.569> is<00:06:07.629> not<00:06:07.779> dry

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
that's like I tell my hair is not dry

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.300 
that's like I tell my hair is not dry
yet<00:06:08.139> because<00:06:08.439> they<00:06:08.529> could<00:06:08.650> still<00:06:08.860> move<00:06:09.009> I

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
yet because they could still move I

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:12.480 
yet because they could still move I
think<00:06:10.229> but<00:06:11.229> I<00:06:11.259> did<00:06:11.469> I<00:06:11.620> did<00:06:11.860> use<00:06:12.069> this<00:06:12.219> a<00:06:12.279> little

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
think but I did I did use this a little

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.929 
think but I did I did use this a little
bit<00:06:12.699> and<00:06:13.860> it<00:06:14.860> seems<00:06:15.069> like<00:06:15.250> when<00:06:15.460> you<00:06:15.580> mix<00:06:15.789> it

00:06:15.929 --> 00:06:15.939 
bit and it seems like when you mix it

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:18.510 
bit and it seems like when you mix it
with<00:06:16.060> something<00:06:16.509> else<00:06:16.779> like<00:06:17.199> a<00:06:17.349> cream<00:06:17.830> it

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
with something else like a cream it

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.950 
with something else like a cream it
worked<00:06:18.789> a<00:06:18.939> little<00:06:19.029> bit<00:06:19.210> better<00:06:19.389> so<00:06:19.750> maybe

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
worked a little bit better so maybe

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.869 
worked a little bit better so maybe
that's<00:06:20.379> the<00:06:20.560> trick<00:06:20.770> with<00:06:20.949> this<00:06:21.069> for<00:06:21.339> me<00:06:21.490> and

00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:21.879 
that's the trick with this for me and

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:24.599 
that's the trick with this for me and
you<00:06:22.000> know<00:06:22.120> that<00:06:22.149> grows
