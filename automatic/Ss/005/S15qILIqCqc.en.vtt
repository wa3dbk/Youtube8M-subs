00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
folks whatever the two books around the

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.729 
folks whatever the two books around the
way<00:00:59.820> exactly<00:01:00.359> they<00:01:00.780> are<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> end

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
way exactly they are but in the end

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.910 
way exactly they are but in the end
you're<00:01:02.010> going<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.219> have<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:03.619> write<00:01:04.619> and

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
you're going to have to write and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.370 
you're going to have to write and
determine<00:01:05.489> whether<00:01:06.090> those<00:01:06.390> match<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.609 
determine whether those match the
consistency<00:01:08.070> okay<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.270> then<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:10.380> said

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
consistency okay and so then you said

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.109 
consistency okay and so then you said
that<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.920> thought<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.520> people<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.880> wrote

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
that the thought the people that wrote

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.230 
that the thought the people that wrote
like<00:01:12.659> puts<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.860> Catholic<00:01:14.549> Christian<00:01:15.119> Bob
