00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.870
 the sad clown also known as 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:13.139
 sony the tragic clown was introduced 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:15.750
 introduced the sad clown also 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.970
 known as blood the tragic clown 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.660
 was first introduced in the 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.390
 sims enjoying life like us npcs 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.529
 others are dona morte the genius servants and 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.750
 Santa Claus 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.539
 he also the late sunset Indians 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:35.059
 vary main world of the sims 3 where 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.059
 probably lived during his lifetime 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.840
 on the sims which incidentally visits 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.539
 depressed scientists who own the 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.160
 the clown stage to animate the 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.350
 however this does not help because the 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.239
 sad clown too sentimental 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.610
 for that reason all the tricks that he 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.250
 will try will fail which means that 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.010
 he will probably make your yes already 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.989
 depressed even more depressed he 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.720
 usually walks around the house 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.570
 crying and coughing and coughing like that 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.549
 expansion interacting with it the only 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.600
 interaction that makes them happier 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.240
 insult him 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.820
 if you try to lock it between four 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.540
 walls with a small space appears a 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.759
 black hole on the floor where they idea 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.369
 teleportation and escapes where there was 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.200
 four ways to get rid of it 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.280
 the first when fire in painting 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.860
 second to sell the painting 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.700
 third calling them exterminator is 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.240
 clowns and the fourth doing the sim 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.240
 happy 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:59.030
 the sad clown does not make an appearance in the 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.200
 the sims 2 but it is replaced by a 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.030
 character with characteristics 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.310
 similar 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.380
 the rabbit and social support that has a 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.100
 similar objective what he had to 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.860
 bells 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.900
 social support rabbit visits sims who 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.150
 has a low social need 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.400
 unlike the sad clown the rabbit 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.950
 and social support is always successful 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.110
 on your mission and only him around 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.150
 raises social need 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:28.330
 the rabbit and social support goes away 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.330
 when social slaughter reaches the average level 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.900
 in the sims 3 the sad clown is 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.210
 dead and buried in the cemetery resting 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.580
 quiet on your headstone can be 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.980
 found along the left side of the 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.430
 cemetery indicates that he died drowned 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.250
 for this reason the color of your ghost is 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.739
 blue if the ghost can usually be 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.720
 spotted around time when the 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.560
 Most other ghosts are already 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.080
 out 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.239
 a different thing is that he's already died 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.610
 in this edition of the game but is alive in 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:08.570
 first game is confusing because the sims 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.700
 3 almost several years before the sims 1 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.010
 this implies that he was already dead in the 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.959
 first game which would be unconscious 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.690
 with your ability to get out of a 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.790
 culture it may be possible that it was 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.860
 resurrected with a bronze 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.830
 it is very possible that this 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.270
 and the sims is not the same person but 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.270
 probably relatives 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.640
 the look of the sad clown in the 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.020
 sims 3 is very different from the appearance 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.350
 two bells 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.570
 she seems more realistically friendly and 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.420
 colored clothing only composed of a 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.040
 light green shirt with a gray vest and 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.410
 colorful pants 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.870
 he also had a black and white hat 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.340
 still has your clown makeup but 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.620
 yes the white base 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.440
 the color of your hair is not video error and 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.239
 yes your eyes are the dark blue 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.000
 although it seems that he has short hair 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.340
 it actually has long hair which is 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.280
 when he revealed instead of clothes 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.590
 sleep swimsuits and eclectic 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.690
 He also has a very thin beard though 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.170
 it is almost impossible to see it in your 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.170
 skin tone 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.310
 the traits of the sad clown are 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:32.120
 easily impressionable 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.610
 clumsy orderly books and drugs 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.319
 strangely do not have any 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:40.099
 favorites but their longing and desire is 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:41.870
 become emerge from world-renowned 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:44.150
 to judge from his traits of 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.199
 the exact opposite of a 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.180
 common clown 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:51.469
 probably this should be the reason for 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:54.800
 so much melancholy the sad clown did 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:56.629
 an appearance as a golfer for download 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.789
 together with the characters of 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:01.909
 known as laura coffin and I will 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:04.879
 admit casket in single play 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:06.500
 good guys but then this was the video of 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:10.250
 I hope you liked it today. 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.800
 How did I do the last video of that one day? 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.620
 so series that not part with 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.000
 and that one must be from the series of 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.430
 origin of families 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.460
 It's like I did the last of the sad clown. 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:24.229
 rabbit and social support. 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.469
 You asked me to do the 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:29.840
 Sad clown I'm here, I did it. 

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:32.150
 I hope you liked it poor 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.060
 the clown he is not a clown do not know 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.729
 because he has that selective name as well 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:40.190
 sensitive is I will leave in the description a 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:42.259
 link from the video to those who did not see 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.960
 see of the talking about the social rabbit 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:46.969
 beauty then this is what I hope you 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.129
