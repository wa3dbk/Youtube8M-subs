unlock your parked cours parcours are
basically<00:00:24.980> CPU<00:00:25.980> cores<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:26.369> aren't<00:00:26.849> being

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
basically CPU cores that aren't being

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.939 
basically CPU cores that aren't being
used<00:00:27.150> by<00:00:27.599> Windows<00:00:27.990> Windows<00:00:28.230> kind<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:28.740> locks

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
used by Windows Windows kind of locks

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.919 
used by Windows Windows kind of locks
them<00:00:29.189> down<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.730> only<00:00:30.210> uses<00:00:30.599> them<00:00:30.720> when<00:00:30.810> your

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
them down and only uses them when your

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.220 
them down and only uses them when your
computer<00:00:31.260> really<00:00:31.529> needs<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.809> for<00:00:33.809> power

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
computer really needs to for power

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.959 
computer really needs to for power
saving<00:00:34.860> or<00:00:34.980> something<00:00:35.250> like<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:35.910> if

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
saving or something like that so if

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.299 
saving or something like that so if
you're<00:00:36.120> worried<00:00:36.329> about<00:00:36.390> power<00:00:36.719> saving<00:00:37.200> then<00:00:37.440> I

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
you're worried about power saving then I

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.950 
you're worried about power saving then I
guess<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.790> can<00:00:38.910> leave<00:00:39.059> them<00:00:39.210> parked<00:00:39.510> but<00:00:39.780> if

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
guess you can leave them parked but if

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.229 
guess you can leave them parked but if
you're<00:00:40.500> into<00:00:41.010> gaming<00:00:41.160> on<00:00:41.460> your<00:00:41.579> laptop<00:00:41.969> and

the text is gonna be grayed out and it's

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.899 
the text is gonna be grayed out and it's

you're<00:01:59.159> going<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.340> want<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.520> follow<00:01:59.790> these

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
you're going to want to follow these

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.530 
you're going to want to follow these
next<00:02:00.180> few<00:02:00.780> steps<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.200> unpark<00:02:01.590> them<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.540> use

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
next few steps to unpark them and use

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.170 
next few steps to unpark them and use
their<00:02:03.840> full<00:02:04.140> power<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.680> your<00:02:04.799> advantage<00:02:05.070> so<00:02:05.460> we

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
their full power to your advantage so we

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.639 
their full power to your advantage so we
can<00:02:06.299> close<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.689> out<00:02:06.869> or<00:02:07.049> minimize<00:02:07.469> it

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
can close that out or minimize it

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.990 
can close that out or minimize it
whatever<00:02:07.799> you<00:02:07.979> want<00:02:08.129> we're<00:02:08.550> gonna<00:02:08.640> be<00:02:08.789> going

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
whatever you want we're gonna be going

0 and hexade hexadecimal can be selected
that's<00:03:39.750> fine<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.200> we<00:03:40.980> want<00:03:41.160> to<00:03:41.220> make<00:03:41.340> sure

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
that's fine and we want to make sure

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.190 
that's fine and we want to make sure
that<00:03:41.730> value<00:03:42.060> max<00:03:42.239> and<00:03:42.420> value<00:03:42.660> minimum<00:03:43.049> are

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
that value max and value minimum are

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.059 
that value max and value minimum are
both<00:03:43.470> set<00:03:43.799> to<00:03:43.950> 0<00:03:44.280> that<00:03:45.060> I<00:03:45.090> think<00:03:45.709> if<00:03:46.709> you're

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
both set to 0 that I think if you're

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.470 
both set to 0 that I think if you're
cores<00:03:47.340> are<00:03:47.519> parked<00:03:47.790> these<00:03:48.000> are<00:03:48.150> gonna<00:03:48.269> be

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
cores are parked these are gonna be

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.259 
cores are parked these are gonna be
labeled<00:03:49.139> 64<00:03:49.799> the<00:03:50.100> values<00:03:50.370> gonna<00:03:50.459> be<00:03:50.609> 64<00:03:51.150> or

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
labeled 64 the values gonna be 64 or

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.240 
labeled 64 the values gonna be 64 or
something<00:03:51.359> but<00:03:52.170> I<00:03:52.319> already<00:03:52.560> unpark<00:03:52.859> mine<00:03:53.040> so

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
something but I already unpark mine so

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.379 
something but I already unpark mine so
we<00:03:53.609> want<00:03:53.760> to<00:03:53.819> make<00:03:53.910> sure<00:03:54.030> that<00:03:54.150> there's<00:03:54.329> zero

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
we want to make sure that there's zero

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.170 
we want to make sure that there's zero
hit<00:03:54.900> okay<00:03:55.230> and<00:03:55.410> then<00:03:55.889> go<00:03:56.370> up<00:03:56.549> to<00:03:56.670> edit<00:03:56.790> again

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
hit okay and then go up to edit again

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.150 
hit okay and then go up to edit again
and<00:03:57.389> then<00:03:57.540> hit<00:03:57.690> find<00:03:58.019> next<00:03:58.410> this<00:03:58.829> is<00:03:58.889> just

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
and then hit find next this is just

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.949 
and then hit find next this is just
gonna<00:03:59.280> search<00:03:59.579> again<00:03:59.970> for<00:04:00.000> any<00:04:00.359> copies<00:04:00.840> of

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
gonna search again for any copies of

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.569 
gonna search again for any copies of
that<00:04:01.079> certain<00:04:01.350> registry<00:04:01.709> and<00:04:02.190> you<00:04:02.280> might<00:04:02.430> want

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
that certain registry and you might want

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:03.920 
that certain registry and you might want
to<00:04:02.639> do<00:04:02.700> that<00:04:02.819> five<00:04:03.120> or<00:04:03.150> six<00:04:03.450> times<00:04:03.660> and<00:04:03.870> just

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
to do that five or six times and just

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.569 
to do that five or six times and just
make<00:04:04.170> sure<00:04:04.319> that<00:04:04.350> all<00:04:04.680> of<00:04:04.739> them<00:04:05.069> are<00:04:05.190> set<00:04:05.459> to

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
make sure that all of them are set to

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.819 
make sure that all of them are set to
zero<00:04:05.880> so<00:04:06.600> once<00:04:06.930> you're<00:04:07.049> done<00:04:07.200> you<00:04:07.500> can<00:04:07.530> just

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
zero so once you're done you can just

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.250 
zero so once you're done you can just
exit<00:04:08.250> out<00:04:08.340> of<00:04:08.400> that<00:04:08.579> and<00:04:08.900> I<00:04:09.900> guess<00:04:10.079> we<00:04:10.170> don't

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
exit out of that and I guess we don't

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.620 
exit out of that and I guess we don't
need<00:04:10.380> this<00:04:10.560> anymore<00:04:10.799> I<00:04:11.100> don't<00:04:12.030> say<00:04:12.359> if<00:04:12.420> I<00:04:12.480> don't

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
need this anymore I don't say if I don't

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.599 
need this anymore I don't say if I don't
need<00:04:12.720> that<00:04:12.870> now<00:04:13.049> we're<00:04:14.010> gonna<00:04:14.100> open<00:04:14.280> up<00:04:14.549> the

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
need that now we're gonna open up the

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:17.449 
need that now we're gonna open up the
task<00:04:15.480> manager<00:04:15.780> again<00:04:16.459> hit

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
task manager again hit

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.520

then

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
then

then
off<00:04:26.300> to<00:04:26.479> the<00:04:26.509> side<00:04:26.599> you<00:04:26.810> should<00:04:26.990> have<00:04:27.259> all<00:04:27.500> of

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
off to the side you should have all of

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:29.599 
your CPUs on parks they should all be

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:31.570 
your CPUs on parks they should all be
sharing<00:04:30.590> the<00:04:30.680> load<00:04:30.860> of<00:04:31.130> the<00:04:31.220> computer

processes<00:04:32.180> and<00:04:32.389> you<00:04:33.289> should<00:04:33.500> see<00:04:33.710> some

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979
