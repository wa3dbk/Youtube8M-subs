00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 wola as you are already warning by networks 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.089
 I have thrown the house for the 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.890
 window and has recorded two videos for 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.200
 this week and as promised it's debt 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.960
 here you have me to show you which ones have 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.170
 been my birthday gifts that by 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.480
 I have been dropped 27 just noticed 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.630
 there so I 'm going to start teaching you 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.160
 well over the little things that I 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.510
 have given me for my birthday first 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.890
 place I show you this top that is as if 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.890
 it was a crypto but a little bit more 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:36.170
 long as if it had lace 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.570
 I do not know I think it's super nice it has double 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.079
 fabric that is the lace goes up and then 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.180
 the top white point normal I think 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.130
 super cool 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.890
 and I'm going to give it a lot of use in summer 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.500
 so they got it right and we continue 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.500
 with all white and this time I teach you 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.640
 this one that is leptis and is a touch goes 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.640
 with a shoulder to the air 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.600
 and so take the steering wheel this so to me 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:08.360
 it reminds me a bit of the Mexican style 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.590
 here this is a tad shorter than the 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.950
 other 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.689
 You can say it's a little bit man 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.469
 but good as I use it with 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:22.310
 high-shot pants you do not see anything and 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:24.500
 to finish top top top I teach you 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.280
 He knows me very well and they give me 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:32.060
 things plants and black because it will be this 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.399
 It's fishing and I love it's super super 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:39.350
 super pretty has his whole back 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:42.380
 in lace is transparent I feel super 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.600
 well this cut me off later 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.039
 to see that I got these pants 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.990
 that you have also seen them because 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.570
 will install because this was a gift 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.260
 advanced 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:56.409
 and they are fishing pants of these 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.690
 so they're cool I do not know how to 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.640
 they call these pants but I know it by 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.890
 all the stores of millions of 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.730
 prints at the same time that you go as the most 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.740
 elegant so 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.290
 perfect then something else that also 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.400
 you have seen by my instagram is this 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:15.300
 zara shirt with white and blue stripes 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.880

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.080
 this exists what it has cost because I 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.650

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.020
 fabric that is but who I liked a lot 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.030
 that although it is long sleeve I think 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.920

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.200
