00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
windshield wiper motion and getting a

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.590 
windshield wiper motion and getting a
really<00:01:22.619> nice<00:01:22.920> smooth<00:01:23.280> blend<00:01:23.520> Kylie<00:01:24.420> doesn't

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
really nice smooth blend Kylie doesn't

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.510 
really nice smooth blend Kylie doesn't
wear<00:01:24.869> any<00:01:25.080> bold<00:01:25.380> eyeshadows<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> regular

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
wear any bold eyeshadows on a regular

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.160 
wear any bold eyeshadows on a regular
basis<00:01:26.970> but<00:01:27.240> she<00:01:27.390> always<00:01:27.540> has<00:01:27.810> some<00:01:28.020> really

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
basis but she always has some really

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.510 
basis but she always has some really
nice<00:01:28.380> smoky<00:01:28.799> Browns

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
nice smoky Browns

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.520 
nice smoky Browns
so<00:01:30.000> that's<00:01:30.210> why<00:01:30.420> I'm<00:01:30.570> adding<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:31.079> Brown<00:01:31.320> in

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
so that's why I'm adding that Brown in

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.319
