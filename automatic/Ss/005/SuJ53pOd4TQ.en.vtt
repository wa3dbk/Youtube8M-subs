00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
out it actually came out better than I

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.920 
out it actually came out better than I
thought<00:02:54.519> it<00:02:54.579> would<00:02:54.790> be<00:02:54.969> because<00:02:55.150> Desi<00:02:55.659> Arnaz

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
thought it would be because Desi Arnaz

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.099 
thought it would be because Desi Arnaz
his<00:02:56.139> face<00:02:56.500> in<00:02:56.799> the<00:02:57.250> original<00:02:57.730> like<00:02:58.359> photograph

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
his face in the original like photograph

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:02.280 
his face in the original like photograph
from<00:02:59.349> this<00:02:59.590> it<00:02:59.829> wasn't<00:03:00.609> a<00:03:00.909> full<00:03:01.599> frontal<00:03:02.019> face

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
from this it wasn't a full frontal face

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.069 
from this it wasn't a full frontal face
it<00:03:02.560> was<00:03:02.709> like<00:03:02.859> almost<00:03:03.129> a<00:03:03.459> full<00:03:03.760> side<00:03:04.180> portrait

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
it was like almost a full side portrait

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:07.500 
it was like almost a full side portrait
of<00:03:05.260> his<00:03:05.469> face<00:03:05.739> so<00:03:06.010> those<00:03:06.519> are<00:03:06.699> really<00:03:06.909> hard<00:03:07.299> to

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.479 
of his face so those are really hard to
draw<00:03:07.780> but<00:03:08.319> no<00:03:08.439> matter<00:03:08.620> how<00:03:08.769> it<00:03:09.099> came<00:03:09.250> out<00:03:09.459> I
