00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.490 
is in actual numbers but it does feel
like<00:01:50.580> it's<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.790> lot<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.000> people<00:01:51.240> who<00:01:51.869> really

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
like it's a lot of people who really

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.410 
like it's a lot of people who really
fanatically<00:01:53.250> love<00:01:53.400> the<00:01:53.520> show<00:01:53.700> but<00:01:54.210> they're

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
fanatically love the show but they're

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.820 
fanatically love the show but they're
sort<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.750> surrounded<00:01:55.080> by<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.200> much<00:01:55.380> bigger<00:01:55.590> pool

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
sort of surrounded by a much bigger pool

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.530 
sort of surrounded by a much bigger pool
of<00:01:55.860> people<00:01:56.009> who<00:01:56.640> thought<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.330> was<00:01:57.420> really

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
of people who thought that was really

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.420 
of people who thought that was really
good<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.840> show<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.650> which<00:01:58.830> adds<00:01:59.070> up<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.280> a

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
good that show so which adds up to a

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.130 
good that show so which adds up to a
fairly<00:01:59.820> chunky<00:02:00.300> audience<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.780> think<00:02:00.960> you<00:02:01.050> know

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
fairly chunky audience I think you know

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.690 
fairly chunky audience I think you know
so<00:02:01.290> there<00:02:01.440> are<00:02:01.560> there<00:02:01.770> some<00:02:02.009> real<00:02:02.369> there<00:02:02.610> are

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
so there are there some real there are

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.940 
so there are there some real there are
absolute<00:02:03.150> hardcored<00:02:03.690> Toffees<00:02:04.110> who<00:02:04.649> will<00:02:04.830> be

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
absolute hardcored Toffees who will be

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.510 
absolute hardcored Toffees who will be
watching<00:02:05.100> every<00:02:05.490> frame<00:02:06.119> with<00:02:06.750> worrying

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
watching every frame with worrying

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.340 
watching every frame with worrying
intensity<00:02:08.520> which<00:02:09.450> makes<00:02:09.690> us<00:02:09.810> very<00:02:09.929> nervous

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
intensity which makes us very nervous

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.660 
intensity which makes us very nervous
but<00:02:10.500> then<00:02:10.649> there's<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:11.100> think<00:02:11.130> there's<00:02:11.400> quite<00:02:11.640> a

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
but then there's I think there's quite a

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.670 
but then there's I think there's quite a
large<00:02:12.030> following<00:02:12.600> of<00:02:12.660> sort<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:12.959> relaxed

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
large following of sort of relaxed

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.759 
large following of sort of relaxed
viewers<00:02:14.130> who<00:02:14.730> quite<00:02:15.000> like<00:02:15.209> red<00:02:15.420> dwarf<00:02:18.769> cabin

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
viewers who quite like red dwarf cabin

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:32.220 
viewers who quite like red dwarf cabin
crew<00:02:20.030> landed

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.290
