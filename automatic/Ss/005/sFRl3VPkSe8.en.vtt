00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.379
 his transparent pregón presents martín 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.129
 muñoz and his transparent proclamation and 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.129
 afflict 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.980
 and here we are with barcina very good 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.290
 days of orbit as they are very well with 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.910
 very eager to work and I with the 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.280
 idea and 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.280
 and the temperance that Christmas 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.600
 just like that good little music here 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.640
 we have snow as we sometimes simulate and 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.110
 all but hey we got used one 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.790
 culture and good we share it the 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.600
 we enjoy because that beautiful room is 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.340
 very cute 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.110
 these analysts are relindo apart not 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:01.000
 knows how easy it is to make the hermitage 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.489
 easy and as we always say economic 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.259
 for the wallet will the waltz someone 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.259
 to work and to give yourself a damn 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.649
 but let's get to work look 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.090
 let's work obviously starts 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:17.880
 transparent friends my friends of his 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.380
 cry and the hotmail is without the gun and 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.270
 the ultra hotmail bars 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.829
 transparent is why because I need 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.380
 this transparency that looks like glass 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.719
 of glass and in turn can take it off 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.780
 where I'm going to work then we're going to 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:32.640
 work transparent hotmail and the 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.079
 supra bonus gun look what 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.479
 let's do it is very, very, very, very 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.489
 simple let's do as if they were 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.399
 some spots that if I start it like that from 

00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:44.969
 the center and see how easy I am going to 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.560
 the laterals but that's not neat 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.340
 saying there does not have to be a way 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.130
 definite 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.040
 see how easy it is to see 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.350
 working it like this 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.350
 let's leave this here I will do another 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.110
 similar and as we go 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.720
 working 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.800
 what we are going to do is reduce the 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.380
 size ok now they will see why 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.240
 come on we are working like this and we are going to 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.980
 start doing a little more 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.990
 that is, we call these two 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.700
 we would then start making a 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.590
 I call him spots because 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.980
 they look like spots 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.500
 a little bit more tiny come I come I come 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.550
 as if they were solcitos spot suns 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.770
 how do you want to call him good in 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.960
 Definitely, what comes out like this is not 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.760
 matter if they are a little thicker if 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.040
 they are a little thinner if what is 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.840
 good is that we go making a 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.360
 little bit more girls as the 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.220
 we are forming well then let's go 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.140
 working well let's do a few 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.340
 because of this that he will defend to see 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.590
 if some are already giving an idea 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.240
 because he is telling us ah I already know how 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.280
 what is going to do about this depends the height 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.230
 also from the tree and obviously the 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.050
 diameter based on the stain we put together 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.300
 or the solcito see that I'm reducing 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.540
 the size then let's go 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.010
 reducing it to a point 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.260
 they're going to see that that's going to be the last 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.870
 that we are going to place well let's go 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.550
 working it like this once you already 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.840
 they have more or less cooked that already 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.540
 they are ready that this works very but 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.610
 very fast what we're going to get 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.290
 are these little spots like the ones I 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.480
 I have here then what we are going to do 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.870
 is to take off obviously withdraw the 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.769
 little tricks and see how easy it comes 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.360
 I begin to place just a droplet and 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.610
 I hit in such a way 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.740
 you want it to be matched is to say that 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.890
 I do not know what is not twisted and that 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.780
 start crisscrossing in each of 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.000
 these rods or little stars that I went 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.920
 putting together then let's go working 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.020
 so it does not matter that you do not have 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.970
 so it has not so marked the 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.440
 outgoing but anyway we 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.850
 It serves and remains perfect then 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:53.520
 we put a little bit of adhesive and 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.709
 I'll take another one, that's why I'm telling you 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.600
 The more we make the cuter, the more 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.180
 to get work a little bit of 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.709
 adhesive and always look forward to a 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.930
 I'm telling you right now 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:07.440
 that is controlled and we are moving 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.959
 so that all the little tree has a 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.940
 shape and texture as beautiful as possible 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:16.049
 I return to place 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:18.900
 and so on until the part of 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.840
 up they see this is repetitive but 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.700
 always be sure to go on doing more 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.440
 to minor and obviously that is not going to 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.690
 another been because if it is not very common that 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.490
 that little tree later it seems that it grew 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:34.009
 against a poor wall then 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.949
 we are going to put some masses and go 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:39.729
 seeing how it ends, see how we're doing 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.729
 giving height 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.710
 this is very fast look at them I tell you more 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:47.030
 If you have to make a souvenir 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.400
 nothing cuter faster and more 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.539
 economic than doing it this way I 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.060
 I put on light and now I'm going to show you 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.979
 how and I will make them easy but 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.080
 you could calmly 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:58.750
 paint gold if you want silver 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.360
 they can hang from the tree also 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.069
 can use them to give away take advantage 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.300
 the idea I know that you take advantage of them 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:07.099
 very well because they write to write us 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.990
 much on the facebook in the of 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:10.370
 welcome in the super avon in mine 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.349
 in any and we always put things 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:17.000
 cute so come see how I'm working 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:18.800
 from highest to lowest until you reach almost 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.960
 from above and what above with what 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.900
 I close with the same glue I make 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.509
 as a kind of tiny bonnet and 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.889
 there I already leave it that is what is the step 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:29.750
 next that I recommend that 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:31.370
 it's super cute you guys already tell 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.590
 touch we obviously take out all the 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.599
 trickles that are forming can 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.340
 work with these candles I work 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:39.080
 that they get them they saw that I know 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.539
 publish many ask me that question 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.550
 then it is very easy to get them 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:44.900
 they enter the facebook they are going to get 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.029
 enter my facebook is there on the wall 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.360
 and remember these pools are good 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:48.409
 why 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.699
 because these are changing the color 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:53.180
 can use others that are 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:55.250
 simply white or others that go the 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.659
 effect is going to be a velita effect what 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.400
 we are going to do in this case 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:06:01.219
 obviously it is to place the little tree that 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.530
 we made on the little candle 

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:05.360
 then when we turn it on what it's going 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.180
 to be normite that is going to be the effect 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.919
 that color and here I already have one that 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.409
 the paste sticks it directly on the 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:14.150
 candle then when turning on the one that goes 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:16.729
 changing in this case the front in the 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.199
 base that likes which now for 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:19.789
 all the chocolates that out there 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:20.840
 they want to buy the candles or not 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:22.129
 they have something good 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.889
 we can use the little tree 

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:30.560
 simply hang them hung tamara 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:32.870
 of silver at work so very 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.740
 but very fast very fast is very cheap 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.740
 and rational 

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:49.259
 and now we continue with mónica ghosts 

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:49.259
 because he makes us some decorated bottles
