00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.100
 Hello 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.100
 Today I would like so much how to pick up my 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.769
 favorite tune spending at the same time 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.159
 minimum effort 

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:13.759
 we need two for this 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:14.679
 programs 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:16.359
 the first is called argar prim 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:18.560
 the second is called hockey 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.010
 both programs you can freely 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.599
 download a khachkar harmonica 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:24.659
 and the second program hockey players can 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:27.149
 find VKontakte application 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:28.919
 so buying you the harmonica 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.099
 probably conceived already played what 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:32.720
 any favorite tune 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.540
 however how much would you pick it up 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.510
 it turned out you have an active line of years 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.960
 what do we need firstly need this 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.960
 melody tune 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.840
 download 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.530
 load 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:48.990
 and he he gives 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.260
 leg sequence 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.160
 we switch indicatively 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.530
 diaconescu 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.530
 and now he gives us a hole 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.780
 inhale and exhale 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.470
 if we play this one 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.470
 the sequence will work out completely 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.450
 not what we heard 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.680
 what to do let's change a little 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.700
 melodies choose tulu parties slipped 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.180
 and choose to raise or lower 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.300
 Ashimov we can share at once 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.920
 villages floors help just one step 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.150
 let's go up a few steps I 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.150
 reproduced these keys 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.370
 now our tunes 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.830
 true sound 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.830
 its core we immediately recognize 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.250
 surely your favorite tunes are not 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.680
 as simple as that 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.680
 and contains much more dmitry bugs 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.060
 you can see right away that not everyone here is from 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.470
 indicated by holes 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.370
 some lots are still designated 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:52.700
 in letters 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.800
 what to do with him 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.800
 if we will 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.050
 over time 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.970
 again 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.110
 will go into the hole 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.949
 however the melody will be from cherry high 

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.579
 if we want to play 10 hint sounds to us 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:14.849
 it does not satisfy 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.689
 so what can we do operations logs 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.439
 reboot as it was in the original 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.119
 position 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:22.869
 You can also pood personally 

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:25.239
 extra notes that just zykov 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:26.579
 component 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.559
 but the main theme is not conveyed 

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:32.559
 in right click and 99 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:37.019
 and we can play her mb with diarrhea which 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.459
 denoted by letters 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.370
 we live daytime biathle somoni 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.599
 can 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.700
 the top line shows us the notes 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.229
 Davydov Nizhny Novgorod 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:52.229
 pressing the button we will hear them from the street 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:57.069
 why did you need the second program 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.609
 charters 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:01.099
 in principle, it duplicates already invested 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:02.669
 picture attachment 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:03.999
 but 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:06.619
 in my opinion, he thinks she is much 

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:09.619
 more comfortable sound or me h 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:13.639
 and it's easier to keep a separate window 

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:16.729
 we take everything with selection 

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.519
 enjoy the game 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:19.760
 play your favorite tunes
