00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:07.069
 9 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.070
 hello to all guys well found at 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.930
 my channel I practice in 68 and 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.210
 welcome to this new video then 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.529
 let's go straight to the new mission 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.529
 of the new dlc 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:16.200
 all 81 rega tell me how much splits vegeta 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:18.509
 on these 4 years level is intense gil 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:27.990
 he said I don't know if you noticed, he said 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:30.960
 dragon ball year groundball have then 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.360
 immediately make a super vegeta 2 and i 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.039
 make me a super dog in this move 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.600
 I really used fire I have to say the 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.960
 Truth indeed I have not used their own 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.619
 honestly, however, it did not seem to me 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.450
 correct has towards godo 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:48.840
 fortunately I can't do the z 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.220
 but that this is speaking there is one 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.220
 exaggerated chat 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.200
 and meanwhile the z 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.720
 but I arrived even when he arrived 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.459
 but look at this move as pretty 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.330
 obviously the guardian will also come 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.330
 however this move 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.159
 the true obviously blocks with one 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.730
 parallel I don't want to tell you anything else we see 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:32.730
 the record 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.780
 but now that I had noticed it 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.780
 now that I've noticed 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.870
 wrong or eye makeup 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.400
 uneasy because right now it's the 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.040
 first time I see him closing 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.880
 eyes completely and had eyes 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:19.090
 blacks that is not the eyes as they are called 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:25.030
 the eyelids should be stepped 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:29.430
 that the fights are good then though 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:32.110
 I'm too know nothing too big 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:36.340
 because we continually do super vg 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:38.800
 tamo semo both still moves and to say of 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.860
 go and get some piled up goes one 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:45.550
 obviously passionate about this time 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.770
 just the beatings and for a reason 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.340
 let's see if we can make a z no 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.340
 obviously 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.549
 and to see why I don't like it so much 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.540
 however the company had me because it is 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:03.319
 hard to get them then I don't know why 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:07.010
 always protect is not that it is one 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:12.520
 of the moves that instead said however the 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:14.950
 perfect room for me that is better 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:18.400
 do not ask me why I know what this 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:21.400
 but what I think the perfect one is 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.820
 slightly more cautious perhaps for the 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.820
 perfect 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.600
 meanwhile I saw coach age doing the 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.490
 camera mea bluff if I'm not mistaken then 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.700
 he really gave me a big hand 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:40.840
 to say I couldn't do without it 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:42.970
 sincerely thanks for so little thing 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.890
 hand and thank you for another room of mine 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:49.750
 bluff 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:52.420
 another as you see fled of course 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.140
 who does practically zero damage 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.140
 look at them a 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:03.330
 but we did the nice thing z 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:08.919
 really nice we made a zeta 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:10.750
 zero from nino lucetta we will see the ta nea 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:16.650
 me to big bang of age coach like it 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:21.310
 scatters in the air while beating 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:26.370
 we recharge c of course I hope you do 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:28.780
 save the microphone too much let's say 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.639
 low I don't know why I'm moving 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.560
 all the time you can't see 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:35.110
 but believe me I'm moving 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:38.710
 I constantly watch the computer watch 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:44.120
 the version better than I tell you 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:48.200
 then how not to do another course 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:52.140
 in the void indeed I think I hit the 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:56.270
 league however rejected that makes the rooms to me 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.270
 a big bang on the tour cannot be seen 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:05.800
 at least they make me super room too 

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:07.470
 it may be that he catches it then 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:12.449
 let's go back another can kill 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.449
 obviously I go out of my favorite move 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:20.409
 there is little proud little boys there 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.060
 pride of tuscia once moved 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:24.490
 over 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:27.330
 we come back we set ourselves again I would rather 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:30.930
 try regional cannon is a bit 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:33.780
 choose we can do nothing 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.979
 then we take a good beating 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.139
 meanwhile another room my bluff of 

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:40.169
 great age cruise coach continues like this 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:40.169
 to 

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:48.120
 we only give it to us anyway 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:49.500
 this is to be seen 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.260
 okay i believe this 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:54.510
 fighting is almost done 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:56.550
 so I would like to start greeting why 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:07:06.800
 see you next time, of course 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:06.800
 part we see a moment that happens ok 

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:19.510
 okay that you like so I said in 

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:22.350
 video the mission was therefore 

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:25.300
 practically finished then we should 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:27.430
 see each other directly with the last one 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.860
 mission if I'm not mistaken it should be 

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:31.840
 the last 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:34.860
 read and the last mission in two that 

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:37.360
 I play the part is the last mission e 

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:39.520
 so I give you an appointment with a gift 

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.910

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:45.430
