00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
do is you're going to squeeze and drop

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.370 
do is you're going to squeeze and drop
this<00:03:25.290> out<00:03:25.530> on<00:03:25.740> to<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.250> left<00:03:26.520> so<00:03:26.990> let<00:03:27.990> me<00:03:28.110> just

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
this out on to the left so let me just

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
do you see this it's like like the

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.760 
do you see this it's like like the
little<00:03:35.970> droplets<00:03:36.300> are<00:03:36.660> going<00:03:36.930> in<00:03:37.110> but<00:03:37.470> they're

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
little droplets are going in but they're

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.500 
little droplets are going in but they're
not<00:03:37.980> like<00:03:38.160> merging<00:03:38.610> together<00:03:38.790> like<00:03:39.180> water

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
not like merging together like water

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.200 
not like merging together like water
does<00:03:39.840> like<00:03:40.050> the<00:03:40.200> droplets<00:03:40.620> are<00:03:40.770> being<00:03:40.980> like

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
does like the droplets are being like

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.460 
does like the droplets are being like
individualized<00:03:42.210> in<00:03:42.480> here<00:03:42.690> okay<00:03:43.110> so<00:03:43.140> I'm

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
individualized in here okay so I'm

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.440 
individualized in here okay so I'm
taking<00:03:43.680> some<00:03:43.890> from<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.400> right<00:03:44.580> here<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.210> then

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
taking some from the right here and then

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.490 
taking some from the right here and then
I'm<00:03:45.600> going<00:03:45.750> to<00:03:45.810> drop<00:03:46.050> this<00:03:46.320> on<00:03:46.530> inside<00:03:48.410> it's<00:03:49.410> a

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
I'm going to drop this on inside it's a

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.750 
I'm going to drop this on inside it's a
little<00:03:49.710> bit<00:03:49.800> harder<00:03:50.130> to<00:03:50.160> see<00:03:50.250> because<00:03:50.610> the

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
little bit harder to see because the

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.650 
little bit harder to see because the
background<00:03:51.000> is<00:03:51.330> blue<00:03:51.630> now<00:03:51.660> but<00:03:53.090> that<00:03:54.090> is<00:03:54.270> so

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
background is blue now but that is so

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:21.240 
background is blue now but that is so
cool<00:03:59.000> like<00:04:00.000> that<00:04:00.360> that<00:04:01.170> is<00:04:01.350> awesome

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.710 

okay<00:04:22.250> so<00:04:22.310> we<00:04:22.520> are<00:04:22.670> now<00:04:22.820> done<00:04:23.030> dropping<00:04:23.360> out

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
okay so we are now done dropping out

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.510 
okay so we are now done dropping out
pretty<00:04:23.990> much<00:04:24.080> as<00:04:24.230> much<00:04:24.560> liquid<00:04:24.980> as<00:04:25.070> we<00:04:25.340> could

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
pretty much as much liquid as we could

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.850 
pretty much as much liquid as we could
get<00:04:25.730> into<00:04:26.000> here<00:04:26.420> so<00:04:26.930> now<00:04:27.350> what<00:04:27.500> we're<00:04:27.620> going<00:04:27.770> to

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
get into here so now what we're going to
