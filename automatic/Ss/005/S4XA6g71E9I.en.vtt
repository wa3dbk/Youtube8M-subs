Hello TequilaTec friends

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.540
In this occasion we bring to you the review from the speaker Bose "Soundlink III"

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.614
Let´s go to the video

00:00:05.614 --> 00:00:06.454
Wellcome

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.500
Technologies, reviews and more...

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.920
We present this speaker because in TequilaTec we believe that it is portable 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.940
And it´ll help you with a great sound wherever you go

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.200
And it is that exist speakers more portable

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.960
Like the JBL Flip 2, Beats Pill or even the Soundlink Mini

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.120
This speaker will take you to a higher level of sound without sacrifice much it´s portability 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.900
Many people knows Bose with just hearing his name

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.220
And in TequilaTec we also believe that exist other great companies like

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.840
JBL, Onkyo, Harman Kardon, Beats, Altec Lansing, Yamaha, and others

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:54.140
So, Bose is a company that had brought us great experiences in headset, speakers, home theaters, car system, equalizer, and others

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.660
Something that we like about this speaker is the quality of the materials

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.040
Because it is made of aluminum and in the ends and buttons we can feel a soft plastic to the touch

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.760
also have a battery that can last up to 14 continues hours

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.120
Weighting approximately 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) in the hand it feels more light

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.480
Being more easy to transport

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.200
In the frontal part we can find the bluetooth icon, which indicate us if it is searching our device

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.200
If it is ready to sync with another or if it has been already sync

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.880
It is possible to mention that de device is compatible with bluetooth 2.0 and 4.0

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:34.640
The auxiliary, that in the back of the speaker is the entrance to connect our device wired by a 3.5 mm cable

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.100
The silence icon or mute, serves for the speaker stop reproducing in any momment

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.540
Without the need to go to the device and you can resume when the user wishes it

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.160
And finally the battery icon, which indicate us if our battery is full turning on with a green color

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.100
If the battery is at middle of use turning on with a yellow - orange color

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.940
Or if it has little battery turning on with a red color, for we can connect and continue enjoying of our music without any interruptions 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.160
At the top we can see with a smooth surface framed with a white plastic

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.380
The first button that we see is the turn on or off button, for both options just make one clic

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.640
The bluetooth button, that serves to turn on or off and lend it pressed for three seconds

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.100
We can sync new devices with a maximum of ten

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.500
The auxiliary, that let it pressed automatically suspend the bluetooth for plug in it wired

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.140
The silence button or mute that as we mention, function to silence the speaker when we wishes

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.800
And finally the buttons to turn less or turn up the volume

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:48.120
In the back we can find with the aux entrance of 3.5 mm that as we said serves to connect our device wired

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.320
A MicroUsb entrance to plug in it to our PC and can updated it as Bose says  

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.060
And the power entrance of 17 to 20 volts that feeds the Bose

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.060
Music examples

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.320
Bluetooth 4.0 used by an iPod Nano 7

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.900
Something that in TequilaTec we like about this speaker is that even it connects by bluetooth it sounds really well

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.480
And we know that the devices that connects by bluetooth it does not have great bass, and this one make us very surprised 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.560
To connect the speaker to a device it is enough to turn on the speaker

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.020
Automatically we can see that turns on the bluetooth icon in the down part

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.420
Next we are going to press the bluetooth icon that is on the top

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.680
And as we can see it turns from white to blue, this mean that it is searching devices

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.860
and finally what is missing to do is to search in your device the Bose Soundlink III

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.620
Once we have our device sync with the speaker, just turn on

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.640
And automatically it is going to recognize

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.260
What is missing 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.054
Will be

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.360
Choose our favorite song

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.620
And that is it, we can turn up the volume we want

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.300
Now, another example of pop

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.320
And another types of music

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:14.820
The Bose speaker sounds really good with any device and function wihout any error in a distance approximately of 15 meters

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.940
Having a device with bluetooth 4.0

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.420
There are five colors for the Bose Soundlink III

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.640
Gray, aqua blue, orange, green and pink cake

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.980
Bose also sells a special edition gamma of the NFL

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.560
The audio of the presented videos were recorded by an iPhone 6.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:08.340
Disponibility and prices

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:15.760
We bought this speaker in the iShop of "Plaza Universidad" that is in the metropolitana zone of the Mexico city

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.220
By a price of $5400 Mexican pesos ($364 USD)

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.160
Nevertheless let´s remember that Apple used to sell Bose products in their stores

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.380
But you can acquire this product through:

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.700
Sanborns, Iron Palace, Best Buy, Linio, Amazon

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.940
Or directly with a Bose supplier

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.700
With a price that can round from $4800 MXM (324 USD) to $5400 MXM ($364 USD)

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.940
In general we believe that this speaker is a great choise to animate the family parties or friendship meetings

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.640
But it price is something high

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.800
But if it isn´t a factor in TequilaTec we recommended it

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.580
Well TequilaTec friends

We have arrived to the end of the video

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.580
