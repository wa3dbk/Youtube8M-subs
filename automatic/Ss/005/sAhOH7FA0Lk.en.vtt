it<00:01:06.810> worked<00:01:07.140> for<00:01:07.350> what<00:01:07.470> we<00:01:07.619> really<00:01:07.860> actually<00:01:08.220> so

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
it worked for what we really actually so

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.490 
it worked for what we really actually so
basically<00:01:09.390> we<00:01:09.630> started<00:01:09.869> out<00:01:10.020> with<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.140> giant

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
basically we started out with a giant

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.530 
basically we started out with a giant
pile<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:11.010> all<00:01:11.189> our<00:01:11.310> craft<00:01:11.670> junk<00:01:11.939> common<00:01:12.330> core

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
pile of all our craft junk common core

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.359 
pile of all our craft junk common core
and<00:01:12.930> was<00:01:13.590> sitting<00:01:13.830> there<00:01:13.920> for<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.220> while

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
and was sitting there for a while

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.490 
and was sitting there for a while
so<00:01:14.670> we<00:01:14.760> thought<00:01:14.880> we<00:01:15.150> could<00:01:15.479> have<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
so we thought we could have it so the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.410 
so we thought we could have it so the
first<00:01:16.680> step<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.040> any<00:01:17.159> major<00:01:17.430> organization<00:01:18.210> is

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
first step to any major organization is

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.179 
first step to any major organization is
to<00:01:18.570> look<00:01:18.689> at<00:01:18.810> what<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.020> have<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.530> organized<00:01:20.040> it

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
to look at what you have in organized it

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.399 
to look at what you have in organized it
into<00:01:20.310> categories<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.869> categories<00:01:22.380> that

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
into categories so the categories that

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.490 
into categories so the categories that
we<00:01:22.590> had<00:01:23.009> were<00:01:23.580> all<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.570> our<00:01:24.659> paints<00:01:25.110> all<00:01:25.259> were

to<00:03:17.770> our<00:03:18.040> template<00:03:18.520> and<00:03:18.700> we're<00:03:18.850> just<00:03:19.000> going

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
to our template and we're just going

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.260 
to our template and we're just going
tensile<00:03:19.660> to<00:03:19.810> mark<00:03:20.020> out<00:03:20.170> how<00:03:20.350> long<00:03:20.560> it<00:03:20.740> is<00:03:20.830> and

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
tensile to mark out how long it is and

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.700 
tensile to mark out how long it is and
protip<00:03:22.270> before<00:03:22.840> we<00:03:22.960> start<00:03:23.200> cutting<00:03:23.380> we're

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710 
protip before we start cutting we're

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.520 
protip before we start cutting we're
going<00:03:23.860> back<00:03:24.010> to<00:03:24.160> minus<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.930> width<00:03:26.200> of<00:03:26.380> the

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
going back to minus the width of the

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.020 
going back to minus the width of the
wood<00:03:26.800> from<00:03:27.100> two<00:03:27.340> of<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.580> sides

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
wood from two of the sides

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.460 
wood from two of the sides
otherwise<00:03:28.450> it's<00:03:28.810> going<00:03:28.960> to<00:03:29.020> be<00:03:29.140> too<00:03:29.290> big<00:03:29.440> for

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
otherwise it's going to be too big for

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.170 
otherwise it's going to be too big for
your<00:03:29.650> door<00:03:29.890> then<00:03:30.550> we're<00:03:30.670> going<00:03:30.790> to<00:03:30.850> cut<00:03:31.060> the

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
your door then we're going to cut the

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.940 
your door then we're going to cut the
wood<00:03:31.360> using<00:03:31.630> small<00:03:31.900> hacksaw<00:03:32.320> and<00:03:32.350> you<00:03:32.620> just<00:03:32.770> do

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
wood using small hacksaw and you just do

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.590 
wood using small hacksaw and you just do
this<00:03:32.980> by<00:03:33.220> putting<00:03:33.430> it<00:03:33.610> up<00:03:33.730> on<00:03:33.880> to<00:03:34.330> bigger

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
this by putting it up on to bigger

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.840 
this by putting it up on to bigger
pieces<00:03:34.870> of<00:03:35.080> wood<00:03:35.230> or<00:03:35.470> we<00:03:35.710> have<00:03:35.890> boxes<00:03:36.340> so<00:03:36.610> we

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
pieces of wood or we have boxes so we

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.750 
pieces of wood or we have boxes so we
use<00:03:37.480> those<00:03:37.690> so<00:03:38.290> once<00:03:38.470> I<00:03:38.590> receive<00:03:39.130> and<00:03:39.310> cut<00:03:39.520> we

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
use those so once I receive and cut we

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.430 
use those so once I receive and cut we
lay<00:03:39.910> them<00:03:40.120> on<00:03:40.300> top<00:03:40.360> of<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.840> template<00:03:41.230> where

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
lay them on top of the template where

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.110 
lay them on top of the template where
everything<00:03:41.830> is<00:03:41.950> supposed<00:03:42.160> to<00:03:42.250> go<00:03:42.370> and<00:03:42.610> just

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
everything is supposed to go and just

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.790 
everything is supposed to go and just
using<00:03:43.390> some<00:03:43.540> normal<00:03:43.840> wood<00:03:44.020> glue<00:03:44.230> glue<00:03:44.620> them

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
using some normal wood glue glue them

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.380 
using some normal wood glue glue them
together<00:03:45.040> and<00:03:45.400> then<00:03:45.910> make<00:03:46.060> sure<00:03:46.090> to<00:03:46.270> use

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
together and then make sure to use

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.270 
together and then make sure to use
masking<00:03:46.810> tape<00:03:46.870> to<00:03:47.230> hold<00:03:47.410> it<00:03:47.560> into<00:03:47.740> place<00:03:47.950> while

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
masking tape to hold it into place while

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.710 
masking tape to hold it into place while
it<00:03:48.310> dries<00:03:48.580> it<00:03:48.910> should<00:03:49.090> take<00:03:49.240> about<00:03:49.330> half<00:03:49.630> an

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
it dries it should take about half an

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.610 
it dries it should take about half an
hour<00:03:49.840> to<00:03:49.990> an<00:03:50.050> hour<00:03:50.230> to<00:03:50.350> dry<00:03:50.620> completely

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
hour to an hour to dry completely

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.930 
hour to an hour to dry completely
so<00:03:53.620> we<00:03:53.800> decided<00:03:54.100> that<00:03:54.250> when<00:03:54.490> I<00:03:54.520> came<00:03:54.670> to<00:03:54.850> our

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
so we decided that when I came to our

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.090 
so we decided that when I came to our
blue<00:03:55.300> and<00:03:55.600> sticky<00:03:56.110> items<00:03:56.410> drawer<00:03:56.680> we<00:03:56.920> didn't

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
blue and sticky items drawer we didn't

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.560 
blue and sticky items drawer we didn't
really<00:03:57.190> need<00:03:57.400> a<00:03:57.460> divider<00:03:57.910> in<00:03:58.120> it<00:03:58.330> because

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
really need a divider in it because

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.660 
really need a divider in it because
everything<00:03:58.810> fits<00:03:59.230> snug<00:03:59.530> together<00:03:59.860> our<00:04:00.160> ribbon

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
everything fits snug together our ribbon

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.490 
everything fits snug together our ribbon
Joe<00:04:00.820> is<00:04:00.970> a<00:04:01.090> little<00:04:01.330> bit<00:04:01.420> more<00:04:01.570> complex<00:04:01.930> so<00:04:02.200> this

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
Joe is a little bit more complex so this

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.250 
Joe is a little bit more complex so this
is<00:04:02.620> how<00:04:02.740> we<00:04:02.800> laid<00:04:03.100> it<00:04:03.250> out<00:04:03.630> and<00:04:04.630> we<00:04:04.840> decided<00:04:05.200> to

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
is how we laid it out and we decided to

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.230 
is how we laid it out and we decided to
add<00:04:05.410> three<00:04:05.740> rows<00:04:05.950> of<00:04:06.190> ribbon<00:04:06.550> grafts<00:04:06.790> to<00:04:06.940> hold

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240

and<00:04:46.880> you<00:04:47.150> can<00:04:47.270> cut<00:04:47.450> that<00:04:47.600> with<00:04:47.780> our<00:04:47.930> hacksaw

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
and you can cut that with our hacksaw

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.440 
and you can cut that with our hacksaw
and<00:04:48.770> then<00:04:49.700> we're<00:04:49.820> going<00:04:49.910> to<00:04:49.970> string<00:04:50.210> on<00:04:50.300> our

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
and then we're going to string on our

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:51.820 
and then we're going to string on our
ribbon<00:04:50.690> rolls<00:04:50.900> and<00:04:51.139> you<00:04:51.200> can<00:04:51.350> set<00:04:51.560> them<00:04:51.680> into

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
ribbon rolls and you can set them into

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.330 
ribbon rolls and you can set them into
place<00:04:52.510> we<00:04:53.510> left<00:04:53.840> a<00:04:54.020> row<00:04:54.290> for<00:04:54.560> washi<00:04:54.770> tape<00:04:55.130> and

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
place we left a row for washi tape and

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.740 
place we left a row for washi tape and
we<00:04:55.550> made<00:04:55.700> it<00:04:55.820> a<00:04:55.880> little<00:04:55.970> bit<00:04:56.120> smaller<00:04:56.450> just

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
we made it a little bit smaller just

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.300 
we made it a little bit smaller just
because<00:04:56.960> the<00:04:57.080> washi<00:04:57.350> tape<00:04:57.530> is<00:04:57.710> smaller<00:04:58.040> than

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
because the washi tape is smaller than

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.860 
because the washi tape is smaller than
the<00:04:58.370> rest<00:04:58.460> of<00:04:58.639> our<00:04:58.729> ribbon<00:04:59.000> so<00:04:59.479> the<00:04:59.630> very<00:04:59.810> last

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
the rest of our ribbon so the very last

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.250 
the rest of our ribbon so the very last
step<00:05:00.200> is<00:05:00.500> to<00:05:00.740> click<00:05:01.040> our<00:05:01.510> drawer<00:05:02.510> inserts<00:05:02.990> into

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
step is to click our drawer inserts into

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.010 
step is to click our drawer inserts into
the<00:05:03.410> drawers<00:05:03.740> inserts<00:05:04.729> inserts<00:05:05.090> insert<00:05:05.870> the

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
the drawers inserts inserts insert the

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.469 
the drawers inserts inserts insert the
insert<00:05:06.430> so<00:05:07.430> we<00:05:07.610> just<00:05:07.790> did<00:05:07.970> this<00:05:08.090> one<00:05:08.270> by<00:05:08.450> one

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 
insert so we just did this one by one

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.450 
insert so we just did this one by one
