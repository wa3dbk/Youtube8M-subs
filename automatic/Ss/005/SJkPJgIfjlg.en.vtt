00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.360
 the cocktail lawyer but the new 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.040

 cognac him I always have them I have a 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.439
 little bit of English sauce 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.060
 I like that I'm going to add a little 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.929
 little tobacco square 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.070

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.360
 red at the end of the clock but here is the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.500
 base of my cocktail sauce I add the 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.840
 ketchup to give him this beautiful 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.710
 pink color so characteristic all 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.710

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:53.160
 this is sauce ready it's ready 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.930
 I decided with my lawyer everything 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.670
 just that what I did I 'm going 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.289
 h and I put a little lemon juice 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.489
 to make it a little couch amollois he 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.619
 is already internet press gain a little 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:08.700
 of time so in my lawyer I add 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.939
 a little bit of my sauce still forms a 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.939
 a bit 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.520
 here I do something pretty 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.740
 thick and now i'm going to add the 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.090
 crab crumbs and then taste 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.950
 you draw you dissect the crab 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.979
 be good exists in box it works very 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.979
 well 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.800
 go to dressage 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.160

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:46.509
 polar with very fast I have here my 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:53.320
 polar bread that is pretty like anything 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:56.009
 we're going to garnish with my preparation in 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:04.090
 up to 1 cm from the edges no more 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:06.610
 important withdrawal hop on I have a 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.440
 organic lemon that I washed it will bring 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:13.240
 a lot a lot of freshness a lot 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:18.370
 peps in my dish here 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:26.440
 and then I add the iceberg that I 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:29.440
 cut in chiffonnade is not bad I 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.000
 take back the second polar pair game 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.290
 sit on it and there I move it 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.360
 lightly pressing on it 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.300
 does that come to stick my bread and 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.000
 see it overflows just a little bit 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.620
 it's over together at home we're going 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.700
