have this cool tip that you basically

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.869 
have this cool tip that you basically
extend<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.680> this<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.219> tube<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.430> will<00:00:47.730> go

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
extend and this is the tube that will go

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.270 
extend and this is the tube that will go
inside<00:00:48.090> your<00:00:48.539> enclosure<00:00:48.870> whether<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.710> have<00:00:49.950> a

glass terrarium an aquarium any of those

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.660 
glass terrarium an aquarium any of those
kinds<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.539> things<00:00:54.600> would<00:00:55.410> enclosure<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.340> how

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
kinds of things would enclosure so how

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.549 
kinds of things would enclosure so how
do<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.850> get<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.059> inside<00:00:57.390> pretty<00:00:57.960> simple<00:00:58.410> if

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
do you get it inside pretty simple if

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.740 
do you get it inside pretty simple if
you<00:00:58.980> have<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.160> screen<00:00:59.550> top<00:00:59.820> you<00:01:00.420> could<00:01:00.600> just

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
you have a screen top you could just

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.900 
you have a screen top you could just
make<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.930> little<00:01:01.199> slit<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.739> slide<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.640> tube

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
make a little slit and slide this tube

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.880 
make a little slit and slide this tube
down<00:01:03.149> into<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.570> slit<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.260> screen<00:01:04.530> top<00:01:04.710> or

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
down into the slit on the screen top or

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.710 
down into the slit on the screen top or
if<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.220> have<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.400> wood<00:01:05.580> enclosure<00:01:05.880> make<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> hole

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
if you have a wood enclosure make a hole

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.690 
if you have a wood enclosure make a hole
exactly<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.380> same<00:01:07.860> size<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.549> you

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
exactly the same size of this and you

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.789 
exactly the same size of this and you
can<00:01:08.850> insert<00:01:09.180> it<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:10.080> there's<00:01:10.350> lots<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.650> ways

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
can insert it in so there's lots of ways

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.250 
can insert it in so there's lots of ways
to<00:01:10.830> get<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.220> inside<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:12.840> other<00:01:12.960> thing<00:01:13.229> that

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
to get it inside the other thing that

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.320 
to get it inside the other thing that
that's<00:01:13.860> cool<00:01:14.130> about<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.909> comes<00:01:15.090> with

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
that's cool about this is it comes with

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.660 
that's cool about this is it comes with
a<00:01:15.360> reservoir<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:16.110> fits<00:01:16.619> right<00:01:17.159> on<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.460> top

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
a reservoir that fits right on the top

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.120 
a reservoir that fits right on the top
here<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.210> need<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.049> screw<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.380> down<00:01:19.500> but<00:01:19.979> if<00:01:20.070> you

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
here I need to screw it down but if you

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.800 
here I need to screw it down but if you
don't<00:01:20.280> like<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.520> size<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:20.909> reservoir<00:01:21.390> guess

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
don't like the size this reservoir guess

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.960 
don't like the size this reservoir guess
what<00:01:22.049> that's<00:01:22.200> standard<00:01:22.770> top<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.460> can<00:01:23.610> even<00:01:23.759> do

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
what that's standard top you can even do

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.890 
what that's standard top you can even do
a<00:01:24.740> like<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.770> coca-cola<00:01:26.130> bottle<00:01:26.430> or<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.450> Pepsi

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
a like a coca-cola bottle or a Pepsi

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.780 
a like a coca-cola bottle or a Pepsi
bottle<00:01:27.930> any<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.409> those<00:01:28.500> kind<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.920> bottles<00:01:29.640> and

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
bottle any of those kind of bottles and

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.490 
bottle any of those kind of bottles and
they'll<00:01:30.210> work<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.570> fit<00:01:30.750> on<00:01:30.869> top<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.229> here<00:01:31.439> and

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
they'll work to fit on top of here and

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.800 
they'll work to fit on top of here and
then<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.159> just<00:01:32.369> basically<00:01:32.579> put<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.659> right

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
then you just basically put it right

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.890 
then you just basically put it right
down<00:01:33.869> on<00:01:34.229> top<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.710> let<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.460> fogging<00:01:35.820> begin<00:01:36.360> so

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
down on top and let the fogging begin so

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.980 
down on top and let the fogging begin so
on<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:37.829> knob<00:01:38.040> right<00:01:38.310> here<00:01:38.840> it's<00:01:39.840> an

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
on this knob right here it's an

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.530 
on this knob right here it's an
adjustment<00:01:40.259> knob<00:01:40.650> 180<00:01:41.310> degree<00:01:41.700> does<00:01:41.970> just<00:01:42.420> but

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
adjustment knob 180 degree does just but

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.760 
adjustment knob 180 degree does just but
not<00:01:42.689> so<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.869> could<00:01:42.960> do<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.110> little<00:01:43.350> bit<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.619> fog

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
not so you could do a little bit of fog

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.010 
not so you could do a little bit of fog
or<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:45.049> whole<00:01:46.049> lot<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.710> fog<00:01:47.600> so<00:01:48.600> when<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.810> first

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
or a whole lot of fog so when you first

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.660 
or a whole lot of fog so when you first
put<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.380> on<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.740> takes<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:50.009> couple<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.399> minutes

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
put this on it takes a couple of minutes

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.090 
put this on it takes a couple of minutes
for<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.119> actually<00:01:51.509> start<00:01:52.020> going<00:01:52.170> but<00:01:52.740> once

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
for it to actually start going but once

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.499 
for it to actually start going but once
you<00:01:53.189> put<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.729> allow<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.939> water<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.329> get

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
you put it on and allow the water to get

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.149 
you put it on and allow the water to get
inside<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.899> reservoir<00:01:55.079> starts<00:01:55.860> up<00:01:55.979> right

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
inside the reservoir starts up right

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.410 
inside the reservoir starts up right
away<00:01:56.280> like<00:01:56.549> this<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.799> this<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:59.040> great<00:01:59.340> for<00:01:59.579> how

you<00:02:03.630> want<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.140> actually<00:02:04.350> time<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.159> we<00:02:05.549> have<00:02:05.640> a

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
you want to actually time it we have a

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.340 
you want to actually time it we have a
great<00:02:05.939> programmable<00:02:06.540> timer<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.079> can
