was weird I was a sophomore in high
school<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.219> was<00:00:44.309> pretty<00:00:44.520> young<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.820> high

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
school so I was pretty young in high

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.869 
school so I was pretty young in high
school<00:00:45.629> wise<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.980> was<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.190> big<00:00:47.670> difference

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
school wise and it was a big difference

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.630 
school wise and it was a big difference
going<00:00:48.239> from<00:00:48.690> high<00:00:49.020> school<00:00:49.050> with<00:00:49.440> around<00:00:49.950> 3,000

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
going from high school with around 3,000

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.950 
going from high school with around 3,000
people<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.120> go<00:00:51.270> into<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.480> high<00:00:51.600> school<00:00:51.870> with

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
people that go into a high school with

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.010 
people that go into a high school with
around<00:00:52.230> maybe<00:00:52.829> 500<00:00:53.460> kids<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.660> was<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.840> big

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
around maybe 500 kids so it was a big

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.920 
around maybe 500 kids so it was a big
cultural<00:00:55.410> change<00:00:55.500> -<00:00:56.210> well<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.329> wasn't<00:00:57.480> easy<00:00:57.719> of

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
cultural change - well it wasn't easy of

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.720 
cultural change - well it wasn't easy of
course<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.440> know<00:00:58.559> as<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.680> father<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.370> think<00:00:59.609> it

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
course you know as a father I think it

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.180 
course you know as a father I think it
was<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.660> little<00:01:01.170> bit<00:01:01.289> easier<00:01:01.739> for<00:01:01.770> me<00:01:02.010> but

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
was a little bit easier for me but

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.680 
was a little bit easier for me but
certainly<00:01:02.430> there<00:01:02.550> was<00:01:02.640> lots<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.940> tears<00:01:03.480> from

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
certainly there was lots of tears from

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.010 
certainly there was lots of tears from
the<00:01:03.809> wife<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:05.220> know<00:01:05.250> my<00:01:06.150> mother<00:01:06.659> and

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
the wife and you know my mother and

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.539 
the wife and you know my mother and
different<00:01:07.500> things<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.890> grandmas<00:01:08.250> but

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
different things in the grandmas but

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.520 
different things in the grandmas but
it's<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.760> it's<00:01:09.450> an<00:01:09.630> experience<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.140> sometimes

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
it's a it's an experience that sometimes

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.859 
it's a it's an experience that sometimes
you<00:01:10.710> have<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.549> kind<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.880> embrace<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.750> say

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
you have to kind of embrace and say

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.060 
you have to kind of embrace and say
that's<00:01:13.049> something<00:01:13.320> different<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.920> they're

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
that's something different that they're

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.800 
that's something different that they're
doing<00:01:14.369> it's<00:01:14.580> going<00:01:15.030> off<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.360> build<00:01:15.540> families

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
doing it's going off to build families

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.870 
doing it's going off to build families
is<00:01:16.229> really<00:01:16.560> kind<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:16.799> unique<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.340> world<00:01:17.520> of

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
is really kind of unique in the world of

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.330 
is really kind of unique in the world of
ice<00:01:18.420> hockey<00:01:18.720> it's<00:01:19.409> not<00:01:19.590> done<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.920> other<00:01:20.040> sports

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
ice hockey it's not done in other sports

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.859 
ice hockey it's not done in other sports
like<00:01:20.610> football<00:01:20.640> basketball

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
like football basketball

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.690 
like football basketball
so<00:01:22.170> it's<00:01:22.950> something<00:01:23.189> as<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.310> parent<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.640> have

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
so it's something as a parent you have

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.539 
so it's something as a parent you have
to<00:01:23.820> be<00:01:23.909> willing<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.509> trust<00:01:24.780> your<00:01:24.930> son<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:26.430> go

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
to be willing to trust your son to go

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.550 
to be willing to trust your son to go
off<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.060> go<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.299> another<00:01:27.540> country<00:01:27.810> on<00:01:28.020> top<00:01:28.350> of

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
off and go to another country on top of

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.289 
off and go to another country on top of
anything<00:01:29.400> else<00:01:29.549> it's<00:01:29.700> not<00:01:29.759> like<00:01:29.970> just<00:01:30.119> going

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
anything else it's not like just going

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.539 
anything else it's not like just going
down<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.630> road<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:31.020> think<00:01:31.770> in<00:01:31.950> five<00:01:32.280> years

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
down the road I think in five years

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.640 
down the road I think in five years
we've<00:01:32.850> really<00:01:33.030> been<00:01:33.570> able<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.900> generate<00:01:34.409> more

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
we've really been able to generate more

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.929 
we've really been able to generate more
awareness<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.220> Western<00:01:35.520> Michael<00:01:35.820> tee

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
awareness of the Western Michael tee

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.580 
awareness of the Western Michael tee
through<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.329> prospects<00:01:36.810> camp<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.380> think

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
through the prospects camp and I think
