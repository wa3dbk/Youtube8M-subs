display<00:04:17.660> in<00:04:17.870> the<00:04:17.900> hardware<00:04:18.470> so<00:04:19.070> it's<00:04:19.250> you<00:04:19.549> have

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
display in the hardware so it's you have

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.140 
display in the hardware so it's you have
a<00:04:19.820> complete<00:04:20.859> seal<00:04:21.859> around<00:04:22.100> around<00:04:22.729> the<00:04:22.850> device

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
a complete seal around around the device

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.180 
a complete seal around around the device
that<00:04:23.479> keeps<00:04:23.870> any<00:04:24.139> reflection<00:04:24.710> from<00:04:24.830> coming

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
that keeps any reflection from coming

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.530 
that keeps any reflection from coming
inside<00:04:25.340> so<00:04:25.669> that<00:04:25.790> makes<00:04:26.000> it<00:04:26.090> brighter<00:04:26.330> by
