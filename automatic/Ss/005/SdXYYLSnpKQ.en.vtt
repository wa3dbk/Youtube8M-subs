00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.510 
doesn't have a chunky friend brick yeah
it<00:01:16.170> isn't<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.619> brick<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.950> like<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.310> feeling

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
it isn't the brick I like that feeling

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.700 
it isn't the brick I like that feeling
but<00:01:18.420> having<00:01:18.659> worked<00:01:18.900> on<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.350> I'm<00:01:19.470> not<00:01:19.650> a

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
but having worked on it and I'm not a

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.350 
but having worked on it and I'm not a
touchscreen<00:01:20.009> guy<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.430> like<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.880> be<00:01:21.119> on<00:01:21.270> the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
touchscreen guy I like it to be on the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.539 
touchscreen guy I like it to be on the
keyboard<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.710> thought<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.040> keyboard<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.520> a

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
keyboard so I thought the keyboard is a

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.999 
keyboard so I thought the keyboard is a
little<00:01:23.790> different<00:01:24.119> but<00:01:24.780> working<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.890> to

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
little different but working on it to

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.649 
little different but working on it to

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
communication and the devices used for

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.520 
communication and the devices used for
communication<00:02:44.700> are<00:02:44.820> moving<00:02:45.350> obviously<00:02:46.350> there

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
communication are moving obviously there

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.410 
communication are moving obviously there
is<00:02:46.650> going<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.920> be<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.340> set<00:02:47.580> of<00:02:47.700> newcomers<00:02:48.180> who

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
is going to be a set of newcomers who

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.480 
is going to be a set of newcomers who
will<00:02:48.540> come<00:02:48.750> in<00:02:48.900> dazzle<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:49.740> with<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:50.040> newness

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.490 
will come in dazzle you with the newness
but<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.060> think<00:02:51.330> what<00:02:51.480> goes<00:02:51.660> behind<00:02:51.870> Nokia<00:02:52.350> and<00:02:52.470> I

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
but I think what goes behind Nokia and I

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
company which I truly believe in terms

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.970 
company which I truly believe in terms
of<00:03:20.790> devices<00:03:21.000> I've<00:03:21.510> used<00:03:21.720> all<00:03:22.410> kind<00:03:22.650> of<00:03:22.770> phones

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
of devices I've used all kind of phones

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.470 
of devices I've used all kind of phones
initially<00:03:23.400> when<00:03:23.700> they<00:03:23.820> came<00:03:23.940> out<00:03:24.120> I<00:03:24.270> think

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
initially when they came out I think

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.360 
initially when they came out I think
there<00:03:24.630> is<00:03:24.660> no<00:03:24.930> more<00:03:25.140> user-friendly<00:03:25.680> telephone

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
there is no more user-friendly telephone

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.790 
there is no more user-friendly telephone
or<00:03:26.720> communicating<00:03:27.720> device<00:03:27.989> in<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.380> world<00:03:28.410> and

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
or communicating device in the world and

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.860 
or communicating device in the world and
this<00:03:29.190> I<00:03:29.340> say<00:03:29.580> you<00:03:30.030> know<00:03:30.150> you<00:03:30.239> can<00:03:30.420> be<00:03:30.540> dazzled

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
this I say you know you can be dazzled

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.690 
this I say you know you can be dazzled
by<00:03:30.930> some<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.920> newness<00:03:32.250> of<00:03:32.370> certain<00:03:32.670> things

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
by some the newness of certain things

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.970 
by some the newness of certain things
will<00:03:33.060> obviously<00:03:33.330> invoke<00:03:33.750> an<00:03:33.930> interest<00:03:34.470> but<00:03:34.950> I

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
will obviously invoke an interest but I

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.110 
will obviously invoke an interest but I
think<00:03:35.220> at<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.370> end<00:03:35.400> of<00:03:35.670> it<00:03:35.790> all<00:03:35.940> the

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
think at the end of it all the

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.729 
think at the end of it all the
sustainance<00:03:36.600> of<00:03:36.750> Nokia<00:03:37.050> is<00:03:37.110> going<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.410> be<00:03:37.530> that

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
sustainance of Nokia is going to be that

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.140 
sustainance of Nokia is going to be that
every<00:03:38.040> time<00:03:38.220> it<00:03:38.310> comes<00:03:38.520> out<00:03:38.670> with<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:38.880> device

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
every time it comes out with the device

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.790 
every time it comes out with the device
it's<00:03:39.810> more<00:03:40.050> than<00:03:40.110> a<00:03:40.200> device<00:03:40.440> it's<00:03:40.650> saying

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
it's more than a device it's saying

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:46.430 
it's more than a device it's saying
