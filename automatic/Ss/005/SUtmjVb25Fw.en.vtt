a startling piece of hardware I'm gonna
start<00:00:16.470> off<00:00:16.619> by<00:00:16.680> just<00:00:16.800> telling<00:00:17.100> you<00:00:17.310> super<00:00:18.029> thin

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
start off by just telling you super thin

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.939 
start off by just telling you super thin
when<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:18.750> feel<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.380> hold<00:00:19.619> it<00:00:19.740> in<00:00:19.859> your

when you feel it and hold it in your
hand<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.400> feel<00:00:20.580> it's<00:00:20.730> almost<00:00:20.970> impossibly

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
hand you feel it's almost impossibly

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.040 
hand you feel it's almost impossibly
well-built<00:00:22.289> very<00:00:23.189> solid<00:00:23.760> yet<00:00:23.939> very<00:00:24.390> thin<00:00:24.840> so<00:00:24.990> I

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
well-built very solid yet very thin so I

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.320 
well-built very solid yet very thin so I
like<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.529> combination<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:26.160> these<00:00:26.820> two<00:00:27.090> things

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
like the combination of these two things

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.120 
like the combination of these two things
but<00:00:27.810> there<00:00:27.960> are<00:00:28.050> some<00:00:28.289> other<00:00:28.560> things<00:00:28.890> in<00:00:29.010> this

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
but there are some other things in this

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.500 
but there are some other things in this
one<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.550> really<00:00:29.730> like<00:00:30.000> first<00:00:30.330> and

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
one that I really like first and

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.269 
one that I really like first and
foremost<00:00:30.929> they<00:00:31.109> give<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.740> very

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
foremost they give you a very

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.010 
foremost they give you a very
interesting<00:00:32.430> case<00:00:33.030> with<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.390> for<00:00:33.809> those<00:00:33.960> who

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
interesting case with it for those who

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.139 
interesting case with it for those who
say<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.590> case<00:00:35.070> with<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.370> phone<00:00:35.579> what's<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.969> big

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
say a case with the phone what's the big

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.670 
say a case with the phone what's the big
deal<00:00:36.329> you've<00:00:36.480> got<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.809> see<00:00:37.050> this<00:00:37.230> case<00:00:37.500> to

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
deal you've got to see this case to

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.470 
deal you've got to see this case to
really<00:00:37.890> understand<00:00:38.370> it's<00:00:38.879> like<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.090> hard

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
really understand it's like a hard

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.260 
really understand it's like a hard
silicon<00:00:40.140> yet<00:00:40.710> works<00:00:41.280> very<00:00:41.489> well<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:42.030> it's

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
silicon yet works very well and it's

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.150 
silicon yet works very well and it's
perfectly<00:00:42.780> suited<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.410> phone<00:00:43.649> it's<00:00:44.010> a

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
perfectly suited to the phone it's a

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.639 
perfectly suited to the phone it's a
kind<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.730> translucent<00:00:45.600> white<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.170> think<00:00:46.559> it's

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
kind of a translucent white I think it's

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.590 
kind of a translucent white I think it's
a<00:00:46.739> very<00:00:47.039> interesting<00:00:47.610> case<00:00:47.820> all<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.480> right

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
a very interesting case all the right

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.740 
a very interesting case all the right
cutout<00:00:49.020> fits<00:00:49.410> very<00:00:49.620> well<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.190> again<00:00:50.280> adds<00:00:51.030> no

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
cutout fits very well and again adds no

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.350 
cutout fits very well and again adds no
bulk<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> phone<00:00:52.920> at<00:00:53.070> all<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.430> almost<00:00:54.120> no

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
bulk to the phone at all and almost no

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.970 
bulk to the phone at all and almost no
weight<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.899> second<00:00:55.350> thing<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.590> even<00:00:55.829> more

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
weight the second thing is even more

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.020 
weight the second thing is even more
interesting<00:00:56.270> right<00:00:57.270> here<00:00:57.859> at<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.160> edge<00:00:59.460> is

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
interesting right here at the edge is

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.150 
interesting right here at the edge is
what<00:01:00.359> looks<00:01:00.629> like<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:01.079> stylus<00:01:01.590> let<00:01:01.770> me<00:01:01.890> take<00:01:02.039> it

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
what looks like a stylus let me take it

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.840 
what looks like a stylus let me take it
out<00:01:02.539> it<00:01:03.539> runs<00:01:04.229> out<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.650> be<00:01:04.820> it's<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:06.590> pin<00:01:07.590> yes<00:01:08.159> so

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
out it runs out to be it's a pin yes so

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.050 
out it runs out to be it's a pin yes so
your<00:01:09.119> SIM<00:01:09.570> card<00:01:09.920> remember<00:01:10.920> every<00:01:11.520> single<00:01:11.700> time

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
your SIM card remember every single time

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.820 
your SIM card remember every single time
these<00:01:12.270> new<00:01:12.479> phones<00:01:12.810> these<00:01:13.140> mini<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.619> micro

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
these new phones these mini and micro

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.399 
these new phones these mini and micro
SIM<00:01:14.280> cards<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.790> problem<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.360> always<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:16.259> you

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
SIM cards the problem is always that you

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.960 
SIM cards the problem is always that you
have<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.619> find<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.220> right<00:01:17.369> pin<00:01:17.790> it's

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
have to find the right pin it's

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.670 
have to find the right pin it's
somewhere<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.509> box<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.200> phone<00:01:19.439> and

somewhere in the box of the phone and
sometimes<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.400> can't<00:01:20.640> find<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.090> can't

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
sometimes you can't find it you can't

change this thing this one comes with it
built-in<00:01:23.490> isn't<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.060> intelligent<00:01:24.570> well<00:01:25.020> it

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
built-in isn't that intelligent well it

is intelligent except for one thing

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.260 
is intelligent except for one thing
the<00:01:28.770> hole<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.400> left<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.850> actually<00:01:30.150> the
