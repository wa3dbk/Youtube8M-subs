00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.100
 and how about youtube friends today we are 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.959
 in a new video and good guys in this 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.360
 occasion we are in the riva of a call 

00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:10.040
 more animals mod good because this mod 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.170
 as its name says it will add us 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.240
 many more animals to our world 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.710
 of minecraft pocket edition something very 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.850
 father in this way is that all 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.130
 animals that are watching 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.840
 then they are generated randomly 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.360
 in our minecraft pocket world 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.430
 edition 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.410
 just be careful with these 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.630
 two with the killer villager that is this 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.790
 bastard and with the terrorist who is 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.220
 here you see it ss that is the terrorist 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.690
 be very careful with those two already 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.100
 that they when they come 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.460
 they were trying to kill so I recommend them 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:42.480
 run from them or not pass near 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.480
 they this world will be added elephants 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.480
 lions 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.460
 as well 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.340
 I think it's a rabbit the rabbits there are 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.780
 different colors but how can they how 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.610
 you can realize they start to fall from the 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.200
 sky all these animals also we 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.960
 add to kangaroos panda bears plus rabbits 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.190
 well here is a blue bunny the panda 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.910
 has blue eyes 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.700
 hi panda 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.619
 as he does his neck see 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.200
 you could practically say that this 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.840
 mode is added from all modes only 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.789
 The eagles are also missing. 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.070
 that take a little while to load but 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:24.590
 otherwise the mod is very well done 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.539
 I really loved it very much and what 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.460
 better is that we can ride the 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.409
 horses will also add horses 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.890
 to ride a horse we will need 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.840
 capture this armor that I'm 10 482 and it 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.700
 craft already with 6 diamonds and a block of 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.289
 blue wool in the middle of that I'm going to 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.990
 fly because if they do not want to kill me 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:45.409
 and we will also need the rope that 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.360
 I'm 483 and be craft already with two threads 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.950
 and a leather we are also going to add 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.380
 this monkey will also add a 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.210
 a shotgun but the truth that the 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.159
 I was testing and it has no use 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.009
 so it's practically useless 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.079
 guys or if someone knows how to use it 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.900
 leave it in the comments 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:07.840
 also us at the time of killing 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.660
 the birds will not release food that 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.150
 we can eat and also the giraffes do not 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.100
 they will release food with sight we will be lacking 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.810
 food and we can cook it so that 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.910
 So let us rise more hearts of life 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.890
 those are the only two mobs that you 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.720
 europe will make food and I tell them too 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.350
 you can ride the horses let me see 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.450
 if I find the horse's egg 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.340
 I do not know right here is here 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.800
 it's here it's more like a donkey 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.140
 see it and they will touch it with the armor 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.180
 and how can you see at the moment of 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.330
 put on the rope starts running and 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.280
 is flying the horse teasing hard that 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.310
 no and let's quickly put it what 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.990
 come on, guys are running 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.730
 they are going to put it quickly and they touch it and 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.220
 as you can see we do not need to 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.650
 carrot to control it is controlled 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.780
 easily and well nothing guys I think that 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.580
 that would be all for the mode to install 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.380
 this mode will need to download the 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.150
 zip file that I'll leave in the 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.430
 description of this video since what 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.170
 have done the unzip and then 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.800
 they will go to block launcher they will import the 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.350
 mod 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.570
 as always but also they will put 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.060
 the texture of the mod because if not the 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.830
 animals will not look good I recommend them 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.720
 that the first time they have internet to 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.000
 that the animals are well discharged and 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.290
 can enjoy it correctly and therefore 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
 nothing friends I think that would be all 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.550
 I hope you liked it said dale 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.550
 like subscribe and until next time
