00:00:04.994 --> 00:00:09.646
Hello, this is Jose Carasco speaking to you, director 
 of Ses Moreres, from the island of Menorca

00:00:09.646 --> 00:00:15.356
today we are going to visit a fantastic country estate in the Alaior area

00:00:15.356 --> 00:00:18.436
a property with 10.000 square metres of land

00:00:18.436 --> 00:00:22.441
and where there stands this house from the 18th century

00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:27.894
it's beautiful and conserves all of its original style

00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:33.435
it's a grand house on two floors with 
 more than 500 square metres built area

00:00:33.435 --> 00:00:36.977
as you can see the surroundings are magnificent

00:00:36.977 --> 00:00:41.438
there are several garden areas, large gardens

00:00:41.438 --> 00:00:51.335
this construction grabs your attention, it is a 
 swimming pool completely integrated into its surroundings

00:00:51.335 --> 00:01:03.456
these wonderful gardens conceal all kinds of fruit trees, 
 fig, lemon, almond and several other kinds

00:01:03.456 --> 00:01:09.756
and in this mature garden we find some magnificent trees

00:01:09.756 --> 00:01:16.776
for example, beautiful old and twisted olive trees

00:01:16.776 --> 00:01:24.754
and also a holm oak tree many hundreds 
 of years old next to the house

00:01:24.754 --> 00:01:31.335
this magnificent property does not lack any little detail

00:01:31.335 --> 00:01:45.750
here for example we find this old pig sty, which 
 has now been converted into a garden house

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.900
as you can see you can really appreciate these old feeding troughs

00:01:50.898 --> 00:01:59.230
it's one of the most rustic buildings that you could find

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.820
let's go and see the house close-up

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:14.800
just look at this old gate, it's a typical Menorquin gate and judging by 
 its appearance is more than 100 years old, one of its features

00:02:14.805 --> 00:02:20.520
and here as you can see we have this 
 large stone terrace, typical stone from Menorca

00:02:20.524 --> 00:02:24.470
it is mares stone as I have explained in many videos

00:02:24.471 --> 00:02:30.730
and this is the house which has great presence, it's a very elegant house

00:02:30.732 --> 00:02:34.520
as I said, there are more than 500 square metres constructed area

00:02:34.515 --> 00:02:45.720
and it has magnificent features, very attractive features such 
 as this stone floor, it is beautiful

00:02:45.718 --> 00:02:51.480
and here, for example, we can see this old oven

00:02:51.478 --> 00:03:00.390
and this house has all the sought-after features 
 of an original old Menorquin country house

00:03:00.388 --> 00:03:13.940
for example this covered terrace with these arches which 
 in the height of summer give enviable cool shade

00:03:13.936 --> 00:03:19.430
we also have areas with pine trees inside the property

00:03:19.427 --> 00:03:25.770
these shady pine woods are very cool in mid-summer

00:03:25.767 --> 00:03:40.510
and summarizing it's a property that lacks nothing, it has 
 mains electricity, its own abundant well, a varied landscape

00:03:40.507 --> 00:03:46.170
and here behind this wall there are the remains of an old barn

00:03:46.174 --> 00:03:56.160
it is a building in addition to the property, and 
 for sure it can be made good use of 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.990
let's go and take a look at the inside of 
 the house and see what surprises it is hiding

00:04:02.987 --> 00:04:15.760
this beautiful covered terrace, which as you see has a fantastic height, 
 is the perfect place to meet with our friends and family

00:04:15.758 --> 00:04:20.820
and to use for all sorts of social events

00:04:20.818 --> 00:04:30.970
this is just the entrance hall which this elegant house 
 has and which captivates us from the first moment

00:04:30.967 --> 00:04:37.450
and here we find the most elegant part of the house

00:04:37.454 --> 00:04:41.210
here we have the main sitting room

00:04:41.206 --> 00:04:46.560
you can see the windows are English-style, sash windows

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.160
presided over by this ornate fireplace

00:04:52.162 --> 00:04:59.950
here for example we find this doorway with stained glass

00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:05.820
with this spacious bathroom

00:05:05.825 --> 00:05:14.440
and with this bathtub, from where you can bathe enjoying the country views

00:05:14.443 --> 00:05:19.080
we can see the swimming pool from here, there it is

00:05:19.075 --> 00:05:26.710
on the ground floor we find the bedrooms, like this one, it's an en-suite

00:05:26.714 --> 00:05:33.550
this is another outer bedroom, very spacious

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.970
and this house is ideal most of all for a large family

00:05:37.972 --> 00:05:46.240
or for someone who has a lot of family and friends 
 and who would like to let them stay independently

00:05:46.244 --> 00:05:50.120
where it would be pleasing to everyone

00:05:50.115 --> 00:05:55.140
this is the dining room, it has a high ceiling height

00:05:55.136 --> 00:05:59.590
just look at these rustic beams, they're wonderful

00:05:59.587 --> 00:06:02.370
lots of light

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:11.480
and finally, we have the largest room, the most spacious room

00:06:11.476 --> 00:06:14.190
lots of natural light as well as you can see

00:06:14.191 --> 00:06:20.460
it's a large open space with just one division here

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:29.810
and it would be ideal, from my point 
 of view, to convert into another bathroom

00:06:29.814 --> 00:06:36.900
but each have their own ideas and it has endless possibilities

00:06:36.895 --> 00:06:40.880
as you have seen, this is a fantastic and unique property

00:06:40.878 --> 00:06:49.210
it's in a very good condition and retains 
 all the spirit of its past splendour

00:06:49.213 --> 00:06:52.480
and without anything further, I'll remind you of our telephone number

00:06:52.478 --> 00:06:55.470

00:06:55.468 --> 00:06:58.280
and our e-mail address

00:06:58.281 --> 00:07:01.780

00:07:01.783 --> 00:07:06.120
I'll say goodbye to you and I hope to 
 see you again soon in the next video

00:07:06.118 --> 00:07:11.140
thank you and a fond farewell from Menorca
