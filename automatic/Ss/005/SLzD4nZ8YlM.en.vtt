starts to get caramelized right you see
those<00:03:42.520> little<00:03:42.790> bits<00:03:43.090> of<00:03:43.270> brown<00:03:43.540> on<00:03:43.570> the<00:03:43.870> top<00:03:43.900> of

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
those little bits of brown on the top of

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.830 
those little bits of brown on the top of
the<00:03:44.350> cheese<00:03:44.620> all<00:03:45.070> of<00:03:45.580> that<00:03:45.760> are<00:03:46.060> signaling<00:03:46.690> a

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
the cheese all of that are signaling a

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.990 
the cheese all of that are signaling a
GE<00:03:47.080> production<00:03:47.860> but<00:03:48.190> there's<00:03:48.370> no<00:03:48.580> reason<00:03:48.970> to

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
GE production but there's no reason to

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.540 
GE production but there's no reason to
throw<00:03:49.420> out<00:03:49.570> your<00:03:49.750> grill<00:03:50.370> realistically<00:03:51.370> how

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
throw out your grill realistically how

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.150 
throw out your grill realistically how
often<00:03:51.970> should<00:03:52.210> we<00:03:52.390> be<00:03:52.540> eating<00:03:52.570> this<00:03:53.110> way<00:03:53.350> if<00:03:53.950> we

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
often should we be eating this way if we

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.430 
often should we be eating this way if we
aim<00:03:54.400> to<00:03:54.430> eat<00:03:54.790> this<00:03:54.940> way<00:03:55.210> about<00:03:55.360> three<00:03:56.080> to<00:03:56.200> four

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
aim to eat this way about three to four

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.440 
aim to eat this way about three to four
times<00:03:56.710> a<00:03:57.010> week<00:03:57.220> I<00:03:57.460> think<00:03:57.940> that<00:03:58.150> would<00:03:58.330> be<00:03:58.420> a

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
times a week I think that would be a

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.450 
times a week I think that would be a
great<00:03:58.810> place<00:03:59.080> to<00:03:59.140> start<00:03:59.680> you<00:04:00.010> don't<00:04:00.130> have<00:04:00.340> to

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
great place to start you don't have to

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.490 
great place to start you don't have to
cut<00:04:00.640> out<00:04:00.790> grilling<00:04:01.240> everything<00:04:01.390> or<00:04:02.050> toasting

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
cut out grilling everything or toasting

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.410 
cut out grilling everything or toasting
everything<00:04:03.100> but<00:04:03.580> if<00:04:03.670> you<00:04:03.790> try<00:04:04.000> to<00:04:04.060> incorporate

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
everything but if you try to incorporate

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.330 
everything but if you try to incorporate
this<00:04:04.840> little<00:04:05.200> by<00:04:05.350> little<00:04:05.590> you<00:04:05.770> can<00:04:05.950> see<00:04:06.160> big

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
this little by little you can see big

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.570
