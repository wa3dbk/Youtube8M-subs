00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
the fire button it needs to do something

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.969 
the fire button it needs to do something
on<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.660> other<00:01:12.690> end<00:01:13.050> and<00:01:13.350> that's<00:01:13.710> where<00:01:13.890> you

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
on the other end and that's where you

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.250 
on the other end and that's where you
get<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.340> feedback<00:01:14.760> from<00:01:14.940> blowing<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.840> head<00:01:16.050> off

know I've always loved shotguns in all
of<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.920> aid<00:01:23.040> games<00:01:23.280> especially<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:24.060> think<00:01:24.479> if

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
of the aid games especially I think if

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.420 
of the aid games especially I think if
we<00:01:24.690> didn't<00:01:25.020> have<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> shotgun<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.800> lot<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.190> fans

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
we didn't have a shotgun a lot of fans

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.240 
we didn't have a shotgun a lot of fans
would<00:01:26.700> be<00:01:26.759> upset<00:01:27.240> but<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.720> crossbow<00:01:28.259> because

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
would be upset but the crossbow because

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.340 
would be upset but the crossbow because
it's<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.580> different<00:01:29.940> and<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.090> new<00:01:30.509> it's<00:01:30.900> almost

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
it's so different and so new it's almost
