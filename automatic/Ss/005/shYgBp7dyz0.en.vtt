now as well silver paint I'm gonna

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.770 
now as well silver paint I'm gonna
switch<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:08.220> color<00:00:08.580> of<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.880> wheels<00:00:09.090> over<00:00:09.389> to

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
switch the color of the wheels over to

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.200 
switch the color of the wheels over to
gunmetal<00:00:10.230> gray<00:00:10.590> with<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.340> Plasti<00:00:11.759> Dip<00:00:11.790> so

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
gunmetal gray with the Plasti Dip so

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.180 
gunmetal gray with the Plasti Dip so
everyone's<00:00:13.110> told<00:00:13.349> me<00:00:13.500> that<00:00:13.710> I<00:00:13.740> don't<00:00:13.920> actually

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
everyone's told me that I don't actually

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.390 
everyone's told me that I don't actually
need<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.780> tape<00:00:15.780> off<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.350> wheel<00:00:16.560> itself<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.310> if

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
need to tape off the wheel itself so if

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.429 
need to tape off the wheel itself so if
we<00:00:17.490> want<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.730> take<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.910> look<00:00:18.140> how<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:19.170> looks

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
we want to take a look how it looks

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.640 
we want to take a look how it looks
right<00:00:19.619> now<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:19.980> just<00:00:20.300> pure<00:00:21.300> silver<00:00:21.810> wheel<00:00:22.050> I'm

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
right now is just pure silver wheel I'm

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.910 
right now is just pure silver wheel I'm
going<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.369> tape<00:00:24.300> off<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.539> rotor<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.230> all<00:00:25.650> and

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
going to tape off the rotor is all and

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.800 
going to tape off the rotor is all and
then<00:00:26.070> I'm<00:00:26.189> gonna<00:00:26.310> use<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.910> cleaning<00:00:27.269> solution

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
then I'm gonna use the cleaning solution

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.529 
then I'm gonna use the cleaning solution
which<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.769> right<00:00:29.010> here<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.730> apply<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.179> the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
which is right here to apply to the

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.120 
which is right here to apply to the
wheel<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.990> get<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.289> all<00:00:31.439> coated<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:31.859> we<00:00:31.949> can

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
wheel to get it all coated so we can

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.540 
wheel to get it all coated so we can
apply<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.880> positive<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:34.160> all<00:00:35.160> right<00:00:35.340> so

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
apply the positive to it all right so

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.700 
apply the positive to it all right so
I've<00:00:35.700> taken<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.210> plastic<00:00:36.809> bag<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.230> kind<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.559> just

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
I've taken a plastic bag I kind of just

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.740 
I've taken a plastic bag I kind of just
cut<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.070> down<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.579> center<00:00:38.730> here<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.510> what<00:00:39.660> I'm

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
cut it down the center here and what I'm

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.569 
cut it down the center here and what I'm
gonna<00:00:39.840> do<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.230> pretty<00:00:40.440> much<00:00:40.559> just<00:00:40.829> stuff<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.399> on

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
gonna do is pretty much just stuff it on

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.580 
gonna do is pretty much just stuff it on
the<00:00:41.940> sides<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.570> rotor<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.140> we<00:00:43.260> don't<00:00:43.410> want

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
the sides of the rotor so we don't want

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.639 
the sides of the rotor so we don't want
that<00:00:43.739> rotor<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.420> get<00:00:45.420> any<00:00:45.660> Plasti<00:00:46.320> Dip<00:00:46.350> in

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
that rotor to get any Plasti Dip in

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.779 
that rotor to get any Plasti Dip in
there<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.160> take<00:00:47.430> this<00:00:47.640> let's<00:00:48.210> see<00:00:48.420> here<00:00:49.789> take

there so take this let's see here take

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.880 
there so take this let's see here take
this<00:00:51.079> kind<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.140> stuff<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.559> down<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.860> sides<00:00:53.160> I

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
this kind of stuff it down the sides I

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.600 
this kind of stuff it down the sides I
make<00:00:55.890> sure<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.129> get<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.399> whole<00:00:56.579> thing

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
make sure you get the whole thing

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.569 
make sure you get the whole thing
covered<00:00:57.180> up<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:57.809> nothing<00:00:58.649> gets<00:00:58.920> on<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.370> rotor

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
covered up so nothing gets on the rotor

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.420 
covered up so nothing gets on the rotor
itself<00:01:00.289> just<00:01:01.289> make<00:01:01.469> sure<00:01:01.710> there's<00:01:01.949> nothing<00:01:02.190> on

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
itself just make sure there's nothing on

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.979 
itself just make sure there's nothing on
the<00:01:02.579> actual<00:01:02.940> wheel<00:01:03.149> itself<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:03.780> I'm<00:01:03.840> gonna

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
the actual wheel itself so I'm gonna

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.170 
the actual wheel itself so I'm gonna
grab<00:01:04.229> my<00:01:04.260> towel<00:01:05.159> I've<00:01:05.430> already<00:01:05.700> cleaned<00:01:05.970> it

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.320 
bit more prep and then we'll get started
with<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.140> spray<00:01:16.939> well<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:17.970> just<00:01:18.030> finished

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
with the spray well I just finished

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.690 
with the spray well I just finished
cleaning<00:01:18.750> up<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.170> wheel<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.680> sprayed<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.549> down

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
cleaning up the wheel I sprayed it down

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.460 
cleaning up the wheel I sprayed it down
basically<00:01:21.270> with<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.509> cleaning<00:01:21.990> solution

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
basically with that cleaning solution

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.410 
basically with that cleaning solution
and<00:01:22.619> then<00:01:22.710> wiped<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.070> all<00:01:23.189> down<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.430> as<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.299> can

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
and then wiped it all down so as you can

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.170 
and then wiped it all down so as you can
see<00:01:24.540> you've<00:01:24.659> got<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.930> rotor<00:01:25.140> all<00:01:25.740> ready<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.970> go

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
see you've got the rotor all ready to go

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.569 
see you've got the rotor all ready to go
and<00:01:27.570> now<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.290> have<00:01:28.500> also<00:01:28.740> been<00:01:28.920> shaken<00:01:29.280> for<00:01:29.430> like

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
and now I have also been shaken for like

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.069 
and now I have also been shaken for like
the<00:01:29.700> last<00:01:29.880> couple<00:01:30.210> minutes<00:01:30.299> with<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.720> Plasti

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
the last couple minutes with the Plasti

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.069 
the last couple minutes with the Plasti
Dip<00:01:31.280> I'm<00:01:32.280> gonna<00:01:32.460> start<00:01:32.729> spraying<00:01:33.030> just<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.900> get

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
Dip I'm gonna start spraying just to get

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.929 
Dip I'm gonna start spraying just to get
coverage<00:01:34.439> on<00:01:34.680> each<00:01:35.040> spoke<00:01:35.310> basically<00:01:35.790> just

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
coverage on each spoke basically just

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.429 
coverage on each spoke basically just
kind<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.210> start<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.600> center<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.020> then<00:01:37.290> do

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
kind of start in the center and then do

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.800 
kind of start in the center and then do
the<00:01:37.560> sides<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.150> pretty<00:01:39.329> easy<00:01:39.420> wheel

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
the sides so this is a pretty easy wheel

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.350 
the sides so this is a pretty easy wheel
to<00:01:39.990> do<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:40.950> yeah<00:01:41.400> we<00:01:41.549> want<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.759> start<00:01:41.939> with<00:01:42.030> 50%

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
to do but yeah we want to start with 50%

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.359 
to do but yeah we want to start with 50%
transparency<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.009> first<00:01:44.220> time

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
transparency so this is the first time

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.550 
transparency so this is the first time
done<00:01:44.549> this<00:01:44.670> I'll<00:01:44.909> see<00:01:45.000> y'all<00:01:45.180> guys<00:01:45.390> here<00:01:46.290> we<00:01:46.380> go

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
done this I'll see y'all guys here we go

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:56.030 
done this I'll see y'all guys here we go
about<00:01:46.920> six<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.399> eight<00:01:47.579> inches<00:01:47.850> away

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:24.540 

there<00:01:57.040> it<00:01:57.160> is<00:01:57.990> okay<00:02:23.190> alright<00:02:24.190> so<00:02:24.220> now<00:02:24.520> that

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
there it is okay alright so now that

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.860 
there it is okay alright so now that
we've<00:02:24.730> got<00:02:24.880> each<00:02:25.000> spoke<00:02:25.270> I'm<00:02:25.450> just<00:02:25.600> gonna<00:02:25.690> do

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
we've got each spoke I'm just gonna do

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.930 
we've got each spoke I'm just gonna do
kind<00:02:26.050> of<00:02:26.170> a<00:02:26.260> short<00:02:26.560> beat<00:02:26.860> around<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.370> edges

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
kind of a short beat around the edges

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.180 
kind of a short beat around the edges
here<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.360> I<00:02:28.960> didn't<00:02:29.320> tape<00:02:29.410> off<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.590> tire<00:02:29.920> it's

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
here and I didn't tape off the tire it's

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.620 
here and I didn't tape off the tire it's
supposed<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:30.550> just<00:02:30.700> create<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.000> gap<00:02:31.240> so<00:02:31.420> we<00:02:31.480> can

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
supposed to just create a gap so we can

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:42.510 
supposed to just create a gap so we can
just<00:02:31.840> peel<00:02:32.020> it<00:02:32.140> off<00:02:32.260> basically<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:42.400> we're

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
just peel it off basically so we're

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.220 
just peel it off basically so we're
trying<00:02:42.670> to<00:02:42.850> avoid<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.330> runs<00:02:43.900> on<00:02:44.140> the

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
trying to avoid the the runs on the

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.980 
trying to avoid the the runs on the
first<00:02:44.470> coat<00:02:44.680> so<00:02:45.130> I<00:02:45.400> will<00:02:45.970> let<00:02:46.210> this<00:02:46.390> first<00:02:46.630> coat

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
first coat so I will let this first coat

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.850 
first coat so I will let this first coat
dry<00:02:48.030> for<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.060> couple<00:02:49.150> seconds<00:02:49.930> here<00:02:50.050> and<00:02:50.560> then

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
dry for a couple seconds here and then

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.040 
dry for a couple seconds here and then
we'll<00:02:51.190> get<00:02:51.280> back<00:02:51.460> at<00:02:51.700> it<00:02:51.730> we<00:02:52.660> actually<00:02:52.930> switch

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
we'll get back at it we actually switch

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.690 
we'll get back at it we actually switch
sides<00:02:53.410> of<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.590> cars<00:02:53.830> in<00:02:54.070> general<00:02:54.160> darker

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
sides of the cars in general darker

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.220 
sides of the cars in general darker
whenever<00:02:54.970> we're<00:02:55.180> working<00:02:55.210> on<00:02:55.510> this<00:02:55.660> side<00:02:55.870> also

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
whenever we're working on this side also

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.080 
whenever we're working on this side also
we're<00:02:57.160> getting<00:02:57.220> ready<00:02:57.430> to<00:02:57.580> start<00:02:57.790> on<00:02:58.000> the

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
we're getting ready to start on the

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.710 
we're getting ready to start on the
second<00:02:58.390> count

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
second count

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.650 
second count
so<00:02:59.040> we'll<00:03:00.040> probably<00:03:00.220> do<00:03:00.489> around<00:03:00.790> maybe<00:03:01.209> three

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
so we'll probably do around maybe three

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.750 
so we'll probably do around maybe three
four<00:03:02.080> coats<00:03:02.410> on<00:03:02.680> this<00:03:02.830> I<00:03:03.040> guess<00:03:03.250> it's<00:03:03.670> just

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
four coats on this I guess it's just

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.030 
four coats on this I guess it's just
whatever<00:03:04.030> it<00:03:04.270> starts<00:03:04.540> to<00:03:04.630> look<00:03:04.780> good<00:03:04.959> so<00:03:05.020> I<00:03:05.620> try

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
whatever it starts to look good so I try

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.370 
whatever it starts to look good so I try
to<00:03:06.100> get<00:03:06.220> about<00:03:06.430> 50%<00:03:06.989> transparency<00:03:07.989> so<00:03:08.260> I'm

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
to get about 50% transparency so I'm

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.830 
to get about 50% transparency so I'm
gonna<00:03:08.530> start<00:03:08.910> hitting<00:03:09.910> another<00:03:10.120> coat<00:03:10.450> this

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
gonna start hitting another coat this

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.770 
gonna start hitting another coat this
one

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
one

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:19.820

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
another kogas so we're gonna get started

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.530 
another kogas so we're gonna get started
on<00:03:39.240> our<00:03:39.420> third<00:03:39.720> code<00:03:40.790> we<00:03:41.790> just<00:03:42.090> let<00:03:42.210> the<00:03:42.300> second

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
on our third code we just let the second

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.420 
on our third code we just let the second
one<00:03:42.690> drive<00:03:42.870> for<00:03:42.900> about<00:03:43.080> 10<00:03:43.350> minutes<00:03:43.560> and<00:03:43.950> then

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
one drive for about 10 minutes and then

to<00:03:52.620> run<00:03:52.800> the<00:03:52.920> same<00:03:53.160> course<00:03:53.430> every<00:03:53.940> time<00:03:54.120> so

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
to run the same course every time so

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.790 
to run the same course every time so
like<00:03:54.390> ID<00:03:54.600> to<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.840> front<00:03:55.140> or<00:03:55.410> kind<00:03:55.680> of<00:03:55.740> the

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
like ID to the front or kind of the

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.680 
like ID to the front or kind of the
outside<00:03:55.950> rim<00:03:56.820> there<00:03:57.060> and<00:03:57.240> then<00:03:57.330> I<00:03:57.390> just<00:03:57.420> go

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
outside rim there and then I just go

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.140 
outside rim there and then I just go
each<00:03:57.870> spoke<00:03:58.200> so<00:03:58.530> I<00:03:58.770> just<00:03:59.220> stick<00:03:59.459> with<00:03:59.640> whatever

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
each spoke so I just stick with whatever

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.210 
each spoke so I just stick with whatever
you've<00:04:00.390> got<00:04:00.420> and<00:04:01.230> then<00:04:01.320> stay<00:04:01.530> with<00:04:01.650> it<00:04:01.830> so<00:04:02.070> me

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
you've got and then stay with it so me

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:30.040 
you've got and then stay with it so me
started

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.390 

and<00:04:31.050> on<00:04:31.170> the<00:04:31.290> inside<00:04:31.590> I'm<00:04:31.920> just<00:04:31.980> doing

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
and on the inside I'm just doing

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.430 
and on the inside I'm just doing
everything<00:04:32.490> right<00:04:32.910> now<00:04:33.090> I'm<00:04:33.210> going<00:04:33.510> over<00:04:33.660> the

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
everything right now I'm going over the

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.070 
everything right now I'm going over the
center<00:04:34.770> cap<00:04:35.010> and<00:04:35.430> the<00:04:35.880> lug<00:04:35.910> nuts<00:04:36.270> so<00:04:36.630> I<00:04:36.870> guess

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
center cap and the lug nuts so I guess

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.270 
center cap and the lug nuts so I guess
we'll<00:04:37.260> see<00:04:37.410> when<00:04:37.500> I<00:04:37.590> gotta<00:04:37.740> take<00:04:37.890> the<00:04:38.040> tires

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
we'll see when I gotta take the tires

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.570 
we'll see when I gotta take the tires
off<00:04:38.580> how<00:04:38.880> it<00:04:39.540> is<00:04:40.290> on<00:04:40.470> the<00:04:40.560> lug<00:04:40.740> nuts<00:04:40.950> I<00:04:41.250> don't

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
off how it is on the lug nuts I don't

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.360 
off how it is on the lug nuts I don't
want<00:04:41.850> it<00:04:41.940> to<00:04:42.150> like<00:04:42.390> peel<00:04:43.320> off<00:04:43.530> obviously<00:04:43.800> so<00:04:44.310> I

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
want it to like peel off obviously so I

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:52.190 
want it to like peel off obviously so I
guess<00:04:44.520> we'll<00:04:44.670> find<00:04:44.880> out<00:04:45.000> all<00:04:45.030> that<00:04:51.200> we

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
guess we'll find out all that we

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.230 
guess we'll find out all that we
actually<00:04:52.530> just<00:04:52.650> finished<00:04:52.800> up<00:04:53.220> all<00:04:53.430> the<00:04:54.000> wheels

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
actually just finished up all the wheels

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.380 
actually just finished up all the wheels
I<00:04:54.630> winded<00:04:55.350> up<00:04:55.470> waiting<00:04:56.340> overnight<00:04:56.820> because<00:04:57.240> we

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
I winded up waiting overnight because we

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.760 
I winded up waiting overnight because we
missed<00:04:57.690> the<00:04:57.780> bug<00:04:57.960> so<00:04:58.200> we<00:04:58.320> had<00:04:58.410> to<00:04:58.500> do<00:04:58.590> another

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
missed the bug so we had to do another

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.220 
missed the bug so we had to do another
coat<00:04:59.070> but<00:05:00.000> yeah<00:05:00.090> take<00:05:00.420> a<00:05:00.450> look<00:05:00.660> over<00:05:00.810> here<00:05:00.960> this

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.490 
is the end product it will get another
one<00:05:02.880> with<00:05:03.690> everything

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
one with everything

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.920 
one with everything
undone<00:05:05.130> but<00:05:05.400> this<00:05:06.000> is<00:05:06.150> pretty<00:05:06.330> much<00:05:06.420> done<00:05:06.750> I've

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
undone but this is pretty much done I've

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.510 
undone but this is pretty much done I've
still<00:05:07.110> got<00:05:07.260> the<00:05:07.350> plastic<00:05:07.500> on<00:05:07.950> there<00:05:08.190> but<00:05:08.370> we'll

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
still got the plastic on there but we'll

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.520 
still got the plastic on there but we'll
be<00:05:08.640> peeling<00:05:08.940> all<00:05:09.330> this<00:05:09.600> off<00:05:09.840> and<00:05:10.200> then<00:05:10.470> we'll

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
be peeling all this off and then we'll

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.260 
be peeling all this off and then we'll
be<00:05:10.680> taking<00:05:10.950> the<00:05:11.040> plastic<00:05:11.250> off<00:05:11.610> as<00:05:11.790> well<00:05:11.940> and

be taking the plastic off as well and

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.840 
be taking the plastic off as well and
then<00:05:12.720> we'll<00:05:13.170> probably<00:05:13.290> do<00:05:13.560> like<00:05:13.680> a<00:05:13.740> full<00:05:14.040> walk

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.300 
then we'll probably do like a full walk
around<00:05:15.240> of<00:05:15.570> the<00:05:15.990> whole<00:05:16.140> car<00:05:16.410> and<00:05:16.620> kind<00:05:17.040> of<00:05:17.160> give

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
I'm just going to try to go back and

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.980 
I'm just going to try to go back and
peel<00:05:26.130> off<00:05:26.340> whatever's<00:05:26.850> on<00:05:27.030> the<00:05:27.270> wheel<00:05:27.660> itself

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
peel off whatever's on the wheel itself

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.110 
peel off whatever's on the wheel itself
so<00:05:28.320> as<00:05:28.890> you<00:05:29.100> can<00:05:29.190> see<00:05:29.250> I<00:05:29.430> kind<00:05:29.610> of<00:05:29.700> just<00:05:29.820> grabbed

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
so as you can see I kind of just grabbed

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.810 
so as you can see I kind of just grabbed
a<00:05:30.270> section<00:05:31.130> and<00:05:32.130> I'm<00:05:32.250> just<00:05:32.370> gonna<00:05:32.490> get<00:05:32.700> it

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
a section and I'm just gonna get it

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.960 
a section and I'm just gonna get it
started<00:05:33.240> around<00:05:33.630> the<00:05:33.780> edge<00:05:33.990> I<00:05:34.610> guess<00:05:35.610> when

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
started around the edge I guess when

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.120 
started around the edge I guess when
you're<00:05:36.120> going<00:05:36.330> it's<00:05:36.690> a<00:05:36.840> good<00:05:37.050> idea<00:05:37.350> we<00:05:37.860> tried

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
you're going it's a good idea we tried

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.920 
you're going it's a good idea we tried
to<00:05:38.280> hit<00:05:38.460> the<00:05:38.580> edge<00:05:38.730> a<00:05:38.760> lot<00:05:39.180> so<00:05:39.540> that<00:05:39.690> it<00:05:39.810> would

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
to hit the edge a lot so that it would

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.410 
to hit the edge a lot so that it would
make<00:05:40.110> a<00:05:40.140> good<00:05:40.470> clean<00:05:40.890> peel<00:05:41.310> and<00:05:42.030> it<00:05:42.180> looks<00:05:42.330> like

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.420 
make a good clean peel and it looks like

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.790 
make a good clean peel and it looks like
it<00:05:42.690> is<00:05:42.810> actually<00:05:43.170> doing<00:05:43.380> a<00:05:43.440> pretty<00:05:43.560> good<00:05:43.650> job

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
it is actually doing a pretty good job

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.120 
it is actually doing a pretty good job
here<00:05:44.690> so<00:05:45.690> once<00:05:45.990> we're<00:05:46.200> done<00:05:46.350> it's<00:05:46.830> not<00:05:47.010> gonna

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.130 
here so once we're done it's not gonna

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.310 
here so once we're done it's not gonna
get<00:05:47.310> all<00:05:47.460> the<00:05:47.580> stuff<00:05:47.790> on<00:05:47.940> the<00:05:48.000> very<00:05:48.360> edge<00:05:48.630> so

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
get all the stuff on the very edge so

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.540 
get all the stuff on the very edge so
I'll<00:05:49.620> probably<00:05:49.740> come<00:05:50.010> back<00:05:50.190> with<00:05:50.370> like<00:05:50.490> a

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
I'll probably come back with like a

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.480 
I'll probably come back with like a
microfiber<00:05:51.210> cloth<00:05:51.450> and<00:05:52.110> hit<00:05:53.010> all<00:05:53.070> that<00:05:53.280> just

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
microfiber cloth and hit all that just

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.610 
microfiber cloth and hit all that just
to<00:05:53.610> make<00:05:53.700> sure<00:05:53.760> it's<00:05:54.060> totally<00:05:54.420> cleaned<00:05:54.690> up<00:05:54.870> but

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
to make sure it's totally cleaned up but

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
to make sure it's totally cleaned up but
this<00:05:55.800> is<00:05:56.070> making<00:05:56.340> a<00:05:56.550> pretty<00:05:56.730> good<00:05:56.850> line<00:05:58.640> looks

00:05:59.630 --> 00:05:59.640 
this is making a pretty good line looks

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:05.780 
this is making a pretty good line looks
like<00:05:59.820> right<00:06:00.060> across<00:06:01.520> let's<00:06:02.520> see
