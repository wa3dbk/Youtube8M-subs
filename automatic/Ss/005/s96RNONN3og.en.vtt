00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.219
 Hello friends welcome to area 

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:11.320
 training today I will be 0 and in this 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:13.870
 occasion we will see a very important issue 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.330
 to play fifa for tactics to 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.480
 the formations for the logic of the game 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.900
 which are the positions this is a subject 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.510
 very complex is a subject that requires 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.740
 robbery you can think your little bit and help 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.510
 much the planning of a great 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.360
 training because we know we need 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.250
 exactly to go to the positions in 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.730
 which we are playing I hope that they 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.290
 serve this tutorial and we will detail 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.500
 little by little each position of the game 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.680
 we all start with the goalie but this 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.600
 it's the most of the keeper for the 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.880
 goals are always going to play in your girl area 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.480
 or in the large area 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.489
 we have the central defenders 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.530
 the central effect can be defense 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.620
 central defense center left or 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.050
 right central defender what will happen 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.690
 with these defenses the general 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.510
 the natural central defender under the line 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.800
 of 5 the left defender and the defense 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.180
 right they will always be able when 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.310
 have 44 14 or a line of 3 the first 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.690
 case has to be loud and strong 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.720
 possibly fast 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.180
 the libero this position is a position 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.680
 little used is not within any of 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.730
 the predetermined formations of 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.700
 game is going to be only one way 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.219
 how can you say it 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.049
 edited that you can use it but it's 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:36.049
 good to know her the book always plays 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:38.149
 back behind the central defenses in 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.590
 the real football book is used almost 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.539
 It is always was always a book A 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.909
 little behind the central defender to 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.510
 cover the spaces in the fifa can 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.290
 to see if it works 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.780
 the laterals we have the l and lb their face 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.820
 john the ends of our defense without 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.890
 be players that are fast 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.450
 generally they are not asked to be very 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.670
 high since they are going to travel the bands 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.280
 without giving many times they will go down 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.740
 until the bottom line this depends on 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.810
 the characteristics of the player is his 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.729
 mentality to attack and defense only 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.770
 they have to study very well colors 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.670
 as dani alves speed and plan and ghella 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.440
 johnson big the large side 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.080
 lane what will happen to the 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.760
 lanes are going to play the five line 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.880
 generally the lanes where they go to 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.730
 exist and it's a position very similar to 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.790
 the laterals but they cross more section of 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.650
 the court and they attack a lot more than a 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.140
 lateral will always reach line of 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.820
 fund will always be in 5 and 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.560
 generally we will find the same 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.690
 as lateral, that is, there is no 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.460
 position for a van lane force 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.280
 to be the double and the defensive means 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.820
 he is a very important player is basic 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.280
 in the fifa it will be set as the 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.230
 defensive central half the one that covers 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.690
 the whole area or divided by your side 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.520
 left or your right side 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.040
 this defensive midfield will cover 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.560
 resort so this whole part does not 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.560
 they throw forward and it's going to give trick game 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.360
 your strong equator is usually going to 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.740
 play in that part of the field the 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.390
 midfielder 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:16.520
 the midfielder is going to be the mc the mv or the 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.430
 mv are half two flyers on the left 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.190
 wt by right to play lightly to 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.320
 in front of the half court that base is 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.180
 a distribution is not going to approach 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.920
 much to the small area but it is going to 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.290
 distribute the game throughout the midfield 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.870
 in these areas which is divided its 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.880
 position power by right or can by 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.310
 left depending on the training that 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.630
 are using a xavi iniesta are 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:44.510
 incredible powers in this position 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.510
 the lateral means is a position 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.340
 very good quick skilled managers 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.090
 and that they enter well and that they have good 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.980
 stuck to play glued to the bands 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.230
 can be a robben can be a ribery 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.870
 as 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.489
 others previously to play glued 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.400
 to the area always accompanied by 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.860
 players the flying media or some 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.900
 offensive forward fly are going to play 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.599
 by the bands can enter but they must 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.360
 center and throw him out of the area 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:16.489
 the flyers the flyers are players 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.609
 very good then in a ronaldo Christian 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.709
 a gareth bale to play in advance 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.229
 of the flying media this is a mistake 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.540
 of the game eye of and according to the criterion 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:28.490
 it should not be from there that it's a flyer 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.289
 for left but good is a detail 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.150
 the simple flyer is going to play in that area 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:34.010
 and will distribute games of the bands 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.160
 towards the front or they can pull 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.750
 it has to be fast it has to be 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.340
 skillful and with good punch 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:45.410
 the offensive midfielder the mc or this one is 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.350
 creative player who plays behind 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.900
 the forwards will always be behind 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.419
 cited from the large area to area transit 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.190
 big is enough handing out the game is going to 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:57.770
 being able to send centers will be able to send 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.920
 steps down has to have very good 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.230
 satin pass 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.990
 it is enough to distribute a lot of game and also 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.220
 can be a pivot to shoot at goal 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.010
 then he also has to detail him very 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:12.930
 well from outside the area the ends and 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.930
 now a 4-3-3 formation works 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.700
 usually they have to be 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.340
 open at the ends would be like a 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:23.250
 middle side like the ones we saw the md 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.200
 but he plays much later always 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.330
 stuck to the bands always reaching 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.430
 bottom line could be commissioned towards 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.530
 in or walk a center but always 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.440
 they are going to play on the sides of the court 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:37.230
 and forward in the front part of 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.840
 midfield the sb which is the second 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:43.290
 forward the perfect example is Leonel 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:46.170
 messi can be ss sdvosb and is for 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:48.450
 right or left and I before this one 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:51.960
 this position is xs that it refers to 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:55.770
 lcd is good lcd is the second forward 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:58.680
 as such, it is defined plays behind what 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:01.470
 which would be the forwards for example 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.060
 a 4-2-3-1 formation could play 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.850
 it will always be in the back 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.930
 and lightly put into the area when 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:09.000
 necessary but it will always be 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:12.150
 backing 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.210
 and we finally have the forward the 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.520
 cobbled from the most general position is 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.260
 the position that almost everyone knows by 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.050
 excellence could be universe move it 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.520
 could be karim in week a pooch 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.220
 benitez wherever he is in the 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.500
 heavens is a position totally of 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.390
 attack is a power that is always going to 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.530
 play in the golf area 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.090
 all the time you will be looking for the 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.920
 opportunity will be pending for a 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.960
 center will be waiting to be 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.390
 open to receive a pass and power 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.610
 throw to goal even run have to 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:44.729
 be fast players high powers that 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:46.660
 can finish a ball 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:48.250
 possibly because they can also have 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.569
 a successful forward like months of 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.429
 pending 

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:53.289
 and we are going to give a strong congratulation to 

00:06:51.429 --> 00:06:55.749

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:13.779
 each of the positions and exactly 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:16.479
 what part of the field of play 

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:19.209
 I hope it helps them improve their 

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:20.319
