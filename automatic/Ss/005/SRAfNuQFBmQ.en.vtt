00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
think I'm always ready but I'm actually

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.160 
think I'm always ready but I'm actually
never<00:02:45.980> ready<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.910> pros<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:47.570> cons<00:02:47.630> of<00:02:47.959> doing

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
never ready the pros and cons of doing

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.020 
never ready the pros and cons of doing
what<00:02:48.380> we<00:02:48.410> do<00:02:48.650> in<00:02:48.769> fact<00:02:48.980> that<00:02:49.130> everything<00:02:49.970> is

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
what we do in fact that everything is

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.550 
what we do in fact that everything is
happening<00:02:50.209> live<00:02:50.600> in<00:02:50.780> front<00:02:50.989> of<00:02:51.050> you<00:02:51.140> if

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
happening live in front of you if

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.259 
happening live in front of you if
something's<00:02:51.920> happened<00:02:52.220> it's<00:02:52.790> not<00:02:53.060> going<00:02:53.209> to

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
something's happened it's not going to

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.009 
something's happened it's not going to
happen<00:02:53.360> again<00:02:53.570> I<00:02:54.100> think<00:02:55.100> you<00:02:55.250> can<00:02:55.430> be<00:02:56.019> artistic

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
happen again I think you can be artistic

as<00:02:57.170> a<00:02:57.200> photographer<00:02:57.769> but<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.370> think<00:02:58.550> all<00:02:58.640> that

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
as a photographer but I think all that

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.729 
as a photographer but I think all that
is<00:02:58.850> is<00:02:59.150> really<00:02:59.180> just<00:02:59.510> trying<00:02:59.660> to<00:02:59.750> take<00:03:00.709> a

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
is is really just trying to take a

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.070 
is is really just trying to take a
different<00:03:01.010> shot<00:03:01.310> which<00:03:01.519> is<00:03:01.670> risky<00:03:02.420> because

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
different shot which is risky because

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.410 
different shot which is risky because
you<00:03:03.739> can<00:03:03.860> go<00:03:03.980> wrong<00:03:04.220> but<00:03:05.030> then<00:03:05.150> again<00:03:05.330> that's

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
you can go wrong but then again that's

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.240 
you can go wrong but then again that's
kind<00:03:05.569> of<00:03:05.660> half<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:05.959> fun

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.000 

so<00:03:11.880> dark<00:03:12.210> it's<00:03:12.810> it's<00:03:13.110> routing<00:03:13.560> routing<00:03:13.830> his

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
so dark it's it's routing routing his

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.340 
so dark it's it's routing routing his
best<00:03:14.250> burn<00:03:14.430> yeah<00:03:14.880> piece<00:03:15.180> of<00:03:15.210> a<00:03:15.510> real<00:03:15.900> character

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
best burn yeah piece of a real character

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.400 
best burn yeah piece of a real character
and<00:03:16.740> the<00:03:16.830> rules<00:03:17.040> of<00:03:17.220> his<00:03:18.090> photography<00:03:18.450> but

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
and the rules of his photography but

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.930 
and the rules of his photography but
only<00:03:19.560> because<00:03:19.920> of<00:03:19.950> his<00:03:20.190> video<00:03:20.460> background

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
only because of his video background

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.700 
only because of his video background
again<00:03:21.120> he<00:03:21.240> approaches<00:03:21.630> it<00:03:21.780> in<00:03:21.870> a<00:03:21.930> very<00:03:22.110> kind<00:03:22.680> of

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
again he approaches it in a very kind of

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.440 
again he approaches it in a very kind of
film<00:03:22.950> external<00:03:23.370> very<00:03:23.550> so<00:03:23.700> documentary<00:03:24.300> type
