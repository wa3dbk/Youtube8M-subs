00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.510 
stuff up here and I ran across this
automatic<00:00:15.090> radio<00:00:15.890> which<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:17.070> never<00:00:17.130> did

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
automatic radio which I never did

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.859 
automatic radio which I never did
restore<00:00:17.790> it's<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.900> six<00:00:19.200> volt<00:00:19.290> er<00:00:20.509> this<00:00:21.509> is<00:00:21.720> the

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
restore it's a six volt er this is the

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.530 
restore it's a six volt er this is the
chassis<00:00:22.140> here<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:23.390> never<00:00:24.390> did<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.689> thing<00:00:24.779> with<00:00:25.140> it

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:26.540 
chassis here I never did a thing with it

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.240 
chassis here I never did a thing with it
all<00:00:27.540> these<00:00:27.779> capacitors<00:00:28.439> are<00:00:28.619> original<00:00:29.130> and

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
all these capacitors are original and

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.749 
all these capacitors are original and
have<00:00:29.430> to<00:00:29.610> be<00:00:29.730> changed<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.210> course<00:00:31.399> all<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.460> had

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
done is years ago I had taken it out of

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:43.400 
done is years ago I had taken it out of
the<00:00:34.920> case<00:00:37.040> and<00:00:41.570> was<00:00:42.570> going<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.810> repair<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.290> and

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
the case and was going to repair it and

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:52.300 
the case and was going to repair it and
just<00:00:43.560> never<00:00:43.740> did<00:00:44.060> it's<00:00:45.060> a<00:00:45.180> six<00:00:45.450> volt<00:00:45.540> vibrator

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.310 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.180 

yeah<00:00:53.310> automatic<00:00:53.940> video<00:00:54.300> six<00:00:54.720> volt<00:00:55.130> this<00:00:56.130> is

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
yeah automatic video six volt this is

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.000 
yeah automatic video six volt this is
the<00:00:56.700> case<00:00:57.060> it<00:00:57.329> would<00:00:57.420> go<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:58.620> would<00:00:58.800> go<00:00:58.980> like

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
the case it would go it would go like

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.060 
the case it would go it would go like
this<00:00:59.220> the<00:00:59.760> chassis<00:01:00.210> would<00:01:00.329> go<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:01.070> actually

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
this the chassis would go in actually

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.850 
this the chassis would go in actually
would<00:01:02.250> go<00:01:02.370> like<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:03.079> this<00:01:04.079> would<00:01:04.290> go<00:01:04.439> down<00:01:04.619> in

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
would go like this this would go down in

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.069 
would go like this this would go down in
there<00:01:05.540> and<00:01:07.640> this<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.030> bottom<00:01:09.630> for<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:09.990> and

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:10.079 
there and this is the bottom for it and

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:11.840 
there and this is the bottom for it and
I<00:01:10.140> just<00:01:10.380> located<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.009> bottom<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:11.549> different

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
I just located the bottom in a different

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.789 
I just located the bottom in a different
part<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.149> the<00:01:12.270> attic<00:01:12.569> it<00:01:13.200> wasn't<00:01:13.560> with<00:01:13.679> the

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
part of the attic it wasn't with the

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.599 
part of the attic it wasn't with the
radio<00:01:14.069> so<00:01:14.429> things<00:01:15.090> got<00:01:15.560> messed<00:01:16.560> up<00:01:17.359> but<00:01:18.359> it's

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:19.609 
radio so things got messed up but it's

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:24.919 
radio so things got messed up but it's
it's<00:01:20.609> a<00:01:20.789> radio<00:01:21.179> that<00:01:22.700> my<00:01:23.700> dad<00:01:23.969> had<00:01:24.329> a<00:01:24.359> radio

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929 
it's a radio that my dad had a radio

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:27.200 
it's a radio that my dad had a radio

one of his old cars many years ago and
this<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.649> not<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.009> one<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.310> course<00:01:32.579> but<00:01:32.789> it's

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
this is not the one of course but it's

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:40.249 
this is not the one of course but it's
the<00:01:33.090> same<00:01:33.329> model<00:01:34.039> he<00:01:35.039> uses<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:36.709> 6<00:01:37.709> volt<00:01:39.049> 7<00:01:40.049> pin

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
the same model he uses the 6 volt 7 pin

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.649 
the same model he uses the 6 volt 7 pin
tubes<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.740> course<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:43.700> being<00:01:44.700> it's<00:01:45.179> got<00:01:45.479> the

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
tubes of course and being it's got the

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.590 
tubes of course and being it's got the
three<00:01:46.619> gang<00:01:46.859> tuning<00:01:47.490> capacitor<00:01:47.670> courses

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
three gang tuning capacitor courses

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.279 
three gang tuning capacitor courses
tuned<00:01:48.899> RF<00:01:49.319> so<00:01:49.639> it's<00:01:50.639> going<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.029> be<00:01:51.289> pretty

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
tuned RF so it's going to be pretty

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:54.260 
tuned RF so it's going to be pretty
sensitive<00:01:52.799> as<00:01:53.039> I<00:01:53.249> recall<00:01:53.639> it<00:01:53.850> was<00:01:53.969> pretty

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
sensitive as I recall it was pretty

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.469 
sensitive as I recall it was pretty
sensitive<00:01:54.749> about<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.770> strictly<00:01:56.159> a.m.<00:01:59.270> but<00:02:00.270> the

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
sensitive about a strictly a.m. but the

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.719 
sensitive about a strictly a.m. but the
problem<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.619> just<00:02:01.799> realized<00:02:02.189> there<00:02:02.429> was<00:02:02.520> no

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
problem is I just realized there was no

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.149 
problem is I just realized there was no
dial<00:02:03.389> glass<00:02:03.689> or<00:02:03.990> dial<00:02:04.229> plastic<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:04.889> here

dial glass or dial plastic in here

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.169 
dial glass or dial plastic in here
anymore<00:02:05.749> for<00:02:06.749> the<00:02:06.840> numbers<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.849> don't<00:02:08.849> know<00:02:09.000> if

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
anymore for the numbers I don't know if

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.910
