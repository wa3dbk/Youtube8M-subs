pool sliders apart for anything else

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.400 
pool sliders apart for anything else
I've<00:00:41.129> tried<00:00:41.430> on<00:00:41.610> 47<00:00:42.420> pairs<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:42.780> far<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.320> they

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
I've tried on 47 pairs so far and they

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.470 
I've tried on 47 pairs so far and they
all<00:00:43.620> look<00:00:43.829> horrendous<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:44.730> I'm<00:00:45.180> suggesting

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
all look horrendous so I'm suggesting

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.139 
all look horrendous so I'm suggesting
that<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.500> nice<00:00:47.100> alternative<00:00:47.309> which<00:00:47.910> is

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
that it is a nice alternative which is

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.709 
that it is a nice alternative which is
the<00:00:48.570> pointed<00:00:49.050> flat<00:00:49.410> shoe<00:00:49.680> feci<00:00:50.610> if<00:00:51.090> you're

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
the pointed flat shoe feci if you're

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.840 
the pointed flat shoe feci if you're
going<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.930> find<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.230> hard<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.949> give<00:00:53.100> up<00:00:53.129> your

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
going to find it hard to give up your

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.090 
going to find it hard to give up your
ballet<00:00:54.030> pump<00:00:54.360> then<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.199> suggest<00:00:55.530> these<00:00:55.860> ones

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
ballet pump then I suggest these ones

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.590 
ballet pump then I suggest these ones
because<00:00:56.340> you've<00:00:56.610> still<00:00:56.879> got<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.149> bow<00:00:57.300> and

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
because you've still got the bow and

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.869 
because you've still got the bow and
it's<00:00:58.500> really<00:00:58.800> almost<00:00:58.949> exactly<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.520> same<00:00:59.579> shoe

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
it's really almost exactly the same shoe

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.819 
it's really almost exactly the same shoe
but<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.090> has<00:01:00.329> got<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.780> crucial<00:01:01.140> point<00:01:01.320> which<00:01:01.590> I

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
but it has got the crucial point which I

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.200 
but it has got the crucial point which I
know<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.160> sounds<00:01:02.399> ridiculous<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:03.059> makes

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
know it sounds ridiculous but it makes

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.270 
know it sounds ridiculous but it makes
all<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.600> difference<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:04.350> always<00:01:04.949> think<00:01:05.159> it's

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
all the difference I always think it's

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.160 
all the difference I always think it's
nice<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.729> have<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> color<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.540> flat<00:01:06.750> shoe<00:01:06.780> in

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
nice to have a color in a flat shoe in

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.630 
nice to have a color in a flat shoe in
the<00:01:07.290> summer<00:01:07.500> because<00:01:07.710> you're<00:01:08.220> not<00:01:08.369> wearing<00:01:08.610> it

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
the summer because you're not wearing it

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.190 
the summer because you're not wearing it
with<00:01:08.820> tights<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.299> it's<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.510> lot<00:01:09.659> easier<00:01:09.810> you

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
with tights so it's a lot easier you

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.270 
with tights so it's a lot easier you
don't<00:01:10.350> have<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.590> tone<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:11.070> with<00:01:11.189> your
