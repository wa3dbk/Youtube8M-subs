00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:11.660
 hello my name is hares pavel 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.280
 I present the author's course creation 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.170
 trading robots before 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.780
 tell what awaits you on this course I 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.640
 talk a little about yourself i am 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.260
 Trader and Lead Specialist 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.340
 automated trading system in 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.200
 xelius group 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.720
 these systems provided me with an average 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.610
 yield of 50 70 percent per annum and 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.180
 allowed me to shut down every year 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.310
 arrived 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.440
 what is the goal of most traders 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.420
 besides that i teach algorithmic 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.309
 trading both individually and on 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.109
 course trading in a million but within 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.850
 This course I can not invest enough 

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:42.710
 knowledge and skills since the course 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.460
 time limited and most 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.260
 pupils 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.059
 comes without initial knowledge of 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.589
 the stock market that nonetheless doesn't 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.229
 prevents them from showing excellent results 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:53.629
 and after graduation even take 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:55.760
 major management capital what does 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.739
 for the moment and sin or however 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.749
 for those who want to immerse themselves in the world 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.120
 algorithmic trading course trading 

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:04.100
 a million will not be enough so we 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.930
 formed a separate course creation 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.759
 trading robots within which you 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.740
 get a concentrated amount of knowledge 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.360
 and skills that will allow you to 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.130
 further it is easy to automate your 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.560
 the trade is first of all given 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.570
 the course is designed for people already having 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.490
 hand trading experience and who 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.229
 lack of perseverance or lack of 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.240
 time and because of psychological 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.640
 problems can not get stable 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.200
 income as well as the course will be extremely useful 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.119
 for those who are already familiar with the basics 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.039
 algorithmic trading and would like to 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.390
 reach a new level and develop skills 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.149
 to create profitable trading 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.130
 algorithms to optimize them why you need 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.289
 learn algo trading in practice within 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.479
 of our course because there is a mass 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.799
 fundamental points that are not 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.990
 described in specialized literature 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.179
 and which cannot be reflected within 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.979
 webinars that we conduct or those 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:49.640
 videos that I post on the channel 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.499
 xelius group 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.200
 course program you will learn advanced 

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:55.450
 set of techniques to create 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.640
 improved trading algorithms need 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.740
 understand what things are being told 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.560
 in books it is a little applicable and to our market 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.469
 and their labors can be used by people 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.509
 having several dozen on the account 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.099
 thousand rubles therefore in my course I 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.500
 I focus on the maximum practical 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.910
 exercises so that students in their 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.280
 real trading as early as possible 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.170
 learned about all the pitfalls in 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.640
 algorithmic trading having met 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.019
 with all the insidious moments in 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.510
 algorithmic trading is still in progress 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.640
 learning further on major 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.720
 capitalier in from the book will be shielded from 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.760
 unpleasant surprises 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.860
 which can result in serious 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.450
 loss in the course of study you meet 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.459
 with such fundamental things on 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.650
 algorithmic trading as a baseline trend and 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.750
 candlestick algorithms with constructor 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.880
 trading robots this love however 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.400
 we will spend most of the time 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.030
 detailed analysis of advanced filters 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.040
 entry in position issues use 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.660
 intelligent pull-up stops 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.730
 we also dwell on 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.410
 best practice testing 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.329
 sustainability of the results 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.829
 naturally you will detail it 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.410
 study in order for your trading 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.959
 algorithms had great real they 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.090
 historical yield want you in advance 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.150
 warn that in order to successfully 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.430
 perform practical tasks you must 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.410
 have at least 50 thousand in the accounts 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.299
 rubles therefore in order to have 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.790
 the ability to run multiple trading 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.370
 robots including algorithms running on 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.989
 index rts you need enough 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.430
 amount of funds for several 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.130
 subaccounts want to note that 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.209
 the effectiveness of your training 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.760
 directly depends on the quality of performance 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.540
 you homework assignments and for 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.209
 order to reach the maximum 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.889
 quality teaching we are engaged in 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.139
 groups of no more than 10 people 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:37.359
 the duration of the course is 1 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:39.639
 the month during which you run in 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.180
 work at least three optimized 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:42.010
 algorithms 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.230
 if you approach responsibly 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.970
 learning can be quite observable 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.160
 future not only to compete 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.840
 best private investor well and borrow on 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.060
 prizes like it did one of 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.190
 my graduates so sign up 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.110
 on courses creating trading robots and already 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.130
 in a month you will start confidence 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.130
 at least profitable trading algorithms
