00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
alright here's a smoke tutorial I did on

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.390 
alright here's a smoke tutorial I did on
how<00:00:02.790> to<00:00:02.850> do<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.300> pop<00:00:03.600> of<00:00:03.810> mod<00:00:04.080> on<00:00:04.529> the

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
how to do the pop of mod on the

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.629 
how to do the pop of mod on the
carburetor<00:00:06.680> Dave<00:00:07.680> I<00:00:07.859> know<00:00:08.040> has<00:00:08.220> covered

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
carburetor Dave I know has covered

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.000 
carburetor Dave I know has covered
majority<00:00:09.269> of<00:00:09.360> it<00:00:09.540> I<00:00:09.690> just<00:00:09.750> wanna<00:00:10.139> show<00:00:10.349> how<00:00:10.980> I

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
majority of it I just wanna show how I

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.010 
majority of it I just wanna show how I
do<00:00:11.190> it<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:11.730> for<00:00:12.330> accuracy<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:14.599> the<00:00:15.599> pop<00:00:15.809> of

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
do it and for accuracy of the pop of

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.340 
do it and for accuracy of the pop of
month<00:00:16.289> so<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:16.800> saw<00:00:17.070> merged<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.550> in<00:00:17.699> water<00:00:18.350> the

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
month so I saw merged it in water the

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.439 
month so I saw merged it in water the
reason<00:00:19.770> for<00:00:20.100> it<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.490> when<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.760> do<00:00:20.939> apply

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
reason for it that when I do apply

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.650 
reason for it that when I do apply
pressure<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.789> it'll<00:00:23.789> give<00:00:23.970> me<00:00:24.060> indications

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
pressure to it it'll give me indications

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.330 
pressure to it it'll give me indications
if<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:24.960> do<00:00:25.019> got<00:00:25.699> leakage<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.880> air<00:00:28.039> whether<00:00:29.039> on

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
if I do got leakage of air whether on

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.650 
if I do got leakage of air whether on
the<00:00:29.490> shaft<00:00:29.760> or<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.420> bottom<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.990> car<00:00:32.660> now

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
the shaft or the bottom of the car now

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.870 
the shaft or the bottom of the car now
for<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.079> car<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.680> gotta<00:00:35.040> make<00:00:35.250> sure<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.640> that

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
for the car I gotta make sure that that

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.110 
for the car I gotta make sure that that
arm<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.420> pretty<00:00:36.899> much<00:00:37.110> closed<00:00:37.579> and<00:00:38.579> seated

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
arm is pretty much closed and seated

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.660 
arm is pretty much closed and seated
there<00:00:39.329> properly<00:00:39.890> centered<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.309> then<00:00:41.489> also

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
there properly centered and then also

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.540 
there properly centered and then also
the<00:00:41.910> needle<00:00:42.270> valve<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.870> sitting<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.950> there<00:00:44.340> if

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
the needle valve is sitting in there if

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.850 
the needle valve is sitting in there if
it's<00:00:45.300> not<00:00:45.510> sitting<00:00:45.719> properly<00:00:46.020> in<00:00:46.410> there<00:00:46.620> it's

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
it's not sitting properly in there it's

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.970 
it's not sitting properly in there it's
gonna<00:00:47.039> bleed<00:00:47.700> off<00:00:47.910> pressure<00:00:49.190> prior<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:51.980> you

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
gonna bleed off pressure prior to you

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.090 
gonna bleed off pressure prior to you
know<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.870> the<00:00:54.870> real<00:00:55.140> pressure<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.770> it's

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
know the the real pressure that it's

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.720 
know the the real pressure that it's
supposed<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.520> give<00:00:56.789> out<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:58.070> just<00:00:59.070> just<00:00:59.370> little

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
supposed to give out so just just little

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.939 
supposed to give out so just just little
things<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.210> have<00:01:00.510> done<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.550> found

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
things that I have done and and found

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.670 
things that I have done and and found
how<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.010> do<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:05.820> like<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.420> said<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.930> got<00:01:07.409> some

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
how to do it so like I said I got some

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.310 
how to do it so like I said I got some
pressure<00:01:07.890> on<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.369> already<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.939> did<00:01:09.510> check<00:01:10.080> this

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
pressure on it already I did check this

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.950 
pressure on it already I did check this
carburetor<00:01:10.770> make<00:01:11.189> sure<00:01:11.369> there's<00:01:11.610> no<00:01:11.880> air

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.330 

leaking<00:01:15.960> out<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.470> what<00:01:16.830> I'm<00:01:16.950> gonna<00:01:17.070> do<00:01:17.220> I'm

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
leaking out so what I'm gonna do I'm

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.760 
leaking out so what I'm gonna do I'm
gonna<00:01:17.460> had<00:01:17.729> some<00:01:17.970> pressure<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.540> now<00:01:19.290> like<00:01:19.740> I

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
gonna had some pressure to it now like I

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.969 
gonna had some pressure to it now like I
said<00:01:20.040> with<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.210> being<00:01:21.509> underwater<00:01:22.049> it's<00:01:22.799> gonna

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
said with it being underwater it's gonna

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.679 
said with it being underwater it's gonna
give<00:01:23.130> me<00:01:23.159> good<00:01:23.430> indications<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.240> where<00:01:24.509> it

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
give me good indications of where it

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.690 
give me good indications of where it
actually<00:01:25.259> popped<00:01:25.860> because<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.310> water's

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
actually popped because the water's

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.480 
actually popped because the water's
gonna<00:01:26.909> submerge<00:01:27.540> or<00:01:28.140> come<00:01:28.470> out<00:01:28.500> from<00:01:29.250> where

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
gonna submerge or come out from where

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.980 
gonna submerge or come out from where
the<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:32.100> needle<00:01:32.490> valve<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.909> at<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.720> arm

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
the the needle valve is at and that arm

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.830 
the the needle valve is at and that arm
so<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.740> already<00:01:35.430> got<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.909> at<00:01:36.030> 15<00:01:36.479> psi<00:01:38.570> okay<00:01:39.570> so

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
so I already got it at 15 psi okay so

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.210 
so I already got it at 15 psi okay so
I'm<00:01:39.930> gonna<00:01:40.610> put<00:01:41.610> some<00:01:41.640> pressure<00:01:42.180> there<00:01:42.360> and

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
I'm gonna put some pressure there and

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.330 
I'm gonna put some pressure there and
you're<00:01:44.220> gonna<00:01:44.399> see<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.670> air<00:01:45.210> come<00:01:45.630> out<00:01:46.340> and

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
you're gonna see that air come out and

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.609 
you're gonna see that air come out and
I'm<00:01:47.490> gonna<00:01:47.759> try<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.140> to<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.259> best<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.560> my

ability
call<00:01:50.790> out<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:50.970> PSI<00:01:51.570> acid<00:01:51.990> as<00:01:52.200> I'm<00:01:52.829> admitting

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
call out the PSI acid as I'm admitting

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:07.560 
call out the PSI acid as I'm admitting
air<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:55.159> right<00:01:56.159> now<00:01:56.390> 14<00:01:58.549> 15<00:01:59.600> 16<00:02:00.600> 17<00:02:03.350> 18

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:15.190 

19<00:02:09.190> got<00:02:10.190> 19<00:02:10.700> psi<00:02:11.360> and<00:02:12.320> it<00:02:12.530> did<00:02:12.770> go<00:02:13.070> up<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:14.840> bled

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
19 got 19 psi and it did go up it bled

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.040 
19 got 19 psi and it did go up it bled
off<00:02:15.350> there<00:02:15.650> that's<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.340> Popoff<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:17.240> what

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
off there that's the Popoff and what

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.960 
off there that's the Popoff and what
when<00:02:18.440> it<00:02:18.590> pops<00:02:18.860> off<00:02:19.100> you're<00:02:19.400> gonna<00:02:19.520> see<00:02:19.760> this

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
when it pops off you're gonna see this

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.610 
when it pops off you're gonna see this
gauge<00:02:20.210> is<00:02:20.390> gonna<00:02:20.600> start<00:02:20.900> going<00:02:21.140> down<00:02:21.320> slow

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
gauge is gonna start going down slow

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.950 
gauge is gonna start going down slow
let's<00:02:22.310> let<00:02:22.580> you<00:02:22.730> know<00:02:22.850> that<00:02:23.060> it<00:02:23.270> did<00:02:23.450> pop<00:02:23.720> off

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
let's let you know that it did pop off

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.800 
let's let you know that it did pop off
and<00:02:24.200> you<00:02:24.710> know<00:02:24.860> that<00:02:25.130> need<00:02:25.760> evolving<00:02:26.300> sitting

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
and you know that need evolving sitting

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.960 
and you know that need evolving sitting
properly<00:02:27.490> so<00:02:28.490> just<00:02:29.330> a<00:02:29.450> short<00:02:29.750> tutorial<00:02:30.970> kind

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.880 
properly so just a short tutorial kind
of<00:02:32.090> show<00:02:32.240> you<00:02:32.300> how<00:02:32.510> I<00:02:32.540> do<00:02:32.720> it<00:02:32.959> it<00:02:33.080> again<00:02:33.650> from

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
of show you how I do it it again from

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.449 
of show you how I do it it again from
the<00:02:33.980> start<00:02:34.340> so<00:02:35.120> then<00:02:36.080> I<00:02:36.200> press<00:02:36.500> that<00:02:36.800> arm

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
the start so then I press that arm

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.560 
the start so then I press that arm
that<00:02:38.450> linkage<00:02:38.780> is<00:02:39.020> make<00:02:39.830> sure<00:02:40.040> I<00:02:40.310> say<00:02:41.090> Rob<00:02:41.360> my

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
that linkage is make sure I say Rob my

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.050 
that linkage is make sure I say Rob my
gauge<00:02:42.010> make<00:02:43.010> sure<00:02:43.190> that<00:02:43.310> needle<00:02:43.670> valve<00:02:43.850> is

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
gauge make sure that needle valve is

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.100 
gauge make sure that needle valve is
properly<00:02:44.510> seated<00:02:44.870> that<00:02:45.440> arm<00:02:45.709> the<00:02:45.920> center<00:02:46.310> and

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
properly seated that arm the center and

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.850 
properly seated that arm the center and
then<00:02:48.110> I<00:02:49.540> go<00:02:50.540> back<00:02:50.570> and<00:02:50.959> start<00:02:51.530> pumping

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
then I go back and start pumping

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.000 
then I go back and start pumping
pressure<00:02:55.750> so<00:02:56.750> kind<00:02:57.140> of<00:02:57.200> give<00:02:57.380> you<00:02:57.500> a<00:02:57.590> more

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
pressure so kind of give you a more

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:06.610 
pressure so kind of give you a more
farther<00:02:58.880> look<00:02:59.239> at<00:02:59.420> it<00:03:01.900> seven<00:03:02.900> eight<00:03:04.120> nine<00:03:05.620> ten

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
farther look at it seven eight nine ten

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.920 
farther look at it seven eight nine ten
and<00:03:06.920> just<00:03:07.580> remember<00:03:07.940> it's<00:03:08.060> slow<00:03:08.300> and<00:03:08.480> steady

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
and just remember it's slow and steady

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.020 
and just remember it's slow and steady
you<00:03:09.440> see<00:03:09.680> a<00:03:09.709> better<00:03:10.010> indication<00:03:10.489> and<00:03:10.790> just

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
you see a better indication and just

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.820 
you see a better indication and just
pumping<00:03:11.450> it<00:03:11.739> dramatically<00:03:12.739> and<00:03:13.040> crazy<00:03:13.930> so<00:03:14.930> you

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
pumping it dramatically and crazy so you

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:23.220 
pumping it dramatically and crazy so you
see<00:03:16.070> the<00:03:16.190> pressure<00:03:16.459> still<00:03:16.790> holding<00:03:18.940> 13<00:03:20.890> 14<00:03:21.890> 15

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
see the pressure still holding 13 14 15

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:31.870 
see the pressure still holding 13 14 15
16<00:03:24.230> 17<00:03:25.570> 18<00:03:30.489> 19

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
16 17 18 19

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.780 
16 17 18 19
let's<00:03:32.690> can<00:03:32.959> see<00:03:33.170> you<00:03:33.350> see<00:03:33.560> that<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:34.430> bubbles

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
let's can see you see that the bubbles

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.170 
let's can see you see that the bubbles
come<00:03:34.970> out<00:03:35.090> that<00:03:35.410> needle<00:03:36.410> valve<00:03:36.620> so<00:03:37.160> there's<00:03:38.120> a

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
come out that needle valve so there's a

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.810 
come out that needle valve so there's a
pop<00:03:38.450> of<00:03:38.660> spring<00:03:39.049> mark<00:03:39.290> that<00:03:39.860> I<00:03:39.890> have<00:03:40.160> dead<00:03:40.489> just

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
pop of spring mark that I have dead just

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.690 
pop of spring mark that I have dead just
kind<00:03:41.030> of<00:03:41.120> short<00:03:41.750> summary<00:03:42.260> of<00:03:42.620> how<00:03:43.010> I<00:03:43.040> do<00:03:43.250> it<00:03:43.519> I

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
kind of short summary of how I do it I

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.580 
kind of short summary of how I do it I
said<00:03:44.239> they've<00:03:44.450> covered<00:03:44.900> most<00:03:45.140> of<00:03:45.260> it

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
said they've covered most of it

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.660 
said they've covered most of it
hope<00:03:45.799> that<00:03:46.040> helps<00:03:46.660> Thanks
