00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:07.639 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:12.080 

about<00:00:08.639> 8<00:00:08.820> degrees<00:00:08.970> out<00:00:09.330> right<00:00:09.360> now<00:00:09.920> so<00:00:11.090> this

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
about 8 degrees out right now so this

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.180 
about 8 degrees out right now so this
will<00:00:12.240> be<00:00:12.330> even<00:00:12.719> more<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.139> test<00:00:13.410> with<00:00:14.010> this

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
will be even more of a test with this

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.429 
will be even more of a test with this
wood<00:00:14.639> being<00:00:15.120> so<00:00:15.299> cold<00:00:16.460> anyway<00:00:18.170> here<00:00:19.170> we<00:00:19.230> go

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
wood being so cold anyway here we go

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.420 
wood being so cold anyway here we go
there's<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.680> nice<00:00:19.830> shot<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.099> that<00:00:21.349> and<00:00:25.430> roughly

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
there's a nice shot of that and roughly

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.600 
there's a nice shot of that and roughly
about<00:00:26.849> there<00:00:27.630> okay<00:00:28.110> hopefully<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.309> guys<00:00:29.399> see

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:29.610 
about there okay hopefully you guys see

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:53.490 
about there okay hopefully you guys see
it

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:44.130 

hmm<00:00:54.500> got<00:00:55.130> an<00:00:55.220> itch<00:00:55.340> in<00:00:55.370> my<00:00:55.520> eye<00:00:56.590> there<00:00:57.590> we<00:00:57.680> go

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:57.420 

oh<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.850> far<00:01:55.030> it's<00:01:55.180> not<00:01:55.300> fighting<00:01:55.659> in<00:01:55.810> as<00:01:56.800> much

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
oh so far it's not fighting in as much

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.480 
oh so far it's not fighting in as much
the<00:01:58.360> one<00:01:58.510> good<00:01:58.720> thing<00:01:58.780> about<00:01:59.020> using<00:01:59.409> the<00:02:00.310> same

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
the one good thing about using the same

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.710 
the one good thing about using the same
tree<00:02:00.729> for<00:02:00.910> multiple<00:02:01.210> knives<00:02:01.390> you<00:02:01.600> can

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
tree for multiple knives you can

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.840 
tree for multiple knives you can
directly<00:02:01.990> compare<00:02:02.380> them<00:02:02.470> to<00:02:02.500> each<00:02:02.650> other<00:02:02.890> the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
directly compare them to each other the

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.969 
directly compare them to each other the
problem<00:02:04.180> though<00:02:04.300> is<00:02:04.900> it's<00:02:05.229> about<00:02:05.410> 15<00:02:05.770> or<00:02:05.890> 20

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
problem though is it's about 15 or 20

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.279 
problem though is it's about 15 or 20
degrees<00:02:06.570> actually<00:02:07.570> no<00:02:07.690> it's<00:02:07.840> about<00:02:07.990> 25

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
degrees actually no it's about 25

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.120 
degrees actually no it's about 25
degrees<00:02:08.729> colder<00:02:09.959> right<00:02:10.959> now<00:02:11.170> that<00:02:11.650> is<00:02:11.860> when<00:02:12.100> I

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
degrees colder right now that is when I

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.270 
degrees colder right now that is when I
did<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.790> other<00:02:12.940> testing<00:02:13.920> on<00:02:14.920> this<00:02:15.130> particular

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
did the other testing on this particular

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.300 
did the other testing on this particular
trainee<00:02:15.850> way<00:02:16.060> so<00:02:16.750> it's<00:02:17.590> not<00:02:17.650> biting<00:02:17.950> as<00:02:18.130> much

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
trainee way so it's not biting as much

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.890 
trainee way so it's not biting as much
by<00:02:18.520> wondering<00:02:18.880> if<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.030> cold<00:02:19.300> is<00:02:19.480> affecting

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
by wondering if the cold is affecting

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:27.930 
by wondering if the cold is affecting
that<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:25.950> in<00:02:26.950> order<00:02:27.070> to<00:02:27.160> be<00:02:27.250> consistent<00:02:27.610> I<00:02:27.820> got

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
that so in order to be consistent I got

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.330 
that so in order to be consistent I got
to<00:02:28.030> come<00:02:28.150> back<00:02:28.180> out<00:02:28.480> here<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.959> also<00:02:29.890> chop<00:02:30.190> with

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
to come back out here and also chop with

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.000 
to come back out here and also chop with
this<00:02:30.459> again<00:02:30.760> in<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:31.360> same<00:02:31.510> temperature<00:02:32.050> as<00:02:32.230> I

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
this again in the same temperature as I

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.850 
this again in the same temperature as I
did<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.280> other<00:02:33.400> two<00:02:34.590> just<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.709> make<00:02:35.830> sure

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
did the other two just to make sure

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.170 
did the other two just to make sure
everything<00:02:36.220> is<00:02:36.280> consistent<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:36.970> cold

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
everything is consistent the cold

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:44.610 
everything is consistent the cold
weather<00:02:37.300> is<00:02:37.480> not<00:02:37.630> affecting<00:02:38.350> that<00:02:43.560> tell<00:02:44.560> you

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
weather is not affecting that tell you

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.970 
weather is not affecting that tell you
one<00:02:44.739> thing<00:02:44.769> I<00:02:44.890> really<00:02:45.010> do<00:02:45.220> like<00:02:45.430> though<00:02:45.610> is<00:02:46.980> the

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
one thing I really do like though is the

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.350 
one thing I really do like though is the
the<00:02:48.310> flared<00:02:48.549> out<00:02:49.290> pommel<00:02:50.760> it<00:02:51.760> really<00:02:52.120> really

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
the flared out pommel it really really

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.240 
the flared out pommel it really really
helps<00:02:52.660> because<00:02:52.750> as<00:02:53.290> I'm<00:02:53.500> coming<00:02:53.650> down<00:02:53.920> even

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
helps because as I'm coming down even

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.240 
helps because as I'm coming down even
though<00:02:54.340> I'm<00:02:54.400> wearing<00:02:54.459> gloves<00:02:55.170> I<00:02:56.220> want<00:02:57.220> a

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
though I'm wearing gloves I want a

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.000 
though I'm wearing gloves I want a
winter<00:02:57.489> gloves<00:02:57.610> now<00:02:57.820> work<00:02:58.000> gloves<00:02:58.890> so<00:02:59.890> the

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
winter gloves now work gloves so the

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.979 
winter gloves now work gloves so the
problem<00:03:00.220> is<00:03:00.610> that<00:03:00.970> a<00:03:01.180> sliding<00:03:01.660> on<00:03:01.720> me<00:03:01.810> a<00:03:01.870> little

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
problem is that a sliding on me a little

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.990 
problem is that a sliding on me a little
bit<00:03:02.130> but<00:03:03.130> you<00:03:03.340> know<00:03:03.459> and<00:03:03.549> of<00:03:03.640> course<00:03:03.790> I<00:03:03.850> don't

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
bit but you know and of course I don't

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000 
bit but you know and of course I don't
have<00:03:04.090> a<00:03:04.120> landed<00:03:04.360> on<00:03:04.480> here<00:03:04.690> but<00:03:04.840> that<00:03:05.590> really

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
have a landed on here but that really

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.009 
have a landed on here but that really
really<00:03:06.160> helps<00:03:06.489> because<00:03:06.519> as<00:03:06.880> a<00:03:07.299> sliding<00:03:07.810> down

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
really helps because as a sliding down

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.199 
really helps because as a sliding down
my<00:03:08.350> pinky<00:03:09.250> is<00:03:09.370> catching<00:03:09.730> that<00:03:09.850> and<00:03:10.000> has<00:03:10.090> given

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
my pinky is catching that and has given

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.240 
my pinky is catching that and has given
me<00:03:10.390> a<00:03:10.420> lot<00:03:10.540> of<00:03:10.600> grip

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
me a lot of grip

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.190 
me a lot of grip
ensuring<00:03:13.120> that<00:03:13.150> I'm<00:03:13.330> not<00:03:13.480> going<00:03:13.630> to<00:03:13.690> let<00:03:14.170> go

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
ensuring that I'm not going to let go

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:25.260 
ensuring that I'm not going to let go
this<00:03:14.500> night<00:03:14.710> while<00:03:14.890> shopping<00:03:24.240> nothing<00:03:25.240> I

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
can't do as well as like a choke down

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.360 
can't do as well as like a choke down

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
and actually have a two or three finger

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.240 
and actually have a two or three finger
grip<00:03:30.400> on<00:03:30.730> this<00:03:31.110> you<00:03:32.110> guys<00:03:32.230> can<00:03:32.440> see<00:03:32.590> that<00:03:32.770> and

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
grip on this you guys can see that and

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.320 
grip on this you guys can see that and
he<00:03:33.310> gives<00:03:33.459> me<00:03:33.550> a<00:03:33.580> little<00:03:33.700> more<00:03:33.850> leverage<00:03:34.030> and

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
he gives me a little more leverage and

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.040 
he gives me a little more leverage and
shopping<00:03:34.830> not<00:03:35.830> as<00:03:35.920> much<00:03:36.040> clip<00:03:36.780> but<00:03:37.780> certainly

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
shopping not as much clip but certainly

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.720 
shopping not as much clip but certainly
more<00:03:38.230> leverage<00:03:38.590> at<00:03:39.070> least<00:03:39.250> a<00:03:39.370> three<00:03:39.550> finger

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
more leverage at least a three finger

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.690 
more leverage at least a three finger

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
grip with a pinky below it's more of

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.870 
grip with a pinky below it's more of
like<00:03:42.730> a<00:03:42.880> fulcrum<00:03:43.870> action<00:03:44.459> alright<00:03:45.459> and<00:03:45.489> I<00:03:45.700> just

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
like a fulcrum action alright and I just

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:55.229 
like a fulcrum action alright and I just
makes<00:03:46.570> a<00:03:46.660> little<00:03:46.750> bit<00:03:46.900> easier<00:03:47.020> to<00:03:47.260> shop<00:03:54.239> so

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
makes a little bit easier to shop so

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.330 
makes a little bit easier to shop so
yeah<00:03:55.530> like<00:03:56.530> a<00:03:56.590> pretty<00:03:56.800> good<00:03:56.950> but<00:03:57.100> it's<00:03:57.220> not<00:03:57.310> the

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
yeah like a pretty good but it's not the

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.720 
yeah like a pretty good but it's not the
waiting<00:03:57.640> nearly<00:03:57.820> as<00:03:58.000> much<00:03:58.120> as<00:03:58.330> the<00:03:58.420> other<00:03:58.540> one

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
waiting nearly as much as the other one

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.220 
waiting nearly as much as the other one
of<00:04:00.730> course<00:04:00.790> is<00:04:01.000> not<00:04:01.150> as<00:04:01.330> much<00:04:01.510> blade<00:04:01.840> have<00:04:02.050> done

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
of course is not as much blade have done

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.470 
of course is not as much blade have done
this<00:04:02.350> either<00:04:02.560> but<00:04:02.860> the<00:04:03.400> Artek<00:04:03.760> too<00:04:04.000> had<00:04:04.450> a

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
this either but the Artek too had a

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:31.920 
this either but the Artek too had a
similar<00:04:04.870> blade<00:04:05.050> shape<00:04:05.400> much<00:04:06.400> longer

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.510 

alright<00:04:34.510> that's<00:04:35.510> it<00:04:35.630> for<00:04:35.690> now<00:04:35.990> I'm<00:04:36.370> going<00:04:37.370> to

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
alright that's it for now I'm going to

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.980 
alright that's it for now I'm going to
do<00:04:37.640> some<00:04:37.850> awesome<00:04:38.150> other<00:04:38.270> testing<00:04:38.660> some<00:04:38.840> other

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
do some awesome other testing some other

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.250 
do some awesome other testing some other
knives<00:04:39.490> off<00:04:40.490> to<00:04:40.730> revisit<00:04:41.120> this<00:04:41.210> again<00:04:41.540> once

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
knives off to revisit this again once

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.320 
knives off to revisit this again once
the<00:04:42.350> I<00:04:42.470> temperatures<00:04:42.950> a<00:04:43.250> little<00:04:43.820> bit<00:04:44.180> higher

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
the I temperatures a little bit higher

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.940 
the I temperatures a little bit higher
at<00:04:44.510> least<00:04:44.660> on<00:04:44.810> this<00:04:44.900> specific<00:04:45.080> tree<00:04:45.530> again<00:04:45.740> so

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
at least on this specific tree again so

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.580 
at least on this specific tree again so
I<00:04:46.010> have<00:04:46.190> a<00:04:46.220> more<00:04:46.570> consistent<00:04:47.570> like<00:04:48.050> you<00:04:48.500> know

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
I have a more consistent like you know

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.160 
I have a more consistent like you know
testing<00:04:49.040> result<00:04:49.400> not<00:04:50.270> really<00:04:50.540> entirely<00:04:50.840> sure

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.170 
testing result not really entirely sure

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.490 
testing result not really entirely sure
if<00:04:51.410> that<00:04:51.980> extra<00:04:52.490> cold<00:04:52.700> weather<00:04:52.970> is<00:04:53.600> making<00:04:54.260> the

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
if that extra cold weather is making the

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.110 
if that extra cold weather is making the
tree<00:04:54.710> more<00:04:54.860> dense<00:04:55.130> or<00:04:55.400> obviously<00:04:55.700> maybe<00:04:55.910> the

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
tree more dense or obviously maybe the

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.520 
tree more dense or obviously maybe the
any<00:04:56.510> kind<00:04:56.720> of<00:04:56.780> moisture<00:04:57.080> in<00:04:57.110> the<00:04:57.230> tree<00:04:57.380> be

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
any kind of moisture in the tree be

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.030 
any kind of moisture in the tree be
frozen<00:04:57.830> maybe<00:04:58.670> hard<00:04:58.940> a<00:04:59.030> job<00:04:59.240> so<00:04:59.770> come<00:05:00.770> back<00:05:00.890> to

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
frozen maybe hard a job so come back to

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.250 
frozen maybe hard a job so come back to
this<00:05:01.130> and<00:05:01.340> let<00:05:02.300> me<00:05:02.390> squash<00:05:02.630> you<00:05:02.720> guys<00:05:02.900> hope<00:05:03.200> you

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
this and let me squash you guys hope you

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.640 
this and let me squash you guys hope you
