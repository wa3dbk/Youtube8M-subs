started<00:00:32.460> off<00:00:32.520> with<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.850> boring<00:00:33.329> thing<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.960> just

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
started off with the boring thing I just

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.350 
started off with the boring thing I just
got<00:00:34.710> keys<00:00:34.950> flip-flops<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.880> thereby

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
got keys flip-flops and thereby

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.090 
got keys flip-flops and thereby
charlotte<00:00:36.930> russe<00:00:37.200> but<00:00:37.530> they're<00:00:37.710> only<00:00:37.800> four

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
charlotte russe but they're only four

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.500 
charlotte russe but they're only four
dollars<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.610> reason<00:00:38.850> why<00:00:38.940> i<00:00:38.969> got<00:00:39.270> these

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
is because my other flip-flops they're

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.600 
is because my other flip-flops they're

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
it was like six dollars or something but

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.080
