00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.340 

okay<00:02:27.650> I'm<00:02:27.830> using<00:02:28.070> the<00:02:28.520> 56<00:02:29.060> millimeter<00:02:29.690> lens<00:02:29.870> at

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
okay I'm using the 56 millimeter lens at

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.060 
okay I'm using the 56 millimeter lens at
1.2<00:02:31.220> which<00:02:32.090> is<00:02:32.270> wide<00:02:32.450> open<00:02:32.860> I've<00:02:33.860> got<00:02:34.040> a

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
1.2 which is wide open I've got a

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.730 
1.2 which is wide open I've got a
shutter<00:02:34.340> speed<00:02:34.520> of<00:02:34.930> 250<00:02:35.930> a--the<00:02:36.050> and<00:02:36.260> I'm<00:02:36.530> on

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
shutter speed of 250 a--the and I'm on

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.360 
shutter speed of 250 a--the and I'm on
800<00:02:37.340> ISO<00:02:37.790> now<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:39.080> shutter<00:02:39.290> speeds<00:02:39.530> at<00:02:39.620> 250<00:02:40.310> is

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
800 ISO now the shutter speeds at 250 is

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.830 
800 ISO now the shutter speeds at 250 is
because<00:02:40.640> it's<00:02:40.760> four<00:02:41.000> times<00:02:41.300> the<00:02:41.480> focal<00:02:41.630> length

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
because it's four times the focal length

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.350 
because it's four times the focal length
or<00:02:42.140> near<00:02:42.350> abouts<00:02:42.650> and<00:02:43.430> that's<00:02:43.700> what<00:02:43.910> I<00:02:43.940> want<00:02:44.210> to

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
or near abouts and that's what I want to

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.060 
or near abouts and that's what I want to
have<00:02:44.570> when<00:02:44.900> I'm<00:02:44.990> working<00:02:45.320> with<00:02:45.350> my<00:02:45.740> prime

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
have when I'm working with my prime

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.550 
have when I'm working with my prime
lenses<00:02:46.520> on<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.760> Fuji<00:02:47.180> x-series<00:02:47.600> I<00:02:47.900> like<00:02:48.380> to

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
lenses on the Fuji x-series I like to

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.530 
lenses on the Fuji x-series I like to
use<00:02:48.890> four<00:02:49.550> times<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:49.880> focal<00:02:50.000> length<00:02:50.180> when<00:02:50.420> I'm

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
use four times the focal length when I'm

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.690 
use four times the focal length when I'm
working<00:02:50.810> handheld<00:02:51.230> that's<00:02:51.770> because<00:02:52.130> the

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
working handheld that's because the

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.730 
working handheld that's because the
pixel<00:02:53.120> pitch<00:02:53.270> is<00:02:53.450> so<00:02:53.630> tight<00:02:53.930> it<00:02:54.140> the

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
pixel pitch is so tight it the

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.250 
pixel pitch is so tight it the
resolution<00:02:55.220> is<00:02:55.700> so<00:02:55.730> high<00:02:56.120> that<00:02:56.450> even<00:02:56.990> the

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
resolution is so high that even the

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.440 
resolution is so high that even the
slightest<00:02:57.950> movement<00:02:58.040> you'll<00:02:58.850> see<00:02:59.180> it<00:02:59.270> in<00:02:59.420> the

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
slightest movement you'll see it in the

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.449 
slightest movement you'll see it in the
frame<00:02:59.810> and<00:03:00.260> it's<00:03:00.440> always<00:03:00.890> better<00:03:01.100> to<00:03:01.250> have<00:03:01.340> a

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
frame and it's always better to have a

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.660 
frame and it's always better to have a
high<00:03:01.820> ISO<00:03:02.420> with<00:03:02.959> crisp<00:03:03.320> sharp<00:03:03.680> images<00:03:04.130> and<00:03:04.430> it

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
high ISO with crisp sharp images and it

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.210 
high ISO with crisp sharp images and it
is<00:03:04.790> to<00:03:04.910> have<00:03:05.090> a<00:03:05.120> lower<00:03:05.690> ISO<00:03:05.989> with<00:03:06.770> that<00:03:06.920> little

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
is to have a lower ISO with that little

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.250 
is to have a lower ISO with that little
bit<00:03:07.459> of<00:03:07.550> movement<00:03:07.820> so<00:03:08.540> that's<00:03:08.959> why<00:03:09.080> I'm<00:03:09.170> on

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
bit of movement so that's why I'm on

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.860 
bit of movement so that's why I'm on
250th<00:03:09.860> let's<00:03:10.250> give<00:03:10.370> it<00:03:10.430> a<00:03:10.520> go<00:03:10.670> right<00:03:11.600> let's

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870

such a place that I can't see the door
handles<00:03:32.390> and<00:03:32.480> things<00:03:32.690> but<00:03:33.080> if<00:03:33.170> I<00:03:33.260> want<00:03:33.440> that

background<00:03:33.920> to<00:03:34.100> get<00:03:34.220> a<00:03:34.250> bit<00:03:34.400> darker<00:03:34.910> because

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
background to get a bit darker because

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.110 
background to get a bit darker because
it's<00:03:35.450> perhaps<00:03:35.860> less<00:03:36.860> exciting<00:03:37.549> I'll<00:03:37.910> show<00:03:38.060> you

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
it's perhaps less exciting I'll show you

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.000 
it's perhaps less exciting I'll show you
how<00:03:38.269> I<00:03:38.299> do<00:03:38.450> that<00:03:38.600> these<00:03:39.230> are<00:03:39.290> the<00:03:39.470> curtains<00:03:39.890> I

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
how I do that these are the curtains I

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.699 
how I do that these are the curtains I
just<00:03:40.250> close<00:03:40.549> these<00:03:40.760> curtains<00:03:41.060> here<00:03:41.660> and<00:03:41.840> what

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
just close these curtains here and what

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.890 
just close these curtains here and what
you'll<00:03:42.860> see<00:03:43.190> in<00:03:43.519> the<00:03:43.580> background<00:03:43.940> is<00:03:44.810> that

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
you'll see in the background is that

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.170 
you'll see in the background is that
background<00:03:45.470> just<00:03:45.560> gets<00:03:45.769> darker<00:03:46.430> so<00:03:47.030> when<00:03:47.150> I

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
background just gets darker so when I

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.240 
background just gets darker so when I
take<00:03:47.420> another<00:03:47.720> picture<00:03:47.989> now<00:03:48.380> that<00:03:48.980> door

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
take another picture now that door

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.300 
take another picture now that door
becomes<00:03:49.640> much<00:03:50.060> darker<00:03:50.570> in<00:03:50.600> tone<00:03:50.750> and<00:03:51.260> in<00:03:52.010> a<00:03:52.130> way

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
becomes much darker in tone and in a way

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.979 
becomes much darker in tone and in a way
you<00:03:52.340> can<00:03:52.670> even<00:03:52.820> print<00:03:53.150> it<00:03:53.330> to<00:03:53.510> black<00:03:53.720> if<00:03:53.900> you

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
you can even print it to black if you

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.310 
you can even print it to black if you
wanted<00:03:54.290> to<00:03:54.530> bring<00:03:55.220> both<00:03:55.400> hands<00:03:55.610> behind<00:03:55.730> you<00:03:56.320> to

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
wanted to bring both hands behind you to

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:03.870 
wanted to bring both hands behind you to
the<00:03:57.560> that's<00:03:57.950> nice<00:03:58.130> just<00:03:58.430> yeah<00:03:59.000> lovely

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.240 

fabulous<00:04:05.019> so<00:04:06.019> the<00:04:06.110> contrast<00:04:06.500> is<00:04:06.680> a<00:04:06.709> lot<00:04:06.890> higher

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
fabulous so the contrast is a lot higher

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.060 
fabulous so the contrast is a lot higher
