makeup because sometimes you know you
get<00:06:48.580> fallout<00:06:48.940> and<00:06:49.090> stuff<00:06:49.330> so<00:06:49.630> I<00:06:49.840> like<00:06:50.590> to<00:06:50.919> clean

00:06:51.269 --> 00:06:51.279 
get fallout and stuff so I like to clean

get fallout and stuff so I like to clean
off<00:06:51.430> the<00:06:51.580> fallout<00:06:51.940> and<00:06:52.120> then<00:06:52.270> make<00:06:52.479> this<00:06:52.659> the

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:52.870 
off the fallout and then make this the

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.339 
off the fallout and then make this the
last<00:06:53.139> step<00:06:53.440> for<00:06:53.680> my<00:06:54.039> eyes<00:06:54.279> and<00:06:54.870> mostly<00:06:55.870> my<00:06:56.080> face

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:58.840 
I guess so that is basically the

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.330 
I guess so that is basically the
finished<00:06:59.169> look<00:06:59.259> for<00:06:59.590> your<00:06:59.680> lips<00:06:59.860> you<00:07:00.009> can<00:07:00.159> pop
