00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.130
 small material to cut paste and a 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.189
 fold loire to realize here a fold 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.450
 well-being so so my map that measures 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:33.119
 12 cm by 12 cm I cut them and in 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.979
 my paper let's apply so I did a 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:40.579
 24 cm by 12 cm card this card 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.579
 bent in two 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.950
 my card I will use as a base I 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.009
 also carved a square in 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.950
 kraft paper so a 9 cm square of 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.729
 side I'm going to stick in the middle of the 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.729
 Red card 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.239
 here I am now going to close 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.920
 cuts in the masking t so i'm going 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:19.160
 make two small two small pieces 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:22.480
 of each you can tear it to the 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.830
 hand it gives an effect also to 6.1 scared 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.140
 and I'm doing a tape on the middle of my 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.140
 kraft card alternating colors 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:37.510
 so I chose if it is white 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.510
 red and light brown 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.990

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.990

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.250
 I will instead put a bright red 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.190
 and I end with the flakes 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.829
 so that was very easy to do 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:40.319

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:50.069
 cuts in my corrugated cardboard with my 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:53.909

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:56.459
 difficult to get out and I stick 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:58.670

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:15.880
 tape the masks in tea and I'm going 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:22.080
