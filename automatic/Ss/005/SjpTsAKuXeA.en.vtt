00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.530
 hello everyone and now I will show you my 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:18.070
 casino tactics on samp-rp 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:21.190
 the servers no matter what its main 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.680
 know and it will be easier to win 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.590
 more precisely it will be easier not to lose choose 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.680
 any basket for example 4 dragon well or 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.810
 Caligula I chose Caligula 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.850
 then we go to the casino the most important thing 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.980
 we should be 260,000 Wirth like 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.770
 starting capital and 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.180
 in general, nothing more is needed 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.530
 main tables which you are now 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:47.320
 see we go to the casino means we occupy 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:52.590
 any table for clarification any vip table 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.590
 from 10 to 100 thousand the world rises for him 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:03.309
 need to bet and bets 112 2 12-12 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:06.200
 each field has 12 numbers 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.570
 choose any field no matter what 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.360
 because in the casino the random goes and here 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.430
 just how lucky you are for example we 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.960
 Now we will bet on 112 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.960
 first bet 10,000 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.979
 set and wait 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.840
 you 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.740
 so we won means our table 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.409
 starts over again we again 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.140
 starting with the first rate of 10,000 set 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.310
 now to another field 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.920
 never put on a tobol which 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.979
 Now I won already thinking that we are lucky 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:51.670
 but you can still rely on different 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.670
 independently set the fields we wait 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.820
 so we lost go to the next 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.770
 table rates then again 10,000 why 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.840
 we put 10,000 up because when 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.670
 the winning bid amount is tripled 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.040
 that is, if we put 10 then we 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.330
 we get 30 but the previous rate of the shaft 10 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.400
 she burned out in addition to be 10,000 here 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.490
 we burned the rate go next 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.990
 betting on the table then we put 15,000 Wirth 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.990
 her 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.990
 we wait 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.379
 again bet lost go to 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:33.000
 next rate 22500 Wirth put on the 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:36.519
 the same field as before 212 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.819
 waiting for this system is different 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:42.099
 which needs to be doubled and put on 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.590
 double chances of type 118 and red and black 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:47.079
 It lies in the fact that here we have a chance to 7 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.659
 quite become hell just five this to us 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.549
 need the fifth again play it back 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:53.560
 probability is small our bet won 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:57.040
 now we move to the next field 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:11.079
 for example 312 and start all over again then 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:13.030
 have on put 10 thousand Wirth we 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.530
 lost and as you already understand us 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:29.379
 need to move on to the next 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:31.239
 bet on the table is 10,000 Wirth well or 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.549
 this all soon I'll post more 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.599
 one tactics for accurate calculation 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.599
 drop number 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.909
 as 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.909
 but casino casino
