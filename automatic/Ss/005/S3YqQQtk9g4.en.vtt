00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
so we've been around nearly 30 years

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.479 
so we've been around nearly 30 years
those<00:02:08.860> founders<00:02:09.429> were<00:02:09.670> interested<00:02:10.420> in

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
those founders were interested in

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.390 
those founders were interested in
enhancing<00:02:12.489> habitat<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.690> bit<00:02:14.650> focusing<00:02:15.250> on

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
enhancing habitat and bit focusing on

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.610 
enhancing habitat and bit focusing on
really<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.060> monarch<00:02:16.480> of<00:02:16.599> the<00:02:16.660> West<00:02:16.990> the

really the monarch of the West the

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.500 
really the monarch of the West the
and<00:02:18.159> I'd<00:02:18.340> add<00:02:18.519> these<00:02:18.670> mohandas<00:02:19.060> themselves

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
and I'd add these mohandas themselves

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.750 
and I'd add these mohandas themselves
they<00:02:19.989> were<00:02:20.049> hunters<00:02:20.560> themselves<00:02:21.069> absolutely

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.430 
perception of hunting is at an all-time
high<00:05:54.340> it<00:05:55.340> certainly<00:05:55.760> is<00:05:55.880> and<00:05:56.540> you<00:05:57.290> know<00:05:57.350> I

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
high it certainly is and you know I

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.990 
high it certainly is and you know I
think<00:05:57.560> groups<00:05:57.950> like<00:05:58.130> ours<00:05:58.340> are<00:05:58.700> trying<00:05:58.910> to

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
think groups like ours are trying to

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000 
think groups like ours are trying to
tell<00:05:59.180> the<00:05:59.300> story<00:05:59.600> of<00:05:59.840> hunters<00:06:00.590> and<00:06:00.860> what

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.010 
tell the story of hunters and what

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.180 
tell the story of hunters and what
they've<00:06:01.220> done<00:06:01.540> well<00:06:02.540> over<00:06:02.870> a<00:06:02.900> several<00:06:03.680> billion

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
they've done well over a several billion

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.310 
they've done well over a several billion
dollars<00:06:04.220> hunters<00:06:05.180> have<00:06:05.390> put<00:06:05.570> into<00:06:05.750> wildlife

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:06.320 
dollars hunters have put into wildlife

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.350 
dollars hunters have put into wildlife
conservation<00:06:07.130> in<00:06:07.280> the<00:06:07.730> last<00:06:07.940> hundred<00:06:08.150> years

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:08.360 
conservation in the last hundred years

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.070 
conservation in the last hundred years
in<00:06:09.140> North<00:06:09.410> America<00:06:10.010> so<00:06:10.600> they<00:06:11.600> really<00:06:11.930> have

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 
in North America so they really have

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.990 
in North America so they really have
supported<00:06:12.650> it<00:06:12.770> with<00:06:12.950> their<00:06:13.130> pocketbook<00:06:13.790> and

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
supported it with their pocketbook and

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.210 
supported it with their pocketbook and
not<00:06:14.600> just<00:06:14.900> so<00:06:15.050> they<00:06:15.200> can<00:06:15.260> harvest<00:06:15.680> something

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
not just so they can harvest something

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.010 
not just so they can harvest something
and<00:06:16.400> so<00:06:16.520> they<00:06:16.670> can<00:06:16.730> enjoy<00:06:16.850> the<00:06:17.330> outdoors<00:06:17.810> and

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
and so they can enjoy the outdoors and

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.920 
and so they can enjoy the outdoors and
take<00:06:18.890> their<00:06:19.070> families<00:06:19.520> along<00:06:19.850> and<00:06:20.180> enjoy<00:06:20.570> the

country opportunities for hunters are

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.340 
country opportunities for hunters are
good<00:06:42.490> and<00:06:43.490> we<00:06:44.390> just<00:06:44.570> need<00:06:44.750> to<00:06:44.870> kind<00:06:45.050> of<00:06:45.170> spread

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:45.350 
good and we just need to kind of spread

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:46.870 
good and we just need to kind of spread
the<00:06:45.560> word<00:06:45.740> about<00:06:45.950> how<00:06:46.220> hunting<00:06:46.730> is

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:46.880 
the word about how hunting is

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.270 
the word about how hunting is
conservation<00:06:47.330> and<00:06:47.900> the<00:06:48.530> role<00:06:48.740> that<00:06:48.770> hunters

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 
conservation and the role that hunters

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.310 
conservation and the role that hunters
play<00:06:49.550> and<00:06:49.790> the<00:06:49.850> work<00:06:50.030> that<00:06:50.240> we<00:06:50.360> do<00:06:50.570> and<00:06:50.780> then

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:51.320 
play and the work that we do and then

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.010 
play and the work that we do and then
access<00:06:51.830> to<00:06:52.070> as<00:06:52.250> a<00:06:52.280> key<00:06:52.520> point<00:06:52.790> for<00:06:53.210> hunters

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.020 
access to as a key point for hunters

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.140 
access to as a key point for hunters
really<00:06:54.320> the<00:06:54.890> number<00:06:55.130> one<00:06:55.280> reason<00:06:55.490> today<00:06:55.820> why

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.150 
really the number one reason today why

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.000 
really the number one reason today why
hunter<00:06:56.510> stop<00:06:56.840> hunting<00:06:57.260> is<00:06:57.380> lack<00:06:57.680> of<00:06:57.830> access

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.010 
hunter stop hunting is lack of access

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:02.500 
hunter stop hunting is lack of access
and<00:06:58.460> so<00:06:59.180> we<00:06:59.630> really<00:07:00.050> see<00:07:00.350> our<00:07:00.890> role<00:07:01.220> out<00:07:02.180> there

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:02.510 
and so we really see our role out there

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.630 
and so we really see our role out there
in<00:07:02.690> the<00:07:02.780> future<00:07:02.990> is<00:07:03.380> helping<00:07:03.800> improve<00:07:04.160> and

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:04.640 
in the future is helping improve and

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.790 
in the future is helping improve and
open<00:07:05.030> up<00:07:05.150> access<00:07:05.450> to<00:07:06.050> either<00:07:06.230> private<00:07:06.740> or
