00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
bright it's pretty dim in here I do have

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.240 
bright it's pretty dim in here I do have
the<00:04:23.169> lights<00:04:23.380> on<00:04:23.590> but<00:04:23.800> I<00:04:23.860> have<00:04:24.070> them<00:04:24.220> adjusted

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
the lights on but I have them adjusted

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.410 
the lights on but I have them adjusted
I<00:04:28.730> don't<00:04:29.730> necessarily<00:04:30.420> like<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.530> keystroke

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 
I don't necessarily like the keystroke

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.110 
I don't necessarily like the keystroke
it<00:04:33.420> doesn't<00:04:33.720> move<00:04:33.900> it<00:04:34.110> so<00:04:34.320> much<00:04:34.560> and<00:04:35.000> when<00:04:36.000> you

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
it doesn't move it so much and when you

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.330 
it doesn't move it so much and when you
do<00:04:36.330> just<00:04:37.080> it<00:04:37.260> it<00:04:37.410> seems<00:04:37.620> to<00:04:37.770> make<00:04:37.890> it<00:04:37.920> blurry

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
do just it it seems to make it blurry

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.060 
do just it it seems to make it blurry
this<00:04:39.330> is<00:04:39.510> as<00:04:39.660> clear<00:04:39.990> as<00:04:40.020> I've<00:04:40.320> managed<00:04:40.800> to<00:04:40.890> get

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
this is as clear as I've managed to get

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.690 
this is as clear as I've managed to get
it<00:04:41.250> and<00:04:41.400> also<00:04:41.880> I<00:04:42.470> guess<00:04:43.470> they're<00:04:43.710> assuming

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
it and also I guess they're assuming

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.670 
it and also I guess they're assuming
like<00:04:45.060> you<00:04:45.330> just<00:04:45.600> get<00:04:45.840> a<00:04:45.870> bigger<00:04:46.200> screen<00:04:46.440> size

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
like you just get a bigger screen size

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.180 
like you just get a bigger screen size
maybe<00:04:47.310> by<00:04:47.550> adjusting<00:04:48.090> the<00:04:48.240> projector<00:04:49.190> cuz

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
maybe by adjusting the projector cuz

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.790 
maybe by adjusting the projector cuz
that<00:04:50.370> says<00:04:50.580> on<00:04:50.760> there<00:04:50.940> goes<00:04:51.210> up<00:04:51.450> to<00:04:51.600> 150<00:04:52.410> inches

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
that says on there goes up to 150 inches

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.050 
that says on there goes up to 150 inches
well<00:04:53.510> I've<00:04:54.510> been<00:04:55.200> searching<00:04:56.190> the<00:04:56.310> manual<00:04:56.820> on<00:04:57.030> a

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
well I've been searching the manual on a

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.750 
well I've been searching the manual on a
jut<00:04:57.540> going<00:04:58.410> on<00:04:58.560> every<00:04:58.890> little<00:04:59.130> adjustment<00:04:59.700> I

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
jut going on every little adjustment I

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.720 
jut going on every little adjustment I
can<00:04:59.940> find<00:05:00.300> on<00:05:00.600> here<00:05:00.950> and<00:05:01.950> I<00:05:02.130> can't<00:05:02.430> find

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
can find on here and I can't find

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.530 
can find on here and I can't find
something<00:05:03.600> to<00:05:03.930> make<00:05:04.290> the<00:05:04.470> screen<00:05:04.860> bigger<00:05:05.540> you

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
something to make the screen bigger you

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.830 
something to make the screen bigger you
can<00:05:06.660> change<00:05:06.960> the<00:05:07.230> aspect<00:05:07.380> ratio<00:05:07.920> but<00:05:08.750> so<00:05:09.750> I'm

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
can change the aspect ratio but so I'm

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.410 
can change the aspect ratio but so I'm
assuming<00:05:10.140> you<00:05:10.500> would<00:05:10.650> just<00:05:10.830> know<00:05:11.420> mounted

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
assuming you would just know mounted

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.750 
assuming you would just know mounted
backwards<00:05:12.720> more<00:05:13.500> more<00:05:13.980> back<00:05:14.190> if<00:05:14.430> you<00:05:14.520> wanted

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
backwards more more back if you wanted

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.360 
backwards more more back if you wanted
it<00:05:14.910> to<00:05:14.940> be<00:05:15.030> bigger<00:05:15.330> well<00:05:16.130> my<00:05:17.130> head<00:05:17.340> tachi<00:05:17.640> was

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
it to be bigger well my head tachi was

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.460 
it to be bigger well my head tachi was
different<00:05:20.370> on<00:05:20.940> the<00:05:21.240> remote<00:05:21.720> you<00:05:21.750> can<00:05:22.080> adjust

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
different on the remote you can adjust

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.290 
different on the remote you can adjust
it<00:05:22.680> and<00:05:22.800> actually<00:05:23.040> it<00:05:23.340> has<00:05:23.610> keystrokes<00:05:24.540> or

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
it and actually it has keystrokes or

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.790 
it and actually it has keystrokes or
vertical<00:05:27.620> and<00:05:28.620> horizontal<00:05:29.570> like<00:05:30.570> this<00:05:31.560> one

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
vertical and horizontal like this one

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.970 
vertical and horizontal like this one
just<00:05:31.980> has<00:05:32.190> it<00:05:32.370> for<00:05:32.550> the<00:05:32.640> vertical<00:05:33.090> up-down

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
just has it for the vertical up-down

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.500 
just has it for the vertical up-down
this<00:05:34.980> one<00:05:35.220> right<00:05:35.400> here<00:05:35.700> has<00:05:35.910> a<00:05:35.970> side-to-side

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
this one right here has a side-to-side

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.560 
this one right here has a side-to-side
so<00:05:37.110> like<00:05:37.410> you<00:05:38.190> can<00:05:38.370> see<00:05:38.580> two<00:05:38.940> adjustments

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
so like you can see two adjustments

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.469 
so like you can see two adjustments
right<00:05:39.750> here<00:05:40.140> the<00:05:40.530> keystroke<00:05:41.040> and<00:05:41.400> then<00:05:42.180> right

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 
right here the keystroke and then right

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:50.120 
right here the keystroke and then right
here<00:05:43.910> so<00:05:45.380> I<00:05:47.570> don't<00:05:48.570> know<00:05:48.840> overall<00:05:49.830> it's

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
here so I don't know overall it's

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:58.790 
here so I don't know overall it's
alright<00:05:56.660> well<00:05:57.660> as<00:05:57.810> happy<00:05:58.229> as<00:05:58.290> I<00:05:58.440> thought<00:05:58.620> it

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
alright well as happy as I thought it

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.460 
alright well as happy as I thought it
would<00:05:58.919> be<00:05:59.070> with<00:05:59.220> it<00:05:59.720> we<00:06:00.720> probably<00:06:01.169> end<00:06:01.320> up

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
would be with it we probably end up

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.010 
would be with it we probably end up
keeping<00:06:01.919> it<00:06:02.070> just<00:06:02.370> because<00:06:03.180> I<00:06:03.300> hear<00:06:03.570> they<00:06:03.720> last

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
keeping it just because I hear they last

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.360 
keeping it just because I hear they last
a<00:06:04.229> long<00:06:04.380> time<00:06:05.180> I<00:06:06.380> just<00:06:07.380> didn't<00:06:07.890> want<00:06:08.070> to<00:06:08.130> get<00:06:08.340> a

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:08.370 
a long time I just didn't want to get a

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.570 
a long time I just didn't want to get a
new<00:06:08.610> a<00:06:08.640> new<00:06:08.820> bulb<00:06:09.270> for<00:06:09.630> this<00:06:09.810> guy<00:06:10.050> was<00:06:10.350> like<00:06:10.580> 125

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
new a new bulb for this guy was like 125

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.390 
new a new bulb for this guy was like 125
dollars<00:06:12.120> and<00:06:12.479> this<00:06:13.410> runs<00:06:13.919> miss<00:06:14.820> itachi<00:06:15.270> runs

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 
dollars and this runs miss itachi runs

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:22.370 
dollars and this runs miss itachi runs
at<00:06:17.840> 220<00:06:20.090> watts<00:06:21.090> and<00:06:21.419> I'm<00:06:21.510> pretty<00:06:21.720> sure<00:06:21.840> this

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 
at 220 watts and I'm pretty sure this

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.950 
at 220 watts and I'm pretty sure this
Bobby<00:06:23.540> LED<00:06:24.540> 3<00:06:24.990> is<00:06:25.640> 65<00:06:26.750> watts

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
Bobby LED 3 is 65 watts

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.140 
Bobby LED 3 is 65 watts
so<00:06:29.330> here<00:06:30.330> in<00:06:30.479> Hawaii<00:06:30.840> so<00:06:31.260> it<00:06:31.410> gets<00:06:31.560> pretty<00:06:31.770> hot

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150 
so here in Hawaii so it gets pretty hot

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.540 
so here in Hawaii so it gets pretty hot
unless<00:06:33.150> he

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.550 
unless he

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.570 
unless he
in<00:06:34.669> this<00:06:34.849> room<00:06:35.150> the<00:06:35.360> better<00:06:36.039> just<00:06:37.039> ended<00:06:37.400> I've

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.580 
in this room the better just ended I've

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:41.409 
in this room the better just ended I've
even<00:06:37.880> actually<00:06:38.270> having<00:06:38.539> a<00:06:38.680> ps3<00:06:39.680> die<00:06:40.419> from

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:41.419 
even actually having a ps3 die from

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:45.159 
even actually having a ps3 die from
overheating<00:06:41.900> so<00:06:42.590> hot<00:06:42.860> but<00:06:43.720> anyways<00:06:44.720> it<00:06:44.990> does

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:45.169 
overheating so hot but anyways it does

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:48.600 
overheating so hot but anyways it does
work<00:06:45.500> yeah<00:06:46.069> I<00:06:46.099> would<00:06:46.699> recommend<00:06:47.270> it<00:06:47.419> for

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:48.610 
work yeah I would recommend it for

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.890 
work yeah I would recommend it for
something<00:06:49.610> would<00:06:49.729> be<00:06:49.819> fun<00:06:50.090> for<00:06:50.270> the<00:06:50.389> kids<00:06:50.419> to

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:50.900 
something would be fun for the kids to

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.990 
something would be fun for the kids to
play<00:06:51.020> on<00:06:51.110> their<00:06:51.410> games<00:06:51.650> but<00:06:52.039> I<00:06:52.340> don't<00:06:52.759> think

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.000 
play on their games but I don't think

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.510 
play on their games but I don't think
they<00:06:53.120> would<00:06:53.330> the<00:06:54.020> resolutions<00:06:54.979> not<00:06:55.250> going<00:06:55.430> to

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 
they would the resolutions not going to

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.450 
they would the resolutions not going to
be<00:06:55.720> not<00:06:56.720> going<00:06:56.900> to<00:06:56.930> be<00:06:57.110> there<00:06:57.349> on<00:06:57.590> adjusting<00:06:58.310> it

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:58.460 
be not going to be there on adjusting it
