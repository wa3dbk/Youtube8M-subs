coming so going to made the decision to

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.810 
coming so going to made the decision to
turn<00:00:58.500> around<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.920> valley<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.370> we<00:00:59.460> decided

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
where leah was we actually sort of

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.810 
where leah was we actually sort of
slipped<00:05:27.580> and<00:05:29.010> at<00:05:30.010> that<00:05:30.190> time<00:05:30.520> I<00:05:30.550> actually

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
slipped and at that time I actually

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.700 
slipped and at that time I actually
tried<00:05:31.120> to<00:05:31.150> stand<00:05:31.510> on<00:05:31.690> my<00:05:31.840> leg<00:05:32.080> and<00:05:32.380> try<00:05:32.650> to

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
tried to stand on my leg and try to

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.800 
tried to stand on my leg and try to
brace<00:05:33.220> myself<00:05:33.460> and<00:05:33.910> the<00:05:34.000> leg<00:05:34.150> just<00:05:34.389> kind<00:05:34.750> of

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
brace myself and the leg just kind of

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.839 
brace myself and the leg just kind of
noodled<00:05:35.200> and<00:05:36.720> finally<00:05:37.720> when<00:05:37.840> we<00:05:38.460> were<00:05:39.460> able<00:05:39.580> to

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:39.849 
noodled and finally when we were able to

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:42.810 
noodled and finally when we were able to
sit<00:05:40.780> and<00:05:41.470> I<00:05:41.650> guess<00:05:41.860> in<00:05:41.979> a<00:05:42.039> safe<00:05:42.250> distance<00:05:42.700> away

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:42.820 
sit and I guess in a safe distance away

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.270 
sit and I guess in a safe distance away
from<00:05:42.910> the<00:05:43.120> plane<00:05:43.389> I<00:05:43.770> guess<00:05:44.770> that's<00:05:45.010> kind<00:05:45.099> of

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
from the plane I guess that's kind of

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.600 
from the plane I guess that's kind of
when<00:05:45.460> there's<00:05:46.419> realness<00:05:46.990> the<00:05:47.289> the<00:05:48.220> impact

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
when there's realness the the impact

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.920 
when there's realness the the impact
really<00:05:48.960> came<00:05:49.960> in<00:05:50.139> yeah<00:05:51.599> you<00:05:52.599> were<00:05:52.720> airlifted

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
really came in yeah you were airlifted

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:53.700 
really came in yeah you were airlifted
out<00:05:53.320> of<00:05:53.440> there

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
out of there

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.810 
out of there
we<00:05:54.550> were<00:05:54.789> hours<00:05:55.330> later<00:05:55.960> how<00:05:56.770> did<00:05:56.949> how<00:05:57.099> did<00:05:57.130> they

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
we were hours later how did how did they

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.409 
we were hours later how did how did they
find<00:05:58.030> you<00:05:58.349> well<00:05:59.729> all<00:06:00.729> planes<00:06:01.060> give<00:06:01.270> off<00:06:01.389> a

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
find you well all planes give off a

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:04.950 
find you well all planes give off a
signal<00:06:02.820> Cessna<00:06:03.820> planes<00:06:04.090> because<00:06:04.360> the<00:06:04.630> battery

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
signal Cessna planes because the battery

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.080 
signal Cessna planes because the battery
isn't<00:06:05.139> as<00:06:05.410> big<00:06:05.740> as<00:06:06.010> commercial<00:06:06.580> airliners

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
isn't as big as commercial airliners

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.879 
isn't as big as commercial airliners
gives<00:06:07.780> off<00:06:07.990> a<00:06:08.020> signal<00:06:08.320> I<00:06:08.560> think<00:06:08.770> it's

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:08.889 
gives off a signal I think it's

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:10.439 
gives off a signal I think it's
somewhere<00:06:09.190> in<00:06:09.400> between<00:06:09.490> 15<00:06:10.060> and<00:06:10.090> 20<00:06:10.419> minutes

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:10.449 
somewhere in between 15 and 20 minutes

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:12.240 
somewhere in between 15 and 20 minutes
every<00:06:10.780> 15<00:06:11.169> 20<00:06:11.289> minutes<00:06:11.680> at<00:06:11.740> this<00:06:11.889> sentence<00:06:12.190> a

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
every 15 20 minutes at this sentence a

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.610 
every 15 20 minutes at this sentence a
signal<00:06:12.580> of<00:06:12.910> its<00:06:13.120> location<00:06:13.630> the<00:06:13.840> reason<00:06:14.500> why<00:06:14.590> I

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
signal of its location the reason why I

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.159 
signal of its location the reason why I
guess<00:06:14.860> it<00:06:15.370> takes<00:06:15.580> so<00:06:16.330> long<00:06:16.510> in<00:06:16.690> between<00:06:16.780> is

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:17.169 
guess it takes so long in between is

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:18.629 
guess it takes so long in between is
because<00:06:17.440> you<00:06:17.530> know<00:06:17.620> if<00:06:17.710> you're<00:06:17.860> very<00:06:18.130> very<00:06:18.340> far

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 
because you know if you're very very far

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:21.089 
because you know if you're very very far
away<00:06:18.669> they'd<00:06:19.030> rather<00:06:19.210> have<00:06:19.510> the<00:06:19.720> signal<00:06:20.110> for<00:06:21.039> a

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:21.099 
away they'd rather have the signal for a

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:23.490 
away they'd rather have the signal for a
long<00:06:21.280> period<00:06:21.699> of<00:06:21.729> time<00:06:21.789> right<00:06:22.630> every<00:06:22.930> 20

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:23.500 
long period of time right every 20

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.629 
long period of time right every 20
minutes<00:06:23.680> rather<00:06:23.919> than<00:06:24.070> if<00:06:24.250> it<00:06:24.370> were<00:06:24.460> to<00:06:24.550> go

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 
minutes rather than if it were to go

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:26.580 
minutes rather than if it were to go
every<00:06:24.880> five<00:06:25.090> minutes<00:06:25.300> you<00:06:26.020> know<00:06:26.110> the<00:06:26.410> battery

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590 
every five minutes you know the battery

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.120 
every five minutes you know the battery
would<00:06:26.860> only<00:06:26.979> that<00:06:27.190> so<00:06:27.370> long<00:06:27.630> and<00:06:28.630> so<00:06:28.870> they<00:06:29.830> saw

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130 
would only that so long and so they saw

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.180 
would only that so long and so they saw
our<00:06:30.400> signal<00:06:30.849> and<00:06:31.560> but<00:06:32.560> for<00:06:32.830> whatever<00:06:33.010> reason

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
our signal and but for whatever reason

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.350 
our signal and but for whatever reason
they<00:06:33.610> didn't

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
they didn't

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.820 
they didn't
they<00:06:34.449> didn't<00:06:34.659> call<00:06:34.870> search<00:06:35.110> and<00:06:35.289> rescue<00:06:35.560> until

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:35.830 
they didn't call search and rescue until

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.200 
they didn't call search and rescue until
about<00:06:36.009> 6:00<00:06:36.939> p.m.<00:06:37.259> that<00:06:38.259> day<00:06:38.560> and<00:06:39.060> I'm<00:06:40.060> not

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
about 6:00 p.m. that day and I'm not

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.899 
about 6:00 p.m. that day and I'm not
sure<00:06:40.419> why<00:06:40.689> but<00:06:41.020> and<00:06:41.530> so<00:06:41.710> it<00:06:41.860> did<00:06:42.250> take<00:06:42.669> around

00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:42.909 
sure why but and so it did take around

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:45.089 
sure why but and so it did take around
five<00:06:43.270> hours<00:06:43.300> there<00:06:43.930> five<00:06:44.409> hours<00:06:44.800> with<00:06:44.979> this

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:45.099 
five hours there five hours with this

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:48.480 
five hours there five hours with this
serious<00:06:45.550> injury<00:06:46.479> you're<00:06:47.319> bleeding<00:06:47.680> your<00:06:48.189> your

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:55.960 
actually just talking to Elliot the

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.520 
actually just talking to Elliot the
other<00:06:56.080> day<00:06:57.150> we<00:06:58.150> were<00:06:58.270> talking<00:06:58.479> about<00:06:58.780> you<00:06:59.409> know

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.860 
other day we were talking about you know
the<00:06:59.889> plane<00:07:00.099> crash<00:07:00.340> and<00:07:00.639> he<00:07:00.969> told<00:07:01.210> me<00:07:01.360> how<00:07:01.539> he

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:01.870 
the plane crash and he told me how he

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.270 
the plane crash and he told me how he
was<00:07:02.409> kind<00:07:02.590> of<00:07:02.620> just<00:07:02.770> saying<00:07:02.919> yeah<00:07:03.099> I'm

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:03.280 
was kind of just saying yeah I'm

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.510 
was kind of just saying yeah I'm
everyone<00:07:03.669> we<00:07:03.789> moved<00:07:04.770> from<00:07:05.770> that<00:07:06.039> embankment

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:06.520 
everyone we moved from that embankment

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.219 
everyone we moved from that embankment
to<00:07:07.029> underneath<00:07:07.300> the<00:07:07.479> tree<00:07:07.689> because<00:07:08.020> it<00:07:08.139> was

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:08.229 
to underneath the tree because it was

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:10.980 
to underneath the tree because it was
beginning<00:07:08.620> to<00:07:08.710> rain<00:07:09.419> and<00:07:10.419> I<00:07:10.659> don't<00:07:10.840> really

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:10.990 
beginning to rain and I don't really

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.809 
beginning to rain and I don't really
remember<00:07:11.199> that<00:07:11.379> very<00:07:11.680> well<00:07:11.800> and<00:07:12.370> that<00:07:12.550> must

00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:12.819 
remember that very well and that must

00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:14.550 
remember that very well and that must
have<00:07:13.029> been<00:07:13.150> because<00:07:13.360> I<00:07:13.750> was<00:07:13.960> in<00:07:14.080> such<00:07:14.259> a<00:07:14.289> state

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 
have been because I was in such a state

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.369 
have been because I was in such a state
of<00:07:14.590> shock<00:07:14.680> and<00:07:15.099> it's<00:07:15.250> such<00:07:15.430> a<00:07:15.460> I<00:07:16.180> guess<00:07:17.169> such<00:07:17.349> a

00:07:17.369 --> 00:07:17.379 
of shock and it's such a I guess such a

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:20.839 
of shock and it's such a I guess such a
state<00:07:17.620> of<00:07:17.770> just<00:07:18.330> you<00:07:19.330> know<00:07:19.419> I<00:07:19.449> was<00:07:19.659> lost<00:07:19.870> I<00:07:20.229> was

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:20.849 
state of just you know I was lost I was

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:25.020 
state of just you know I was lost I was
it<00:07:21.849> was<00:07:21.969> a<00:07:22.000> moment<00:07:22.389> of<00:07:22.449> terror<00:07:22.719> you<00:07:22.960> know
