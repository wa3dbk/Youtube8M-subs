00:00:01.116 --> 00:00:03.294
Hello everyone, I’m İdil. Welcome to my kitchen.

00:00:03.494 --> 00:00:08.230
We’ll make an omelette in this video.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.234
When someone says egg, omelette is the first thing that comes to…

00:00:12.434 --> 00:00:16.394
…my mind! Let’s take a look at the ingredients.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.173
2 eggs.  1 tbsp grated mozzarella cheese.

00:00:22.373 --> 00:00:25.846
You can use any cheese that you have in your fridge.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.600
3 springs of parsley. 1/2 tbsp butter. Some salt and pepper.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.240
Now first, let’s whisk the eggs with a fork, in a bowl.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.672
I use 2 eggs for the omelette.

00:00:42.872 --> 00:00:46.800
You can use 3 eggs if you like. If I’m on a diet, then I use 3 eggs too.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.964
But I use only the yolk of 1 of them.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.539
Now I’m whisking the eggs, mixing the yolks and whites.

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.061
I want them too mix well. This is important in an omelette.

00:01:03.261 --> 00:01:07.183
The eggs were at room temperature. I removed them from the fridge an hour ago.

00:01:07.383 --> 00:01:09.633
You should also try that. You’ll see the difference.

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:14.211
Now I’m whisking them until well mixed.

00:01:15.629 --> 00:01:20.488
Eggs are beautifully mixed. Now I set them aside. Meanwhile I’ll heat the pan up.

00:01:20.688 --> 00:01:23.772
I put the pan on medium heat and add butter.

00:01:23.972 --> 00:01:29.370
I don’t like a overcooked egg. I mean, of course it should be cooked but I like …

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.736
…undercooked, soft omelette. So I’m not cooking the omelette on high heat, but medium heat.

00:01:35.936 --> 00:01:42.165
I’ll keep the heat on medium all throughout the cooking.

00:01:42.365 --> 00:01:44.154
Now I’l wait for the butter to melt.

00:01:47.537 --> 00:01:53.335
The butter has melted. I’m adding the eggs before the butter gets too hot.

00:01:56.176 --> 00:01:57.676
Now I’ll wait for about 10 seconds.

00:01:57.876 --> 00:02:03.068
I’ll see the sides begin to firm up.

00:02:03.995 --> 00:02:08.794
Then I’ll stir the omelette with small movements.

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:14.108
This way, it will cook evenly.

00:02:14.308 --> 00:02:18.682
The sides started cooking. I will push that side towards the center.

00:02:23.095 --> 00:02:28.494
I like my omelette with butter but you can use a good quality olive oil.

00:02:35.703 --> 00:02:39.747
Omelette recipes are actually completely up to your own taste.

00:02:39.947 --> 00:02:45.090
If you like it overcooked, turn the heat up, be sure you get the golden-brown color.

00:02:49.122 --> 00:02:51.375
Tilt your pan so that it's even.

00:03:02.915 --> 00:03:08.910
I’ll let the omelette cook now. After I see that it’s halfway done, I’ll add the cheese and…

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.720
…parsley in.

00:03:12.435 --> 00:03:17.654
The omelette is halfway cooked. I guess you can see the change in the egg.

00:03:17.854 --> 00:03:22.687
Now I add the cheese. Omelette, actually, is a great way to…

00:03:22.887 --> 00:03:27.388
…use left overs.

00:03:27.588 --> 00:03:32.981
This way you get to use them up!

00:03:33.661 --> 00:03:38.506
You can use any other cheese, ham, greens

00:03:38.706 --> 00:03:43.398
Potatoes, anything that comes to your mind, you can use most of them in an omelette.

00:03:44.077 --> 00:03:48.648
I put half the parsley in. I like to see some green in an omelette.

00:03:48.848 --> 00:03:51.099
So today I used parsley.

00:03:52.835 --> 00:03:58.591
I make sure the sides aren’t stuck to the pan, with a spatula.

00:03:59.775 --> 00:04:04.813
I like to use a non-stick pan for an omelette. I bring the heat to low now.

00:04:05.013 --> 00:04:09.172
I fold it with a spatula.

00:04:10.464 --> 00:04:12.977
It will be easier for you if you tilt your pan a little.

00:04:14.688 --> 00:04:16.937
Slowly, and done.

00:04:17.137 --> 00:04:21.142
You can fold it in three if you like.

00:04:22.144 --> 00:04:25.150
I press on it a little.

00:04:28.931 --> 00:04:34.384
I remove from heat. I don’t like the omelette to turn golden-brown, as you can see.

00:04:34.584 --> 00:04:39.909
I like the light gold color, it’s very soft. Please leave your comments on how you like your omelette.

00:04:40.109 --> 00:04:45.584
Lets add a pinch of salt.

00:04:46.512 --> 00:04:51.288
There’s no need for much, because the cheese is already salty.

00:04:51.973 --> 00:04:53.719
I also add some pepper.

00:04:57.242 --> 00:04:58.481
Now I’m plating it.

00:04:58.681 --> 00:05:00.244
Slowly…

00:05:01.951 --> 00:05:05.180
Excellent! The kitchen smells incredible right now.

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:09.622
I sprinkle the spared parsley on top.

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:11.126
For decoration

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:18.325
And the omelette is ready. It’s a soft, moist omelette. I can’t wait to taste it.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.998
I put some cherry tomatoes on the side of the omelette. Now if you excuse me, I’ll taste it

00:05:34.269 --> 00:05:38.871
It’s a soft, moist omelette. I would be pleased if you try leave your comments about this recipe
