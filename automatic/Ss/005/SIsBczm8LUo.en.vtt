of this year if your amp features all
the<00:00:43.260> innovative<00:00:44.010> solutions<00:00:44.399> we<00:00:45.059> already

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
the innovative solutions we already

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.470 
the innovative solutions we already
introduced<00:00:45.989> for<00:00:46.320> our<00:00:46.440> top<00:00:47.039> line<00:00:47.340> in<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.910> cs2

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
introduced for our top line in the cs2

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.750

so<00:00:49.230> it's<00:00:49.410> an<00:00:49.530> integrated<00:00:50.039> amplifier<00:00:50.430> that

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
so it's an integrated amplifier that

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.670 
so it's an integrated amplifier that
automatically<00:00:51.420> changes<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.170> pure<00:00:52.410> power

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
automatically changes to a pure power

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.770 
automatically changes to a pure power

this we can pack in a quite attractive

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.330 
this we can pack in a quite attractive

look for a hope and attractive price and

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.240 
look for a hope and attractive price and
my<00:01:23.520> approach<00:01:23.820> will<00:01:24.150> be<00:01:25.040> since<00:01:26.040> we're<00:01:26.189> in

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
my approach will be since we're in

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.580 
my approach will be since we're in
Germany<00:01:26.520> we<00:01:27.360> can<00:01:27.570> talk<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.020> use<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.409> would

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
Germany we can talk and use this would

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.810 
Germany we can talk and use this would
be<00:01:28.799> about<00:01:29.450> 1500<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.479> 1800<00:01:31.229> euros<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.520> US

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
be about 1500 to 1800 euros and US

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.609 
be about 1500 to 1800 euros and US
dollar<00:01:33.119> let's<00:01:33.390> say<00:01:33.540> below<00:01:33.810> 2000<00:01:34.470> US<00:01:34.680> dollars

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
dollar let's say below 2000 US dollars

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.249 
dollar let's say below 2000 US dollars
that's<00:01:36.100> a<00:01:36.189> great<00:01:36.369> price<00:01:36.670> for<00:01:36.939> a<00:01:37.000> BMC<00:01:37.540> product<00:01:37.930> I

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
that's a great price for a BMC product I

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.530 
that's a great price for a BMC product I
hope<00:01:39.070> so<00:01:39.399> and<00:01:39.670> I've<00:01:39.759> had<00:01:39.909> if<00:01:40.119> you<00:01:40.210> see<00:01:40.390> it<00:01:40.509> that

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
hope so and I've had if you see it that

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.950 
hope so and I've had if you see it that
