00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.350
 Hey YouTube users it's Charlie we finally got our first real look at Grant in Gustin 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.960
 So this work will collapse it along with the update for all 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.639
 The things we learned about the show in the past two weeks. My stock valuation 

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:02.210
 The finale is being published later tonight. I'll take a link because it's in description. 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.990
 Before this clip we had seen a bunch of pictures from his set in costume, but this 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.439
 In fact it is difficult to judge when there are no special effects added and do not have color 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:10.170
 Correct everything. 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.840
 So for the first time outside the most obvious thing. Great powers. I dig exactly what they do 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.909
 With them. Both look at Grant Gustin super fast, and the way his character is treated 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.890
 for them. In comedy, Barry Allen is not a reluctant hero. So it's not like Bruce Banner 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.060
 This structure. Barry will not cure Speedforce like a curse, it's a blessing. all 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.310
 Association of Justice A-list superheroes, he is one of those more positive and self-conscious. 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.439
 Remember what Boy Arrow was the guest when he starred earlier this season? 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.509
 He's like a superhero who got called to big companies. 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.170
 Because he even races around in the suit in the clip there is a little bit of disconnecting. 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.659
 Because right now in the normal timeline he still passed out, he did not know about 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.039
 He has new powers and he does not have a lawsuit yet. 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.679
 So I'll be ready to be that the trailer events are mostly taken from the pilot 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.819
 With a few small trucks. Right now they are not in production for season 1 yet. So only 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:06.350
 The shots they have are the things they already pick up, or any green screen things they did at 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.810
 Al Tayer. 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.420
 It does not always include everything from buggies in the final version of episodes, 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.040
 But I think we can plan for Steven Amell and Felicity have at least minor appearances 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.049
 In the first episode. Unless expanded and made two parts. 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:23.420
 But let's talk about crossing with the arrow, because the trailer itself is the arrow 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.780
 Cross. 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.380
 Will flash whether it is in the special show, Mark Guggenheim, Andrew Kriesberg and all other producers 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.560
 They do the best we can to make them a common universe. It's kind of is already starting from the loop 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.069
 19 stuff with Kateline Snow, Ramon Labs and Cisco Star. 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.590
 That being said, I think full of material transitions will be limited to a few times 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.079
 Season at most. But there will be tons of verbal references to people on other shows. 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.170
 I love when Felicity says she was dumped by someone in a coma. Talking about Barry 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.780
 And Western Iris. This is not true. The Western iris is supposed to be Barry's best friend 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.600
 The way Oliver and Felicity are the best friends to have just a lot of chemistry. 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.600
 So all shippers there are just thinking of Iris and Barry as the new Olicity. 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.009
 Let's next talk about Season 1 story. Barry is like a CSI person in Central 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:13.380
 City Police Station. His mentor slant figure father is a Western detective. So there will be 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.729
 Maniac of solving the aspects of crime week to show. But the big big story would be Barry 

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:22.290
 Learn to use his powers clear his father killed his mother. Remember that great 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.310
 Map the board in its office with all red link lines. Imagine his super speeding to all 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.530
 Those places get his CSI deviation on. 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.579
 The whim of the week things will be day to day, and he will solve his mother 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.449
 Killed in the background every week. It's like an arrow where a team takes down criminals 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:40.570
 Every week, but the main story was Deathstroke and Mirakuru. 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:46.500
 As for the bad guys Deathstroke level on the flash, there is a big question mark Edward 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.530
 Thawne, which is likely to turn out to be magnification. 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:56.530
 If you look here at the end it seems to zoom past running credits. So I receive 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.030
 Really excited. 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.600
 I fully expect Flash to do the same thing I did the arrow with superhero and just names 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.519
 Shorten them. There are other comic book characters on display such as Kateline Snow and Cisco Ramon, 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.840
 But they can do something for Laurel with them. 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.570
 As in the Laurel is a black canary in comedy, only the arrow has a normal person, with 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.520
 We promise that in one season in the future she wants to become Canary Black. So Katlin Snow can always be 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.900
 The killer turns Frost, or just frost if we shorten it. But do not expect it at any time 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.080
 coming soon. 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.580
 In episode 19 she seemed like such a fun person and I think she would be one of the good ones 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.419
 Men during season 1. Keep your eyes peeled though. Armor agents do this thing 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.229
 Where they made Ward turn evil at the end of the season. 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:46.500
 Let's talk about other characters, I already did not show a video for my main cast. But 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:53.500
 Tom Cavanaugh is Harrison Wells, and he is the person who is responsible for the particles 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.370
 Acceleration Accelerator. So he would be like Professor Livo from the show. Just 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.340
 It hates it. He's not a villain like Evo though. 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.260
 As for John Wesley Shipp. Yes everyone hopes it turned out to be Jay Garrick 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:13.020
 flash. Whatever his role is, it will be repeated. But it is also possible that he can play 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.370
 Captain Frey of Comedy. He's one of Barry's bosses at the police department 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.530
 He also has a secret character called Captain Incredible. So the shipp can play superhero 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.590
 In disguise regardless of who is his vanity and narcissism. 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.650
 As for episode 1 when going in the air, I posted this video and we do not know any 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:37.650
 Tonight will flash on air. But they will say tomorrow in upfronts. My guess is 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.240
 He would either replace Star crossed, which was canceled, on Monday at 8 or 9 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.210
 Or it will replace 100 shares after Wednesday. 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.980
 Because they will let us know tomorrow. I'm just going to post an update in description 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.090
 With the day and time it will be broadcast on. The only reason I kind of want to be different 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.320
 The night of the arrow is super hard for me to do video clips for two in the same 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.790
 Night. This is mainly why I have not done supernatural videos. just to 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.139
 I'm very tired by the time I end up with SHIELD videos. Crossed the fingers. 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.090
 I'll be doing weekly bonus videos for the flash and the stock in the off-season. So be sure 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:06.210
 Subscribe to get everything, and leave me suggestions for topics in the comments below. 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.340
 My arrow will finally end in a few hours and my Q will be posted tomorrow like regular. 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.600
 I'll be combining the arrow and Flash stuff, so feel free to ask me anything about either 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.620
 Appear. 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.200
 Right now click here for my video arrow end and click here for that Q &amp; A 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.580
 Annotations as soon as I publish them. 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.770
 Thanks for watching, see you guys tonight. High quiches!
