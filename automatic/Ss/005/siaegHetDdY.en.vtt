00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.309
 and what happens we are here Kim Jong 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:09.030
 craig we were going to bring you an advance of 

00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:10.799
 skins the king of project you know 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.440
 project as project jazz there was already 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:17.250
 came out this time and we are here in a 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.710
 promotional page of these skins and look 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.109
 what a nice example in animus type of the 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.900
 socia script actually has here the 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.660
 symbols of the siege and thomson and I remembered 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.089
 were these and point and these symbols 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.340
 also what is said is like this 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:34.650
 in any case we have a project here 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.850
 jazz there was someone who already has 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:41.100
 come out and it's marked as it is 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.690
 taken out does not say is your asset I do not know what 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.800
 I do not know how much he puts us here is another one that 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.080
 explains some details 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.080
 if we want here then it does not appear 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.210
 little things going up 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:58.260
 as well 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.809
 I find it great as we go 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.640
 hence, we are interested in the other 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.400
 skills and from those who go to 0 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.530
 up here we will talk later about 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.470
 done because it gives us nothing of 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.830
 information this node 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.300
 so let's go to this and well this 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.470
 is all that makes us is giving 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:24.280
 information and clues about who is 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:27.130
 the corner is a bit there a little bit of 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:31.180
 you have to play with what you know 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:33.340
 lot and we're going to look at this and he says 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.950
 here what 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.250
 because revealed defense that dances 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.650
 around the enemy and I do not know I do not know 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.840
 How much does it cost 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.100
 so I 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.320
 Obviously this was looking at me before 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.780
 make videos because it gives us time to 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.710
 read without even text in this 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.619
 time there you have it again and it's worth it 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.810
 he says that he throws himself towards the enemy the 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.080
 mow against the enemy etc then I 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.000
 I would say yes now because with the new 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.880
 record with really dance around the 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.950
 enemy and with the last subject still 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.870
 orbit around enemy as it says 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:19.490
 there so I would say it's here and now 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:22.010
 ok then we have here to see 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.080
 this was pretty easy nancy here you 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.400
 says brand marked by darkness and 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:31.939
 there is only one this point and final 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.099
 some say they are not I do not think that 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:35.540
 be heel just because you put silence 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:38.239
 there 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:42.500
 marked by darkness is only one in 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:46.800
 the one that puts the mark of death 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:49.460
 so there we would have to do 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.840
 who is this 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:55.580
 but anyway 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.580
 of beer age 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.380
 pierce in the milkmaid 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.010
 Mr. looked like it seems to me 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.520
 let's see if we can see it again 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:14.470
 because he does not want 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.470
 I will see if there is now 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.249
 Well, like a blazer 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.519
 in the pure is an almost normal fury 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:34.410
 time to read it well in any case 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:37.800
 everything sounds pretty negative 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.980
 to light and such and that that is 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:43.890
 penetrating and such has all the appearance of 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.020
 to be looked like they looked like 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.440
 project would be quite comfortable science 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.350
 mind 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.580
 then we also have around here shines in 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:56.760
 the feet 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:04:00.060
 in the protector of light pringles the 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.930
 boys are faith finds out everything 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.930
 because I do not have time 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.410
 there are not mine 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.410
 has been 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:18.060
 they are fire in the boss 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:19.700
 If it is not important if you are nowhere 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.020
 good 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:26.389
 I would say that in lioness that's why 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:31.419
 says something of the light 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:35.240
 but another possibility would be to fall but 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:38.060
 lion welcomes a reinforcement because it does 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:42.310
 time in a while ago not so much a 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:46.110
 river ter said they were going 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:50.020
 I was looking forward to a skin out of 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:55.090
 sci-fi of lioness and casually 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:59.040
 here it is so that as such no 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:03.100
 otherwise, it would be in the other good option 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.020
 and the latter who is good because if 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.770
 you enter the promotional page from 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:13.160
 the mobile will appear a churrasco there 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:15.680
 which is an image with some 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:20.510
 with a text that I do not remember that says 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:23.040
 that the corrupt lie or I do not know that no 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:26.730
 I know how much I tell you a moment 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:30.330
 what I said tells you do not trust and 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:31.830
 it also tells you corrupt memory in 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.490
 how much to corrupt memory then the in 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:38.060
 feira has done in itself and the lot does not 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.060
 trust 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:45.220
 I do not know what it comes from and by the way 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.560
 obviously has an image what 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.990
 you will be seeing two images better 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.690
 said one that is with which salt enters 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:56.440
 from the mobile that has messages and other 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:58.740
 which is what they put the other day to 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:03.509
 finish him 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:06.620
 the ls s not so there you have that and 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:09.410
 you can say who is good 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.550
 The first thing is that you have a child with 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.650
 which can you 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.900
 there's a hint that it may be longer 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:19.920
 that a lot of people say it can be without 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:22.950
 salt for him 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:26.190
 for the hair it has but if you go to 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:30.000
 move from jacques to the original good 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:32.640
 to the original new you will see that it has that 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:37.950
 same fucking pigtail and of course he has 

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:42.020
 the same thing so I would say that by 90% 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:45.930
 possibility that jacques is valid and if not 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:47.300
 we would have a chincha or a 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:51.259
 possibility 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:53.960
 I do not believe it honestly and also 

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:55.729
 we could have there that I do not think so either 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.720
 because he has a skin that I do not remember 

00:06:55.729 --> 00:07:03.680
 which is that this is also in plan 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:05.060
 futuristic science fiction so so 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.800
 I do not have much more than comments 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.659
 Gentlemen, I hope you have been 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.729
 interesting to tell me what you think 

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:12.670
 you wrong me some can 

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:15.340
 to be 

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:17.680
 anyone you each 

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.990
 these know percent has also been 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.840
 people who have said in the picture is a 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:24.580
 new champion at risk have you said that 

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.190
 the next champion will take it a 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:30.250
 little bit more of good public time 

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:33.340
 they are vacationing us too with in 

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:38.350
 vacation a little bit so 

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:40.570
 I want to be a new champion and it's going to 

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:42.880
 go out with a people projects and by the 

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:44.710
 face then nothing to tell me that what 

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.290
 it seems life favorite italy you know that 

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:48.580
 it helps a lot anything to roger 

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.470
 mason who by the way I'm the one who stayed 

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:53.280
 nothing appears here 

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.280
 or if 

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:58.860
 that's a lawyer because that's what 

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.860
 appears here 

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:06.250
 in mouths that we see
