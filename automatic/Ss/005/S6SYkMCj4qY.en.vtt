the camera the probe rapid you can do it

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.149 
the camera the probe rapid you can do it
manually<00:01:03.989> it's<00:01:04.260> just<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.680> most<00:01:05.119> DSLRs<00:01:06.119> today

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
manually it's just that most DSLRs today

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.130 
manually it's just that most DSLRs today
we'll<00:01:08.159> go<00:01:08.369> ahead<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:09.299> do<00:01:09.479> an<00:01:09.600> automatic

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
we'll go ahead and do an automatic

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.170 
we'll go ahead and do an automatic
bracket<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:10.890> want<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.400> find<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:11.970> your

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
bracket so you want to find on your

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.080 
bracket so you want to find on your
camera<00:01:12.650> where<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.950> can<00:01:14.159> go<00:01:14.340> ahead<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.640> rack

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
camera where you can go ahead and rack

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.499 
camera where you can go ahead and rack
it<00:01:15.650> and<00:01:16.650> we'll<00:01:16.920> talk<00:01:17.189> about<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.580> also<00:01:18.030> during

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
it and we'll talk about that also during

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.260 
it and we'll talk about that also during
the<00:01:18.630> program<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.259> possibly<00:01:20.030> will<00:01:21.030> use

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
the program and possibly will use

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.270 
the program and possibly will use
several<00:01:21.600> cameras<00:01:22.140> for<00:01:22.320> example<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.040> a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
several cameras for example this is a

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.800 
several cameras for example this is a
nikon<00:01:23.490> d200<00:01:24.530> and<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:26.070> has<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.790> brackets<00:01:27.360> at<00:01:27.540> one

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
nikon d200 and it has it brackets at one

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.580 
nikon d200 and it has it brackets at one
stop<00:01:28.909> if<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.090> can<00:01:30.270> bracket<00:01:30.689> into<00:01:30.810> that's<00:01:31.290> even

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
stop if you can bracket into that's even

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.429 
stop if you can bracket into that's even
better<00:01:31.970> but<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.060> will<00:01:33.210> make<00:01:33.390> nine<00:01:33.689> exposures

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
better but it will make nine exposures

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.090 
better but it will make nine exposures
nine<00:01:34.920> bracketing<00:01:35.520> exposures<00:01:36.590> four<00:01:37.590> up<00:01:37.799> four

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
nine bracketing exposures four up four

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.230 
nine bracketing exposures four up four
down<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.579> then<00:01:39.270> one<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.689> center<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:41.240> we're

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
down and then one in the center so we're

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.359 
down and then one in the center so we're
going<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.420> use<00:01:42.630> our<00:01:42.840> lowest<00:01:43.259> ISO<00:01:43.829> which<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.340> a

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
going to use our lowest ISO which is a

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.940 
going to use our lowest ISO which is a
hundred<00:01:44.850> for<00:01:45.720> outdoor<00:01:46.079> especially<00:01:46.799> when

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.260 
focus you wouldn't want to use aperture
priority<00:05:09.590> because<00:05:10.159> then<00:05:10.430> it<00:05:10.789> would<00:05:10.970> go<00:05:11.000> ahead

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
priority because then it would go ahead

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.899 
priority because then it would go ahead
and<00:05:11.479> it<00:05:11.720> would<00:05:11.870> have<00:05:12.050> some<00:05:12.260> depth<00:05:12.560> of<00:05:12.770> field<00:05:13.039> as

00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:13.909 
and it would have some depth of field as

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:17.290 
and it would have some depth of field as
it<00:05:14.810> went<00:05:15.020> back<00:05:15.260> and<00:05:15.530> forth<00:05:16.030> to<00:05:17.030> choose<00:05:17.270> a

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
it went back and forth to choose a

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.379 
it went back and forth to choose a
different<00:05:17.599> aperture<00:05:18.169> so<00:05:19.010> we're<00:05:19.250> using<00:05:19.400> either

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
different aperture so we're using either

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:25.719 
different aperture so we're using either
shutter<00:05:20.930> priority<00:05:21.280> or<00:05:24.099> just<00:05:25.099> manual<00:05:25.520> and<00:05:25.669> I

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
shutter priority or just manual and I

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:27.310 
shutter priority or just manual and I
don't<00:05:25.880> got<00:05:26.060> that<00:05:26.090> I<00:05:26.330> know<00:05:26.389> exactly<00:05:26.599> what<00:05:27.199> I'm

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
don't got that I know exactly what I'm

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.080 
don't got that I know exactly what I'm
doing<00:05:27.349> it<00:05:27.710> exactly<00:05:27.830> the<00:05:28.280> exposures<00:05:28.849> that<00:05:28.880> I've

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
doing it exactly the exposures that I've

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.600 
doing it exactly the exposures that I've
got<00:05:29.300> and<00:05:29.930> I<00:05:30.020> don't<00:05:30.260> have<00:05:30.680> to<00:05:30.710> worry<00:05:31.699> about

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
got and I don't have to worry about

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.490 
got and I don't have to worry about
problems<00:05:34.610> like<00:05:34.849> that<00:05:35.090> also<00:05:35.659> one<00:05:35.900> other<00:05:35.930> thing

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
problems like that also one other thing

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.700 
problems like that also one other thing
on<00:05:37.370> your<00:05:37.639> camera's<00:05:38.330> usually

here's a single exposure want to make
sure<00:05:43.220> that<00:05:43.580> you're<00:05:43.610> involved<00:05:44.030> exposure<00:05:44.740> so

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
sure that you're involved exposure so

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.740 
sure that you're involved exposure so
let's<00:05:46.010> go<00:05:46.220> ahead<00:05:46.250> and<00:05:46.550> do<00:05:46.910> one<00:05:47.210> more<00:05:47.240> right
