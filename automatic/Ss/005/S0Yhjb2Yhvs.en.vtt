00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.600
 I will show you in this video 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:07.940
 how to disable the bios or 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:18.640
 reset the bios of a toshiba 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:22.730
 model satellite number to 110 149 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:34.370
 original windows xp install it to the 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:36.969
 first step we take away the homeland on 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.969
 take a screwdriver 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.230
 davis is yes cache memory churn 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:21.470
 at 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:25.500
 we remove the memory module we take 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:32.540
 a very simple copper wire to make 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.540
 a crash in my two sides 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.270
 so here normally under the bar 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.710
 memory there is a plastic cover 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.220
 so I tried to make a good 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:59.479
 picture 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:02:02.300
 the cache a plastic is normally the 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:07.380
 reset 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:14.209
 he is here it is this little part there 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:19.830
 and it's to show better the jumper 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:23.600
 this is a very small party here 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.600
 brands and if I zoom in on its brands and 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.959
 its marks and 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:39.200
 these three there j open 1 bourgi for young people 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:44.180
 fear so that's the goal of the game we have 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:49.640
 plugged in the power supply he finds 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:58.340
 the branch feeding location 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:03:02.600
 food and we take his count on 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.900
 go the branches and do well contact 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.900

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.050
 so contact here 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:26.390
 on the power of the bar 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.360
 memory and contacts here during a 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.380
 fifteen seconds 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.400
 so here I am usually it's not 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.320
 obvious to do because I 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:39.760
 phone in hand so the fact of 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.760
 touch by touch 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:49.930
 the power supply of the memory module and 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:53.650
 the jumper it's going to disable injured 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.780
 consequence it will disable true it's going 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.000
 turn off the the brush in love 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:02.670
