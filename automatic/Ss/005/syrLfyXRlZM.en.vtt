00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.539 
it like a pinch of pepper no more than
that<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:06.319> we'll<00:02:07.319> work<00:02:07.500> outside<00:02:07.920> because

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
that and we'll work outside because

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.850 
that and we'll work outside because

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
although it's not toxic the powder is

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.220 
although it's not toxic the powder is
very<00:02:11.099> fine<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.390> we<00:02:12.540> don't<00:02:12.750> really<00:02:12.989> want<00:02:13.170> to

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
very fine and we don't really want to

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.490 
very fine and we don't really want to
breathe<00:02:13.440> it<00:02:13.620> in<00:02:13.739> I<00:02:14.269> have<00:02:15.269> a<00:02:15.299> cup<00:02:15.569> here<00:02:15.870> with

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
breathe it in I have a cup here with

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.979 
breathe it in I have a cup here with
just<00:02:16.739> a<00:02:16.860> few<00:02:17.220> drops<00:02:17.400> of<00:02:17.700> water<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:18.299> really<00:02:18.720> tiny

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
amount and I'm gonna add the inoculant

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.680 
amount and I'm gonna add the inoculant
to<00:02:23.099> the<00:02:23.190> water<00:02:23.989> give<00:02:24.989> it<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.200> little<00:02:25.349> swirl<00:02:26.690> now

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
to the water give it a little swirl now

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.580 
to the water give it a little swirl now
I'll<00:02:27.870> add<00:02:28.049> my<00:02:28.230> piece<00:02:29.989> make<00:02:30.989> sure<00:02:31.140> you<00:02:31.290> count

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
I'll add my piece make sure you count

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.590 
I'll add my piece make sure you count
your<00:02:31.769> peas<00:02:32.040> out<00:02:32.250> before<00:02:32.819> you<00:02:32.940> do<00:02:33.120> this<00:02:33.269> because

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
your peas out before you do this because

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.780 
your peas out before you do this because
otherwise<00:02:34.079> they'll<00:02:34.889> end<00:02:35.069> up<00:02:35.220> with<00:02:35.459> a<00:02:35.549> whole

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
otherwise they'll end up with a whole

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.470 
otherwise they'll end up with a whole
lot<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.030> wet<00:02:36.420> Peas<00:02:36.720> that<00:02:37.049> you<00:02:37.139> can't<00:02:37.380> plant<00:02:38.480> I'm

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
swirl and now we have our piece coated

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.920 
swirl and now we have our piece coated
in<00:02:47.459> just<00:02:47.639> a<00:02:47.790> little<00:02:47.819> bit<00:02:48.269> of<00:02:48.569> this<00:02:48.720> inoculant

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
in just a little bit of this inoculant

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.979 
in just a little bit of this inoculant
here<00:02:51.930> I<00:02:51.989> have<00:02:52.230> a<00:02:52.260> bed<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:53.010> I've<00:02:53.130> prepared<00:02:53.989> it

thing you can see here is that I've
already<00:03:12.090> built<00:03:12.299> a<00:03:12.510> trellis<00:03:12.989> I've<00:03:13.739> used<00:03:14.010> this

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
already built a trellis I've used this

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.250 
already built a trellis I've used this
dumbu<00:03:14.609> to<00:03:15.209> create<00:03:15.480> something<00:03:15.720> for

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
dumbu to create something for

creative<00:03:29.069> with<00:03:29.549> building<00:03:29.909> a<00:03:29.970> trellis<00:03:30.180> for

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
creative with building a trellis for

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.890 
creative with building a trellis for
your<00:03:30.629> piece<00:03:31.069> I've<00:03:32.069> used<00:03:32.370> bamboo<00:03:32.700> here<00:03:33.090> but<00:03:33.659> you

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
your piece I've used bamboo here but you

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.710 
your piece I've used bamboo here but you
could<00:03:34.079> use<00:03:34.260> chicken<00:03:34.290> wire<00:03:34.819> sticks<00:03:35.819> string

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
could use chicken wire sticks string

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.839 
could use chicken wire sticks string
really<00:03:37.470> anything<00:03:37.950> that<00:03:38.129> you<00:03:38.280> have<00:03:38.549> lying

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
really anything that you have lying

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.610 
really anything that you have lying
around<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.269> house<00:03:39.510> would<00:03:40.319> be<00:03:40.440> great<00:03:40.769> to<00:03:40.950> use

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
around the house would be great to use

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.670 
around the house would be great to use
so<00:03:43.620> once<00:03:43.829> we're<00:03:44.010> ready<00:03:44.220> to<00:03:44.430> plant<00:03:45.060> our<00:03:45.269> piece

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
so once we're ready to plant our piece

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.099 
so once we're ready to plant our piece
will<00:03:46.680> poke<00:03:47.010> some<00:03:47.250> holes<00:03:47.280> into<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.849> soil<00:03:48.180> in

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
will poke some holes into the soil in

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.050 
will poke some holes into the soil in
the<00:03:49.170> springtime<00:03:49.680> I'm<00:03:50.459> going<00:03:50.700> to<00:03:50.760> plant<00:03:51.000> my

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
the springtime I'm going to plant my

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.140 
the springtime I'm going to plant my
peas<00:03:51.480> about<00:03:52.230> 1<00:03:52.560> inch<00:03:52.829> deep<00:03:53.129> and<00:03:53.549> two<00:03:53.849> inches

peas about 1 inch deep and two inches
apart<00:03:54.950> in<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.159> summer<00:03:56.430> time<00:03:56.760> for<00:03:57.150> a<00:03:57.180> fall

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
apart in the summer time for a fall

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.129 
apart in the summer time for a fall
harvest<00:03:57.810> I'll<00:03:58.650> plant<00:03:59.010> marquees<00:03:59.459> a<00:03:59.489> lot<00:03:59.790> deeper

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:00.139 
harvest I'll plant marquees a lot deeper

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:03.110 
harvest I'll plant marquees a lot deeper
about<00:04:01.139> two<00:04:01.470> inches<00:04:01.799> deep<00:04:02.099> and<00:04:02.519> two<00:04:02.819> inches

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:05.909 
apart and the reason for that is that

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:09.800 
apart and the reason for that is that
being<00:04:06.840> a<00:04:06.959> cool<00:04:07.230> weather<00:04:07.409> crop<00:04:08.329> peas<00:04:09.329> like<00:04:09.599> to

germinate in a cooler soil and in the
summer<00:04:13.049> time<00:04:13.139> I'll<00:04:13.829> want<00:04:14.099> to<00:04:14.159> get<00:04:14.280> down<00:04:14.549> to

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
summer time I'll want to get down to

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.949 
summer time I'll want to get down to
where<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.180> soil<00:04:15.480> is<00:04:15.720> just<00:04:15.780> a<00:04:16.109> little<00:04:16.410> bit<00:04:17.959> so

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
where the soil is just a little bit so

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.449 
where the soil is just a little bit so
I'll<00:04:19.079> go<00:04:19.229> ahead<00:04:19.260> and<00:04:19.769> just<00:04:19.949> poke<00:04:20.160> some<00:04:20.430> holes

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
I'll go ahead and just poke some holes

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:35.310 
I'll go ahead and just poke some holes
with<00:04:21.030> my<00:04:21.150> finger<00:04:21.539> here

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.220 

so<00:04:36.320> we'll<00:04:36.470> give<00:04:36.650> these<00:04:36.830> a<00:04:36.860> little<00:04:37.190> pat<00:04:37.430> on

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
so we'll give these a little pat on

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.650 
so we'll give these a little pat on
water<00:04:39.230> them<00:04:39.500> in<00:04:39.710> a<00:04:39.889> minute<00:04:40.190> and<00:04:40.729> then<00:04:41.479> we'll

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
water them in a minute and then we'll

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.810 
water them in a minute and then we'll
sit<00:04:41.900> back<00:04:42.110> and<00:04:42.380> wait<00:04:42.770> for<00:04:42.830> our<00:04:43.130> piece<00:04:43.370> to<00:04:43.610> grow

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
sit back and wait for our piece to grow

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.550 
sit back and wait for our piece to grow
I<00:04:44.650> can't<00:04:45.650> wait<00:04:45.979> to<00:04:46.160> eat<00:04:46.220> them
