00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.050
 we need what it is 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.049
 one centimeter is one hundredth of a meter 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.820
 one millimeter is one thousandth of a meter 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.539
 one nanometer 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.880
 here is another billionth of a meter 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.320
 This is a ratio of values ​​that can 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.179
 compare only by 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.699
 sizes of a small soccer ball and 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.699
 giant globe 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.620
 nanotechnology describes the scene of such 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.540
 ultra thin materials what 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.760
 they can be considered only one and a half tons 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.200
 microscope 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.410
 one of the favorite use in nature 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.930
 connected with this effect are plants 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.850
 lotus 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.400
 nothing on its surface 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.400
 grateful dirt is kept 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.720
 how do i use this amazing 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.340
 Effect 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.630
 in everyday life 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.100
 here are some application examples 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.100
 nanotechnology 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.640
 one of the most popular areas 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.440
 vehicle applications 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.590
 steel coating glass 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.480
 cars and improved visibility 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.080
 any driver is familiar with the problems 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.770
 limited visibility during 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.530
 rain and in the dark or when 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.820
 the wiper has not been used for a long time 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.050
 and apparently waiting to disappear because 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.130
 it starts to drizzle 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.420
 and then the washer tank is not 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.090
 seem too full 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.870
 a clear wiper 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:38.960
 too fast 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.840
 in this period of time issued blindly 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.700
 force one meter and extremely 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.070
 dangerously 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.730
 according to a study in 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.360
 nanotechnology 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.360
 these problems are a thing of the past 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.090
 use of application technique 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.030
 coverage is extremely simple and clear even 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.300
 to non-specialists 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.560
 runes of fictitiousness 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.180
 it is significantly different from 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.290
 normal coating on the surface layer 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.610
 paint and trash 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.890
 First, the surface should be processed to 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.890
 gloss special cleaners 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.769
 then applying the mixture 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.109
 components which, thanks to their 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:22.719
 ultra small size do so 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:24.840
 called intelligent chemical 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.929
 the connection to the surface has subsided 

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:28.489
 at this time, the individual components 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.539
 arranged exactly 

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:34.539
 solid layer on the glass surface 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:39.539
 These compounds are very durable and 

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:41.739
 lasting about one year 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.959
 or up to 23 thousand kilometers 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.900
 but hold any load 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.440
 unlike the client's wishes 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.359
 updated 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.049
 henceforth on such processing 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.109
 surfaces are no longer held from now on 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:56.109
 burning eyes 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.809
 surface tension prizes 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:00.939
 water drops are combined and in the form 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:03.729
 balls roll down the glass making 

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:04.939
 by this 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:08.319
 network of dirt particles 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.489
 this effect can even be displayed with 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:11.529
 using measuring 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:13.839
 instrumentation as well as certified 

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:16.049
 technical control systems 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.399
 nanocoatings 

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:19.629
 set diplomas are offered 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:22.629
 for all surfaces it means not 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:24.309
 only free review of torrential rain 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:27.489
 thanks to nanocoating glass 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.859
 and therefore the frequency of plumbing 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.519
 thanks to nanocoating for 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:32.969
 glass ceramics 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:34.889
 victory on the screen thanks to us about 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.609
 fabric cover 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.209
 processed wooden and 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.369
 ceramic products thanks to the new 

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:42.919
 cover for wood and stones 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:45.449
 constantly sparkling paint thanks 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:47.349
 galaxy nanocoatings 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.069
 and many other protected 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:50.119
 surface 

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:53.119
 thanks to the effect itself we clean the place 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.329
 more water repellent 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.919
 people walls cover the dirt easily 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:01.249
 removed without use 

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:03.599
 chemicals with long lasting 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.340
 pollution protection 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.129
 weather and oil containing waste 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:10.189
 on technology provide 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:12.679
 dazzling color retention 

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:14.429
 breathability 

00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:16.089
 as well as scratch resistance 

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.559
 practical 

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:20.019
 all surfaces and materials 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.490
 so by the sun it becomes products 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.050
 absolutely eco-friendly and require 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.580
 only minimal cost
