 can 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:22.650

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.349

 get to know Dortmund 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.100
 as she has to focus recently lock is even gross 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.370
 the receipt is of course much faster 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.480
 human 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.730
 I have to be really normal with you then something does not represent 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.730
 if that's class 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.470

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.490
 Würzburg ots Search Groups Focus 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.579

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.490
 Percent of other videos is not necessarily new now the match gone ' 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.170
 Magic trackpad matching motif so 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.450
 around 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.890
 as I said I probably wanted because of position Iran Mac OS x Lion what 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.330
 soon to come out so that Murdoch the ball 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.140

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.930
 then just the different control what's up after him and so the 2 2 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.580

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.020
 around 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.840

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.200
 say 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.649

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:10.859
 Google new 

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:13.769
