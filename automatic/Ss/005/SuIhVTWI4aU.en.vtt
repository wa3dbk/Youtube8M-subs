Garcon but basically from checking out
the<00:03:36.940> auction<00:03:37.270> block<00:03:37.390> and<00:03:37.660> whatnot<00:03:38.050> it<00:03:38.260> looks

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
the auction block and whatnot it looks

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.040 
the auction block and whatnot it looks
like<00:03:38.800> the<00:03:38.920> market<00:03:39.340> is<00:03:39.490> crashing<00:03:40.180> a<00:03:40.330> good<00:03:40.720> bit

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
like the market is crashing a good bit

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.170 
like the market is crashing a good bit
it's<00:03:41.530> your<00:03:41.650> best<00:03:42.010> off<00:03:42.310> holding<00:03:42.850> on<00:03:43.000> to<00:03:43.120> stuff

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
it's your best off holding on to stuff

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.880 
it's your best off holding on to stuff
if<00:03:43.630> you<00:03:43.780> want<00:03:44.080> to<00:03:44.170> sell<00:03:44.380> things<00:03:44.590> right<00:03:44.860> now

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
if you want to sell things right now

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.750 
if you want to sell things right now
it's<00:03:45.220> probably<00:03:45.910> not<00:03:46.270> the<00:03:46.540> best<00:03:46.570> time<00:03:47.760> just

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
it's probably not the best time just

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.550 
it's probably not the best time just
with<00:03:48.910> the<00:03:49.060> influx<00:03:49.570> of<00:03:49.780> all<00:03:49.930> these<00:03:50.080> team<00:03:50.380> of<00:03:50.500> the

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
with the influx of all these team of the

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.620 
with the influx of all these team of the
air<00:03:50.680> flares<00:03:51.010> and<00:03:51.520> collectibles<00:03:52.180> and<00:03:52.420> stuff

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
air flares and collectibles and stuff

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.660 
air flares and collectibles and stuff
right<00:03:52.870> now<00:03:52.930> it<00:03:53.650> means<00:03:53.860> they<00:03:54.070> are<00:03:54.250> a<00:03:54.280> lot

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
right now it means they are a lot

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.760 
right now it means they are a lot
cheaper<00:03:54.730> and<00:03:55.570> therefore<00:03:56.170> the<00:03:56.350> market<00:03:56.650> is

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
cheaper and therefore the market is

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.770 
cheaper and therefore the market is
crashing<00:03:57.430> some<00:03:57.700> of<00:03:57.820> those<00:03:57.910> goals<00:03:58.270> are<00:03:58.510> rising

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
crashing some of those goals are rising

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.590 
crashing some of those goals are rising
in<00:03:59.140> value<00:03:59.170> because<00:04:00.040> the<00:04:00.550> collectibles<00:04:01.120> are<00:04:01.330> so

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
in value because the collectibles are so

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.720 
in value because the collectibles are so
easy<00:04:01.900> to<00:04:02.050> get<00:04:02.470> and<00:04:02.770> basically<00:04:03.190> I<00:04:03.340> guess<00:04:03.430> we're

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
easy to get and basically I guess we're

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.820 
easy to get and basically I guess we're
going<00:04:03.880> to<00:04:03.940> see<00:04:04.150> how<00:04:04.810> it<00:04:04.960> shapes<00:04:05.350> up<00:04:05.560> pretty

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
going to see how it shapes up pretty

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.360 
going to see how it shapes up pretty
soon<00:04:06.660> for<00:04:07.660> sure<00:04:07.690> though<00:04:08.320> I<00:04:08.350> have<00:04:08.800> to<00:04:08.980> say<00:04:09.010> if
