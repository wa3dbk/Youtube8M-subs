$1,000 I always recommend to pay see
because<00:00:45.200> you<00:00:45.260> can<00:00:45.289> get<00:00:45.500> a<00:00:45.559> good<00:00:45.739> quality

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
because you can get a good quality

painting for under $1,000 once you're

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.299 
painting for under $1,000 once you're
great<00:00:50.050> let's<00:00:51.050> start<00:00:51.320> to<00:00:51.500> come<00:00:51.649> into<00:00:51.800> play<00:00:51.890> but

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
great let's start to come into play but

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:53.950 
great let's start to come into play but
I<00:00:52.430> would<00:00:52.579> still<00:00:52.820> recommend<00:00:53.000> your<00:00:53.420> PC<00:00:53.750> because

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
I would still recommend your PC because

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.500 
I would still recommend your PC because
when<00:00:54.260> you<00:00:54.379> compare<00:00:54.620> say<00:00:55.489> the<00:00:55.640> same<00:00:55.910> type<00:00:56.480> of

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
when you compare say the same type of

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.209 
when you compare say the same type of
that<00:00:56.750> to<00:00:56.899> the<00:00:56.989> same<00:00:57.199> time<00:00:57.410> pieces<00:00:57.859> that<00:00:58.039> have

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
that to the same time pieces that have

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.250 
that to the same time pieces that have
the<00:00:58.340> same<00:00:58.520> specs<00:00:58.969> so<00:00:59.359> they<00:00:59.510> say<00:00:59.690> is<00:00:59.840> still<00:01:00.050> buy

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
the same specs so they say is still buy

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.900 
the same specs so they say is still buy
cheaper<00:01:00.739> so<00:01:00.980> I<00:01:01.039> would<00:01:01.129> always<00:01:01.370> recommend<00:01:01.579> to

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
cheaper so I would always recommend to

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.600 
cheaper so I would always recommend to
the<00:01:02.059> PC<00:01:02.480> for<00:01:03.440> example<00:01:03.769> if<00:01:03.829> you<00:01:03.920> compare<00:01:04.070> these

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
the PC for example if you compare these

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.450 
the PC for example if you compare these
two<00:01:04.670> competitors<00:01:05.590> got<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:06.860> Apple<00:01:07.250> MacBook

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
two competitors got the Apple MacBook

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.309 
two competitors got the Apple MacBook
Pro<00:01:08.030> and<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.929> HP<00:01:09.380> Pavilion<00:01:09.950> GM<00:01:10.490> 4<00:01:10.940> you<00:01:11.869> can<00:01:12.020> see

00:01:12.309 --> 00:01:12.319 
Pro and the HP Pavilion GM 4 you can see

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:14.050 
Pro and the HP Pavilion GM 4 you can see
that<00:01:12.679> they<00:01:12.890> pretty<00:01:13.130> much<00:01:13.280> have<00:01:13.759> the<00:01:13.789> same

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
that they pretty much have the same

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.180 
that they pretty much have the same
specs<00:01:14.780> so<00:01:16.750> we've<00:01:17.750> got<00:01:17.899> the<00:01:17.990> same<00:01:18.229> processor

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
specs so we've got the same processor

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.620 
specs so we've got the same processor
same<00:01:19.819> graphics<00:01:20.330> card<00:01:20.660> same<00:01:21.170> amount<00:01:21.440> of<00:01:21.500> RAM

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
same graphics card same amount of RAM

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.589 
same graphics card same amount of RAM
the<00:01:23.630> PC<00:01:24.380> actually<00:01:24.709> has<00:01:24.920> more<00:01:25.340> gigs<00:01:26.300> in<00:01:26.569> the

00:01:26.589 --> 00:01:26.599 
the PC actually has more gigs in the

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:29.469 
the PC actually has more gigs in the
hard<00:01:26.990> drive<00:01:27.459> the<00:01:28.459> PC<00:01:28.789> screens<00:01:29.090> a<00:01:29.209> little<00:01:29.390> bit

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
hard drive the PC screens a little bit

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.040 
hard drive the PC screens a little bit
bigger<00:01:30.640> yes<00:01:31.640> there's<00:01:31.940> a<00:01:32.000> few<00:01:32.270> differences<00:01:32.720> but

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
bigger yes there's a few differences but

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.320 
bigger yes there's a few differences but
basically<00:01:33.530> the<00:01:33.739> same<00:01:33.979> and<00:01:34.369> then<00:01:34.640> look<00:01:35.149> at<00:01:35.209> the

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
basically the same and then look at the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.219 
basically the same and then look at the
price<00:01:35.630> and<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:37.099> pace<00:01:37.280> a<00:01:37.550> is<00:01:37.940> obviously<00:01:38.630> much

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
price and the pace a is obviously much

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.589 
price and the pace a is obviously much
cheaper<00:01:39.860> so<00:01:40.369> that's<00:01:40.550> just<00:01:40.729> one<00:01:40.970> example<00:01:41.000> of

00:01:41.589 --> 00:01:41.599 
cheaper so that's just one example of

00:01:41.599 --> 00:01:50.310 
cheaper so that's just one example of
how<00:01:41.920> pay<00:01:42.920> stays<00:01:43.190> a<00:01:43.819> much<00:01:44.270> cheaper<00:01:44.300> and<00:01:45.170> Macs

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.260 

yes<00:01:51.320> there<00:01:51.560> is<00:01:51.710> there's<00:01:51.920> a<00:01:52.070> reason<00:01:52.220> them<00:01:52.520> max

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
yes there is there's a reason them max

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.789 
yes there is there's a reason them max
cost<00:01:53.570> more<00:01:53.869> and<00:01:53.930> it's<00:01:54.170> all<00:01:54.320> got<00:01:54.470> to<00:01:54.530> do<00:01:54.710> with

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
cost more and it's all got to do with

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.130 
cost more and it's all got to do with
the<00:01:54.920> better<00:01:55.100> quality<00:01:55.310> hardware

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
the better quality hardware

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.170 
the better quality hardware
Mac's<00:01:57.619> are<00:01:57.770> made<00:01:57.950> from<00:01:58.220> top<00:01:58.820> quality

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
Mac's are made from top quality

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.910 
Mac's are made from top quality
aluminium<00:01:59.360> and<00:01:59.900> glass<00:01:59.960> which<00:02:00.440> means<00:02:00.710> they're

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
aluminium and glass which means they're

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.969 
aluminium and glass which means they're
a<00:02:00.950> better<00:02:01.130> computer<00:02:01.430> from<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.759> inside<00:02:02.240> out

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
a better computer from the inside out

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.109 
a better computer from the inside out
they're<00:02:03.979> also<00:02:04.130> made<00:02:04.460> from<00:02:04.640> recycled

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
they're also made from recycled

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.700 
they're also made from recycled
materials<00:02:05.659> meaning<00:02:05.869> that<00:02:06.049> they'll<00:02:06.229> cost<00:02:06.409> more

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
materials meaning that they'll cost more

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.570 
materials meaning that they'll cost more
but<00:02:06.890> it's<00:02:07.039> actually<00:02:07.369> a<00:02:07.929> investment<00:02:08.929> in<00:02:09.140> our

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
but it's actually a investment in our

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.680 
but it's actually a investment in our
environment<00:02:10.580> so<00:02:10.759> it<00:02:10.850> costs<00:02:11.090> more<00:02:11.150> but<00:02:11.390> it's<00:02:11.510> a

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
environment so it costs more but it's a

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.650 
environment so it costs more but it's a
lot<00:02:11.870> better<00:02:12.050> for<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.260> environment<00:02:13.569> paints<00:02:14.569> a

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
lot better for the environment paints a

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.290 
lot better for the environment paints a
is<00:02:14.720> a<00:02:14.780> chafer<00:02:15.200> because<00:02:15.470> they<00:02:15.709> use<00:02:16.300> cheaper

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
is a chafer because they use cheaper

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.850 
is a chafer because they use cheaper
parts<00:02:17.480> which<00:02:17.840> means<00:02:18.080> they're<00:02:18.290> not<00:02:18.319> as<00:02:18.620> good

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
parts which means they're not as good

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.199 
parts which means they're not as good
quality<00:02:19.610> weight

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
quality weight

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.360 
quality weight
so<00:02:22.569> really<00:02:22.810> expensive<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.470> upgrade<00:02:23.500> cards<00:02:23.980> and

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
so really expensive to upgrade cards and

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.679 
so really expensive to upgrade cards and
actually<00:02:24.670> works<00:02:24.970> out<00:02:25.090> cheaper<00:02:25.150> just<00:02:25.599> to

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:25.689 
actually works out cheaper just to

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.000 
actually works out cheaper just to
replace<00:02:25.959> the<00:02:26.019> whole<00:02:26.290> machine<00:02:26.620> which<00:02:26.890> is

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
replace the whole machine which is

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.970 
replace the whole machine which is
pretty<00:02:27.220> expensive<00:02:27.610> already<00:02:28.650> pay<00:02:29.650> stick<00:02:29.890> the

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
pretty expensive already pay stick the

that<00:03:02.709> there<00:03:03.040> will<00:03:03.280> be<00:03:03.310> any<00:03:03.760> crazy<00:03:04.599> viruses

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170

from<00:03:06.010> this<00:03:06.159> year<00:03:06.340> almost<00:03:06.579> a<00:03:06.790> from<00:03:07.000> 2012

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
from this year almost a from 2012

from this year almost a from 2012
actually<00:03:08.079> one<00:03:08.620> reason<00:03:09.099> why<00:03:09.310> max<00:03:09.549> don't<00:03:09.849> get

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
actually one reason why max don't get

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.809 
actually one reason why max don't get
many<00:03:10.329> viruses<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:11.200> one<00:03:12.040> of<00:03:12.129> them<00:03:12.220> is<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.519> doing

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
many viruses and one of them is to doing

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.880 
many viruses and one of them is to doing
the<00:03:13.000> inbuilt<00:03:13.409> virus<00:03:14.409> protection<00:03:14.620> software

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
the inbuilt virus protection software

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.309 
the inbuilt virus protection software
that<00:03:15.370> max<00:03:15.579> come<00:03:15.849> with<00:03:16.030> another<00:03:16.780> reason<00:03:17.200> is

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
that max come with another reason is

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.339 
that max come with another reason is
Happy's<00:03:18.280> tend<00:03:18.760> to<00:03:18.879> use<00:03:19.120> and<00:03:19.510> therefore<00:03:19.690> happy

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
Happy's tend to use and therefore happy

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.020 
Happy's tend to use and therefore happy
things<00:03:21.209> well<00:03:22.209> really<00:03:22.690> the<00:03:22.870> only<00:03:23.139> reason<00:03:24.030> is

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
things well really the only reason is

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.379 
things well really the only reason is
because<00:03:25.870> only<00:03:26.650> 14%<00:03:27.220> of<00:03:27.760> show<00:03:27.940> they<00:03:28.000> actually

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
because only 14% of show they actually

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.780 
because only 14% of show they actually
use<00:03:28.599> that<00:03:29.349> means<00:03:29.500> for<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.739> rest<00:03:29.769> of<00:03:30.040> PC<00:03:30.400> users

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
use that means for the rest of PC users

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.490 
use that means for the rest of PC users
so<00:03:31.359> it's<00:03:31.659> bound<00:03:31.870> to<00:03:31.959> be<00:03:32.609> seized<00:03:34.170> up<00:03:35.170> right

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
so it's bound to be seized up right

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.020 
so it's bound to be seized up right
that's<00:03:35.680> an<00:03:35.799> operating<00:03:36.250> system

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.490 

yes<00:03:40.030> because<00:03:40.329> Apple<00:03:40.959> makes<00:03:41.139> both<00:03:41.379> the

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
yes because Apple makes both the

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.080 
yes because Apple makes both the
operating<00:03:41.829> system<00:03:42.220> and<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.400> drivers<00:03:42.849> it

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
operating system and the drivers it

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.970 
operating system and the drivers it
makes<00:03:43.239> them<00:03:43.449> much<00:03:43.629> more<00:03:43.660> stable<00:03:44.139> and<00:03:44.530> cleaner

makes them much more stable and cleaner

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.409 
makes them much more stable and cleaner
since<00:03:45.280> this<00:03:45.430> means<00:03:45.699> that<00:03:45.790> max<00:03:46.000> breed<00:03:46.299> are

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419 
since this means that max breed are

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:48.390 
since this means that max breed are
faster<00:03:46.930> and<00:03:47.139> they're<00:03:47.500> a<00:03:47.530> lot<00:03:47.709> less<00:03:47.859> likely<00:03:47.919> to

negative with some both Mac and PC I

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.150 
negative with some both Mac and PC I
can't<00:05:26.290> really<00:05:26.380> seem<00:05:26.650> clear

can't really seem clear
and<00:05:27.250> I<00:05:27.310> think<00:05:27.370> that<00:05:27.640> in<00:05:27.760> the<00:05:27.850> end<00:05:27.880> to<00:05:28.210> withstand

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.390 
and I think that in the end to withstand

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.350 
and I think that in the end to withstand
the<00:05:28.630> personal<00:05:28.990> preference
