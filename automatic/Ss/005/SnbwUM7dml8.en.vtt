00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.240 
journalists or anything like that which
I<00:01:33.630> guess<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.990> isn't<00:01:34.170> really<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.560> typical<00:01:34.950> job

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
I guess that isn't really a typical job

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.210 
I guess that isn't really a typical job
but<00:01:35.930> that's<00:01:36.930> something<00:01:37.259> I'd<00:01:37.560> like<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.799> do<00:01:38.040> that

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
but that's something I'd like to do that

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.469 
but that's something I'd like to do that
they<00:01:38.369> didn't<00:01:38.579> have<00:01:38.700> listed<00:01:39.090> on<00:01:39.180> there<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.420> think

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
they didn't have listed on there I think

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.960 
they didn't have listed on there I think
like<00:01:40.229> one<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.590> only<00:01:40.650> few<00:01:41.340> things<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.700> liked

another<00:03:08.580> counter<00:03:09.000> where<00:03:09.600> if<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:09.930> were<00:03:10.050> using

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
another counter where if you were using

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.250 
another counter where if you were using
the<00:03:10.350> advanced<00:03:10.650> UAV<00:03:10.830> you<00:03:11.430> get<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.880> UAV<00:03:12.570> a<00:03:12.840> counter

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
the advanced UAV you get a UAV a counter

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.690 
the advanced UAV you get a UAV a counter
and<00:03:13.410> then<00:03:13.530> at<00:03:13.650> 12<00:03:13.920> you<00:03:14.070> get<00:03:14.220> advance<00:03:14.490> and

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
and then at 12 you get advance and

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.280 
and then at 12 you get advance and
that's<00:03:14.820> it<00:03:14.970> now<00:03:15.120> would<00:03:15.180> rather<00:03:15.390> have<00:03:15.630> two<00:03:15.840> UAVs

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
that's it now would rather have two UAVs

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.260 
that's it now would rather have two UAVs
and<00:03:16.320> two<00:03:16.560> counters<00:03:16.980> rather<00:03:17.580> than<00:03:17.790> that<00:03:17.970> stupid

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
and two counters rather than that stupid

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.910 
and two counters rather than that stupid
advanced<00:03:18.870> UAV<00:03:18.990> because<00:03:19.440> that<00:03:19.590> thing<00:03:19.620> is

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
advanced UAV because that thing is

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.030 
advanced UAV because that thing is
pretty<00:03:20.370> useless<00:03:20.820> I<00:03:21.180> know<00:03:21.960> like<00:03:22.440> they<00:03:22.770> wanted

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
pretty useless I know like they wanted

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.440 
pretty useless I know like they wanted
nerf<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.460> I<00:03:23.490> understand<00:03:23.940> from<00:03:24.000> black<00:03:24.270> ops

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
nerf and I understand from black ops

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.390 
nerf and I understand from black ops
maybe<00:03:24.660> it<00:03:24.780> was<00:03:24.870> a<00:03:24.900> little<00:03:24.990> powerful<00:03:25.740> but

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
maybe it was a little powerful but

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.250 
maybe it was a little powerful but
assassin<00:03:27.090> being<00:03:27.570> hidden<00:03:27.750> from<00:03:27.870> it<00:03:28.170> and

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
assassin being hidden from it and

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.980 
assassin being hidden from it and
doesn't<00:03:28.620> show<00:03:28.890> movement<00:03:29.220> and<00:03:29.780> it<00:03:30.780> could<00:03:30.960> be

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
doesn't show movement and it could be

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.750 
doesn't show movement and it could be
shot<00:03:31.290> down<00:03:31.590> pretty<00:03:31.980> easily<00:03:32.190> i<00:03:32.400> think<00:03:32.460> it<00:03:32.670> takes

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
shot down pretty easily i think it takes

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.250 
shot down pretty easily i think it takes
like<00:03:32.910> one<00:03:33.180> stinger<00:03:33.600> missile<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:33.990> take<00:03:34.020> that

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
like one stinger missile to take that

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.020 
like one stinger missile to take that
thing<00:03:34.440> out<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:34.680> it's<00:03:34.800> huge<00:03:35.190> in<00:03:35.460> the<00:03:35.580> sky<00:03:35.820> I've

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
thing out and it's huge in the sky I've

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.670 
thing out and it's huge in the sky I've
taken<00:03:36.240> a<00:03:36.390> few<00:03:36.510> of<00:03:36.600> those<00:03:36.660> things<00:03:36.840> out<00:03:37.020> myself<00:03:37.230> I

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
taken a few of those things out myself I

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.670 
taken a few of those things out myself I
don't<00:03:38.580> think<00:03:39.300> that<00:03:39.390> van<00:03:39.930> two<00:03:40.050> babies<00:03:40.320> are<00:03:40.470> that

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
don't think that van two babies are that

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.410 
don't think that van two babies are that
helpful<00:03:40.950> i'd<00:03:41.100> rather<00:03:41.280> have<00:03:41.400> two<00:03:41.700> UAVs<00:03:42.150> and<00:03:42.180> two

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
helpful i'd rather have two UAVs and two

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.810 
helpful i'd rather have two UAVs and two
counters<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.470> also<00:03:43.950> if<00:03:44.250> you<00:03:44.490> were<00:03:44.580> running

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
counters and also if you were running

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.630 
counters and also if you were running
like<00:03:45.180> Sam<00:03:45.540> this<00:03:46.020> is<00:03:46.140> better<00:03:46.320> than<00:03:46.410> running<00:03:46.709> UAV

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
like Sam this is better than running UAV

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.820 
like Sam this is better than running UAV
counter<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:48.209> Sam<00:03:48.480> because<00:03:48.810> for<00:03:49.200> UAV<00:03:49.620> 5

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
counter and Sam because for UAV 5

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.910 
counter and Sam because for UAV 5

completely<00:03:54.570> confused<00:03:55.140> you<00:03:55.320> but<00:03:56.100> the<00:03:56.490> point

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
completely confused you but the point

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.090 
completely confused you but the point
I'm<00:03:56.790> trying<00:03:56.820> to<00:03:57.060> get<00:03:57.120> across<00:03:57.240> is<00:03:58.100> running

I'm trying to get across is running

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.580 
I'm trying to get across is running
these<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.820> kill<00:04:00.090> streaks<00:04:00.360> and<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.750> in<00:04:00.959> the

these to kill streaks and the in the
support<00:04:01.980> package<00:04:02.370> is<00:04:02.580> way<00:04:03.180> more<00:04:03.360> helpful<00:04:03.810> than

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
support package is way more helpful than

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.870 
support package is way more helpful than
running<00:04:04.200> three<00:04:04.740> actual<00:04:05.100> in<00:04:05.430> my<00:04:05.640> opinion

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
running three actual in my opinion

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
counter of course can be switched out

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.650 
counter of course can be switched out
for<00:04:34.320> ballistic<00:04:35.160> vests<00:04:35.490> or<00:04:35.580> explosive<00:04:36.300> decoy

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
for ballistic vests or explosive decoy

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.120 
for ballistic vests or explosive decoy
but<00:04:36.930> it's<00:04:37.050> silly<00:04:37.290> how<00:04:37.410> many<00:04:37.500> people<00:04:37.860> fall<00:04:38.100> for

explosive decoys I really didn't think

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.870 
explosive decoys I really didn't think
those<00:04:40.139> things<00:04:40.380> would<00:04:40.500> work<00:04:40.650> at<00:04:40.830> all<00:04:40.949> anyway

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880
