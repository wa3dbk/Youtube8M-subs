00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.389
 hello very good we are all ladies and what 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.699
 happens what happens here we finally have the 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.039
 fifa ultimate team fifa interface 14 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:19.650
 we have a lot of desire and first of all 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.570
 before teaching the series how good is 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.700
 they applied the following in next 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.410
 video we are going to teach our 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.539
 templates we have until the 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.890
 moment that they are not too many 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.330
 nor to stain the coins that 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.550
 we have but good and here you have the 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.980
 fut interface there a bit like 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.140
 to windows 8 there for panels there and now 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.269
 let's start with the templates the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.640
 first template is a Brazilian chip 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:43.140
 he taught us to high enough game you 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.579
 is truly giving out the truth that yes 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.960
 good results especially those of 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.329
 light rich money is at stake much 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.710
 darling roberto signed and welliton the 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.389
 truth is that it is the most expensive of the team 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.600
 welliton they have been lowered enough 

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:56.639
 is 76 has 66 on average but 86 of 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.260
 rhythm seven hundred coins for him what 

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:59.639
 others the truth that quite cheap 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.920
 none passes four hundred coins 

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:03.600
 so a team to start that is 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.250
 highly recommended for anyone who 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.890
 like the Brazilian and tell you that 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.600
 moment feedback 14 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.909
 is not using more than 13 the truth 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.530
 but what we do not like is that a lot 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.909
 people are talking and playing centers 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.560
 disgusting games plate us back 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.240
 going out to the counter and downtown and to 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.190
 in and here we have the second 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.290
 template as you can not do in your 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.450
 account is not done as always a team 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.350
 win is a team win is indeed me 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.759
 like good I wanted to start the fifa 14 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.740
 a gold template brings silver and bronze 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.330
 that is to say a little mixture of the two 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.890
 but good to my intention is that I play 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.170
 Silver tournaments especially highlight or 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.090
 here in the middle super rhythm here that 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.070
 I bought a letter this handle for 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.229
 necessary for the envelope that they make you 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.149
 for the gifts of manager and such and 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.009
 stand out here and the far left 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.810
 that h in bonn I think it's called that is 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.280
 well there was here five hundred coins 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.810
 which is a real tank to give those 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.130
 so disgusting centers that we do not like 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.630
 and above all, as we said in other 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.280
 videos if you are not watching what 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.170
 we are doing a little bit like that 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.820
 buy that expensive equipment do not spend 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.280
 all your money in purchase two 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.899
 equipazos and go little by little there are many 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.580
 players do not choose very expensive leagues 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.490
 like the barclays for example and here 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.170
 we have a team from the league two 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.660
 crimes in effect above will already give that is 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.820
 only 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.650
 I quite like to see everything more 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.240
 players are very good they have a lot 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.250
 body and the Togolese in the center of everything 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.210
 1 451 you are seeing that we are going 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.860
 interspersing different alignments 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.650
 to start trying to see what they are 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.710
 those that we like the ones that least already 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.880
 note especially 4-3-1-2 Giving 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.500
 the Brazilians that I quite like 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.020
 especially by the centralized game that 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.370
 he's used to that and the 352 that 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.490
 I love as always all the 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.370
 do the same alignment does not let me 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.220
 to like because as you already know 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.260
 it allows to play very vertical very very 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.430
 possessive he got the ball always the 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.050
 you can have because you always have 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.880
 supports on all the sites here we have 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.890
 the Russian league we have made both 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.560
 each team a Russian league team the 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.820
 zagat is a little more more cheap 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.280
 because as I had enough more 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.840
 templates do not want to spend much 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.740
 money because now let's move on to 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.920
 tell you what we are going to do 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:05.480
 soon in our our series 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.530
 and of course when you see how 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.930
 explain what I'm going to do and good 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.900
 You know explain what you going to do 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.060
 try to do before all a climb to 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.560
 first division be a little special 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.630
 little special because we are not going to 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.650
 say but let's leave it there so that 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.080
 you see in the first episode but it's going to 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.100
 being very very special is going to be amazing 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.430
 that season a different team 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.959
 but centralized in something very good there 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.910
 you have a bronze template that 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.470
 simply to play matches against 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.269
 the machine in tournaments and so on that 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.700
 neither are we gambling on top 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.870
 but good and that use it a lot because 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.030
 you recover the players if you win 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.130
 easy coins and good let's move on to 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.560
 see my templates I have only two 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.600
 templates the first of the Russian rich 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.340
 as I said before a Russian league 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.830
 quite more expensive than the sagas but 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.810
 good is also quite more than quality 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.280
 Sure but it cost me about 11,000 coins 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.590
 a team that moment has not lost 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.049
 no match one I equip the truth there 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.730
 we have cumbia and bussufa up 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:01.100
 also wakaso that we like much more 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.420
 gay and this player here that we have 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.510
 up also in tip that is also 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.730
 very good mus to the 91 rhythm and now 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.200
 you see the other template that is what I 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.620
 has been playing that can not be sold and 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.330
 those 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.909
 you see that he has a man who puts in 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.500
 English I have loaded again another 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:17.340
 year more than doing the road to balclis 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.840
 fever lic 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.060
 you know that I love to be 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.440
 things a little bit higher of the price I'm going to 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.360
 try to save a little bit for 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.000
 start the team a little more decent and 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.340
 there we see that I touched cissokho 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.440
 players before a good bit but 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.550
 not too many boateng there I'm going to 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.710
 be to all the bronzes when 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.710
 let's start, you see the silver ring above 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.479
 be like that of Suarez and there we have the 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.070
 fundamental life of the team a striker 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:44.310
 center that makes entrance defenses 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:46.500
 the truth that no compensation if 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.690
 you remove it from there the conversation goes up and 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.300
 samples also or by bringing original 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.590
 cheap players tips and everything from 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.389
 always and good what has always 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.380
 liked in live maps and until next time 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.380
 until the next kids
