all<00:00:02.429> right<00:00:02.610> what<00:00:02.820> up<00:00:02.850> YouTube<00:00:05.509> I've<00:00:06.509> been

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
all right what up YouTube I've been

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.690 
all right what up YouTube I've been
getting<00:00:07.370> quite<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.429> bit<00:00:08.490> of<00:00:08.639> questions<00:00:09.599> on<00:00:10.700> how

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
getting quite a bit of questions on how

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.890 
getting quite a bit of questions on how
to<00:00:11.730> do

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
to do

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.760 
to do
Grundy's<00:00:13.650> chain<00:00:14.070> grabs<00:00:14.870> and<00:00:15.870> they're<00:00:16.560> pretty

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
Grundy's chain grabs and they're pretty

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.480 
Grundy's chain grabs and they're pretty
simple<00:00:17.070> once<00:00:17.460> you<00:00:17.550> get<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.850> timing<00:00:18.090> down

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
simple once you get the timing down

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.560 
simple once you get the timing down
they're<00:00:20.490> not<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.789> hard<00:00:20.939> so<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.449> going

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
they're not that hard so this is going

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.000 
they're not that hard so this is going
to<00:00:21.630> be<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.750> tutorial<00:00:21.900> on<00:00:23.930> how<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:24.960> do<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.830> three

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
to be a tutorial on how to do the three

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.490 
to be a tutorial on how to do the three
different<00:00:26.160> chain<00:00:26.519> grabs<00:00:26.849> which<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.599> Solomon

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
different chain grabs which is a Solomon

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.590 
different chain grabs which is a Solomon
Grundy<00:00:28.830> straight<00:00:33.620> and<00:00:34.620> it's<00:00:34.950> really<00:00:35.190> all<00:00:35.430> a

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
Grundy straight and it's really all a

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.600 
Grundy straight and it's really all a
timing<00:00:36.600> issue<00:00:37.399> once<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.550> figure<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.000> out<00:00:40.610> like

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
timing issue once you figure it out like

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:52.900 
timing issue once you figure it out like
I<00:00:41.730> said<00:00:41.760> it's<00:00:42.300> not<00:00:42.450> that<00:00:42.690> hard

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.780 

okay<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.860> I've<00:00:55.860> got<00:00:55.920> my<00:00:56.190> button<00:00:56.400> commands

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
okay so I've got my button commands

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.900 
okay so I've got my button commands
there<00:00:57.060> on<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.270> list<00:00:57.740> so<00:00:58.740> to<00:00:59.160> go<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.340> start<00:00:59.790> the

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
there on the list so to go to start the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.010 
there on the list so to go to start the
grab<00:01:00.150> you<00:01:00.510> would<00:01:00.660> do<00:01:00.810> his<00:01:01.410> trait<00:01:01.830> or<00:01:02.840> if<00:01:03.840> you're

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.020 
grab you would do his trait or if you're

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.690 
grab you would do his trait or if you're
using<00:01:04.050> the<00:01:04.440> number<00:01:04.710> layout<00:01:05.040> you're<00:01:05.460> going<00:01:05.640> to

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
using the number layout you're going to

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.580 
using the number layout you're going to
use<00:01:05.850> four<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.620> it'll<00:01:07.620> look<00:01:07.710> like<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:09.590> and

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
use four so it'll look like that and

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.170 
use four so it'll look like that and
then<00:01:10.650> out<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.130> basic<00:01:12.030> command<00:01:12.530> you<00:01:13.530> have

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
then out of that basic command you have

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.070 
then out of that basic command you have
other<00:01:15.180> commands<00:01:15.660> that<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.990> can<00:01:16.020> do<00:01:17.720> so<00:01:18.720> and

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
other commands that you can do so and

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.030 
other commands that you can do so and
each<00:01:19.740> chain<00:01:20.700> grab<00:01:21.000> does<00:01:21.540> different<00:01:25.040> does

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
each chain grab does different does

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.120 
each chain grab does different does
different<00:01:26.430> things<00:01:26.660> so<00:01:27.660> we<00:01:28.160> can<00:01:29.160> go<00:01:29.340> into<00:01:31.130> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
different things so we can go into the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.620 
different things so we can go into the
moves<00:01:32.340> list<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.880> over<00:01:33.030> here<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.210> character

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
moves list and over here to character

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.800 
moves list and over here to character
power<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.670> you<00:01:35.670> can<00:01:35.820> see<00:01:35.940> that<00:01:36.119> he<00:01:36.240> has<00:01:36.270> three

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
power and you can see that he has three

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.520 
power and you can see that he has three
sets<00:01:37.080> of<00:01:37.200> chain<00:01:38.360> grabs<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.600> he<00:01:39.720> can<00:01:39.869> do<00:01:42.530> so

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
sets of chain grabs that he can do so

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.499 
sets of chain grabs that he can do so
this<00:01:43.770> first<00:01:43.950> one<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> power<00:01:44.610> chain<00:01:45.060> and

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.270 

there's<00:01:48.509> two<00:01:48.690> parts<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.170> each<00:01:49.259> grab<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:50.040> one

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
there's two parts to each grab this one

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.370 
there's two parts to each grab this one
the<00:01:50.430> first<00:01:50.550> part<00:01:50.910> will<00:01:51.720> increase<00:01:52.050> the<00:01:52.200> damage

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
the first part will increase the damage

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.830 
the first part will increase the damage
on<00:01:52.619> all<00:01:52.649> attacks<00:01:53.190> and<00:01:53.759> if<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.479> land<00:01:54.720> the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
on all attacks and if you land the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.899 
on all attacks and if you land the
second<00:01:55.200> part<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:56.160> further<00:01:56.520> increases

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
second part of it it further increases

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.719 
second part of it it further increases
damage<00:01:57.720> on<00:01:57.990> all<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.799> his<00:01:58.950> attacks<00:01:59.280> for<00:01:59.670> the

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
damage on all of his attacks for the

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.920 
damage on all of his attacks for the
remainder<00:02:01.549> so<00:02:02.549> let's<00:02:02.820> try<00:02:03.000> this<00:02:03.060> one<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:03.690> it's

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
remainder so let's try this one so it's

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.780 
remainder so let's try this one so it's
a<00:02:04.170> Ford<00:02:04.560> back<00:02:04.710> B<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.280> then<00:02:05.369> quarter-circle

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
a Ford back B and then quarter-circle

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.990 
a Ford back B and then quarter-circle
Ford<00:02:06.180> be

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.340 

so<00:02:09.509> we're<00:02:09.720> going<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.899> start<00:02:10.110> out<00:02:10.200> with<00:02:10.229> a

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
so we're going to start out with a

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:19.430 
so we're going to start out with a
normal<00:02:10.470> chain<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:15.140> Ford<00:02:16.140> back<00:02:17.390> be<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:18.750> as<00:02:19.110> soon

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
normal chain and Ford back be is as soon

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:31.130 
normal chain and Ford back be is as soon
as<00:02:19.800> they<00:02:20.010> hit<00:02:20.280> turn<00:02:28.940> and<00:02:29.940> that's<00:02:30.690> pretty<00:02:31.020> much

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
as they hit turn and that's pretty much

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.200 
as they hit turn and that's pretty much
what<00:02:31.350> it<00:02:31.440> looks<00:02:31.620> like<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:32.520> you<00:02:32.670> can<00:02:32.820> see<00:02:33.000> down

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
what it looks like and you can see down

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.590 
what it looks like and you can see down
there<00:02:33.450> on<00:02:34.170> my<00:02:34.230> player<00:02:34.590> bar<00:02:35.000> it<00:02:36.000> shows<00:02:36.360> that<00:02:36.540> I

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
there on my player bar it shows that I

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.200 
there on my player bar it shows that I
did<00:02:36.870> get<00:02:37.080> both<00:02:37.920> commands<00:02:38.520> of<00:02:38.610> that<00:02:38.700> chain<00:02:38.970> grab

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
did get both commands of that chain grab

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.600 
did get both commands of that chain grab
so<00:02:39.570> I<00:02:39.900> have<00:02:40.380> a<00:02:40.410> damage<00:02:40.800> boost<00:02:40.980> on<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.370> next

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
so I have a damage boost on the next

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.600 
so I have a damage boost on the next
time<00:02:41.820> I<00:02:42.209> attack<00:02:42.780> my<00:02:43.020> opponent<00:02:45.800> um<00:02:46.800> I<00:02:47.070> kind<00:02:47.580> of

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
time I attack my opponent um I kind of

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.630 
time I attack my opponent um I kind of
got<00:02:47.760> unlucky<00:02:48.120> they're<00:02:49.280> usually<00:02:50.280> on<00:02:50.550> this

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
got unlucky they're usually on this

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.100 
got unlucky they're usually on this
first<00:02:50.910> grab<00:02:51.590> he<00:02:52.590> says<00:02:52.800> solomon<00:02:53.370> grundy<00:02:54.110> born

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
first grab he says solomon grundy born

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.400 
first grab he says solomon grundy born
on<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.260> Monday<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:57.150> that's<00:02:57.930> usually<00:02:58.110> when

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
on a Monday and that's usually when

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.720 
on a Monday and that's usually when
you're<00:02:58.530> going<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.740> want<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:58.920> input<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.400> the

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
you're going to want to input the the

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.970 
you're going to want to input the the
second<00:03:00.209> command<00:03:00.540> so<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:01.110> first<00:03:01.320> command<00:03:01.650> is

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
second command so the first command is

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.610 
second command so the first command is
the<00:03:02.820> actual<00:03:03.150> trade<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.810> second<00:03:04.170> command<00:03:04.470> is

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
the actual trade the second command is

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.010 
the actual trade the second command is
Ford<00:03:05.010> back<00:03:05.190> here<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:06.600> I<00:03:07.320> missed<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:08.450> so<00:03:09.450> the

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
Ford back here and I missed it so the

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.460 
Ford back here and I missed it so the
first<00:03:10.260> trait<00:03:10.680> is<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.550> grab<00:03:11.790> which<00:03:12.330> is<00:03:12.480> we<00:03:12.660> in<00:03:13.110> a

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
first trait is the grab which is we in a

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.110 
first trait is the grab which is we in a
Ford<00:03:13.800> back<00:03:14.010> beat<00:03:14.220> in<00:03:14.400> their<00:03:14.519> Lane<00:03:16.910> okay<00:03:17.910> as

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
Ford back beat in their Lane okay as

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.420 
Ford back beat in their Lane okay as
soon<00:03:18.330> as<00:03:18.480> he<00:03:18.570> said<00:03:18.780> born<00:03:19.350> on<00:03:19.530> a<00:03:19.560> Monday<00:03:19.800> that<00:03:20.280> is

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
soon as he said born on a Monday that is

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.310 
soon as he said born on a Monday that is
from<00:03:20.610> one<00:03:20.790> foot<00:03:21.090> or<00:03:21.300> for<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.600> Ferger<00:03:21.780> Ford<00:03:22.080> B

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
from one foot or for the Ferger Ford B

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:29.270 
from one foot or for the Ferger Ford B
and<00:03:23.390> so<00:03:24.390> that<00:03:24.690> is<00:03:24.989> his<00:03:25.580> basic<00:03:28.010> first<00:03:29.010> chain

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
and so that is his basic first chain

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.410 
and so that is his basic first chain
grab<00:03:30.920> now<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:31.980> next<00:03:32.280> one<00:03:32.459> follows<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.180> same

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
grab now the next one follows the same

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.740 
grab now the next one follows the same
guidelines<00:03:33.480> because<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:35.430> trait<00:03:35.730> is<00:03:36.300> the<00:03:36.510> same

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
guidelines because the trait is the same

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.160 
guidelines because the trait is the same
beginning<00:03:37.230> grab

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
beginning grab

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.860 
beginning grab
which<00:03:40.170> is<00:03:40.319> that<00:03:40.530> and<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:42.060> second<00:03:42.359> one<00:03:42.450> is<00:03:42.569> most

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
which is that and the second one is most

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.170 
which is that and the second one is most
damaging<00:03:43.379> out<00:03:43.590> of<00:03:44.129> out<00:03:44.370> of<00:03:44.430> all<00:03:44.670> three<00:03:44.909> of<00:03:45.030> them

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
damaging out of out of all three of them

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.300 
damaging out of out of all three of them
and<00:03:45.450> it's<00:03:45.689> probably<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.530> easiest<00:03:46.560> one<00:03:47.069> to<00:03:47.099> hit

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
and it's probably the easiest one to hit

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.559 
and it's probably the easiest one to hit
and<00:03:47.930> it's<00:03:48.930> down<00:03:49.379> down<00:03:49.620> and<00:03:49.680> up<00:03:50.010> up<00:03:50.400> so<00:03:51.209> down

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
and it's down down and up up so down

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.300 
and it's down down and up up so down
down<00:03:51.810> for<00:03:52.019> the<00:03:52.079> first<00:03:52.319> part<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:52.769> then<00:03:52.920> up<00:03:53.159> up

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
down for the first part and then up up

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.619 
down for the first part and then up up
for<00:03:53.579> the<00:03:53.640> second<00:03:53.969> part<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:54.359> it'll<00:03:54.540> look

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:54.629 
for the second part and it'll look

00:03:54.629 --> 00:04:08.509 
for the second part and it'll look
something<00:03:54.840> like<00:03:55.019> this<00:04:03.439> okay<00:04:04.439> so<00:04:07.219> just<00:04:08.219> like<00:04:08.340> on

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
something like this okay so just like on

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.750 
something like this okay so just like on
the<00:04:08.609> first<00:04:08.790> graph<00:04:09.120> when<00:04:09.389> we<00:04:09.480> inputted<00:04:10.760> Ford

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
the first graph when we inputted Ford

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.939 
the first graph when we inputted Ford
back<00:04:12.000> B<00:04:14.599> this<00:04:15.599> time<00:04:15.659> we<00:04:16.079> just<00:04:16.259> replaced<00:04:16.680> that

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
back B this time we just replaced that

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.819 
back B this time we just replaced that
timing<00:04:17.340> with<00:04:17.609> down<00:04:17.820> down<00:04:18.090> B<00:04:18.329> as<00:04:18.599> soon<00:04:19.500> as<00:04:19.650> they

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
timing with down down B as soon as they

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:26.839 
timing with down down B as soon as they
land<00:04:23.750> and<00:04:24.750> then<00:04:25.259> up<00:04:25.500> up<00:04:25.680> B<00:04:25.889> is<00:04:26.190> as<00:04:26.400> soon<00:04:26.610> as<00:04:26.759> the

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:26.849 
land and then up up B is as soon as the

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:29.480 
land and then up up B is as soon as the
second<00:04:27.389> part<00:04:27.539> of<00:04:27.720> that<00:04:27.930> so<00:04:28.320> he<00:04:29.009> slams<00:04:29.310> them

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
second part of that so he slams them

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.370 
second part of that so he slams them
down<00:04:29.669> and<00:04:30.000> then<00:04:30.120> you<00:04:30.210> hit<00:04:30.360> down<00:04:30.539> down<00:04:30.840> B<00:04:31.050> and

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
down and then you hit down down B and

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.900 
down and then you hit down down B and
then<00:04:31.500> as<00:04:31.590> soon<00:04:31.740> as<00:04:31.830> he<00:04:31.919> slams<00:04:32.220> them<00:04:32.400> down<00:04:32.580> again

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
then as soon as he slams them down again

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:46.640 
then as soon as he slams them down again
you<00:04:32.940> do<00:04:33.270> up<00:04:33.449> up<00:04:33.599> B<00:04:43.789> um<00:04:44.789> so<00:04:45.570> let's<00:04:45.960> take<00:04:46.409> a<00:04:46.440> look

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
you do up up B um so let's take a look

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.810 
you do up up B um so let's take a look
at<00:04:46.740> his<00:04:46.889> other<00:04:47.159> one<00:04:48.470> which<00:04:49.470> is<00:04:49.650> down<00:04:49.949> up<00:04:50.220> B<00:04:50.490> and

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
at his other one which is down up B and

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.110 
at his other one which is down up B and
up<00:04:51.270> down<00:04:51.659> be<00:04:53.000> reduced

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
up down be reduced

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.570 
up down be reduced
oh<00:04:57.289> yeah<00:04:58.289> the<00:04:58.530> the<00:04:58.860> second<00:04:59.190> chain<00:04:59.370> grab

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
oh yeah the the second chain grab

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.460 
oh yeah the the second chain grab
reduces<00:05:00.210> the<00:05:00.780> damage<00:05:01.139> that<00:05:01.729> Solomon<00:05:02.729> takes<00:05:02.940> so

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
reduces the damage that Solomon takes so

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.060 
reduces the damage that Solomon takes so
if<00:05:04.470> you're<00:05:04.650> playing<00:05:04.889> a<00:05:06.470> black<00:05:07.470> Adam<00:05:07.889> or

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
if you're playing a black Adam or

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.379 
if you're playing a black Adam or
someone<00:05:08.370> like<00:05:08.460> that<00:05:08.520> that<00:05:08.699> does<00:05:09.030> a<00:05:09.060> lot<00:05:09.330> of

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
someone like that that does a lot of

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.350 
someone like that that does a lot of
damage<00:05:09.710> this<00:05:10.710> is<00:05:10.889> a<00:05:10.919> good<00:05:11.130> chain<00:05:11.340> grab<00:05:11.550> dude<00:05:11.789> to

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
damage this is a good chain grab dude to

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.170 
damage this is a good chain grab dude to
use<00:05:12.570> because<00:05:13.099> the<00:05:14.099> combo<00:05:14.490> will<00:05:14.669> not<00:05:14.849> do<00:05:15.030> as

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
use because the combo will not do as

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:21.279 
use because the combo will not do as
much<00:05:17.210> the<00:05:18.210> third<00:05:18.419> one<00:05:18.630> is<00:05:18.780> block<00:05:19.050> damage<00:05:19.500> so

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
much the third one is block damage so

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.140 
much the third one is block damage so
really<00:05:22.289> all<00:05:22.470> three<00:05:22.770> of<00:05:22.860> these<00:05:22.949> grabs<00:05:23.460> depends

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
really all three of these grabs depends

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.120 
really all three of these grabs depends
on<00:05:24.300> how<00:05:24.780> you're<00:05:25.020> wanting<00:05:25.320> to<00:05:25.349> play<00:05:25.620> and<00:05:25.860> what

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
on how you're wanting to play and what

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.720 
on how you're wanting to play and what
you're<00:05:26.280> wanting<00:05:26.550> to<00:05:26.610> do

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 
you're wanting to do

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.620 
you're wanting to do
okay<00:05:29.660> so<00:05:29.720> for<00:05:30.410> part<00:05:31.340> three<00:05:31.730> of<00:05:32.030> his<00:05:32.300> grab<00:05:32.570> is

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
okay so for part three of his grab is

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.130 
okay so for part three of his grab is

is<00:05:44.480> the<00:05:44.660> same<00:05:44.960> as<00:05:45.830> the<00:05:46.220> other<00:05:46.370> two<00:05:46.580> grabs<00:05:46.850> which

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
is the same as the other two grabs which

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:57.880 
is the same as the other two grabs which
as<00:05:47.300> soon<00:05:47.510> as<00:05:47.660> they<00:05:47.780> hit<00:05:47.990> the<00:05:48.170> ground<00:05:56.890> second

part<00:05:58.100> is<00:05:58.280> as<00:05:58.430> soon<00:05:58.610> as<00:05:58.760> he<00:05:58.880> lifts<00:05:59.270> them<00:05:59.450> above

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
part is as soon as he lifts them above

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.970 
part is as soon as he lifts them above
his<00:06:00.080> head<00:06:00.550> so<00:06:01.900> so<00:06:02.900> it's<00:06:03.140> down<00:06:03.530> up<00:06:03.560> for<00:06:03.920> the

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:03.980 
his head so so it's down up for the

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.600 
his head so so it's down up for the
first<00:06:04.190> part<00:06:04.520> right<00:06:05.230> there<00:06:06.230> and<00:06:06.830> then<00:06:07.070> up<00:06:07.370> down

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
first part right there and then up down

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:15.310 
first part right there and then up down
right<00:06:07.940> there<00:06:13.090> so<00:06:14.090> I<00:06:14.120> mean<00:06:14.780> these<00:06:14.990> are<00:06:15.170> pretty

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320 
right there so I mean these are pretty

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.490 
right there so I mean these are pretty
simple<00:06:15.710> once<00:06:16.010> you<00:06:16.070> get<00:06:16.220> the<00:06:16.340> timing<00:06:16.580> down<00:06:17.500> so

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:18.500 
simple once you get the timing down so

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.960 
simple once you get the timing down so
let's<00:06:18.860> run<00:06:19.040> through<00:06:19.220> all<00:06:19.520> three<00:06:19.760> of<00:06:19.790> them

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:19.970
