so<00:02:08.610> how<00:02:08.789> can<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:09.030> determine<00:02:09.209> what<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.050> causing

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
so how can you determine what is causing

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.100 
so how can you determine what is causing
your<00:02:10.590> problem<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.640> can't<00:02:11.940> unless<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.930> are<00:02:13.080> a

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
your problem you can't unless you are a

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.790 
your problem you can't unless you are a
computer

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
PC every time you have a software

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.390 
PC every time you have a software
problem<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.330> this<00:02:37.020> will<00:02:37.410> also<00:02:37.620> protect<00:02:38.010> you

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
problem and this will also protect you
