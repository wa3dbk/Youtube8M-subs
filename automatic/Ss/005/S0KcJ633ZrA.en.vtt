00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 so my friends finally there are times 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.940
 again a chef video yes I have 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.799
 finally done again 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.630
 Today we make spaghetti broccoli 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.080
 peanut sauce, however you like it 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.080
 like to call 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.530
 we need either peanut butter 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.390
 or bibi tours never be easy to halt 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.779
 I only have less fat here 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.820
 Coconut milk streams of Alnatura is very 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.650
 horny where I have to say now I have 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.400
 now the trenches are found that is true 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.699
 no bio 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.250
 but that has in principle 65 percent 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:45.040
 coconut oil ice and water in it so this 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.500
 as well as that of alnatura 50 cents 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.720
 better 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.879
 three grams less fat and 50 cents 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.229
 better 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.489
 So try the two next time 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:56.050
 we need things there we still need 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.940
 a bit spelled around the whole thing 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.550
 stretch 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.449
 broccoli like program 400 but that is 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.449
 just give plenty 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:11.020
 wholegrain spaghetti yes i want of course 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.460
 other variations take that too 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.900
 Of course, it is up to you 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.970
 so you do not have to 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:21.580
 somehow set 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:25.050
 yes we have the whole thing is too 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:30.520
 super simple is already on the cook 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:34.510
 the spaghetti rhein as well as roccoli come 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:37.810
 cutouts at the pottery with the 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:41.460
 businesses do with it so come 50 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:46.150
 Milliliter is nothing in the end 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:55.270
 50 I hope now that the coconut milk 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:58.110
 already liquid is good times purely near the 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.110
 911 liquid 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.540
 So turn people on if you're right 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.060
 liquid until then I think so 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.800
 now fits next to 100 milliliters 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.250
 until you can as you can on 75 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.920
 milliliter 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:21.090
 Of the 75 milliliters you can do it 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:26.220
 it's not choose yourselves 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:30.680
 Leave it to yourself to say so 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.680
 we have that in the fridge 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.820
 so come on yet with the high school diploma 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.500
 of course you can do exactly the same thing 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.950
 We also think freely how we think 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.600
 We wanted to do it next to 25 degrees 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.600
 you will actually get along well with that 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:56.010
 can take 30 too 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:57.390
 27 the de happy and did not want to 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.280
 I want to be hot now you want 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.280
 You can think it all over for yourself 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:09.709
 I make myself a teaspoon kreiensen te 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.709
 Reh flys has no lying 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:24.360
 Which she likes sheep all over 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:27.330
 dry and there is still a bit 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.090
 curry with just in there 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.560
 we do not need that, but you can not 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.230
 Even professions are only used anymore 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:40.590
 salt or something like that, where you are 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:43.310
 also all the minerals 04 but 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.019
 you want to take that 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:50.280
 so and now this state has the 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.540
 Join in for a while and that's it 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.620
 then I have already been to people 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.690
 switch back on 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.980
 while everything is done so far then 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.360
 we come to the get in the eye 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.370

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.519

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.299

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:18.540
 Freestyle will taste great too 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.829
 I know I will not try now 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.930
 because I 'm hungry then I want 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.169
 Eat directly from the nutrition 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:29.039
 he sees the whole thing so out of order 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:31.260
 1146 calories yes 48 grams of protein 167 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:33.690
 grams of carbohydrates and 33 grams falls 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.960
 that's how it looks like 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.970
 I already showed you and I leave it 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.890
