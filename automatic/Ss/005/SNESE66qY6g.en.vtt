00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.540
 hello to all of you i hope you 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.620
 be fine, I'm fine 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.140
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.550
 little video about an express gameplay of 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.430
 at express since as you see 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.680
 I cut the majority of the game 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.810
 since it's just from 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.340
 from that moment that I will start to 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:32.230
 very well chained then we will say no 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.000
 I do not need your mouth I 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.400
 I'm really sorry I still have not 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.950
 does episode 3 of a prestigious 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.480
 snipers I'm busy doing it but 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.270
 I had to make a video in 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.790
 waiting and so you wait and well 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.550
 Sunday certainly or so Monday in 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.770
 closing short you expect from here 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.930
 the next 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.380
 so for once I have not at all 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.630
 thought what I was going to say I'm going 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.110
 maybe you talk about small projects 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.720
 to come up 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.500
 so today while I was listening to a 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.970
 exciting talk about bob marley 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.550
 as part of the French course yes 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.450
 yes I know bob marley under the 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.170
 French course that a little special 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.240
 well, well, it was people from my 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.760
 class and more particularly 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.580
 members of the sky team who presents is 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.880
 exposed yves durand is exhibited belgian elected 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.700
 three ideas that I had rather well to 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.040
 about the string so both 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.560
 first concerns subscribers the 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.570
 third regards the tika stopovers so 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.090
 the first one would be to make a dual 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.330
 commentary with subscribers with a 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.240
 subscriber excuse me the second one would be 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.100
 make a special video subscribers with 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.440
 only subscriber gameplay but 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.600
 there reassure you I will take 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.130
 gameplay simply crazy because 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.539
 that I know that among the subscribers there are 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.240
 very very strong people who would make me 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:57.160
 simply huge gameplay we 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.090
 hence the potential interest of this video 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.610
 and then the third idea would be to 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.380
 make a special video team as case where 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.080
 I would only put videos of the 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.640
 team stopovers sniper snorkel 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.160
 who is doing very well more than that 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.210
 would finally put a minimum 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.660
 worth 7 7 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:22.230
 this team that will finally have 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.820
 does he pose any mounting since his the 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.200
 beginning of his existence which is a little 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.040
 sad is not it so that's it for a 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.310
 little catch up 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.070
 briefly tell me what you think of these 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.050
 ideas anyway the first I'm 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.050
 sure of the sphere so the commentary duel 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.820
 with a subscriber so already posted in the 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.980
 comments if you want to participate 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.470
 or between quotes lucky draw 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.410
 ah yes not in quotation marks at the draw 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.360
 comes out very short to do it there is 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.060
 just one condition is to have a 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.770
 correct microphone because good make a 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.330
 video where we do not hear what the guy 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.610
 says it's just horrible 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.260
 so only post a comment if 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.790
 you have a correct microphone at worst you 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.340
 ask a friend to lend 1 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.750
 I do not know but if you do not have 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.120
 correct microphone and that I'm doing 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.750
 account at the time of the dual b 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.250
 unfortunately can not do it 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.890
 because it's really horrible a 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.530
 micro of rotten quality I hope that 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.580
 you will understand either I am really 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.650
 sorry but it's pro fry a sound of 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.930
 a minimum of quality to subscribers 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.340
 is not it 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.769
 so it's really happy because 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.450
 I would have spoken I would have spoken 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.209
 finally I would have completely what 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.859
 pay this gameplay so I'm sorry I 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.269
 still plays at the cers does a lot of 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.879
 gameplay in lasserre was then 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.560
 believe me it's going to be very diversified 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.969
 soon finally no it's actually going 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.849
 last and last gameplay this is at 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:44.450
 age and 36 so no worries I'm 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:46.400
 make ideas so it's safe on 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.480
 village I play with my class 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.459
 usual undetectable assassin is 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.090
 targeted the one most certainly like to my 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.519
 habit 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.889
 I was still in my prestige 0 so 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.200
 not in my prestige the sniper reassure 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:02.030
 I have not cracked yet I am 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.120
 still level 72 because I have not 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.939
 a lot played since the last video 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.200
 for lack of time but in any case 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:10.040
 now that I have the hd pvr I'm counting 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.319
 well finish it 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.290
 the video is already coming to an end I hope 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.329
 cause would have liked this video we can only 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.889
 more expresses I hope you put 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.729
 a little green shoots what that makes 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.829
 really happy 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.169
 I hope you did say it's the 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.440
 next I tell you bye-bye hi to 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.440
