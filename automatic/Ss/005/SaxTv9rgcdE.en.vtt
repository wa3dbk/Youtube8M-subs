you just want to go slowly and watch the
bottom<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:01.620> that<00:04:01.680> will<00:04:01.950> help<00:04:02.100> you<00:04:02.310> keep<00:04:02.490> it

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
bottom and that will help you keep it

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.720 
bottom and that will help you keep it
straight<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.870> if<00:04:04.740> you'd<00:04:04.950> like<00:04:05.160> when<00:04:05.460> you<00:04:05.550> get

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
straight and if you'd like when you get

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.300 
straight and if you'd like when you get
to<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.000> back<00:04:06.210> side<00:04:06.510> you<00:04:06.930> can<00:04:07.110> add<00:04:07.320> another

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
to the back side you can add another

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:15.400 
to the back side you can add another
piece<00:04:08.640> of<00:04:08.940> score<00:04:09.330> tape<00:04:10.400> to<00:04:11.400> hold<00:04:11.550> the<00:04:11.760> back

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.620 

that's<00:04:16.100> probably<00:04:16.459> what<00:04:16.790> I'll<00:04:16.940> do<00:04:17.209> because

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
that's probably what I'll do because

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.979 
that's probably what I'll do because
this<00:04:17.840> one<00:04:18.140> strip<00:04:18.620> down<00:04:18.800> the<00:04:18.860> middle<00:04:19.989> doesn't

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
this one strip down the middle doesn't

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.750 
this one strip down the middle doesn't
hold<00:04:21.170> it<00:04:21.350> as<00:04:21.560> well<00:04:21.890> as<00:04:22.070> I'd<00:04:22.250> liked<00:04:22.490> it<00:04:22.520> to

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
hold it as well as I'd liked it to

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.150 
hold it as well as I'd liked it to
because<00:04:23.330> of<00:04:23.510> the<00:04:23.600> curb<00:04:23.870> of<00:04:24.050> the<00:04:24.230> jar<00:04:24.500> because

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
because of the curb of the jar because

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.750 
because of the curb of the jar because
you<00:04:25.280> can<00:04:25.460> see<00:04:25.670> how<00:04:25.850> that's<00:04:26.060> going<00:04:26.330> to<00:04:26.390> look<00:04:26.450> now

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
you can see how that's going to look now

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.850 
you can see how that's going to look now
we're<00:04:28.760> going<00:04:28.880> to<00:04:28.940> put<00:04:29.030> little<00:04:29.690> bongo<00:04:30.140> on<00:04:30.320> here
