00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.010 

this<00:00:19.460> is<00:00:19.610> the<00:00:19.670> new<00:00:19.759> viking<00:00:20.150> tactics<00:00:20.570> target

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
this is the new viking tactics target

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.290 
this is the new viking tactics target
looks<00:00:21.349> somewhat<00:00:21.710> like<00:00:21.770> a<00:00:21.920> competition<00:00:22.730> target

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
looks somewhat like a competition target

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.870 
looks somewhat like a competition target
that's<00:00:23.420> overlaid<00:00:23.840> on<00:00:24.050> on<00:00:24.410> the<00:00:24.860> skull<00:00:25.189> and<00:00:25.489> the

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
that's overlaid on on the skull and the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.280 
that's overlaid on on the skull and the
body<00:00:26.119> of<00:00:26.270> the<00:00:26.360> target<00:00:26.720> the<00:00:26.810> reason<00:00:27.050> we<00:00:27.140> did

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:27.290 
body of the target the reason we did

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.470 
body of the target the reason we did
that<00:00:27.500> was<00:00:27.770> we<00:00:27.800> wanted<00:00:28.369> an<00:00:28.489> outline<00:00:28.939> so<00:00:29.239> from

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
that was we wanted an outline so from

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.240 
that was we wanted an outline so from
two<00:00:29.660> and<00:00:29.810> three<00:00:29.989> hundred<00:00:30.079> yards<00:00:30.380> we'd<00:00:31.009> be<00:00:31.189> able

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
two and three hundred yards we'd be able

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.910 
two and three hundred yards we'd be able
to<00:00:31.399> to<00:00:32.239> distinguish<00:00:32.899> where<00:00:33.470> we<00:00:33.590> needed<00:00:33.770> to

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
to to distinguish where we needed to

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.710 
to to distinguish where we needed to
hold<00:00:34.190> on<00:00:34.370> a<00:00:34.399> human<00:00:34.730> body<00:00:34.910> the<00:00:35.329> reason<00:00:35.570> that<00:00:35.630> we

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
hold on a human body the reason that we

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.569 
hold on a human body the reason that we
made<00:00:35.899> the<00:00:36.020> Viking<00:00:36.320> tactics<00:00:36.739> target<00:00:37.010> contrasts

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
made the Viking tactics target contrasts

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.520 
made the Viking tactics target contrasts
with<00:00:38.149> the<00:00:38.300> black<00:00:38.510> and<00:00:38.750> the<00:00:38.840> white<00:00:39.020> we<00:00:39.230> tried

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
with the black and the white we tried

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.960 
with the black and the white we tried
putting<00:00:39.770> grey<00:00:40.190> here<00:00:40.460> which<00:00:40.610> would<00:00:40.790> have<00:00:40.880> been

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:40.970 
putting grey here which would have been

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.870 
putting grey here which would have been
a<00:00:41.000> lot<00:00:41.570> cheaper<00:00:41.600> to<00:00:42.110> make<00:00:42.320> but<00:00:43.130> when<00:00:43.640> we<00:00:43.730> move

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
a lot cheaper to make but when we move

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.310 
a lot cheaper to make but when we move
the<00:00:44.000> targets<00:00:44.360> out<00:00:44.510> to<00:00:44.690> two<00:00:44.810> and<00:00:44.960> three<00:00:45.080> hundred

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
the targets out to two and three hundred

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.590 
the targets out to two and three hundred
yards<00:00:45.470> we<00:00:46.250> couldn't<00:00:46.640> really<00:00:46.790> tell<00:00:47.120> where<00:00:47.390> the

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
yards we couldn't really tell where the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.810 
yards we couldn't really tell where the
target<00:00:47.960> ended<00:00:48.290> in<00:00:48.380> the<00:00:48.440> body<00:00:48.650> began<00:00:49.070> so<00:00:49.640> that's

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
target ended in the body began so that's

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.510 
target ended in the body began so that's
why<00:00:50.000> we<00:00:50.180> put<00:00:50.360> a<00:00:50.390> white<00:00:50.690> target<00:00:51.410> with<00:00:52.190> a<00:00:52.220> black

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
why we put a white target with a black

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.160 
why we put a white target with a black
outline<00:00:52.850> that<00:00:53.450> way<00:00:53.630> at<00:00:53.720> the<00:00:53.870> farther

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
outline that way at the farther

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.990 
outline that way at the farther
distances<00:00:54.770> were<00:00:54.950> able<00:00:55.280> to<00:00:55.310> discriminate<00:00:55.730> on

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
distances were able to discriminate on

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.910 
distances were able to discriminate on
that<00:00:56.120> target<00:00:56.510> and<00:00:56.600> know<00:00:56.750> exactly<00:00:56.900> where<00:00:57.770> we're

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
that target and know exactly where we're

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.200 
that target and know exactly where we're
holding<00:00:58.280> just<00:00:58.430> like<00:00:58.579> you<00:00:58.700> would<00:00:58.850> be<00:00:59.000> with<00:00:59.120> the

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
holding just like you would be with the

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.910 
holding just like you would be with the
person<00:00:59.420> you<00:00:59.960> can<00:01:00.050> see<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:00.350> outline<00:01:00.739> of<00:01:00.770> that

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
person you can see the outline of that

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.880 
person you can see the outline of that
human<00:01:01.340> being<00:01:01.550> at<00:01:01.640> that<00:01:01.790> distance<00:01:02.770> the<00:01:03.770> other

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
human being at that distance the other

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.679 
human being at that distance the other
thing<00:01:04.100> that<00:01:04.129> we<00:01:04.309> did<00:01:04.489> was<00:01:04.729> up<00:01:05.030> close<00:01:05.329> you'll<00:01:05.600> be

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
thing that we did was up close you'll be

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:07.870 
thing that we did was up close you'll be
able<00:01:05.780> to<00:01:05.930> see<00:01:06.079> where<00:01:06.320> you<00:01:06.530> shoot<00:01:06.829> actually<00:01:07.490> in

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
able to see where you shoot actually in

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.370 
able to see where you shoot actually in
the<00:01:07.970> body<00:01:08.180> and<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:08.479> skeletal<00:01:08.930> structure<00:01:09.200> you

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
the body and the skeletal structure you

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.889 
the body and the skeletal structure you
can<00:01:09.470> see<00:01:09.590> the<00:01:09.710> pelvis<00:01:10.130> the<00:01:10.790> chest<00:01:11.149> and<00:01:11.390> the

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
can see the pelvis the chest and the

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:14.110 
can see the pelvis the chest and the
head<00:01:12.049> zone<00:01:12.320> there<00:01:12.560> as<00:01:12.680> well<00:01:12.890> the<00:01:13.729> other<00:01:13.760> thing

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
head zone there as well the other thing

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.260 
head zone there as well the other thing
we<00:01:14.240> did<00:01:14.450> was<00:01:14.659> we<00:01:14.810> added<00:01:14.990> plus<00:01:15.620> 0<00:01:15.950> plus<00:01:16.250> 0.5<00:01:16.880> plus

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
we did was we added plus 0 plus 0.5 plus

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.260 
we did was we added plus 0 plus 0.5 plus
1.5<00:01:18.229> seconds<00:01:18.860> so<00:01:19.010> that<00:01:19.159> everybody<00:01:19.550> knows<00:01:19.610> if

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
1.5 seconds so that everybody knows if

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.700 
1.5 seconds so that everybody knows if
they<00:01:20.420> put<00:01:20.600> those<00:01:20.780> rounds<00:01:21.170> in<00:01:21.260> those<00:01:21.409> zones

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
they put those rounds in those zones

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.380 
they put those rounds in those zones
that's<00:01:22.250> how<00:01:22.460> much<00:01:22.640> time<00:01:22.850> we're<00:01:23.030> going<00:01:23.120> to<00:01:23.180> add

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
that's how much time we're going to add

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.690 
that's how much time we're going to add
to<00:01:23.630> that<00:01:23.659> run<00:01:24.049> the<00:01:24.950> other<00:01:25.070> thing<00:01:25.340> that<00:01:25.370> we've

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
to that run the other thing that we've

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.430 
to that run the other thing that we've
added<00:01:25.909> to<00:01:26.150> this<00:01:26.270> target<00:01:26.750> our<00:01:26.870> center<00:01:27.409> of

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
added to this target our center of

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.430 
added to this target our center of
gravity<00:01:27.560> zone<00:01:28.130> so<00:01:28.310> we<00:01:28.400> have<00:01:28.520> one<00:01:28.729> in<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:28.940> face

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
gravity zone so we have one in the face

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.230 
gravity zone so we have one in the face
one<00:01:30.440> in<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.620> chest<00:01:30.920> for<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:31.280> heart<00:01:31.549> and<00:01:31.790> lung

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
one in the chest for the heart and lung

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:40.370 
one in the chest for the heart and lung
area<00:01:32.630> and<00:01:32.870> one<00:01:33.380> in<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:33.560> pelvis

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.540 

this<00:01:41.380> is<00:01:41.530> what<00:01:41.680> you'll<00:01:41.770> find<00:01:41.950> in<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.160> back<00:01:42.370> of

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
this is what you'll find in the back of

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.400 
this is what you'll find in the back of
the<00:01:42.610> target<00:01:42.970> for<00:01:43.270> bullseye<00:01:43.720> targets<00:01:44.230> their

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
the target for bullseye targets their

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.010 
the target for bullseye targets their
25-yard<00:01:45.220> pistol<00:01:45.670> bull's<00:01:45.880> the<00:01:46.630> reason<00:01:46.900> we<00:01:46.990> use

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
25-yard pistol bull's the reason we use

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.990 
25-yard pistol bull's the reason we use
a<00:01:47.170> 25-yard<00:01:47.860> pistol<00:01:48.280> Bowl<00:01:48.430> it's<00:01:48.610> about<00:01:48.820> the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
a 25-yard pistol Bowl it's about the

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.420 
a 25-yard pistol Bowl it's about the
right<00:01:49.180> size<00:01:49.450> to<00:01:49.750> get<00:01:49.900> a<00:01:49.930> guy<00:01:50.110> dialed<00:01:50.560> in<00:01:50.740> if

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
right size to get a guy dialed in if

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.190 
right size to get a guy dialed in if
they<00:01:51.730> shoot<00:01:51.790> out<00:01:52.060> in<00:01:52.150> the<00:01:52.210> 8th<00:01:52.360> zone<00:01:52.630> we

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
they shoot out in the 8th zone we

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.230 
they shoot out in the 8th zone we
normally<00:01:53.530> give<00:01:53.680> them<00:01:53.800> zeros<00:01:54.160> anything<00:01:55.000> in<00:01:55.120> the

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
normally give them zeros anything in the

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.150 
normally give them zeros anything in the
10<00:01:55.480> or<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:55.990> 9<00:01:56.170> ring<00:01:56.440> or<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.590> extra<00:01:56.920> ring<00:01:57.010> we're

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
10 or the 9 ring or the extra ring we're

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.370 
10 or the 9 ring or the extra ring we're
going<00:01:57.190> to<00:01:57.310> give<00:01:57.520> them<00:01:57.760> a<00:01:58.000> 10<00:01:58.690> on<00:01:58.960> some<00:01:59.230> of<00:01:59.320> the

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
going to give them a 10 on some of the

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.110 
going to give them a 10 on some of the
drills<00:01:59.650> we<00:02:00.070> also<00:02:00.370> use<00:02:00.520> this<00:02:00.700> for<00:02:00.760> when<00:02:01.030> we

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
drills we also use this for when we

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.850 
drills we also use this for when we
shoot<00:02:01.300> our<00:02:01.420> hundred<00:02:01.720> yard<00:02:01.900> aggregate<00:02:02.410> with

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
shoot our hundred yard aggregate with

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.440 
shoot our hundred yard aggregate with
the<00:02:02.980> rifle<00:02:03.340> and<00:02:03.490> 50<00:02:03.730> yard<00:02:03.910> aggregate<00:02:04.330> it

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
the rifle and 50 yard aggregate it

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.270 
the rifle and 50 yard aggregate it
allows<00:02:04.720> you<00:02:04.900> to<00:02:04.990> shoot<00:02:05.200> four<00:02:05.920> different

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
allows you to shoot four different

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.710 
allows you to shoot four different
positions<00:02:06.430> and<00:02:06.910> know<00:02:07.030> where<00:02:07.180> you<00:02:07.270> hit<00:02:07.450> at<00:02:07.600> each

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
positions and know where you hit at each

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.260 
positions and know where you hit at each
position<00:02:08.130> so<00:02:09.130> we<00:02:09.220> got<00:02:09.369> four<00:02:09.640> bulls

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
position so we got four bulls

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.360 
position so we got four bulls
we<00:02:10.479> also<00:02:10.630> gritted<00:02:11.140> that<00:02:11.260> each<00:02:11.650> grid<00:02:12.010> is<00:02:12.130> one

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
we also gritted that each grid is one

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.550 
we also gritted that each grid is one
inch<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:13.390> grid<00:02:13.600> lines<00:02:13.840> being<00:02:14.080> one<00:02:14.350> inch

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
inch the grid lines being one inch

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.290 
inch the grid lines being one inch
allows<00:02:14.830> you<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.100> quickly<00:02:15.280> adjust<00:02:15.580> your<00:02:16.000> scope

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
allows you to quickly adjust your scope

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.000 
allows you to quickly adjust your scope
whenever<00:02:16.660> you<00:02:16.840> need<00:02:17.020> to<00:02:17.050> and<00:02:17.500> that<00:02:17.860> should

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
whenever you need to and that should

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.949 
whenever you need to and that should
help<00:02:18.160> to<00:02:18.520> limit<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.180> time<00:02:19.209> that<00:02:19.570> it<00:02:19.660> takes<00:02:19.810> to

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
help to limit the time that it takes to

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.170 
help to limit the time that it takes to
get<00:02:20.170> everybody<00:02:20.530> dialed<00:02:20.980> in<00:02:21.100> with<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.910> correct

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
get everybody dialed in with the correct

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.570 
get everybody dialed in with the correct
zero<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:23.500> other<00:02:23.620> thing<00:02:23.860> that<00:02:23.890> we<00:02:24.070> did<00:02:24.250> was<00:02:24.459> we

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
zero the other thing that we did was we

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.060 
zero the other thing that we did was we
put<00:02:24.610> this<00:02:25.030> gray<00:02:25.570> line<00:02:25.870> which<00:02:26.290> goes<00:02:26.709> into<00:02:26.980> a

put the cross in there as normally

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.730 
put the cross in there as normally
Geyser<00:02:30.670> are<00:02:31.120> accepting<00:02:31.959> a<00:02:32.050> zero<00:02:32.320> that's<00:02:32.560> not

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
Geyser are accepting a zero that's not

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.680 
Geyser are accepting a zero that's not
acceptable<00:02:33.100> so<00:02:33.880> with<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.150> cross<00:02:34.390> on<00:02:34.660> the

acceptable so with the cross on the

acceptable so with the cross on the
target<00:02:35.140> what<00:02:35.230> it<00:02:35.320> allows<00:02:35.500> us<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.890> do<00:02:36.040> if<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.880> guy

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
target what it allows us to do if a guy

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.910 
target what it allows us to do if a guy
is<00:02:37.060> hitting<00:02:37.330> high<00:02:37.600> right<00:02:37.870> you'll<00:02:38.230> tell<00:02:38.290> right

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
is hitting high right you'll tell right

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.310 
is hitting high right you'll tell right
away<00:02:38.950> that<00:02:39.459> those<00:02:39.910> rounds<00:02:40.450> are<00:02:40.540> all<00:02:40.690> impacting

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
away that those rounds are all impacting

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.320 
away that those rounds are all impacting
high<00:02:41.500> right<00:02:41.769> rather<00:02:42.250> than<00:02:42.430> looking<00:02:42.790> at<00:02:42.940> just<00:02:43.209> a

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
high right rather than looking at just a

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.000 
high right rather than looking at just a
round<00:02:43.750> target<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:44.350> saying<00:02:44.470> okay<00:02:44.739> they're<00:02:44.920> all

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
round target and saying okay they're all

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.500 
round target and saying okay they're all
in<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.190> 10<00:02:45.430> I'm<00:02:45.700> good<00:02:46.209> to<00:02:46.300> go

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
in the 10 I'm good to go

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.840 
in the 10 I'm good to go
this<00:02:46.750> helps<00:02:47.050> to<00:02:47.110> further<00:02:47.350> define<00:02:47.620> that<00:02:48.040> the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
this helps to further define that the

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.699 
this helps to further define that the
other<00:02:48.970> thing<00:02:49.209> we<00:02:49.330> added<00:02:49.600> were<00:02:49.720> the<00:02:49.840> shapes<00:02:50.140> the

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
other thing we added were the shapes the

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.320 
other thing we added were the shapes the
reason<00:02:50.980> we<00:02:51.070> put<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.370> shapes<00:02:51.610> on<00:02:51.790> this<00:02:51.940> target

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
reason we put the shapes on this target

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.720 
reason we put the shapes on this target
is<00:02:52.420> one<00:02:52.630> is<00:02:52.810> it<00:02:52.930> allows<00:02:53.140> a<00:02:53.170> shooter<00:02:54.040> if<00:02:54.280> we<00:02:54.550> move

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
is one is it allows a shooter if we move

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.520 
is one is it allows a shooter if we move
them<00:02:54.850> up<00:02:54.940> close<00:02:55.150> they<00:02:55.750> have<00:02:55.900> to<00:02:56.050> work<00:02:56.200> on<00:02:56.380> their

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
them up close they have to work on their

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.080 
them up close they have to work on their
hold<00:02:56.709> off<00:02:56.920> so<00:02:57.130> it's<00:02:57.250> two<00:02:57.430> and<00:02:57.550> a<00:02:57.580> half<00:02:57.730> inches

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
hold off so it's two and a half inches

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.600 
hold off so it's two and a half inches
normally<00:02:58.540> of<00:02:58.690> standoff<00:02:59.500> between<00:02:59.769> their<00:03:00.220> line

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
normally of standoff between their line

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.550 
normally of standoff between their line
of<00:03:00.640> sight<00:03:00.820> and<00:03:01.239> where<00:03:02.110> their<00:03:02.260> bullets

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
of sight and where their bullets

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.290 
of sight and where their bullets
actually<00:03:02.890> gonna<00:03:02.980> impact<00:03:03.370> at<00:03:03.610> the<00:03:03.730> closer<00:03:03.940> yard

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
actually gonna impact at the closer yard

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.660 
actually gonna impact at the closer yard
lines<00:03:04.570> so<00:03:05.170> this<00:03:05.350> allows<00:03:05.800> them<00:03:06.100> to<00:03:06.280> make<00:03:06.430> those

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
lines so this allows them to make those

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.370 
lines so this allows them to make those
shots<00:03:06.700> and<00:03:07.450> you<00:03:07.540> can<00:03:07.720> say<00:03:07.930> this<00:03:08.140> is<00:03:08.200> the

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
shots and you can say this is the

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.590 
shots and you can say this is the
hostage<00:03:08.799> this<00:03:08.980> is<00:03:09.130> your<00:03:09.340> suspect<00:03:10.150> or<00:03:10.330> your<00:03:10.450> bad

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
hostage this is your suspect or your bad

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.330 
hostage this is your suspect or your bad
guy<00:03:10.810> target<00:03:11.320> and<00:03:11.470> they've<00:03:11.830> got<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.130> put<00:03:12.250> the

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
guy target and they've got to put the

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.430 
guy target and they've got to put the
rounds<00:03:12.640> in<00:03:12.730> there<00:03:12.850> or<00:03:13.090> vice<00:03:13.120> versa<00:03:13.330> it<00:03:14.260> also

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
rounds in there or vice versa it also

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.440 
rounds in there or vice versa it also
allows<00:03:14.830> us<00:03:14.860> to<00:03:15.070> call<00:03:15.340> out<00:03:15.549> numbers<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.000> get

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
allows us to call out numbers and get

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.120 
allows us to call out numbers and get
them<00:03:16.600> to<00:03:16.720> quickly<00:03:16.930> dry<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.290> gun<00:03:17.560> from<00:03:17.769> target

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
them to quickly dry the gun from target

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.009 
them to quickly dry the gun from target
a<00:03:18.190> target<00:03:18.549> for<00:03:18.640> example<00:03:19.030> we<00:03:19.120> might<00:03:19.269> say<00:03:19.330> five

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
a target for example we might say five

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.570 
a target for example we might say five
for<00:03:20.380> one<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:20.830> they'd<00:03:20.920> have<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.070> shoot<00:03:21.190> five

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
for one and they'd have to shoot five

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.120 
for one and they'd have to shoot five
four<00:03:22.030> and<00:03:22.299> then<00:03:22.840> one<00:03:23.110> the<00:03:23.680> other<00:03:23.830> thing<00:03:24.100> that

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130
