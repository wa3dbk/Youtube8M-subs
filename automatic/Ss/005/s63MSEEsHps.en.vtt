difference<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> cup<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:39.440> first<00:00:40.440> up<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.739> my

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
difference in the cup so first up is my

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.880 
difference in the cup so first up is my
old<00:00:41.100> trusty<00:00:42.079> play<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.260> mouthpiece<00:00:43.440> for<00:00:43.710> many

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
old trusty play this mouthpiece for many

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:59.180 
old trusty play this mouthpiece for many
years<00:00:57.079> but<00:00:58.079> now<00:00:58.230> I'll<00:00:58.410> switch<00:00:58.530> over<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
years but now I'll switch over to the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.700 
years but now I'll switch over to the
Flex<00:01:00.090> mouthpiece<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:02.780> the<00:01:03.780> video<00:01:04.049> microphone

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
Flex mouthpiece and the video microphone

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.100 
Flex mouthpiece and the video microphone
will<00:01:04.890> allow<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.820> should<00:01:06.030> have<00:01:06.150> obviously

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
will allow you should have obviously

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.530 
will allow you should have obviously
here<00:01:07.380> more<00:01:07.590> core<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:09.060> may<00:01:09.180> be<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.330> little

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
here more core and it may be a little

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.469 
here more core and it may be a little
core<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.580> just<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.610> little<00:01:11.790> more<00:01:11.939> sound<00:01:12.270> than

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
core and just a little more sound than

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:25.350 
core and just a little more sound than
on<00:01:13.200> my<00:01:13.470> last<00:01:13.650> box

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.900 

ah<00:01:25.390> I<00:01:26.050> know<00:01:27.010> it's<00:01:27.190> probably<00:01:27.280> hard<00:01:27.520> to<00:01:27.700> tell<00:01:27.880> on

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 
ah I know it's probably hard to tell on

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.030 
ah I know it's probably hard to tell on
the<00:01:28.150> video<00:01:28.240> but<00:01:28.930> this<00:01:29.560> one<00:01:29.770> is<00:01:29.860> definitely

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
the video but this one is definitely

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.700 
the video but this one is definitely
easier<00:01:30.610> to<00:01:30.760> play<00:01:30.970> it<00:01:31.840> just<00:01:32.290> seems<00:01:32.470> like<00:01:32.620> it

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
easier to play it just seems like it

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.460 
easier to play it just seems like it
takes<00:01:32.830> less<00:01:33.130> effort<00:01:33.340> to<00:01:34.090> get<00:01:34.930> more<00:01:34.960> sound

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
takes less effort to get more sound

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.290 
takes less effort to get more sound
which<00:01:35.740> I<00:01:36.070> think<00:01:36.610> that's<00:01:36.760> pretty<00:01:36.880> much<00:01:37.000> what

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
which I think that's pretty much what

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.950 
which I think that's pretty much what
we're<00:01:37.450> all<00:01:37.570> looking<00:01:37.750> for<00:01:38.110> so<00:01:39.600> other<00:01:40.600> than<00:01:40.690> the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
we're all looking for so other than the

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.840 
we're all looking for so other than the
mouthpiece<00:01:41.350> is<00:01:41.530> being<00:01:41.860> close<00:01:42.160> close<00:01:42.640> to<00:01:42.670> the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
mouthpiece is being close close to the

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.700 
mouthpiece is being close close to the
same<00:01:43.060> this<00:01:43.270> does<00:01:43.660> use<00:01:43.810> a<00:01:43.870> coupler<00:01:44.140> system

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
same this does use a coupler system

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.090 
same this does use a coupler system
which<00:01:45.310> means<00:01:45.550> I<00:01:45.760> can<00:01:45.940> adjust<00:01:46.390> how<00:01:47.200> far<00:01:47.590> my<00:01:47.890> gap

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
which means I can adjust how far my gap

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.219 
which means I can adjust how far my gap
is<00:01:48.280> on<00:01:48.400> the<00:01:48.490> horn<00:01:48.700> and<00:01:48.940> we<00:01:49.600> can<00:01:49.780> talk<00:01:49.930> a<00:01:49.960> little

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
is on the horn and we can talk a little

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.450 
is on the horn and we can talk a little
bit<00:01:50.410> more<00:01:50.950> about<00:01:51.190> that<00:01:51.250> in<00:01:51.490> another<00:01:52.180> video
