00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
looks like when its installed now we're

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:59.890 
looks like when its installed now we're
just<00:04:58.580> gonna<00:04:58.790> go<00:04:59.000> take<00:04:59.240> a<00:04:59.300> look<00:04:59.420> at<00:04:59.570> some<00:04:59.720> of<00:04:59.780> the

just gonna go take a look at some of the

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.600 
just gonna go take a look at some of the
software<00:05:00.230> and<00:05:00.350> check<00:05:00.980> out<00:05:01.130> some<00:05:01.160> of<00:05:01.280> the<00:05:01.400> specs

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610

some updates of the website and this is

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.370 
some updates of the website and this is
it<00:05:13.190> I<00:05:13.370> got<00:05:14.030> this<00:05:14.090> program<00:05:14.480> that<00:05:14.630> shows<00:05:14.660> you<00:05:14.960> the

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
it I got this program that shows you the

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.270 
it I got this program that shows you the
specs<00:05:15.650> for<00:05:15.830> the<00:05:15.919> same<00:05:16.280> GPU<00:05:17.080> miss<00:05:18.080> close<00:05:18.320> to<00:05:18.470> 830

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
specs for the same GPU miss close to 830

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.920 
specs for the same GPU miss close to 830
but<00:05:19.430> you<00:05:19.850> can't<00:05:20.150> overcook<00:05:20.540> thinkest<00:05:21.169> up<00:05:21.350> to

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
but you can't overcook thinkest up to

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.650 
but you can't overcook thinkest up to
1050<00:05:23.930> or<00:05:24.200> 1100<00:05:25.160> or<00:05:25.250> something<00:05:25.580> like<00:05:25.669> that<00:05:25.730> and

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
1050 or 1100 or something like that and

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.140 
1050 or 1100 or something like that and
the<00:05:26.840> program<00:05:27.169> that<00:05:27.350> you<00:05:27.470> get<00:05:27.830> to<00:05:28.000> overcook<00:05:29.000> it

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
the program that you get to overcook it

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.500 
the program that you get to overcook it
comes<00:05:29.630> on<00:05:29.840> the<00:05:30.020> CD<00:05:30.380> is<00:05:30.530> msi<00:05:31.100> afterburner<00:05:31.510> good

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
comes on the CD is msi afterburner good

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:33.970 
comes on the CD is msi afterburner good
just<00:05:32.660> use<00:05:32.840> that<00:05:33.050> at<00:05:33.169> all<00:05:33.320> cockatoo<00:05:33.830> where
