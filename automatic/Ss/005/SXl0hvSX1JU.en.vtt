00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.169
 hello at all times today as 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.340
 use the echo extractor so what is 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.439
 what is an extractor a 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.540
 extractor it is a device that allows 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.579
 to break a cylinder or tear off his 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.590
 rotor when the silane is not 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.970
 exceeded in this case it's true 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.680
 we could use a casting 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.190
 classic but then it would have to cut 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.450
 or remove the handle to be able to have a 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.760
 small beats of sydam from to 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.199
 minimum 3 mm and what they say is this 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.269
 called a blackcurrant the shelter so what 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:48.519
 is not the case we will use a 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:49.960
 extractor of 6.1 which therefore allow for 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.600
 locate patient reports 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.339
 then you are using an extractor of 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.039
 silence I do not know if we always 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.899
 need that aims him to extraction levis 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.309
 of extraction are specific lives 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.649
 which comes in three sizes 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.260
 different and which allow to create 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.210
 first a thread inside 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.920
 cylinders to bring a second 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.710
 that a third aims extraction 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.450
 knowing that we will always use the 3rd 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.340
 vice to proceed with the extraction this 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.650
 are special lives that support 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.450
 pressures several tons here as one 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.490
 is on a relatively low cylinder of 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.380
 range that has no security 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.720
 inside against the barÃ§a plays against 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.030
 the case we will just use two 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.740
 screw sizes a first times and 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.390
 then an intermediate size that will be 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.210
 probably enough for 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.870
 extraction so the first operation 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.930
 areva realized for uses case otherwise 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:43.180
 it is the insertion of an extraction screw 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.240
 so the first extraction target is 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.920
 really put in the center of the Sinai in 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.690
 entered two keys she is always a 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.870
 little bit difficult to penetrate 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:57.520
 but once the effect is Free 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.520
 at the second than third height 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.959
 so once I positioned the 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:20.560
 first aims of extraction game there 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:22.209
 simply pops out and then I go to my 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.040
 second tie of screw so there like the 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.390
 threading and creating it's going to go of course 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.390
 much faster for insertion 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.410
 once upon a time my life is 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.900
 properly positioned the process is 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.060
 very simple ever here you see that a 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.980
 little cart that will be caught in the 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:50.110
 screw head so I need to move forward 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:52.269
 between 26 2 the cart like this is 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.900
 now I'm backing it a little bit for 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:58.030
 put unique and in tension this is this 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.340
 is actually I have two possibilities the 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.680
 first manual is simply 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.260
 use a wound to roll back the 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.569
 carriage is broken the rotor the second 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.049
 a little bit faster will consist of 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:13.150
 use a pleaide yes as we already have 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.870
 anyway note drill for 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.910
 the insertion 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.640
 it's not bad to use way 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.680
 systematic the key so there you go 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:31.180
 see the process is going to be extremely 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:33.280
 fast for the blow so the rotor that 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.500
 as you see it to yield to the level of 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.000
 bridge we could proceed to the extraction 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.950
 we have more now than 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.840
 clear the few elements that 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.150
 can still be present at 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.660
 the interior of the sind are here in high 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.070
 heath 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:50.049
 we have the boss you eat cases 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.400
 the sorters are aids while 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.319
 I see 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:58.239
 so glad to release to 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:04:00.280
 the outside twin-cylinder once my 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.349
 free entry I will be able to use 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.239
 a very simple way a wound 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.790
 drive that will allow me to 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:10.359
 open or close 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.069
 of the focused concerned here I hope that it 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:14.640
 want to be interested and I tell you to a 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:14.640
 next exit
