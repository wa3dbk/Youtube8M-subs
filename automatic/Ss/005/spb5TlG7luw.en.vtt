let's<00:02:14.360> compare<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.930> range<00:02:15.140> of<00:02:15.290> wood<00:02:15.440> 55<00:02:16.010> to

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
let's compare the range of wood 55 to

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.030 
let's compare the range of wood 55 to
the<00:02:16.460> Victorinox<00:02:17.090> hunter<00:02:17.510> once<00:02:17.750> again<00:02:18.110> the

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
the Victorinox hunter once again the

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.580 
the Victorinox hunter once again the
difference<00:02:19.490> in<00:02:19.730> size<00:02:20.000> may<00:02:20.420> not<00:02:20.630> be<00:02:20.840> huge<00:02:21.200> but

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
difference in size may not be huge but

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.590 
difference in size may not be huge but
it<00:02:21.710> makes<00:02:21.980> a<00:02:22.190> noticeable<00:02:22.460> difference<00:02:23.000> when

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
it makes a noticeable difference when

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.110 
it makes a noticeable difference when
using<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:24.230> range<00:02:24.440> of<00:02:24.650> wood<00:02:24.770> especially<00:02:25.430> when

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
using the range of wood especially when

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.800 
using the range of wood especially when
using<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.750> saw<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:28.400> larger<00:02:28.790> handle<00:02:29.240> gives

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
using the saw the larger handle gives

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:41.760 
using the saw the larger handle gives
you<00:02:30.020> a<00:02:30.050> solid<00:02:30.380> feel<00:02:33.670> look<00:02:34.670> at<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.940> difference

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.590 

also<00:02:42.770> what<00:02:43.220> I<00:02:43.250> like<00:02:43.520> about<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:44.030> range<00:02:44.240> of<00:02:44.390> wood

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
also what I like about the range of wood

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.730 
also what I like about the range of wood
are<00:02:44.810> these<00:02:45.410> 3d<00:02:46.130> contoured<00:02:46.700> handle<00:02:46.880> scales

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
are these 3d contoured handle scales

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:54.670

they are very comfortable by the way the

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.800 
they are very comfortable by the way the

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.170 
me give you a quick rundown of the tools
let's<00:03:05.270> start<00:03:05.600> with<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.930> blade<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.940> blade

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
let's start with the blade the blade

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.050 
let's start with the blade the blade
comes<00:03:08.510> with<00:03:08.750> a<00:03:08.780> safety<00:03:09.110> lock<00:03:09.580> the<00:03:10.580> lock<00:03:10.730> up<00:03:10.910> is

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
comes with a safety lock the lock up is

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.880 
comes with a safety lock the lock up is
pretty<00:03:11.390> solid<00:03:12.100> no<00:03:13.100> blade<00:03:13.340> play<00:03:13.370> at<00:03:13.700> all

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
pretty solid no blade play at all

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.410 
pretty solid no blade play at all
basically<00:03:15.890> the<00:03:16.220> locking<00:03:16.640> mechanism<00:03:17.209> is<00:03:17.390> a

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
basically the locking mechanism is a

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.630 
basically the locking mechanism is a
liner<00:03:17.750> lock<00:03:18.050> here<00:03:18.739> you<00:03:18.860> can<00:03:19.070> see<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:19.400> liner

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
liner lock here you can see the liner

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.590 
liner lock here you can see the liner
and<00:03:20.080> by<00:03:21.080> pressing<00:03:21.709> on<00:03:21.860> this<00:03:22.100> button<00:03:22.430> you<00:03:22.760> push

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
and by pressing on this button you push

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.970 
and by pressing on this button you push
the<00:03:24.050> liner<00:03:24.290> to<00:03:24.560> the<00:03:24.620> left<00:03:24.920> and<00:03:26.709> that's<00:03:27.709> how<00:03:27.920> you

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
the liner to the left and that's how you

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.430 
the liner to the left and that's how you
disengage<00:03:28.550> the<00:03:29.030> lock<00:03:29.209> again

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:39.270 

then<00:03:33.440> we've<00:03:33.650> got<00:03:33.950> a<00:03:33.980> flathead<00:03:34.580> screwdriver<00:03:35.270> a

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.699 

cap<00:03:40.280> lifter<00:03:40.550> and<00:03:41.380> a<00:03:42.380> wire<00:03:42.590> bender<00:03:43.450> at<00:03:44.709> the

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
cap lifter and a wire bender at the

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.979 
cap lifter and a wire bender at the
opposite<00:03:46.100> end<00:03:46.310> of<00:03:46.430> the<00:03:46.640> handle<00:03:47.060> is<00:03:47.239> the<00:03:47.750> can

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
opposite end of the handle is the can

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:54.070 
opposite end of the handle is the can
opener<00:03:48.470> I<00:03:52.180> have<00:03:53.180> to<00:03:53.360> admit<00:03:53.600> though<00:03:53.810> that<00:03:53.840> I

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
opener I have to admit though that I

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.900 
opener I have to admit though that I
prefer<00:03:54.620> the<00:03:54.800> Victorian<00:03:55.250> lock<00:03:55.340> style<00:03:55.610> can

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
prefer the Victorian lock style can

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.449 
prefer the Victorian lock style can
opener<00:03:56.360> maybe<00:03:57.019> it's<00:03:57.260> because<00:03:57.440> I'm<00:03:57.860> used<00:03:58.130> to<00:03:58.250> it

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
opener maybe it's because I'm used to it

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.880 
opener maybe it's because I'm used to it
when<00:03:59.330> you<00:03:59.480> use<00:03:59.690> the<00:04:00.019> Victorian<00:04:00.470> Hawks<00:04:00.620> can

when you use the Victorian Hawks can
open<00:04:01.220> up<00:04:01.340> you<00:04:01.820> push<00:04:02.060> it<00:04:02.269> forward<00:04:02.870> away<00:04:03.380> from

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
open up you push it forward away from

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.490 
open up you push it forward away from
yourself<00:04:04.209> but<00:04:05.209> with<00:04:05.420> the<00:04:05.630> Wrangell<00:04:05.959> style<00:04:06.260> can
