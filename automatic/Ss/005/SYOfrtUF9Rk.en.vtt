00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 
instead of going all the way you're just

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.830 
instead of going all the way you're just
doing<00:03:38.620> from<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:38.950> middle<00:03:39.370> back<00:03:40.000> unlike<00:03:40.659> the

outwards into it even for music fill it

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.599 
outwards into it even for music fill it
in<00:03:55.659> using<00:03:56.079> even<00:03:56.290> strokes<00:03:56.799> and<00:03:57.069> reshape<00:03:57.459> the

the<00:04:06.769> last<00:04:07.249> technique<00:04:07.760> is<00:04:08.540> called<00:04:08.780> before<00:04:09.769> I

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.300 

for<00:04:14.810> this<00:04:14.930> application<00:04:15.109> you<00:04:15.829> start<00:04:16.100> with<00:04:16.190> the

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
for this application you start with the

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.490 
for this application you start with the
line<00:04:16.519> on<00:04:16.880> the<00:04:17.030> opposite<00:04:17.389> of<00:04:17.449> your<00:04:17.660> eye<00:04:17.810> you

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
line on the opposite of your eye you

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.319 
line on the opposite of your eye you
draw<00:04:18.709> another<00:04:18.949> line<00:04:19.070> from<00:04:19.519> the<00:04:19.579> inside<00:04:20.030> and

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
draw another line from the inside and

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.240 
draw another line from the inside and
work<00:04:20.599> your<00:04:20.750> way<00:04:20.810> outwards<00:04:21.410> to<00:04:21.769> connect<00:04:22.099> the

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
work your way outwards to connect the
