more extensively on coffee time but

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.550 
more extensively on coffee time but
essentially<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.410> fell<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.510> landed<00:00:24.560> kneecap

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
excruciating and I thought for sure that

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.910 
excruciating and I thought for sure that
the<00:00:32.910> pain<00:00:33.180> go<00:00:33.450> after<00:00:33.840> like<00:00:34.020> an<00:00:34.140> hour<00:00:34.320> or<00:00:34.710> at<00:00:34.800> the

the pain go after like an hour or at the
very<00:00:34.950> least<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.370> would<00:00:35.460> just<00:00:35.550> be<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.730> little<00:00:35.940> bit

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
very least it would just be a little bit

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.440 
very least it would just be a little bit
sore<00:00:36.360> um<00:00:36.690> it's<00:00:37.620> like<00:00:37.800> still<00:00:38.340> hard<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.879> walk<00:00:39.090> so

fingers<00:00:40.110> crossed<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.980> gets<00:00:41.190> itself

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
fingers crossed that that gets itself

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.369 
fingers crossed that that gets itself
sorted<00:00:42.090> out<00:00:42.180> so<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.570> don't<00:00:42.660> have<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.989> go<00:00:43.020> to

totally up to you but I would say you do
some<00:01:31.079> research<00:01:31.200> maybe<00:01:31.619> wait<00:01:31.890> for<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.189> couple

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
some research maybe wait for a couple

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.819 
some research maybe wait for a couple
more<00:01:32.640> updates<00:01:33.150> before<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.840> do<00:01:34.110> because<00:01:34.530> it's

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
more updates before you do because it's

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.010 
more updates before you do because it's
so<00:01:35.220> vague<00:01:35.520> right<00:01:35.820> now<00:01:35.970> it's<00:01:36.210> just<00:01:36.420> weird<00:01:36.689> any
