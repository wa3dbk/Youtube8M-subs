band that needs to be sized down so what

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.029 
band that needs to be sized down so what
I<00:00:20.760> did<00:00:21.210> was<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.630> cut<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:21.960> piece<00:00:22.050> out<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.710> it

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
I did was I cut a piece out of it

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.480 
I did was I cut a piece out of it
and<00:00:23.420> now<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.900> first<00:00:25.170> thing<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.560> have<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.980> do<00:00:26.189> is

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
and now the first thing I have to do is

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.359 
and now the first thing I have to do is
bring<00:00:26.939> these<00:00:27.210> two<00:00:27.449> pieces<00:00:27.689> together<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.650> I'm

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
bring these two pieces together and I'm

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.609 
bring these two pieces together and I'm
going<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.609> use<00:00:29.849> some<00:00:30.119> specialty<00:00:31.109> bending

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
going to use some specialty bending

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:40.130 
going to use some specialty bending
pliers<00:00:38.090> to<00:00:39.090> bring<00:00:39.329> these<00:00:39.480> two<00:00:39.719> pieces<00:00:39.960> of

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
pliers to bring these two pieces of

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:51.340 
pliers to bring these two pieces of
metal<00:00:40.290> together<00:00:46.070> so<00:00:47.070> it's<00:00:47.280> like<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:49.670> now

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
metal together so it's like that now

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.900 
metal together so it's like that now
we've<00:00:52.350> got<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.620> good<00:00:52.860> smooth<00:00:53.579> line<00:00:54.000> here<00:00:54.420> okay

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
we've got a good smooth line here okay

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.670 
we've got a good smooth line here okay
the<00:00:56.910> very<00:00:57.180> first<00:00:57.510> thing<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:57.930> want<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.199> do<00:00:58.410> when

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
the very first thing you want to do when

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.029 
the very first thing you want to do when
you're<00:00:58.800> soldering<00:00:59.160> gold<00:00:59.699> is<00:01:00.500> you<00:01:01.500> want<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.800> dip

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
you're soldering gold is you want to dip

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.189 
you're soldering gold is you want to dip
your<00:01:02.250> ring<00:01:02.520> in<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.879> solution<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.510> boric<00:01:03.989> acid

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
your ring in a solution of boric acid

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.980 
your ring in a solution of boric acid
and<00:01:04.650> alcohol<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.489> then<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.450> want<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.750> light

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
and alcohol and then you want to light

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.440 
and alcohol and then you want to light
it<00:01:09.080> what<00:01:10.080> this<00:01:10.470> does<00:01:10.890> boric<00:01:11.580> acid<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
it what this does boric acid is the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.450 
it what this does boric acid is the
white<00:01:12.720> compound<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.530> see<00:01:13.920> on<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.250> ring

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
white compound that you see on the ring

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.770 
white compound that you see on the ring
and<00:01:14.760> boric<00:01:15.600> acid<00:01:16.490> keeps<00:01:17.570> oxidation<00:01:18.570> from

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
and boric acid keeps oxidation from

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.410 
and boric acid keeps oxidation from
occurring<00:01:19.409> everywhere<00:01:20.340> except<00:01:20.909> where<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.240> do

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
occurring everywhere except where you do

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.230 
occurring everywhere except where you do
your<00:01:21.600> solder<00:01:21.900> work<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:23.159> don't<00:01:23.369> mind<00:01:23.790> if<00:01:24.060> it

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
your solder work and I don't mind if it

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.330 
your solder work and I don't mind if it
oxidizes<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.229> diss<00:01:25.409> colors<00:01:25.860> right<00:01:26.130> here

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
oxidizes and diss colors right here

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.740 
oxidizes and diss colors right here
where<00:01:26.549> I'm<00:01:26.640> going<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.939> solder<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.420> because<00:01:27.720> I

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
where I'm going to solder it because I

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.140 
where I'm going to solder it because I
have<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:27.990> clean<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.500> polish<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:28.860> anyway<00:01:29.460> but

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
have to clean and polish that anyway but

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.819 
have to clean and polish that anyway but
I<00:01:30.180> really<00:01:30.720> don't<00:01:30.930> want<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.200> clean<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:31.650> polish

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
I really don't want to clean and polish

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.219 
I really don't want to clean and polish
everything<00:01:32.670> else<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.390> that's<00:01:33.930> what<00:01:34.110> the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
everything else and that's what the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.819 
everything else and that's what the
boric<00:01:34.500> acid<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:35.009> alcohol<00:01:35.400> does<00:01:35.990> so<00:01:36.990> next

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
boric acid and alcohol does so next

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.999 
boric acid and alcohol does so next
thing<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.189> I'm<00:01:38.369> going<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.579> put<00:01:38.820> my<00:01:39.000> green<00:01:39.329> flux

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
thing is I'm going to put my green flux

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.780 
thing is I'm going to put my green flux
on<00:01:41.270> the<00:01:42.270> joint<00:01:42.649> which<00:01:43.649> helps<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.100> solder<00:01:44.369> flow

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
on the joint which helps the solder flow

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.830 
on the joint which helps the solder flow
and<00:01:46.369> then<00:01:47.369> I'm<00:01:47.579> going<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.270> take<00:01:48.570> my<00:01:50.329> 14<00:01:51.329> karat

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
and then I'm going to take my 14 karat

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.330 
and then I'm going to take my 14 karat
yellow<00:01:52.020> gold<00:01:52.700> ez-flo<00:01:53.700> plum<00:01:54.360> solder<00:01:55.100> I'm<00:01:56.100> going

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
yellow gold ez-flo plum solder I'm going

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.310 
yellow gold ez-flo plum solder I'm going
to<00:01:56.399> flow<00:01:56.939> my<00:01:57.119> solder<00:01:57.420> in<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.659> ball<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.079> pick<00:01:58.290> it

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
to flow my solder in a ball and pick it

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.319 
to flow my solder in a ball and pick it
up<00:01:58.530> on<00:01:58.710> my<00:01:58.890> solder<00:01:59.130> pick<00:01:59.460> like<00:01:59.700> this<00:02:02.329> you

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
up on my solder pick like this you

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.609 
up on my solder pick like this you
always<00:02:03.630> have<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.930> remember<00:02:03.990> when<00:02:04.469> you're

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
always have to remember when you're

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.600 
always have to remember when you're
soldering<00:02:04.979> gold<00:02:05.880> or<00:02:06.299> silver<00:02:06.540> or<00:02:06.960> platinum

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
soldering gold or silver or platinum

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.059 
soldering gold or silver or platinum
that<00:02:08.610> heat<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.300> going<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.810> go<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.619> coldest

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
that heat is going to go to the coldest

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.790 
that heat is going to go to the coldest
point<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:11.790> if<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.120> put<00:02:12.540> my<00:02:12.750> torch<00:02:13.080> here

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
point so if I put my torch here

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.700 
point so if I put my torch here
all<00:02:14.160> of<00:02:14.460> my<00:02:14.670> heat<00:02:15.000> is<00:02:15.270> going<00:02:16.080> down<00:02:16.290> here

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
all of my heat is going down here

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.610 
all of my heat is going down here
because<00:02:17.550> this<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.330> coldest<00:02:18.750> point<00:02:19.020> well

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
because this is the coldest point well

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.850 
because this is the coldest point well
because<00:02:20.070> I<00:02:20.280> want<00:02:20.580> control<00:02:20.850> up<00:02:21.540> here<00:02:22.020> I<00:02:22.170> want

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
because I want control up here I want

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.340 
because I want control up here I want
this<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.970> be<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.240> coldest<00:02:24.630> point<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.140> Ring

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
this to be the coldest point of the Ring

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.310 
this to be the coldest point of the Ring
so<00:02:26.010> this<00:02:26.520> is<00:02:26.790> where<00:02:27.000> I'll<00:02:27.120> put<00:02:27.360> my<00:02:27.570> torch<00:02:27.870> last

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
so this is where I'll put my torch last

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.300 
so this is where I'll put my torch last
not<00:02:28.890> first<00:02:29.340> so<00:02:30.210> what<00:02:30.390> I'm<00:02:30.510> going<00:02:30.630> to<00:02:30.690> do<00:02:31.160> is<00:02:32.160> I'm

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
not first so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.000 
not first so what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.520> come<00:02:32.730> down<00:02:32.940> here<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:34.680> I'm<00:02:34.800> going<00:02:34.950> to

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
going to come down here and I'm going to

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.010 
going to come down here and I'm going to
heat<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.280> bottom<00:02:35.610> of<00:02:35.700> this<00:02:35.820> up<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:36.900> can

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
heat the bottom of this up and you can

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.050 
heat the bottom of this up and you can
see<00:02:37.200> my<00:02:37.380> flux<00:02:37.680> starting<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.250> bubble<00:02:38.430> up<00:02:38.730> on<00:02:38.910> the

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
see my flux starting to bubble up on the

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.740 
see my flux starting to bubble up on the
top<00:02:39.270> here<00:02:39.600> so<00:02:40.370> once<00:02:41.370> all<00:02:41.550> of<00:02:41.610> this<00:02:41.910> is<00:02:41.970> hot

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
top here so once all of this is hot

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.590 
top here so once all of this is hot
now<00:02:43.560> I'm<00:02:43.950> going<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.280> be<00:02:44.370> able<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:44.790> control<00:02:45.270> what

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
now I'm going to be able to control what

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.900 
now I'm going to be able to control what
I'm<00:02:45.720> doing<00:02:46.110> up<00:02:46.290> here<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:47.280> I'm<00:02:47.370> going<00:02:47.520> to<00:02:47.610> put<00:02:47.790> my

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
I'm doing up here so I'm going to put my

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.070 
I'm doing up here so I'm going to put my
solder<00:02:48.240> on<00:02:48.540> here<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:50.330> now<00:02:51.330> watch<00:02:51.660> it<00:02:51.900> it's

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
solder on here and now watch it it's

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.810 
solder on here and now watch it it's
just<00:02:52.380> going<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.680> all<00:02:52.890> of<00:02:53.070> a<00:02:53.130> sudden<00:02:53.550> it's<00:02:53.730> just

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
just going to all of a sudden it's just

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.690 
just going to all of a sudden it's just
going<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.240> disappear<00:02:55.250> I'm<00:02:56.250> going<00:02:56.490> to<00:02:56.550> make

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
going to disappear I'm going to make

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.940 
going to disappear I'm going to make
sure<00:02:56.850> I<00:02:56.910> get<00:02:57.150> both<00:02:57.390> sides<00:02:57.630> of<00:02:57.930> my<00:02:58.140> ring<00:02:58.380> equally

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
sure I get both sides of my ring equally

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.700 
sure I get both sides of my ring equally
hot<00:02:59.160> and<00:02:59.840> there<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.990> solder<00:03:01.260> went<00:03:01.530> through

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
hot and there the solder went through

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.890 
hot and there the solder went through
the<00:03:01.830> joint<00:03:02.130> now<00:03:02.400> if<00:03:02.880> I<00:03:03.000> pull<00:03:03.330> my<00:03:03.630> torch

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
the joint now if I pull my torch

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.250 
the joint now if I pull my torch
underneath<00:03:08.120> solder<00:03:09.120> goes<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.840> hottest

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
underneath solder goes to the hottest

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.070 
underneath solder goes to the hottest
point<00:03:10.500> so<00:03:11.400> if<00:03:11.550> I<00:03:11.700> make<00:03:12.000> under<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.630> ring<00:03:12.840> the

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
point so if I make under the ring the

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.770 
point so if I make under the ring the
hottest<00:03:13.440> point<00:03:13.650> my<00:03:13.950> solder<00:03:14.310> will<00:03:15.000> flow<00:03:15.420> all

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
hottest point my solder will flow all

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.140 
hottest point my solder will flow all
the<00:03:15.840> way<00:03:16.560> through<00:03:16.830> that<00:03:17.010> joint<00:03:17.250> just<00:03:17.730> like<00:03:17.970> it

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
the way through that joint just like it

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:26.870 
the way through that joint just like it
did<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:19.290> now<00:03:22.550> if<00:03:23.550> you<00:03:23.670> look<00:03:23.700> at<00:03:24.030> it<00:03:24.620> that<00:03:25.620> is<00:03:26.040> a

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
did and now if you look at it that is a

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
did and now if you look at it that is a
very<00:03:27.480> clean<00:03:28.020> solder<00:03:28.590> joint<00:03:29.040> so<00:03:29.820> let's<00:03:30.360> dip<00:03:30.720> it

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
very clean solder joint so let's dip it

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.070 
very clean solder joint so let's dip it
in<00:03:30.990> the<00:03:31.050> boric<00:03:31.350> acid<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:31.950> cool<00:03:32.130> it<00:03:35.780> let's<00:03:36.780> tap

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
in the boric acid and cool it let's tap

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:51.380 
in the boric acid and cool it let's tap
it<00:03:37.260> round<00:03:48.230> now<00:03:49.230> as<00:03:49.440> you<00:03:49.560> can<00:03:49.650> see<00:03:50.150> that<00:03:51.150> it's

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
it round now as you can see that it's

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.770 
it round now as you can see that it's
discolored<00:03:51.990> right<00:03:52.440> here<00:03:53.210> but<00:03:54.210> nowhere<00:03:54.720> else

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
discolored right here but nowhere else

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.940 
discolored right here but nowhere else
on<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.350> ring<00:03:55.820> is<00:03:57.140> it<00:03:58.140> discolored<00:03:58.650> this<00:03:58.800> is

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
on the ring is it discolored this is

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.590 
on the ring is it discolored this is
just<00:03:59.220> some<00:03:59.340> boric<00:03:59.640> acid<00:03:59.760> which<00:04:00.120> will<00:04:00.270> come<00:04:00.420> off

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
just some boric acid which will come off

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.740 
just some boric acid which will come off
here<00:04:00.780> on<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:00.960> polishing<00:04:01.500> but<00:04:02.130> now<00:04:02.570> what<00:04:03.570> we

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
here on the polishing but now what we

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.770 
here on the polishing but now what we
want<00:04:03.960> to<00:04:04.050> do<00:04:04.490> is<00:04:05.490> let's<00:04:05.790> run<00:04:05.970> a<00:04:06.000> file<00:04:06.330> across

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
want to do is let's run a file across

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.660 
want to do is let's run a file across
that<00:04:07.050> and<00:04:07.110> see<00:04:07.410> what<00:04:07.560> it<00:04:07.650> looks<00:04:07.830> like<00:04:09.500> and<00:04:10.500> that

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
that and see what it looks like and that

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.200 
that and see what it looks like and that
is<00:04:11.670> how<00:04:11.910> you<00:04:11.970> solder<00:04:12.300> gold<00:04:12.720> jewelry
