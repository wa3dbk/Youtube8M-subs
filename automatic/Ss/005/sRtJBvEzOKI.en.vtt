00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:12.450
 the theory of one's brain the theory 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:16.660
 of the tribe brain is not a proposition 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.120
 developed in the year 1970 by the 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:23.020
 American doctor and neuroscientist 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:25.990
 paul mclean with which he sought to explain 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.660
 how the brain responds to traces 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.070
 of the evolutionary process is to say to their 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.280
 most basic structures 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.110
 according to this theory the brain that 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.770
 It is integrated by three systems 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.900
 neurons interconnected with each other that 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.059
 have evolved through the 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.019
 history shaped layers 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:50.989
 they overlap such neuronal systems 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:53.870
 they are called reptilian complex 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:57.720
 or brain reptile brain mammal 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:01.710
 political and neocortex 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:05.200
 reptilian complex or reptilian brain 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.290
 represents 5% of brain volume 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:11.140
 of the reptilian brain has as a function 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.870
 advocate for survival because of what 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.320
 which acts quickly mechanical and 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:21.250
 unconscious from two reflexes to 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.620
 work or wii and it manifests in 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.230
 automatic survival behaviors 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.800
 like breathing or heartbeat 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:32.200
 heart the reptilian brain presents 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.170
 resistance to change and do not learn 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.210
 of the errors is called reptilian because 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.170
 that in the case of reptiles is this 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.740
 brain who controls their act 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.860
 mammalian or limbic brain represents the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.380
 10% of brain volume controls the 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.110
 emotive life allows us to classify 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.140
 new experiences in pleasant and 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.539
 unpleasant this is for or in 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.210
 against survival is 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:03.000
 conformed among other components by 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.149
 the brain amygdala the hypothalamus and 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.220
 we push between its functions you can 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.519
 highlight the evaluation of information 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.739
 obtained from the learning environment and the 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:17.430
 declarative memory covers its 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:19.350
 expressions like love and hate 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.540
 nheo cuts 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.570
 It represents 85 percent of the volume 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.840
 brain and differentiates the human being from 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:32.200
 the other species is composed of two 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.240
 hemispheres the left and the right 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.610
 being the first in charge of the 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.850
 rational functions like thinking 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.760
 logical symbolic and the second 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.740
 related to creativity and art 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.380
 has functions such as planning 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.840
 strategies reason the taking of 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.630
 conscious decisions and communication 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.210
 through structured language 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.640
 the information processing that 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.970
 involves the three brains is given 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.340
 the following way a stimulus affects 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.460
 the senses of the human being and this 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.950
 information product of the stimulus arrives 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:13.100
 up to the thalamus then going through the 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.610
 neocortex and from this to the amygdala 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:19.569
 brain which triggers an emotion 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.790
 or an action 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:25.269
 It is worth clarifying that the 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.219
 neuroscientist joseph ledoux proposed 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.730
 that on certain occasions the 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:33.670
 information does not go through the neocortex 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:37.100
 but it travels directly from the thalamus 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:40.100
 towards the cerebral amygdala 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.100
