00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
other youtubers i only really covered me

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.130 
other youtubers i only really covered me
to<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.700> last<00:02:20.909> couple<00:02:21.239> days<00:02:21.390> up<00:02:21.569> until<00:02:21.659> it<00:02:21.930> was

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140
