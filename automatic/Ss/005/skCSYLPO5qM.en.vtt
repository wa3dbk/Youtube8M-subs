00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.970
 how about friends again welcome to 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.280
 the blue tips this time I'm going to 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.900
 present a mask that is quite a 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.580
 super novelty release that in addition to 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.410
 that has color is terrific how can 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.870
 realize that it is the ultra mask 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.970
 good light because not only this has 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.760
 very good qualities because it has 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.100
 specifications each each color you 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.020
 gives a specification of a treatment 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.730
 different is to say they are masks of 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.070
 eyelashes that help you as any 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.740
 Mascara to give as more 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.660
 volume to swell but not only 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.460
 that each one has a treatment because 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.130
 they have vita proteins this means 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.040
 which are added with different 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.440
 elements that help us correct and 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.570
 help different problems that then 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.550
 we all have with the tabs to what 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.260
 better that we have them dry short 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.240
 that do not grow us and other good because 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.979
 each of the seven different colors 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.659
 help us correct some of these 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.180
 problems for example one here 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.130
 appeared very novel is the mask of 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.740
 orange eyelashes which 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.240
 contains snail slime and biotin that 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.850
 they are very novel ingredients because 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.320
 good they help you to elasticity and 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.270
 moisturizing the eyelashes in addition to 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.039
 that left the protective layer which 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.600
 helps us to protect the tab of the 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.030
 environment of all these 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.220
 inclement weather now with the 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.929
 ultraviolet rays and others good then 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.729
 for the girls sandro because they feel 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:58.220
 What is your problem with the mask? 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.470
 orange is the ideal and so each of 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.450
 the colors have different types of 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.549
 protein vitamins and they help us 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.549
 correct this very specific problems 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.849
 very good friends now yes let's go 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.290
 directly with the topic that will be 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.090
 very fun because we are going to use 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.549
 two different shades of black eyelashes 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.260
 with purple as such and for this I have to 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.420
 for gorgeous that will accompany me today 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.310
 to be able to show you this 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.359
 this guy who must be very father and 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.969
 Well what we are going to do is use 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:35.829
 first the purple-colored mask that 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:37.450
 indeed it is also purple 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.909
 a different from the difference of 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.609
 other six colors than all the others 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:44.799
 they are black ok but the abode is purple and 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:47.409
 what we are going to do is that we are going to 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.939
 saturate the eyelashes with this brush 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:51.189
 which is also very good towards 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:54.180
 I will also comment below 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:57.010
 something this ultra eyelash mask the 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.299
 has a different brush to the rest of 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.889
 the brushes that you already know about 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.250
 the masks of go to paul cosmetics 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:04.780
 this service is called max and what it does 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.230
 is that it helps us to raise from a 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.699
 way much better lashes saturate 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.100
 the ones in a way that we have left 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:14.380
 very much thicker 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.610
 and it also gives us a much more 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.380
 long ok 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.020
 remember to always comment from the root 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.150
 and go up towards the tip 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.520
 in this way and he will also be happy 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.430
 a little touch on the top of 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.980
 suddenly ok this way we will be able to 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.640
 Give that super purple color effect 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.550
 father 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.709
 and it will be very nice to us very well 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.740
 now how can the eye realize 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.980
 has this look and feel and now what 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:45.680
 what I'm going to do is use another mask 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.450
 another ultra light mask now I'm going to 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.750
 use the yellow that for example in this 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.240
 If the novelty of this mask 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.400
 eyelashes then that one that has collagen and 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.590
 vitamin e then you can 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.330
 identify perfectly well what 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.610
 quality is what they are looking for which 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.440
 is the one they already liked and do not have to 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.810
 say hour and a half that you have collagen and 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.980
 vitamin e and others if not nothing else the 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.590
 yellow ok 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.600
 because each of the colors has 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.940
 different properties different view 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.890
 proteins very well and now what are we going 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.380
 to do the effect is let's saturate 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.180
 perfectly good eyelashes but 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.150
 only from the part of the tail of the 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.700
 little eye of the eye this will help us 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.340
 give an aspect of one eye much more 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:32.480
 elongated a little bit much more 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.220
 elongated and almond-shaped very well and the 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.480
 purple effect will be left at the center 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.370
 that at the same time that is going to give us 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.410
 a thick effect 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.630
 also a very funny touch when not 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.190
 They want to use shadows because they do not 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.320
 he wants you to give them that little touch of 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.490
 color that looks very chic for the day and 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.490
 for any time ok 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.410
 good friends so they thought the guy 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:57.050
 it's a very fast and very creative way 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.940
 to be able to give a change a turn to this 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.949
 issue of being able to give life to our 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.510
 eyelashes and not only that not only 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:03.979
 to combine the two colors but 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.160
 also one thing that they have to remember 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:08.330
 is that basically each of the 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.100
 ingredients that contain these 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.229
 different mascara tabs are 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.090
 made and designed exactly with the 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.800
 purpose of growing the eyelashes 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.199
 like all those products there 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.880
 that is why they are growing 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:22.100
 the tabs but these make them 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.289
 natural way because they are treatments 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.870
 ok then what they do is basically 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:28.400
 that prolong the life of your lashes 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.620
 allowing them to achieve their maximum 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.660
 long when they are in your eye remember 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.880
 that lashes pretty much last in 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.229
 our eye around three months and 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.970
 well many times we fall 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:40.220
 before this is because of the lack of 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.320
 protein vitamins and others and good 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.470
 because this mask other just what 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.660
 that attacks is that 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.340
 vitamins and proteins containing the 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.720
 which will help us prolong the 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.000
 life of our eyelashes and achieve the 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.350
 maximum length when we have them in 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.350
 our ojito very well 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.080
