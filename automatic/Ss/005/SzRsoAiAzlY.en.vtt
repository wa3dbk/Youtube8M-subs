00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
looks really bad it's hard to see it's

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.520 
looks really bad it's hard to see it's
very<00:01:29.430> blurry<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> little<00:01:30.990> different

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
very blurry this is a little different

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.669 
very blurry this is a little different
it's<00:01:31.740> not<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.039> bad<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.970> can<00:01:33.149> watch<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.679> it

00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:34.679 
it's not that bad you can watch it it

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:36.710 
it's not that bad you can watch it it
looks<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.460> doesn't<00:01:35.880> look<00:01:36.000> quite<00:01:36.179> like<00:01:36.450> high

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
looks it doesn't look quite like high

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.080 
looks it doesn't look quite like high
def<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.140> looks<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.439> little<00:01:37.740> fuzzy<00:01:38.130> but<00:01:38.340> it's

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
def it looks a little fuzzy but it's

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.460 
def it looks a little fuzzy but it's
hard<00:01:39.330> to<00:01:39.360> tell<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.689> difference<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:40.170> pretty

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
hard to tell the difference is pretty

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.529 
hard to tell the difference is pretty
clear<00:01:40.829> image<00:01:41.189> now<00:01:41.880> when<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.090> put<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.299> glasses

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
clear image now when you put the glasses

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:44.270 
clear image now when you put the glasses
on<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:43.049> gets<00:01:43.170> much<00:01:43.380> better<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:44.100> can

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
on it gets much better you can

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.249 
on it gets much better you can
definitely<00:01:44.670> see<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.880> 3d<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:45.960> it's<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.140> pretty

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
definitely see the 3d so it's a pretty

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.080 
definitely see the 3d so it's a pretty
good<00:01:46.500> technology<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.250> guess<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.700> know<00:01:47.820> if<00:01:47.970> you

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
good technology I guess you know if you

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.749 
good technology I guess you know if you
only<00:01:48.210> have<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:49.229> 04<00:01:49.799> pair<00:01:50.069> of<00:01:50.130> glasses<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.640> a

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
could watch it 3d and some of them can

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.139 
could watch it 3d and some of them can
just<00:01:54.810> watch<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.530> regular<00:01:55.679> way<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.939> son
