00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.169
 well that everyone is 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.120
 extract put today we end up 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:16.160
 for a new tutorial on minecraft 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.470
 so I hope you're fine 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.210
 for my part it's okay and so 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.960
 today I present to you is a 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.160
 software that will facilitate you 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.619
 installing any vote that the 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.310
 desire and who is on the software all 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.470
 simply so among others bat thomas 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.550
 said m and so for what they had 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:40.309
 problems now you are going to be 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:41.829
 with edgar, you're just fine 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.899
 install we'll say I do not know how 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.460
 to say that's good it's going to be super simple is 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:46.820
 so where aging in this 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.969
 video 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.530
 and so here I knew I will 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.899
 asked how I will show you 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.809
 how to install really is 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.359
 in we're going to say that now everything 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.769
 that they had already installed before and 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.969
 well everything you do well 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.890
 it's the software that will do it so 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.930
 basically it's practically nothing to do 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.409
 you go into the description so there 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.000
 where there is the most skiing to read so 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.799
 logically there will be no bugs done 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.939
 a very small description with all 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.170
 those small bilingual so me I 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:15.530
 the cold media issue which is the 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.380
 problem 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.420
 so once downloaded it looks like 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.420
 you see that it's much more see 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.060
 thanks and so you open it problem of 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.860
 covetousness compatibility it's not 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.180
 serious we run it I do not know what 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.700
 that they ask you at the beginning I 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.840
 removed it does not matter the virus steps 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.579
 are more worried because they have 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.220
 that once opened it looks like that 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.000
 so we choose it's your version 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.549
 spent enough to change version 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.990
 silver which is pretty good and so 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.899
 there you go in the fashion category 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.079
 and then you find everything manidem so 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:51.480
 everyone loves you a needle 1.3.2 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:53.520
 I think most comes from the water 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.230
 this is the last version you have at 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.730
 worst you will change version here 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:01.440
 or change too many times 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.670
 so it's simple like everything so see 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.830
 your pretty on minecraft 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.770
 good I connects made to eat the 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.220
 paid version here I am on the mode 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.190
 solo he's not there we have 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.440
 super I press the key to the so the 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.090
 key or to deactivate or activate 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.260
 and I know if you hear it 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.760
 of course he knew it nothing but his 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.020
 fiction we agree 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:28.110
 the names now we do that like 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.030
 to leave I just know how to leave 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.670
 now here is where you 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.160
 select what you want and whose 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.720
 you press on install and there 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.310
 you can make a backup of 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.830
 your current installation smokes this 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.250
 which is marked you do it or not in 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.960
 less at home we will try training here 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.510
 so everything you do before with 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.710
 will undermine all this to decompress here and there 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.690
 it's the software that will do it and 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.420
 much faster it's really 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.990
 something really nice I'm going 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:03.630
 not you just have to open thugs 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:04.830
 you will see that I have everything going so 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.110
 of course all the problems of 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.550
 compatibility with cracked version 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.830
 stay the same huh does not make strong south 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.690
 alps otherwise it'll all of you take you off 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.820
 this is normal and you will see that you 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.200
 as wipes or internal beautiful 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.989
 installed 2 3 seconds 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.850
 it's really nice serious I think 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.400
 that it is really a software that 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:27.270
 someone did well to 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:31.770
 do something that makes it easier 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:34.650
 to say it's really nice so nice and 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.420
 so here I hope you like it 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.370
 especially for those who do not have it 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.160
 installed and so after all the bugs in 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.070
 line it stays the same it's normal 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:48.630
 just makes it easy just facilities 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:50.550
 sorry if I want a little bit so all 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.960
 the other bugs it stays the same so if 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.460
 you have the bug online 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.230
 after there will be just to see them 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.520
 start a video where to find his game you 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.270
 will put everything in the description 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:03.150
 so if you have cracked and there you have to 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.490
 uncheck strong south is here after 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.990
 do not forget to remove a medal 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.750
 that's the software that does not 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.760
 me not involved against his pump fashion 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.590
 the smell I do not know if there is it 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.739
 gone for a job all sought to be there 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.270
 nothing therefore does not have each version 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.790
 after they are not necessarily all 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:23.580
 lille I do not think there is at worst 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.630
 it does not matter I do not think you 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.790
 will need it works 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.340
 at worst it does not work she will you 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.010
 try to logically install it's going 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.290

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:35.670
