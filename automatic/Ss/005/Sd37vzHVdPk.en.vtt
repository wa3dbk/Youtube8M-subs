00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
and give you a walkthrough of the three

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.259 
and give you a walkthrough of the three
different<00:00:39.239> input<00:00:39.510> devices<00:00:40.909> first<00:00:41.909> we<00:00:42.059> tried

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.269 
different input devices first we tried

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:44.809 
different input devices first we tried
the<00:00:42.449> s-pen<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.980> turns<00:00:44.249> out<00:00:44.429> to<00:00:44.460> be<00:00:44.579> my

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:44.819 
the s-pen and that turns out to be my

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:47.630 
the s-pen and that turns out to be my
favorite<00:00:45.300> way<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.510> play<00:00:46.190> even<00:00:47.190> though<00:00:47.460> there's

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
favorite way to play even though there's

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.700 
favorite way to play even though there's
not<00:00:47.789> official<00:00:48.239> support<00:00:48.659> for<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:49.199> and<00:00:49.409> draw

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
not official support for it and draw

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.979 
not official support for it and draw
something<00:00:50.010> it's<00:00:50.640> still<00:00:51.089> the<00:00:51.479> most<00:00:51.690> accurate

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
something it's still the most accurate

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.020 
something it's still the most accurate
you<00:00:52.829> can<00:00:52.859> see<00:00:53.399> where<00:00:54.089> you're<00:00:54.479> touching<00:00:56.030> even

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
you can see where you're touching even

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.759 
you can see where you're touching even
though<00:00:57.210> it's<00:00:57.449> like<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> millimeter<00:00:58.019> off<00:00:58.409> from

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
though it's like a millimeter off from

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:00.349 
though it's like a millimeter off from
where<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.219> feel<00:00:59.639> like<00:00:59.940> you're<00:01:00.149> actually

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
where you feel like you're actually

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.009 
where you feel like you're actually
touching<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.229> it's<00:01:01.920> still<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.460> most<00:01:03.019> fluid

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
touching it it's still the most fluid

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.600 
touching it it's still the most fluid
way<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.259> draw<00:01:05.149> and<00:01:06.149> then<00:01:06.659> we<00:01:06.899> have<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.610> the

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
way to draw and then we have the the

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.800 
way to draw and then we have the the
Adonit<00:01:09.060> jot<00:01:09.119> Pro<00:01:09.329> and<00:01:10.399> it's<00:01:11.399> pretty<00:01:12.299> similar

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
Adonit jot Pro and it's pretty similar

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.100 
Adonit jot Pro and it's pretty similar
to<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.140> s-pen<00:01:13.740> but<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.460> found<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.689> had<00:01:16.079> a

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
to the s-pen but I found that it had a

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.649 
to the s-pen but I found that it had a
hard<00:01:16.409> time<00:01:16.469> whenever<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.100> was<00:01:17.310> tapping<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:18.119> don't

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
hard time whenever I was tapping I don't

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.270 
hard time whenever I was tapping I don't
know<00:01:18.780> why<00:01:18.960> but<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.350> seems<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.860> have<00:01:20.039> a<00:01:20.070> lot<00:01:20.250> of

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
know why but it seems to have a lot of

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.330 
know why but it seems to have a lot of
issues<00:01:20.549> with<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:22.009> specifically<00:01:23.009> and

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
issues with that specifically and

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.399 
issues with that specifically and
everything<00:01:23.700> else<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.119> pretty<00:01:24.299> much<00:01:24.420> fine<00:01:24.869> it

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
everything else is pretty much fine it

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.649 
everything else is pretty much fine it
felt<00:01:25.890> really<00:01:26.189> comfortable<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.880> smooth<00:01:27.240> and

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
felt really comfortable and smooth and

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.170 
felt really comfortable and smooth and
it<00:01:28.560> really<00:01:28.950> was<00:01:29.100> just<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.399> tapping<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.060> was

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
it really was just the tapping that was

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.260 
it really was just the tapping that was
the<00:01:30.329> main<00:01:30.509> drawback<00:01:31.430> as<00:01:32.430> far<00:01:32.700> as<00:01:32.789> your<00:01:32.909> finger

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
the main drawback as far as your finger

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.999 
the main drawback as far as your finger
that's<00:01:33.570> it's<00:01:33.930> about<00:01:34.140> what<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.439> would<00:01:34.560> expect

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
that's it's about what you would expect

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.219 
that's it's about what you would expect
I<00:01:35.310> mean<00:01:35.579> it's<00:01:36.090> exactly<00:01:36.329> where<00:01:36.899> you<00:01:37.079> would

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
I mean it's exactly where you would

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.109 
I mean it's exactly where you would
touch<00:01:37.469> because<00:01:37.890> these<00:01:38.250> devices<00:01:38.880> have<00:01:39.030> been

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
touch because these devices have been

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.359 
touch because these devices have been
optimized<00:01:39.659> for<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:39.930> except<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.039> really

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
optimized for that except you really

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.660 
optimized for that except you really
can't<00:01:41.640> see<00:01:41.939> where<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:43.049> are<00:01:43.079> touching<00:01:43.469> so<00:01:44.460> his

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
can't see where you are touching so his

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.719 
can't see where you are touching so his
fingers<00:01:45.090> lestor

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
fingers lestor

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.069 
fingers lestor
it's<00:01:46.180> probably<00:01:46.479> the<00:01:46.570> most<00:01:46.689> of<00:01:46.899> you<00:01:47.020> were

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:47.079 
it's probably the most of you were

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:49.800 
it's probably the most of you were
