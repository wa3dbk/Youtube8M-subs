light it doesn't flip flop the dark
should<00:02:34.450> become<00:02:34.720> light<00:02:34.930> than<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.140> light

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
should become light than the light

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.500 
should become light than the light
should<00:02:35.470> become<00:02:35.770> dark<00:02:36.100> that's<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.820> names<00:02:37.150> wood

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
should become dark that's the names wood

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.850

if<00:02:37.690> it<00:02:37.810> doesn't<00:02:38.140> do<00:02:38.260> it<00:02:38.380> then<00:02:38.530> you<00:02:38.620> know<00:02:38.740> it's

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
if it doesn't do it then you know it's

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.370 
if it doesn't do it then you know it's
just<00:02:38.920> a<00:02:39.070> picture<00:02:39.540> this<00:02:40.540> how's<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:40.960> picture<00:02:41.230> I

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
similar to this it realized okay let me

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.130 
similar to this it realized okay let me
go<00:02:57.220> get<00:02:57.340> my<00:02:57.400> guitar<00:02:57.730> compared<00:02:58.390> and<00:02:59.020> I've

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
go get my guitar compared and I've

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.600 
go get my guitar compared and I've
compared<00:02:59.560> my<00:02:59.710> nerve<00:02:59.860> you<00:02:59.950> guys<00:03:00.070> might<00:03:00.340> sound

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
compared my nerve you guys might sound

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.810 
compared my nerve you guys might sound
way<00:03:00.880> better<00:03:01.350> so<00:03:02.350> I<00:03:02.380> like<00:03:02.590> remarkably<00:03:03.460> louder

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
way better so I like remarkably louder

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.170 
way better so I like remarkably louder
and<00:03:04.210> a<00:03:04.600> nicer<00:03:04.810> tone<00:03:05.140> then<00:03:05.980> I<00:03:06.070> realized<00:03:06.520> that

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
and a nicer tone then I realized that

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.360 
and a nicer tone then I realized that
