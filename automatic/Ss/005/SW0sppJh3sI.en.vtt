 four angles 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.070
 I make a point not to fix my plate 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.390
 because we can consider that it is 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.390

 I drew roughly the stems of 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.360
 mongu and with a ribbon of about 4 mm 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.110

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.470

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:10.570
 I put my delhaize queue in duplicate 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:14.560

 a bit clear in relation to the whole 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.800

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:17.250
