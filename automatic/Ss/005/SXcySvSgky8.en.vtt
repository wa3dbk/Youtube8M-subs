granddaddy tournament of them all is
every<00:00:32.369> year<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.820> that's<00:00:33.600> how<00:00:33.780> we<00:00:33.840> were

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
every year and that's how we were

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.200 
every year and that's how we were
introduced<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.680> sport<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:35.309> got<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> group<00:00:36.000> of

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
introduced to the sport I got a group of

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.340 
introduced to the sport I got a group of
models<00:00:37.020> together<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.190> create<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.550> calendar

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
models together to create a calendar

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.819 
models together to create a calendar
because<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.440> thought<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.680> would<00:00:40.739> be

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
because I thought it would be

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.729 
because I thought it would be
interesting<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.340> have<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.640> product<00:00:42.350> at<00:00:43.350> some<00:00:43.649> of

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
interesting to have a product at some of

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.020 
interesting to have a product at some of
the<00:00:43.800> tournaments<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.399> we<00:00:44.520> were<00:00:44.610> going<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:45.000> I

was<00:00:45.270> going<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.600> be<00:00:45.690> there<00:00:45.870> anyway<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.230> might

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
was going to be there anyway and might

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.520 
was going to be there anyway and might
as<00:00:46.680> well<00:00:46.829> be<00:00:46.950> doing<00:00:47.250> something<00:00:47.670> productive

as well be doing something productive

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.369

and<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:50.129> once<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.300> got<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.600> calendar<00:00:51.960> together

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
and so once I got the calendar together

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.470 
and so once I got the calendar together
and<00:00:52.739> brought<00:00:53.370> some<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.760> young<00:00:53.879> ladies<00:00:54.210> to

happy about that

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.889 
happy about that
so<00:00:58.649> they<00:00:58.920> wanted<00:00:59.219> more<00:00:59.550> authenticity<00:00:59.899> they

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
so they wanted more authenticity they

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
be hillbillies are claimed to be redneck

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.359 
be hillbillies are claimed to be redneck
but<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.409> derived<00:01:40.770> with<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.100> Native

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
but this derived with the Native

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.550 
but this derived with the Native
Americans<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.020> was<00:01:43.170> their<00:01:43.380> way<00:01:43.409> of

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
Americans and it was their way of

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.330 
Americans and it was their way of
obtaining<00:01:44.420> food<00:01:45.420> sources<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:46.860> we<00:01:47.159> just

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
obtaining food sources and so we just

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.649 
obtaining food sources and so we just
feel<00:01:47.549> like<00:01:47.700> we're<00:01:47.880> carrying<00:01:48.119> on<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> tradition

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
feel like we're carrying on a tradition

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.840 
feel like we're carrying on a tradition
that's<00:01:49.020> been<00:01:49.170> around<00:01:49.380> for

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
that's been around for

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.179 
that's been around for
basically<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.600> just<00:01:51.650> you<00:01:52.650> get<00:01:52.830> in<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.040> water

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
basically you just you get in the water

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.690 
basically you just you get in the water
and<00:01:53.400> you<00:01:54.330> try<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.780> find<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.409> know<00:01:55.439> slabs<00:01:56.430> of

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
and you try and find you know slabs of

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.210 
and you try and find you know slabs of
concrete<00:01:56.909> or<00:01:57.689> rock<00:01:58.259> structures<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.009> stuff

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
concrete or rock structures and stuff

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.130 
concrete or rock structures and stuff
that<00:01:59.610> you<00:02:00.000> know<00:02:00.119> fish<00:02:00.330> can<00:02:00.570> burrow<00:02:00.900> themselves

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
that you know fish can burrow themselves

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.590 
that you know fish can burrow themselves
into<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.159> make<00:02:02.340> kind<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.640> like<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.820> bowl<00:02:03.119> inside

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
into and make kind of like a bowl inside

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.020 
into and make kind of like a bowl inside
and<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.649> mean<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.340> can<00:02:05.490> go<00:02:05.580> a<00:02:05.640> long<00:02:05.759> boat

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
and so I mean you can go a long boat

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.840 
and so I mean you can go a long boat
ramps<00:02:06.360> or<00:02:06.479> anything<00:02:06.630> or<00:02:07.200> along<00:02:07.860> rock<00:02:08.100> walls<00:02:08.399> or

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
ramps or anything or along rock walls or

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.140 
ramps or anything or along rock walls or
