severe pollution and that sort of thing

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.630 
severe pollution and that sort of thing
all<00:03:16.440> these<00:03:16.560> things<00:03:16.769> are<00:03:16.890> factors<00:03:17.280> that<00:03:17.310> we

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
all these things are factors that we

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.699 
all these things are factors that we

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
have to take into consideration so yes

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.259 
have to take into consideration so yes
I'd<00:03:19.890> say<00:03:19.920> it's<00:03:20.549> something<00:03:20.880> that<00:03:21.000> would<00:03:21.150> be

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
I'd say it's something that would be

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.750 
I'd say it's something that would be
beneficial<00:03:21.420> to<00:03:21.900> anybody<00:03:22.410> basically<00:03:23.010> some<00:03:23.670> of

more beneficial and if we're working in
a<00:04:32.840> you<00:04:33.110> know<00:04:33.230> that<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:33.620> general<00:04:33.950> principle<00:04:34.490> is

to work with what the body normally does

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.530 
to work with what the body normally does
