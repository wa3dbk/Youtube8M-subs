00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.580
 This is a tutorial to take better care of your playstation 3 pack 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.440
 The first thing we need is this one is to go 

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:14.029
 propose without fighting and having 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:17.029
 preferable to have a high space on the sides 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.629
 so that the base of the pri do not touch surface appeal is something with which there is 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.210
 and what follows is to have a present 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.190
 we do not want to expose 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.130
 he showed it 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.000
 under the pri 3 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.140
 so that the base does not 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.140
 noticed that at the table and the client 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.670
 good as we can see we already have the sad are three mounted on the base 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.510
 as I said I have a certain height 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.420
 base 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.990
 so that the surface act does not collide 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.140
 since the triple 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.990
 something like that 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.990
 It is never easy to do 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.930
 and if we want 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.800
 take even more care of playstation 3 to avoid overheating 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.740

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.590
 thing that makes the air 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.770
