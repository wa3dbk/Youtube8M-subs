00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 with you again online shop on the biscuits 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.040
 in this video review I want to introduce you 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.049
 with whey protein from the company 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.980
 say so nutrition he is called 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.559
 one hundred percent slade or one hundred percent 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.059
 perfect isolate in plain language means 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.880
 this protein is recommended for athletes 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.010
 which is on drying either to people 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.970
 who want to ramp up purely dry 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.609
 muscle mass 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.260
 why so and they are different now I am everything to you 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.310
 I 'll tell you in detail packaging 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.539
 represents the mean here such 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.680
 transparent jar where clearly visible 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.870
 substance specifically this ports means you 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.210
 jars us by weight weighing more precisely weight 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.399
 700 grams of production here is at 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.550
 this serving is 25 grams per 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.610
 Container contains 28 servings 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.920
 we also have to port 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.710
 only 99 kilocalories there is very large 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.000
 quantity therefore you should not be afraid 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.250
 because excess fat will appear 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.739
 or fatty coat this protein can 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.980
 take at night as if its because 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.320
 this 100% isolate is also us fat 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.369
 just one gram 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:10.080
 then we still have here 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.050
 carbohydrate 2 grams only very 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.270
 small amount 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.280
 decent attention means nasty 20 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.950
 gram that is how you can understand here 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.440
 we probably have about eighty 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.550
 five percent 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.820
 real pure protein per serving 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.520
 have to mean a minimum of sweeteners 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.310
 in this case, nascut is represented by a banana 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.470
 that is, but other tastes are chocolate or 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.550
 There vanilla or strawberry on site can 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.710
 see at least visited as I have 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.520
 said mean to the judges 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.420
 contains ultra filtered 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:49.220
 whey whey isolate 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.840
 protein enriched with ions is some sort of 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.850
 probably a new development company sky 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.400
 so nutrition as if for me 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.170
 let's say it's a little about how well 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.650
 would the manufacturers say it 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.770
 some kind of ultra new formula means a 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:06.170
 also contains us glutamine made up 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.050
 250 milligrams means who does not know 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.429
 glutamine is an essential amino acid 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.530
 which in principle is one of 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.290
 most important muscle fiber building 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.820
 your body means and it represents 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.250
 interest for all athletes who 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.350
 are engaged in an intense gym 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.570
 aim at the result means still 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.920
 small addition to say what 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:30.590
 then this one or glutamine and glutamine 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.540
 differently you can call it like 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.180
 the main substance when building your 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.730
 muscle fibers 60 percent muscle 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.860
 consist of glutamine and if just like that 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.840
 say in simple language so he 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.800
 Especially important for trainees 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.040
 gymnasium 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.600
 means it per serving of 250 milligrams is 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.030
 I want to say quite a few 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.220
 principle but don't consider it 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.480
 as full 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.700
 like full amino acids or 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.880
 specifically glutamine for or which 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.410
 Seriously 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.960
 and I recommend to do buy by 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.880
 Separate amino acid lenny acid 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.820
 In goal specifically glutamine money there is 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.980
 sold and take it separately 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.440
 Means a lot of quotas one hundred percent isolates 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.240
 this g-100 product and your attention and 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.820
 I will emphasize again why because 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.030
 good composition in principle is not here 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.520
 contains some there do not know him 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.310
 incomprehensible types of protein 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.950
 which right now to write different 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.060
 manufacturers add there sheet 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.370
 soy proteins 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.110
 Well, like iso whey protein and some 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.360
 more under other types of proteins here 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.300
 clean we have serum very good at 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.450
 velit is smooth and which is sure to be 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.800
 act in the training process 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.140
 mean recommendations for use 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.840
 it all depends on your initial muscular 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.060
 masses are your tasks and goals mean 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.790
 Moms recommend taking from 2 to 6 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.370
 portions of the day if the mass mass is large then 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.350
 6 servings it will be ok if mass 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.300
 a small order of 70 kilograms means 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.460
 take about two servings per day 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.380
 if the mass has exceeded seventy three 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.580
 somewhere up to 85 kilograms can be safely 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.950
 take 3 servings 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.570
 day harm will not believe me will 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.910
 only normal real result 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.460
 so we should not forget what it means to 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.020
 us protein is not say so not 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.090
 should be in the body one hundred percent 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.040
 source of protein means sports 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.549
 food is only no more than 30 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.870
 percent of the daily diet should 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.850
 make up sports supplements 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.010
 so take another mother normal 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.720
 big and protein food and will you 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.030
 good results normal power 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.380
 indicators but bart e in how would this 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.150
 nice bonus which allows 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.400
 achieve these results much 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.380
 faster we go online store years 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.640
 choose sports nutrition and 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.640
 we get thanks
