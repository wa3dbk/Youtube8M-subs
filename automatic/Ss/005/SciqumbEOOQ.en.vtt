going on and explain the science behind

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.729 
going on and explain the science behind
it<00:00:42.640> by<00:00:43.149> comparing<00:00:43.989> it<00:00:44.050> to<00:00:44.079> the<00:00:44.170> frailties<00:00:44.710> of

everything you care to mention in Borneo

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.010 
everything you care to mention in Borneo
just<00:01:33.459> I<00:01:33.670> think<00:01:33.939> particularly<00:01:34.479> the<00:01:34.719> jungle

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
just I think particularly the jungle

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.899 
just I think particularly the jungle
environments<00:01:35.469> are<00:01:35.590> really<00:01:35.889> really<00:01:36.189> hard

environments are really really hard

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.330 
environments are really really hard
going<00:01:37.630> and<00:01:37.840> in<00:01:38.319> Borneo<00:01:38.619> because<00:01:38.889> it's<00:01:39.009> a<00:01:39.100> swamp

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
going and in Borneo because it's a swamp

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.399 
going and in Borneo because it's a swamp
forest<00:01:39.700> you<00:01:39.909> are<00:01:39.999> just<00:01:40.329> up<00:01:40.509> to<00:01:40.749> your<00:01:40.869> waist<00:01:41.049> in

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
forest you are just up to your waist in

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.339 
forest you are just up to your waist in
swamp<00:01:42.069> and<00:01:42.340> filth<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:42.969> mud<00:01:43.270> every<00:01:44.020> single<00:01:44.200> day

00:01:44.339 --> 00:01:44.349 
swamp and filth and mud every single day

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:46.709 
swamp and filth and mud every single day
we<00:01:45.130> did<00:01:45.279> a<00:01:45.310> story<00:01:45.549> about<00:01:45.670> bat-eared<00:01:46.119> foxes

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
we did a story about bat-eared foxes

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.660 
we did a story about bat-eared foxes
that<00:01:46.959> have<00:01:47.289> incredible<00:01:47.920> hearing<00:01:48.279> and<00:01:48.399> huge

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
ears and they use these to listen for

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.319 
ears and they use these to listen for
bugs<00:01:51.130> that<00:01:51.249> move<00:01:51.490> around<00:01:51.609> under<00:01:51.999> the<00:01:52.119> sound

bugs that move around under the sound

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:54.629 
bugs that move around under the sound
that<00:01:52.479> they<00:01:52.599> vent<00:01:52.840> dig<00:01:53.049> up<00:01:53.200> and<00:01:53.439> eat<00:01:53.590> and<00:01:54.520> we

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:54.639 
that they vent dig up and eat and we

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:56.999 
that they vent dig up and eat and we
tried<00:01:54.999> to<00:01:55.149> go<00:01:55.630> head-to-head<00:01:56.170> with<00:01:56.439> them<00:01:56.829> and

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
tried to go head-to-head with them and

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.909 
tried to go head-to-head with them and
got<00:01:57.219> this<00:01:57.340> little<00:01:57.849> guitar<00:01:58.329> pick<00:01:58.959> up<00:01:59.169> and<00:01:59.409> put

00:01:59.909 --> 00:01:59.919 
got this little guitar pick up and put

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:01.620 
got this little guitar pick up and put
the<00:02:00.009> pickups<00:02:00.310> in<00:02:00.459> the<00:02:00.579> sand<00:02:00.849> and<00:02:01.090> then<00:02:01.329> listen

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
the pickups in the sand and then listen

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.809

doing this program is because we try and
