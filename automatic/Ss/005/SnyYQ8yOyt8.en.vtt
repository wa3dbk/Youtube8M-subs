for going over to the right side and

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.910 
for going over to the right side and

look for installed physical memory when
right<00:02:29.280> there<00:02:29.489> we<00:02:29.549> see<00:02:29.700> 8<00:02:29.849> gigabytes<00:02:30.390> which

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
right there we see 8 gigabytes which

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.390 
right there we see 8 gigabytes which
means<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.019> system<00:02:31.200> is<00:02:31.560> reading<00:02:32.130> all<00:02:32.280> the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
means the system is reading all the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.979 
means the system is reading all the
