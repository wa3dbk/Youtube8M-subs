hi<00:00:06.399> YouTube<00:00:06.790> this<00:00:06.880> is<00:00:07.029> a<00:00:07.210> video<00:00:07.810> for<00:00:08.290> the

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
hi YouTube this is a video for the

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.369 
hi YouTube this is a video for the

hard<00:00:11.889> and<00:00:12.100> penny<00:00:12.280> millimetre<00:00:12.670> town<00:00:13.110> so<00:00:14.110> let's

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:15.099 
hard and penny millimetre town so let's

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:22.100 
hard and penny millimetre town so let's
get<00:00:15.280> on<00:00:16.770> so<00:00:17.770> in<00:00:18.040> the<00:00:18.099> case<00:00:18.490> there's<00:00:20.640> often<00:00:21.640> a

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.110 
get on so in the case there's often a

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:31.799 
get on so in the case there's often a
little<00:00:23.110> early<00:00:23.470> version<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:27.570> after<00:00:29.669> which<00:00:30.809> I

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:31.809 
little early version and after which I

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:35.900 
little early version and after which I
think<00:00:32.320> it's<00:00:32.439> for<00:00:32.649> reducing<00:00:33.399> the<00:00:33.700> voltage<00:00:34.140> and

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
think it's for reducing the voltage and

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.630 
think it's for reducing the voltage and
for<00:00:36.910> silicon<00:00:37.480> panes<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:41.469> actually<00:00:42.100> is<00:00:42.250> a<00:00:42.280> fan

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
for silicon panes this actually is a fan

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.900 
for silicon panes this actually is a fan
in<00:00:42.969> the<00:00:43.089> dark<00:00:43.329> let<00:00:43.870> me<00:00:44.050> close<00:00:44.350> my<00:00:44.519> cold<00:00:45.519> cathode

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
in the dark let me close my cold cathode

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.020 
in the dark let me close my cold cathode
lights<00:00:46.149> but<00:00:46.539> you<00:00:46.570> can<00:00:46.839> sit<00:00:46.989> better

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
lights but you can sit better

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.619 
lights but you can sit better
uh-huh<00:00:49.089> in<00:00:49.960> real<00:00:50.620> life<00:00:50.920> it's<00:00:51.699> it<00:00:52.149> has<00:00:52.359> an<00:00:52.480> even

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
uh-huh in real life it's it has an even

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.470 
uh-huh in real life it's it has an even
better<00:00:52.929> blue<00:00:53.230> color<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:54.640> is<00:00:54.850> the<00:00:54.879> color<00:00:55.059> of

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
better blue color this is the color of

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.169 
better blue color this is the color of
the<00:00:55.629> Zelman<00:00:56.230> compared<00:00:57.219> to<00:00:57.429> that<00:00:57.550> to<00:00:57.909> the<00:00:58.030> one

00:00:58.169 --> 00:00:58.179 
the Zelman compared to that to the one

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:00.569 
the Zelman compared to that to the one
of<00:00:58.329> the<00:00:58.420> cooler<00:00:58.690> master<00:00:59.219> the<00:01:00.219> one<00:01:00.370> of<00:01:00.489> the

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
of the cooler master the one of the

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.590 
of the cooler master the one of the
Zelman<00:01:01.059> is<00:01:01.239> brighter<00:01:01.749> and<00:01:02.109> actually<00:01:03.600> it

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
Zelman is brighter and actually it

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.440 
Zelman is brighter and actually it
covers<00:01:05.170> a<00:01:05.199> higher<00:01:05.710> area<00:01:06.100> I<00:01:06.520> mean<00:01:06.700> if<00:01:06.880> I<00:01:07.030> put<00:01:07.060> my

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
covers a higher area I mean if I put my

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.040 
covers a higher area I mean if I put my
hand

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
hand

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.810 
hand
it<00:01:08.380> gets<00:01:08.590> lit<00:01:09.570> Wow<00:01:10.570> the<00:01:10.630> one<00:01:11.200> in<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:11.470> back<00:01:11.820> well

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
it gets lit Wow the one in the back well

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.000 
it gets lit Wow the one in the back well
no<00:01:13.710> it's<00:01:14.710> more<00:01:14.890> dark<00:01:15.400> blue<00:01:15.990> looks<00:01:16.990> better<00:01:17.200> but

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
no it's more dark blue looks better but

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.410 
no it's more dark blue looks better but
for<00:01:18.460> a<00:01:19.120> front<00:01:19.960> fan<00:01:20.260> or<00:01:20.560> if<00:01:21.240> you're<00:01:22.240> not

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
for a front fan or if you're not

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
for a front fan or if you're not
intending<00:01:23.170> to<00:01:23.200> use<00:01:23.380> cold<00:01:24.250> cathode<00:01:24.460> lamps<00:01:25.440> then

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
intending to use cold cathode lamps then

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.250 
intending to use cold cathode lamps then
yeah<00:01:27.120> the<00:01:28.120> Zelman<00:01:28.540> is<00:01:28.660> a<00:01:28.690> very<00:01:28.930> good<00:01:29.050> time<00:01:29.230> for

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
yeah the Zelman is a very good time for

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.940 
yeah the Zelman is a very good time for
you<00:01:29.530> oh<00:01:29.770> hey<00:01:30.670> I<00:01:30.970> almost<00:01:31.600> forgot

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.150 

so<00:01:36.060> first<00:01:37.060> of<00:01:37.210> all<00:01:37.300> the<00:01:37.720> the<00:01:38.020> silicon<00:01:38.800> pins

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
so first of all the the silicon pins

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.650 
so first of all the the silicon pins
that<00:01:39.430> it<00:01:40.270> includes<00:01:41.190> for<00:01:42.190> me<00:01:42.340> are<00:01:42.490> hard<00:01:43.000> to<00:01:43.450> use

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
that it includes for me are hard to use

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.399 
that it includes for me are hard to use
so<00:01:43.990> I<00:01:44.530> couldn't<00:01:45.270> mount<00:01:46.270> it<00:01:46.570> that<00:01:46.750> way<00:01:46.960> and

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.649 

if<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.280> use<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.700> resistor<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:52.130> adapter<00:01:53.659> this

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
if you use the resistor the adapter this

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.710 
if you use the resistor the adapter this
thingy<00:01:55.400> then<00:01:57.259> it<00:01:58.259> doesn't<00:01:58.770> only<00:01:59.330> reduce<00:02:00.330> the

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
thingy then it doesn't only reduce the

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.810 
thingy then it doesn't only reduce the
airflow<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.530> noise<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:02.220> also<00:02:02.369> reduces

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
airflow and the noise it also reduces

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.690 
airflow and the noise it also reduces
the<00:02:03.290> the<00:02:04.290> brightness<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.830> the<00:02:04.860> LD<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.549> yeah

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
the the brightness of the LD so yeah

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.650 
the the brightness of the LD so yeah
because<00:02:06.690> noise<00:02:07.080> noise<00:02:08.090> he's<00:02:09.090> in<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.390> hard

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
because noise noise he's in the hard

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.180 
because noise noise he's in the hard
matter<00:02:09.929> a<00:02:10.340> big<00:02:11.340> matter<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:12.060> I'm<00:02:12.209> getting<00:02:13.190> a

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
matter a big matter and I'm getting a

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.960 
matter a big matter and I'm getting a
fan<00:02:15.060> controller<00:02:15.480> soon<00:02:15.870> then<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:16.880> wouldn't<00:02:17.880> need

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
fan controller soon then I wouldn't need

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.150 
fan controller soon then I wouldn't need
this
