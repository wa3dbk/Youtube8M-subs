00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.910
 Did you know if it involves me? 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:12.059
 company system 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:16.680
 We can almost come to the conclusion that 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.869
 there because it's a little bit does not end 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:25.850
 and begins to enter through this hose 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.850
 here and there the water will cease 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.620
 you can observe that the water level is 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:11.030
 downloading is coming to the edge there 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:14.420
 turn- by-turn with curia 32 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:25.540
 the adapter flange and the side of here 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:25.540
 also you begin to enter the air 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:52.450
 well then I set the referee down because 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:54.670
 if there is no more water fall 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.410
 then at that moment this volume of water 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:05.110
 that he has here he will feed the three 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:11.140
 stalls and the bug tank that appears 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:14.860
 at the end of the video here will have low 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.380
 the water here has such low 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:24.430
 more or less here about 10 centimeters 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:25.260
 that it will lower the system that it 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.920
 Water 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:32.590
 how full it comes to this level here and 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.860
 when down and arrives at that level to 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:40.360
 refill it to take 15 minutes to 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:44.380
 to fill a myth filled with 10 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.030
 12 minutes and will fill and empty cam 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.120
 five minutes 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:54.970
 then this is the system will then yes it is 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:58.800
 simple way to make water from the 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:05.590
 fish first falls into this decanter 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:10.360
 then go through this computer and 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:12.780
 We tried to have this difference. 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:17.580
 water level here 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:25.610
 and there goes to this filter are in this 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:33.660
 Moment the water is coming from here. 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:36.180
 passing through this bank then feeds 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:40.470
 this basis, which is also the second 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:49.560
 feeds this third bank 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:54.360
 here I have lettuce days and I have 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:57.030
 also the parsley and the onion 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.610
 the system is starting over because when 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.870
 an accident happened here I left the 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.530
 Water 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.900
 the concessionaire opened accidentally 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.150
 Why I used to be able to take away 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.400
 a little bit of network fighting 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.840
 I just left open overflowed the 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.979
 fish died 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:22.500
 I'm starting with the system again 

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:24.150
 but now with decanter and the sinfum who 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:30.830
 want to see the other video another video that 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.830
 it's on youtube aquaponics mg 2013 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:37.080
 anyone who has any suggestions who want 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.789
 send some ideas you can send 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:45.770
