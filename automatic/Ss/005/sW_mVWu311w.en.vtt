00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:13.750
 The Hello I was Atsushi Imai, this time at the top of this turbid 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:15.860
 And The photo around The photo roll of slope 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.400
 There are four at the end of Ooki 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.520
 The left foot is lower and the opposite left foot is higher 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.500
 Also like this toe 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:31.080
 This of rise and toe of the city 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:36.120
 Yes there are 4 balls How is this 4 patterns 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.410
 I would like to tell you if it is easy to fly and this time this left foot fall 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.160
 Is the version of 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.410
 It is conclusively that this left foot version is 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.380
 The ball is 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.780
 It will be easier to take right 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:52.870
 The reason is 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:54.640
 In this way it that is tilted to the left of 56 is going to have hanging on better here 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.560
 I in the swing 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.010
 Surely this 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:05.580
 The body will pull the high towards this way 16 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:07.880
 Then than is really this late tension is say this scrub becomes 4 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.240
 Like this with machines 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:15.780
 To Henriette slope, but it goes straight if could go to witchcraft 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:19.170
 It is pushed by a little child gravity, good copy 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.110
 If you enter it, the pace will be open a little 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.730
 a 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:28.680
 The ball because the downhill is 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:33.710
 If you go north, it's like the club is late and you fly right 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.710
 I think it would be nice if you remember that it is easy to go 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:02:04.439
