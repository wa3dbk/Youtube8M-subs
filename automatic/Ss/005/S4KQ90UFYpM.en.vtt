00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:11.389
 [Music] 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.070
 surgery and wakes of the brain is 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.750
 a technique that allows to realize the 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.250
 management of lesions and more 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.689
 usually the extraction of tumors from 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.189
 low grade located in areas of 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.910
 brain responsible for very functions 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.560
 important 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.810
 It basically has the areas of the 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.779
 language the areas of production the 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.430
 language and language comprehension 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.290
 as well as the motor region and the 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.239
 region without ultimate brain before 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.829
 the intervention of the surgeon the patient 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.899
 passes several exams that allows 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.000
 to situate the tumor very precisely 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.230
 that areas not to damage the success 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.700
 of surgery and wakes of the brain 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.310
 requires real collaboration 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.660
 between all the speakers 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.830
 speech therapists and neuropsychologists 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.440
 neurologists who specialize in language and 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.330
 imaging the speech therapist meets 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.890
 the patient before the intervention for 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.240
 do an assessment of the expression and 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.710
 understanding of language 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.330
 it's a balance sheet with all 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.829
 situations finally from the language to 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:02.900
 know reading the writing the 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.020
 denomination the formulation of sentences 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.250
 the understanding of sentences 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.659
 when talking to him and understanding 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.810
 of sentences 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:15.560
 kylie also is obviously a test 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.759
 naming 80 images the patient 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.229
 also passes a functional irm 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.299
 language- centric 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.399
 equipped with glasses a helmet and a 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.200
 micro he interacts with the doctors in 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.479
 performing several exercises one haunts 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.459
 the surgeon who operates and his passions 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.409
 the goal is after the intervention 

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:32.149
 it is passion shows no 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.640
 language disorders as in others 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.649
 surgeries involving the cortex 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.179
 we know that language is something 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.099
 complex thing and that it's not that 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.409
 speech there is also everything we can 

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:44.810
 so understand the purpose was to try 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.390
 to have language tasks that are 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.129
 the most representative of the different 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.530
 language components so there is 

00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:53.569
 the expression aspect of language but 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.310
 when you talk to me there is also everything 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:58.909
 my understanding aspect throughout the 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.729
 part understanding and in this 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.939
 dichotomy between expression production 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:07.159
 has been for over a hundred years 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:10.190
 that it corresponds to regions 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:13.040
 different on the cortical plane like 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.500
 we can see it here on a diagram 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.430
 relatively simplified region that is 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.549
 found in border regions 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.989
 year called the broca air and who 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.940
 is rather involved with everything 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.489
 production and the whole party 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.750
 posterior temporal key is the most 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.130
 involved for all that is 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:33.709
 perception understanding of the 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.540
 say the purpose of exploring the 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.459
 language we do before surgery 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.380
 it'll be trying to explore his 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.000
 different compartments with tasks 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.180
 who will try 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.080
 so to answer these questions a long 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.330
 image processing work 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.920
 acquired during the MIR then allows to 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.600
 make a first mapping of 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.180
 different areas of the brain that would have 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.320
 acted during the exercises to the interest 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.310
 this exam make a first 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.780
 cartography ie to know if 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.650
 the functions we want to study 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.270
 las in the functions of the language are 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.350
 already in the hemisphere of the legion 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.480
 first information 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.680
 and whether or not they are at a distance from 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.220
 the plane that will be operated is a 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.510
 first information that will allow to 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.100
 tell the surgeons if it needs to be 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.420
 especially careful if 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.820
 activations are close to religions 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.500
 or if he is so sweet if can be 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.600
 confident about his surgery 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.430
 ie if the results show 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.830
 activations that are well remote 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.510
 the legion even better in 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.330
 the contralateral hemisphere to the legion 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.800
 the interest of this examination is also 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.209
 can point regions that are 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.650
 particularly relevant for the 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.880
 surgeon ie regions that 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.440
 were activated during the task that 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.459
 are likely to be indispensable to 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.420
 So the function it means to 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.190
 surgeons attention it takes 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.300
 particularly stimulated those regions there 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.830
 that have been activated during 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.790
 officials an example of results 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.290
 here is here in yellow so you have 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.269
 here a bar that corresponds to the value 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.380
 statistics of what we have here in 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.900
 area the regions that were so 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.570
 activated by the tasks we did 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.670
 to do to the subjects who are here by 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.680
 example the distance of a conquered lesion 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.670
 who will be operated 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.670
 when this first mapping 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.299
 established the patient enters the block 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.850
 the intervention takes place in several 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.989
 time access to the brain researches 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.180
 are important to save by 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.250
 simulation removal of tumor at 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.790
 microscope and finally closing the 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.549
 brain cavity 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.919
 the technique itself consists of 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:26.669
 to lull the patient to become almost 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:29.770
 normal to realize a cranio tommy of 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:32.780
 to expose the areas 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:35.030
 functional the language areas then 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:38.750
 the patient will be woken up on the table 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.940
 intervention and we will start 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.040
 to make him realize a number 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:47.270
 tasks to ensure that 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.360
 essential functions are preserved 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.400
 so how does this happen 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.580
 exactly using a small 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:59.150
 10mm electrodes we will stimulate 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:01.010
 by degrees eloquent areas 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.190
 this stimulation is going to be causing 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:07.040
 of a function inhibition so the 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:10.580
 boosting areas that will result in a 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:13.160
 language disorder will have to absolutely 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.220
 be respected and will be identified to 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.830
 using small labels number 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.780
 areas whose stimulation 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.760
 will not result in any change to the 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.520
 language can be removed 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:28.400
 once the patient is awake 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.030
 while doctor metellus stimulates 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.710
 the brain 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.810
 well I'll start with him 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.660
 ask to count to 10 and this 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:38.660
 moment there if I if I notice that 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:42.480
 during counting there is a stop of 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.890
 the word for example or a jaw 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.680
 movements in the jaw 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:49.530
 or tingling in the limb 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.710
 in the opposite hand at that moment I 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:55.920
 warn doctor metellus that the patient 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.610
 to manifestations due to his 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.680
 stimulation 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.980
 once this mapping will be 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:04.550
 we can start the reduction 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:07.140
 of the tumor respecting these areas 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.210
 after the intervention of complications 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.770
 transient may occur as a result of 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.300
 the appearance of edema around the 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.670
 cavity created by the extraction of the 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.230
 tumor these complications causes a 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:18.570
 passenger dysfunction at the level of 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.740
 motor activity or language but 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.900
 everything goes in order when 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.670
 of hematomas disappears surgery and 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.080
 wakefulness of the brain non extraction of 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.730
 Low grade tumors improves 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.690
 significantly the survival of patients and 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.690
 their subsequent quality of life
