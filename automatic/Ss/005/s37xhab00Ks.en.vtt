 sensors are sitting according to the words here 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:36.810
 pressure and test the camera the camera on 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.810
 this model and an 8-megapixel 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.400
 to orient characteristics 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:05:02.170
 focus works perfectly well, this video still 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.810
 look at those videos and photos that we 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:16.680
 recorded a video of us full hd on top 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:19.680
 record a small demonstration so and 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.680
 a photo 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:26.490
 in camera above average for budget 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.950
 smartphone camera just great let's say 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.250
 so here and take a look at the dial pad 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.250
 numbers 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.510
 proximity sensor works well for us 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.850
 and let you down 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:44.270
 short summary of casatin of this gadget 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.800
 that's what we tell you first 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.980
 I was pleased with the battery capacity 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:53.340
 I personally tested 10 hours in mode 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:55.980
 watching videos online and it works 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.620
 model that is, I can assume that with 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.510
 average usage will work 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.460
 about a week that is in capacity 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:05.010
 battery it will keep at 20 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.820
 percent longer than lenovo p780 per 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.120
 account of being here 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:11.190
 low-power mtk 6582 processor 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.660
 consumption and here i am capacity 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:16.530
 battery still 400 milliamps 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:18.510
 above that's why the main horse of course 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.230
 This model is worth a good price 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.420
 manufacturer 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.800
 and high capacity aqaba buy in 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.340
 mobido online store 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.340
