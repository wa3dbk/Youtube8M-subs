00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:09.450
 from the guitar method is a free workout in the sense that you try to do 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.019
 plain or a path 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:13.649
 controlled 

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:16.299
 but where there are not 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.690
 rsv theme but above all here but here eat and drink as they are called i beholds 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:28.699
 that made with a relationship not too not too long that allows you as it has 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:29.819
 say 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:34.210
 other times, it's up to you to walk among other things at 80 200 now 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.390
 100 rides will start and it started to be pretty though it's cooper 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.930
 someone surely 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.840
 a feasible thing here 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.480
 but being able to stay with a relationship that can be only fifty-three 19 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.870
 maximum 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.300
 vis 7 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.790
 but these pedaling frequencies of and certainly helps you to give to give 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.550
 so here is speed 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.840
 the work in agility is a job in the plain on a path 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.790
 wavy where you can always try not to ding ding between up and down 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.980
 you never stop pedaling 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.090
 md be able to notice against ita 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.770
 sum nation to do then 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.890
 I need to caesar home but the work that everything is done in the days before using it 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.290
 which are the reports 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.810
 3 too long 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.170
 you could not use this also in management 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.790
 of certain moments that then have difficulties during even some 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:34.840
 marathon 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.600
 but 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.170
 because we always tend to put the relationship together because there and then 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.430
 hard relationship seems like it takes you 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.890
 1 a help which hard relationship there is tt friend but after tt in paste e 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:48.770
 when 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.470
 for 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.800
 you can't really get in to 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.969
 to find the right rhythm from the hard relationship 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.400
 go the agile supply very difficult 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.280
 from the acro acidity I bring a little bit longer is certainly simpler 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.190
 then 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.960
 get used to doing these sessions with you in these pedaling frequencies on the other 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.739
 detail 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.459
 90 the 100 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.880
 surely then helps you stay 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.089
 almost always with one more tooth 

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:21.389
 centers that then is the whole added value 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.400
 to the whole economy of bankruptcy name 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.379
 many times we always tend 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.889
 to put so many teeth harder but a hard tooth then 

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:34.329
 if you show me 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:39.459
 the priest them for them at the beginning kitty from akita felt that helps but 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.040
 then he gives you the beating between head and neck 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.340
 and when you get between head and neck what is there to go hard and 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.689
 births 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:50.030
 suckers all get used to these frequencies 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.760
 always tends to stay with a relationship to please these a little and this helps you 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.459
 then in the management of the whole year of the whole garde rho of the economy 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:59.079
 thinning
