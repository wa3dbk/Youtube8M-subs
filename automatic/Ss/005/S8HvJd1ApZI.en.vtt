00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.750
 we want to continue adding to follow 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.420
 going up on the table and be sure 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.350
 for the line with a solid defensive 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.119
 jurgen the best defense until the 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.340
 moment is that of pachuca yes and also 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.930
 thank you in the back we have 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.099
 very good players the cone when in 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.949
 a very good level 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.600
 efraín arriola and pizarro also walk 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:38.219
 very well and good that has been shown in 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.339
 the court and as he says we are the best 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.600
 defense and good we hope to continue like this 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:44.909
 that same way having a team 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.760
 leveled in defense of the attack and 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:50.010
 let's continue adding to classify 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.929
 jürgen how have you been feeling under the 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.030
 technical direction of a man who then 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:55.139
 is constantly teaching them 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.659
 talking to you as is enrique 

00:00:55.139 --> 00:01:00.299
 meza is declared is a great coach the 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:02.010
 more success that Mexico has had and good 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:04.440
 personally helps me a lot is a 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.930
 coach who works every day 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.220
 with you teaches you the things that 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.620
 you are missing polish 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.940
 in the things that you should improve and good 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.280
 as you say a coach that supports you 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.690
 very much and that personally I 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.250
 I felt very good with him and very 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.470
 happy to be playing and that I 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.250
 be where your trust if you are in a 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.440
 third place 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.390
 jürgen but also those who come back 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.310
 very stuck not here there is no margin 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.260
 mistake to stay among the first 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.090
 eight yes of course we have to keep adding up 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.340
 this now against visiting saints 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.380
 we have to go out by the three points 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.620
 we know how do you say this america 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.690
 pumas are down very sticky teams 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.850
 and we know that with a setback we do not 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.320
 can move away from the area but I think that 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.810
 we are not our mindset we want 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.640
 continue on that in that good run and good 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.380
 we hope in God to do it like this and follow 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.140
 in these places they have to do to 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.520
 beat him in jumps in the region this go 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.530
 to leave with the same intensity as 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.910
 always have a ball position and 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.470
 specify the stands that we have 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.570
 I think what he's doing very well 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.250
 the team is to have position and also 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.930
 we have made many opportunities 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.030
 We are generating at the very good moment 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.789
 and good to take advantage of that and 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.229
 and win very well, I hope you have 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.940
 the possibility of playing your first 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.010
 liguilla in Mexican soccer and now 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.390
 we hope in God is a great dream that 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.390
 I have and we hope it is
