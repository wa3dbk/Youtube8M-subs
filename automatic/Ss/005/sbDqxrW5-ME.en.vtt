00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.210
 here if we are going to need it 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:55.120
 cream cheese butter 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.059
 it's very apart cheese double cream and the 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.790
 cream cheese cream cheese is more more 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:06.900
 creamy double cream cheese is a bit 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:09.640
 minus the juice of a lemon sugar flours 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.970
 we have here you almost do not see the zest 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.940
 of a lemon crushed cookies are 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.290
 those cookies that are vanilla flavor 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.899
 cream whipped cream that we use to 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.710
 eat the golden taquitos the 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:27.480
 pambazos this milk cream with milk 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:30.480
 condensed and cottage cheese 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.930
 around here I also have my blender for 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.600
 here I have a mold of maxima of 25 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.360
 centimeters in floured diameter and in 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.150
 good fat greased and floured what 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.980
 first thing that is going to be done is alhama to the 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.470
 cookie we are going to add the 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:50.310
 Butter 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.850
 it is already soft it is called ointment point 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.850
 it seems to me 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.070
 and we're going to pass it 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.110
 with the fingers 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:10.569
 until there is a magical mass 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.640
 well come on, that's what we first 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.430
 will do and already after we have 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.190
 We will spread it on the 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.410
 mold if it's nothing else in the part of 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.209
 down as you like or in the 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.920
 walls this time I'm going to 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:29.150
 do on the antlers on the walls 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:33.410
 good and I have here the mold and what you 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.750
 I put the cookie around pretty much to 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.970
 the height that I think will be left if 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.840
 you have a removable mold what 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.480
 can use if it's a little better 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.489
 well now what are we going to do the 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.010
 break east 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:52.790
 bake it a little bit this cookie more or 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.400
 minus about 10 minutes in the oven to 170 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.819
 degrees 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.900
 well here I already have my hot oven 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:03.069
 now 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:07.329
 at the cost of the good cheesecake here in the 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:10.069
 fret that is a little deep we are going to 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:13.299
 beat the cream cheese 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.299
 with cottage cheese 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.739
 the milkmaid 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:35.870
 let's beat it very well 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.870
 3 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.320
 and there is another moment 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.220
 the eggs 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.599
 one 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.489
 but with repeated carry their 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.280
 cataracts of the jack if I happened to 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:09.849
 right I like both each of the 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.849
 military 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:47.890
 here I have already removed the crust from the oven and 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:51.370
 let it cool a little it has to stay 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:55.000
 in the oven around 10 out of 5 to 10 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.440
 minutes if we let it cool if the 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.600
 we leave more time they start doing 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.729
 bubbles here too what we can 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:05.050
 do 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:08.860
 that with a knife we do this for 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.839
 that does not start sponge and then 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.870
 well it's already warm now what I'm going to 

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:12.870
 do 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:24.050
 put the fill and we will enter the 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:24.050
 stuffing to put it in the oven 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.940
 I'll leave it there 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:42.259
 because you can upload then so that 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:45.979
 it is very very good, it is now 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:51.169
 moment to put it into the home we are going to 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:53.449
 leave at 170 degrees for plus or minus 45 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:55.879
 minutes to give us an idea of 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:06:00.560
 that if our cheesecake is no longer 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:06:03.919
 let's introduce a toothpick or tip 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.050
 of a knife if it comes out or dry 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:08.430
 say that it is already and let it cool 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:12.480
 to unmold 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:18.310
 here the cheesecake is baked and I 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:21.540
 I left more or less about an hour 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:25.660
 this was the little bit that stayed 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:28.260
 so let's turn it off and let's 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.260
 remove it 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:40.700
 well now only what is missing is 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:44.060
 decorate the cheesecake 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:46.630
 with the jam of that zamora that 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.630
 here I have 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:51.559
 and well you have to talk about it about 15 

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:53.460
 minutes 20 minutes to cool the 

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:56.240
 cheesecake 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:07:00.080
 I already know where 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:02.690
 the cheesecake or bread the cheese here 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:06.810
 they came out two and now the only thing I'm going to 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:09.809
 do is add the jam 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:12.330
 above 

00:07:09.809 --> 00:07:15.270
 enough 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.860
 and with the same spoon 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:20.939
 we're going 

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:22.590
 spreading all over the bread if you 

00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:25.530
 they like to drain on the banks 

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:27.740
 they can throw it towards the 

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.740
 shores 

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:35.310
 well this is the final touch here 

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.310
 Let's put some other blackberry 

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:41.720
 this way 

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:43.870
 and I'm going to put a twig of 

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.870
 peppermint 

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:55.520
 well that's how our 

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:57.529
 cheesecake I hope you like friends and what 

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.990
