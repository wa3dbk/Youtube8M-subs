00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:06.960
 dvd criticism in another trailer 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.820
 check and that to a film of it 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.410
 trailer look very unusual 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.630
 But the director is just too 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.969
 a very unusual because it is 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.320
 the new strip of christopher nolan 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.930
 and with that we would be looking at the 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.930
 first german trailer to inter stella 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.960
 We have always been through the 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.470
 skill defined impossible too 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.470
 to reach 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.749
 and we count those moments 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:53.050
 who flew half faster than 

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:55.840
 that hurt those moments in which we 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.830
 still in the higher range 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.830
 exceed limits 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.530
 to reach for the stars 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.330
 the 67th 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.330
 to explore the unknown 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.340
 but a big step for the 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.929
 mankind 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.030
 we count these moments as ours 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:18.560
 the biggest one is the wings 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.810
 fantasy of a whole generation 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.030
 we lost that 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.420
 With 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:29.080
 for the last time or maybe have 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.159
 We forget that we are still 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.830
 are pioneers 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.030
 that we are still at the very beginning 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.740
 and that our greatest achievements 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.630
 not allowed to lay else 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.979
 that our fate 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.979
 lies before us 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.280
 I do not know how you are but at 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.900
 I feel that way to the trailer 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.430
 do not learn anything about the 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.990
 story but i want this movie 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.239
 be sure to see the trailer is 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.619
 feeling this horny review of the 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.450
 humanity and this ongoing 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.100
 knowledge and research or research 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.569
 exploring the world and doing so 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.459
 he embodies in this great voiceover 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.530
 and this wonderful music among others 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.209
 Of course , from Hans room the man 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.709
 just knows how to do it all great 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.780
 act leaves it is the new movie by 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.420
 christopher nolan den and warner bros 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.010
 expected from 6 november 2014 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.810
 in German cinemas bring so still 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.400
 this time can be forever 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.900
 for a long time a few times 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.180
 change but christopher nolan is 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.459
 just my father resysta behind the 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.680
 dark batman trilogy behind film like 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.430
 inception or moments or prestige and 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.959
 many more 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.819
 and a man who knows exactly someone 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.560
 stories told so that the audience 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.030
 then talk about it for a long time and 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.830
 You can make films several times 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.000
 see and also in the topic of leaves 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.200
 somehow this impression and actually 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.760
 that in this movie well and theories 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.799
 around time or not around time travel around 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.480
 live holes and black holes 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.890
 in the end a thing always goes 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.690
 she is again fascinated because she 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.250
 that's just how big it is 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.230
 could allow some time travel 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.730
 and again and again that's the brain of one 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.230
 people crashing when you 're in at night 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.150
 the stars look at it at all 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.260
 think that I'm curious what that 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.820
 whole here still brings 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.350
 interesting after the success gravity 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.720
 here the next film comes the environment 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.400
 example be the last one 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.750
 2014 at nolan you think okay 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.920
 which you really can not do much 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.970
 Wrong That I'm Me 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.859
 curious what the really 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.079
 actual story line will be the moment 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:25.280
 one is still very much held back 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.630
 I just do not like much 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.980
 tell you more but also curious if 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.600
 over the trails and similar feeling 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.980
 I then understood what I mean 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.540
 that is a special feature when 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.890
 trailer it's about to tell 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.350
 Nevertheless, huge interest to act 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.150
 By the way, here in front of the camera madcon he 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.769
 Among other things, the case of the so 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.200
 Anyway, it's going smoothly again 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.760
 he is only here at the 900 film 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.290
 at the next scorsese movie wolf on the 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.269
 Wall Street will have one later 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.950
 emaciated aids ill in dallas 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.750
 It works I think the man experienced 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.980
 just so the second really big one 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.510
 Career high and that's okay 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.299
 great then at jessica chastain 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.870
 anyway one of the best 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.920
 character actress is the moment 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.840
 on the globe can find the 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.060
 wonderful airway michael caine channing 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.709
 tatum casey affleck matt damon and yet 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.299
 So many other familiar faces are 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.769
 not the kas great and can yes 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.390
 the film music and the director 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.440
 The thing can hardly be anywhere 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.630
 I am already wrong 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.430
 really looking forward to interstellar and 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.650
 hope so but that still makes me 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.700
 well wait eleven months and by then was 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.010
 it is now with my little trailer 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.000
 section that the lask in a thumb there 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.470
 We made this let it remain 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.640
 will not be otherwise there is still one 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.650
 few cinema reviews twitter and facebook 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.900
 or abo buttons tomorrow 15 o'clock 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.610
