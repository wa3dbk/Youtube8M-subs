00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
the expected outcome but in the question

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.650 
the expected outcome but in the question
it<00:00:48.780> doesn't<00:00:49.140> really<00:00:49.289> state<00:00:49.800> what<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:51.030> drug<00:00:51.360> is

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
it doesn't really state what the drug is

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.650 
it doesn't really state what the drug is
used<00:00:52.440> for<00:00:53.239> when<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.300> took<00:00:54.360> my<00:00:54.539> Saunders<00:00:55.309> NCLEX

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
used for when I took my Saunders NCLEX

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.299 
used for when I took my Saunders NCLEX
it<00:00:57.660> actually<00:00:58.260> says<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.559> know<00:00:58.980> like

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
it actually says you know like

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.349 
it actually says you know like
lisinopril<00:01:00.890> patient<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:01.980> using<00:01:02.250> for<00:01:02.609> his

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
lisinopril patient is using for his

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.100 
lisinopril patient is using for his
hypertension<00:01:04.260> what<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.299> it<00:01:06.299> indicator<00:01:06.720> that

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
hypertension what is it indicator that

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.170 
hypertension what is it indicator that
this<00:01:07.619> medication<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.909> actually<00:01:09.450> working<00:01:10.110> and

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
this medication is actually working and

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.410 
this medication is actually working and
so<00:01:12.180> that<00:01:12.330> gave<00:01:12.510> me<00:01:12.570> clues<00:01:13.729> but<00:01:14.729> for<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.090> NCLEX

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
so that gave me clues but for the NCLEX

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.270 
so that gave me clues but for the NCLEX
exam<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:16.020> wasn't<00:01:16.350> like<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.530> at<00:01:16.710> all

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
exam it wasn't like that at all

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.910 
exam it wasn't like that at all
it<00:01:17.340> just<00:01:17.970> gave<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.960> generic<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.680> brand

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
it just gave the generic and the brand

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.190 
it just gave the generic and the brand
name<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.430> medication<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.750> then<00:01:22.049> you

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
name of the medication and then you

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.440 
name of the medication and then you
would<00:01:22.320> have<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.710> have<00:01:22.970> figure<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.119> out<00:01:24.240> you

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
would have to have figure it out you

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.200 
would have to have figure it out you
would<00:01:24.570> have<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.840> know<00:01:24.920> exactly<00:01:25.920> what<00:01:26.640> will<00:01:27.060> be

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
would have to know exactly what will be

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.600 
would have to know exactly what will be
like<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.810> expected<00:01:28.229> outcome<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.280> forth

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
like the expected outcome and so forth

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.100 
like the expected outcome and so forth
so<00:01:30.680> that<00:01:31.680> really<00:01:32.220> freaked<00:01:32.759> me<00:01:32.880> out<00:01:32.939> because<00:01:33.360> I

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
so that really freaked me out because I

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.380 
so that really freaked me out because I
kept<00:01:34.890> getting<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.220> lot<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.369> pharmacology<00:01:36.150> stuff

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
kept getting a lot of pharmacology stuff

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.740 
kept getting a lot of pharmacology stuff
and<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.630> thought<00:01:37.880> am<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:38.970> not<00:01:39.150> doing<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:39.540> well<00:01:39.720> on

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
and I thought am I not doing so well on

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.840 
and I thought am I not doing so well on
this<00:01:40.159> but<00:01:41.720> overall<00:01:43.100> I<00:01:44.100> didn't<00:01:44.579> think<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.790> was

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
this but overall I didn't think it was

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.920 
this but overall I didn't think it was
that<00:01:44.909> bad<00:01:45.299> we<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:46.170> was<00:01:47.130> nervous<00:01:47.600> my<00:01:48.600> heart<00:01:48.750> was
