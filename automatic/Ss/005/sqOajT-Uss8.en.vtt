00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
places you can get it down and kind of

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.220 
places you can get it down and kind of

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.240 
we didn't actually very well off as a

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.170 
we didn't actually very well off as a

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
back on class play with the second

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.969 
back on class play with the second
scenario<00:01:14.390> so<00:01:14.929> I<00:01:15.050> just<00:01:15.200> felt<00:01:15.440> like<00:01:15.530> we<00:01:15.590> will<00:01:15.860> be

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
scenario so I just felt like we will be

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.790 
scenario so I just felt like we will be
exactly<00:01:16.729> an<00:01:16.910> audience<00:01:17.420> and<00:01:18.289> I<00:01:18.470> just<00:01:18.649> had

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
exactly an audience and I just had

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.029 
exactly an audience and I just had
confidence<00:01:19.160> that<00:01:19.520> then<00:01:19.759> we<00:01:20.750> can<00:01:20.929> go<00:01:21.050> be<00:01:21.200> the

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
confidence that then we can go be the

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:24.190 
confidence that then we can go be the
first<00:01:22.280> to<00:01:22.429> play<00:01:22.640> I<00:01:22.880> was<00:01:23.090> pushing<00:01:23.420> it<00:01:23.660> and<00:01:23.840> then

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
first to play I was pushing it and then

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.529 
first to play I was pushing it and then

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
we screwed us both of those points for

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:29.290 
we screwed us both of those points for

well<00:01:47.330> on<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.540> second<00:01:47.870> half<00:01:48.020> and<00:01:48.650> the<00:01:48.860> one

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
well on the second half and the one

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.950 
well on the second half and the one
handling<00:01:49.370> the<00:01:49.550> movement<00:01:49.970> it<00:01:50.450> will<00:01:50.570> get<00:01:50.690> wit

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
handling the movement it will get wit

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.240

will<00:02:41.310> curve<00:02:41.550> was<00:02:41.790> out<00:02:41.970> so<00:02:42.240> we<00:02:42.360> have<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.540> spy<00:02:42.900> in

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
will curve was out so we have a spy in

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.870 
will curve was out so we have a spy in
which<00:02:45.000> we<00:02:45.540> inspire<00:02:45.960> Mike<00:02:46.290> we're<00:02:46.470> supposed<00:02:46.710> to

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
which we inspire Mike we're supposed to

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.130 
which we inspire Mike we're supposed to
so<00:02:47.880> we<00:02:48.030> could<00:02:48.180> have<00:02:48.270> had<00:02:48.360> a<00:02:48.390> guy<00:02:48.600> right<00:02:48.870> from

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140
