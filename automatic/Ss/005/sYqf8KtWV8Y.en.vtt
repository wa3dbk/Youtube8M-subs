by Hardy I have not really tested it out
yet<00:00:41.370> but<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.579> will<00:00:41.760> be<00:00:41.910> testing<00:00:42.239> out<00:00:42.329> very<00:00:42.540> soon

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
yet but I will be testing out very soon

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.020 
yet but I will be testing out very soon
cuz<00:00:43.260> I<00:00:43.440> just<00:00:43.469> move<00:00:43.829> these<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.280> side<00:00:44.700> and

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
cuz I just move these to the side and

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.520 
cuz I just move these to the side and
its<00:00:45.180> first<00:00:45.510> open<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:47.000> blue<00:00:48.000> controller<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
its first open the blue controller the

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:57.139 
its first open the blue controller the
run<00:00:50.360> the<00:00:51.360> soy<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.800> other<00:00:53.430> side<00:00:54.530> the<00:00:55.530> job<00:00:56.149> the

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
run the soy the other side the job the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.459 
run the soy the other side the job the
botton<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:59.129> bar<00:00:59.989> okay<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.050> it's<00:01:01.320> pretty

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
botton and the bar okay so it's pretty

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.500 
botton and the bar okay so it's pretty
simple<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.859> open<00:01:02.129> just<00:01:02.550> pull<00:01:02.789> up<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.180> flap

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
simple to open just pull up this flap

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.649 
simple to open just pull up this flap
over<00:01:03.719> here<00:01:04.199> open<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.739> up<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.309> voila

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
over here open it up and voila

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.539 
over here open it up and voila
you<00:01:06.750> can<00:01:06.930> see<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.290> top<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.950> controller

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
you can see the top of the controller

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.929 
you can see the top of the controller
then<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:10.760> guess<00:01:11.760> we<00:01:11.939> just<00:01:11.970> slide<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.840> out<00:01:13.939> pretty

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
then I guess we just slide it out pretty

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.490 
then I guess we just slide it out pretty
awesome<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:16.110> we<00:01:16.439> have<00:01:16.740> some<00:01:17.159> instructions

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
awesome and we have some instructions

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.700 
awesome and we have some instructions
the<00:01:20.180> instruction<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:22.020> there<00:01:22.290> are<00:01:22.409> cheese<00:01:22.590> in

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
the instruction so there are cheese in

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.370 
the instruction so there are cheese in
the<00:01:22.799> plastic<00:01:23.310> just<00:01:23.820> removed<00:01:24.240> what<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.259> heck

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
the plastic just removed what the heck

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.960 
the plastic just removed what the heck
oh<00:01:25.770> there<00:01:26.040> we<00:01:26.100> go<00:01:26.220> pretty<00:01:26.549> simple

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
oh there we go pretty simple

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.999 
oh there we go pretty simple
take<00:01:27.659> out<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.900> controller<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.530> water

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
take out the controller and water

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.190 
take out the controller and water
connects<00:01:29.759> it's<00:01:30.000> ready<00:01:30.210> for<00:01:30.360> your<00:01:30.720> canoes<00:01:30.960> oh
