00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.010
 Swipe a damp towel to remove 

00:00:07.349 --> 00:00:12.650
 remains of dead skin 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:16.250
 then moisturizes the lips with 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.380
 a little cocoa chooses a petrolatum 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.570
 profiler that is the same red as the 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.840
 lipstick that you are going to use and 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.500
 begins to delineate 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.330
 you can make small corrections 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.190
 so that your lips have a more shape 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.830
 definite 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.780
 if you prefer this lip technique 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:39.170
 It also looks great with colors like 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:42.109
 strong orange fuchsia or cherry 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.879
 If you have very dry lips before 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:46.489
 paint them you can prepare a 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.359
 gentle scrub with sugar and oil 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.359
 olive or honey 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.760
 once delineated contour starts 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.800
 fill all the lip 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.009
 this will make the color stay 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.140
 intact for more hours a brush of 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.510
 lips will help you paint them with more 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.120
 precision 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.560
 impregnated in the color and applied a fine 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.560
 layer all over the lip 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.660
 the technique that you are learning today is 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.240
 a great alternative to lipstick 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:33.140
 permanents that both dry out and damage 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.140
 lip skin 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.110
 apply the color with care so that 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.110
 is very well defined 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.420
 separates the two layers of a kleenex for 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.780
 stay with one and support the envelope 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.780
 lips 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.720
 with a finger the slight pressures on 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.670
 the lips so that the excess 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.670
 product is impregnated in the Kleenex 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.450
 a very small amount of powder 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.640
 loose translucent will help to fix the 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.640
 color remember to put very little 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.620
 then we will apply a 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.620
 thin layer of color 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.640
 and finally we will repeat the trick of 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.640
 Kleenex
