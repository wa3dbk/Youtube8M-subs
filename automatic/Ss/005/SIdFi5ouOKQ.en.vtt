00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:07.630 
with a dolphin this one's mine because I
like<00:02:05.390> dolphins<00:02:05.659> and<00:02:06.170> so<00:02:06.920> this<00:02:07.100> one<00:02:07.280> he<00:02:07.430> drew

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
like dolphins and so this one he drew

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.120 
like dolphins and so this one he drew
for<00:02:07.850> me<00:02:07.909> and<00:02:08.240> he<00:02:09.140> actually<00:02:09.289> did<00:02:09.710> these<00:02:09.860> back<00:02:10.100> in

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
for me and he actually did these back in

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.330 
for me and he actually did these back in
2001<00:02:11.060> so<00:02:11.660> he<00:02:12.350> hasn't<00:02:12.590> really<00:02:12.740> drawn<00:02:13.070> anything

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
2001 so he hasn't really drawn anything

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.840 
2001 so he hasn't really drawn anything
since<00:02:13.880> you<00:02:14.480> know<00:02:14.600> he's<00:02:14.780> so<00:02:14.960> busy<00:02:15.200> with<00:02:15.850> with

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
since you know he's so busy with with

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.089 
since you know he's so busy with with
being<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.630> YouTube<00:02:18.140> director<00:02:18.650> or<00:02:18.830> whatever

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
being the YouTube director or whatever

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.130 
being the YouTube director or whatever
he<00:02:19.849> just<00:02:20.000> doesn't<00:02:20.180> draw<00:02:20.480> anymore<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:21.019> it's

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
he just doesn't draw anymore and it's

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.380 
he just doesn't draw anymore and it's
unfortunate

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
unfortunate

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.080 
unfortunate
was<00:02:22.600> a<00:02:22.630> poster<00:02:23.290> that<00:02:23.319> he<00:02:23.620> started<00:02:24.190> about<00:02:24.430> four

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
was a poster that he started about four

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.510 
was a poster that he started about four
years<00:02:25.150> ago<00:02:25.600> and<00:02:26.200> as<00:02:26.500> you<00:02:26.560> can<00:02:26.950> see<00:02:26.980> there's<00:02:27.430> a

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
years ago and as you can see there's a

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.400 
years ago and as you can see there's a
lot<00:02:27.700> of<00:02:27.730> empty<00:02:28.209> space<00:02:28.480> that<00:02:28.930> needs<00:02:29.050> to<00:02:29.290> be

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
lot of empty space that needs to be

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.370 
lot of empty space that needs to be
filled<00:02:29.650> in<00:02:29.890> I<00:02:30.130> think<00:02:30.700> he<00:02:30.850> should<00:02:31.090> get<00:02:31.870> up<00:02:32.080> get

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
filled in I think he should get up get

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.460 
filled in I think he should get up get
into<00:02:32.709> that<00:02:32.800> and<00:02:33.330> try<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:34.450> take<00:02:34.600> some<00:02:34.810> time<00:02:34.840> to

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470
