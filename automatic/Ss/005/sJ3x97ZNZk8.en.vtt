00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.950
 and how am I mou and that day I'm going to 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:10.210
 teach how to get the resident trophy and 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:13.599
 2 hdr master like the palm of my hand or 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:16.090
 which in English would be every look and 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:18.189
 create and first of all I have to 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.580
 say that the trophy is quite tedious 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:24.010
 the truth is that I think you 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.869
 trophies more headache 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:31.000
 they gave me in fact it was the last 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:34.239
 that I got because the description does not 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.489
 they say nothing confuses confuse a lot 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.010
 the description tells us that we have to 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.170
 visit all the places on the map as 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.780
 that's not really true what we have 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.879
 What to do is collect all the items that 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.059
 there is on the map that is to say anything 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:51.160
 as well as key items such as 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.230
 defense items and also the archives 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.720
 you have to collect absolutely everything from 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:59.049
 map the good thing is that on the map we are 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:02.820
 mark a red color when we 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:05.920
 we do not have the items that should 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.350
 have in that place in the part of the map 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.040
 When we have not obtained them, the map 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.900
 You will mark red once we have all 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.370
 the items of that place because the map goes to 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.820
 change color 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.250
 I strongly suggest you do this and 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.370
 that you leave it for the end practically 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.190
 this trophy because too tedious 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:31.360
 I suggest you do it on the difficulty 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:33.580
 or at the hardest level in heart and you 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.730
 you will tell me but go down because mobile and good 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:41.110
 in heart there are many fewer items of 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:43.270
 defense as of life and therefore and 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.000
 ammunition too and therefore there are 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.800
 less and we have to pick up then you 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.460
 I suggest you do the difficulty 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:56.770
 more difficult and also that you occupy agile already 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:02:01.159
 that you will have 22 extra slot to be able 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:04.369
 get this this trophy you'll see 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.829
 once the button is lit 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:10.759
 self - destruction of the laboratory no longer 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:13.640
 you will be able to return to the mansion or 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.670
 you will not be able to return 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.180
 I suggest that before leaving the mansion 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.730
 What is it that everything on the map is 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.890
 travel and that has changed color 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.989
 you have to search in every corner there 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.480
 many there are many items that are 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.150
 hidden in blind spots you have to 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.640
 go in many corners looking for you 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.299
 I also suggest that once you leave a 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:42.440
 room or a corridor or a corridor 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:44.810
 I know it's the map and see if the room the 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.180
 bedroom the corridor or the place from where 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.400
 come already has changed color because that 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.829
 it will mean that there are no more items 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.270
 what to look for in that place and if they make you 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:57.360
 it's missing because it goes back 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.640
 check every corner this trophy 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.590
 you jump immediately you take the 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.590
 flares on the helipad 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.780
 that's where they give it to you so I'll give you 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.190
 I suggest again that before 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.280
 that you do anything before 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.770
 face up and check the map and 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.040
 that the map is like the color that 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.020
 you saw in the video where you can already see 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.030
 that there is no red part and that 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.860
 all the items have been collected 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.620
 I hope this video has served you 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:31.250
 to know what to do in 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.470
 this trophy and if you need any 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.270
 orientation or have any questions about 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.630
 how to get a trophy for me 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.810
 they can let me know by leaving me in the 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.860
 comment box there is a little and I 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.410
 quickly as soon as possible 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.260
 I'll answer you what can be done 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:52.459
 as you saw in the video as you will see in the 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:55.519
 video at the end I get the platinum trophy 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.290
 which is the doctorate in resident iva and 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.410
 I can honestly tell you that the 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.580
 more tedious was this trophy was that of 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.670
 like the palm of my hand 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.770
 and even much harder than 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:11.760
 determine it on hard difficulty or the 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:14.070
 to end it in river the survivor that 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.040
 I feel it is the second most difficult of 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:19.890
 all the trophies that this has 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.650
 videogame the favorite videogame my 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:25.860
 favorite video game of the entire saga of 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:29.820
 resident and 2 and that has been a pleasure 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:33.570

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.660
 also tell you how you can get this 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.870
