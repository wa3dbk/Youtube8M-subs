well right here I distressed the edge

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.719 
well right here I distressed the edge
because<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.930> exacto<00:01:13.380> knife<00:01:13.530> would<00:01:13.710> cut<00:01:13.770> with

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
because the exacto knife would cut with

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.390 
because the exacto knife would cut with
these<00:01:14.939> curves<00:01:15.270> very<00:01:15.630> well<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.530> kind<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.250> hit
