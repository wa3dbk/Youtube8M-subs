 Hello 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.079
 to be 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.460
 when they say that the transalp sling is 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.460
 one of the best bikes in the world 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.670

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.220
 especially for the board Silver 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.830
 the golden layer

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.079
 true 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.950

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.670
 please 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:49.970

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.319
 Wine understand and explain to people 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.129
 with this 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:57.130
 in all grades we have and how it 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.820

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.970
 a movie 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.980
 and ready to give of himself 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.980
 one touch 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:55.450
 because when you tighten 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.450

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.160
 paquito h 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.580

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.260
