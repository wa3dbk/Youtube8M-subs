home<00:02:37.190> and<00:02:37.250> I<00:02:37.520> actually<00:02:37.700> opened<00:02:38.330> them<00:02:38.450> up<00:02:38.569> and

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
home and I actually opened them up and

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.290 
home and I actually opened them up and
looked<00:02:39.020> looked<00:02:39.650> at<00:02:39.800> the<00:02:40.010> sizing<00:02:40.550> they're<00:02:41.090> all

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
looked looked at the sizing they're all

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.990 
looked looked at the sizing they're all
very<00:02:41.780> uniform<00:02:42.379> in<00:02:42.440> shape<00:02:42.500> there<00:02:43.370> is<00:02:43.400> not<00:02:43.760> any

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
very uniform in shape there is not any

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.920 
very uniform in shape there is not any
that's<00:02:44.330> like<00:02:46.030> out<00:02:47.030> of<00:02:47.090> shape<00:02:47.420> whatever<00:02:47.720> and

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
that's like out of shape whatever and

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.360 
that's like out of shape whatever and
the<00:02:48.260> reason<00:02:48.620> I<00:02:48.709> was<00:02:48.830> a<00:02:48.860> little<00:02:49.069> worried<00:02:49.280> about

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
the reason I was a little worried about

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.460 
the reason I was a little worried about
that<00:02:49.700> because<00:02:49.910> usually<00:02:50.300> the<00:02:50.569> crach<00:02:50.930> if<00:02:51.319> I'm

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
that because usually the crach if I'm

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.680 
that because usually the crach if I'm
saying<00:02:51.680> that<00:02:51.830> right<00:02:52.060> that<00:02:53.060> name-brand<00:02:53.420> right

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
saying that right that name-brand right

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.290 
saying that right that name-brand right
