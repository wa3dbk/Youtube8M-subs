much just think about if you've been

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.070 
working hard you've been consistent
you're<00:02:34.550> really<00:02:34.970> putting<00:02:35.180> in<00:02:35.360> your<00:02:35.390> time<00:02:35.750> and

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
you're really putting in your time and

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.130 
you're really putting in your time and
you're<00:02:36.650> doing<00:02:36.770> quite<00:02:37.400> well<00:02:37.459> and<00:02:37.970> you<00:02:38.780> were<00:02:38.900> to

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
you're doing quite well and you were to

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.479 
you're doing quite well and you were to
measure<00:02:39.320> body<00:02:39.590> fat<00:02:39.770> let's<00:02:40.100> just<00:02:40.250> say<00:02:40.340> it's

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
measure body fat let's just say it's

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.630 
measure body fat let's just say it's
twelve<00:02:40.910> percent<00:02:41.540> and<00:02:41.870> then<00:02:42.800> you<00:02:43.190> did<00:02:43.340> another

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
twelve percent and then you did another

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.900 
twelve percent and then you did another
three<00:02:44.300> weeks<00:02:44.330> with<00:02:44.840> that<00:02:45.020> same<00:02:45.410> type<00:02:45.830> of<00:02:45.910> focus

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
three weeks with that same type of focus

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.290 
three weeks with that same type of focus
intensity<00:02:47.810> that<00:02:47.930> effort<00:02:48.350> and<00:02:49.000> you<00:02:50.000> really

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
intensity that effort and you really

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.040 
intensity that effort and you really
think<00:02:50.480> that<00:02:50.510> number<00:02:50.840> should<00:02:50.870> be

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
think that number should be

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.380 
think that number should be
significantly<00:02:51.709> less<00:02:51.950> you<00:02:52.700> could<00:02:52.970> very<00:02:53.270> well

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
significantly less you could very well

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.540 
significantly less you could very well
get<00:02:53.690> your<00:02:53.810> body<00:02:54.050> fat<00:02:54.320> tested<00:02:54.860> three<00:02:55.519> weeks

get your body fat tested three weeks

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.949 
get your body fat tested three weeks
later<00:02:55.940> and<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:57.590> could<00:02:57.830> be<00:02:58.070> a<00:02:58.340> lot<00:02:59.269> higher<00:02:59.600> than

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
later and you could be a lot higher than

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.830 
later and you could be a lot higher than
that<00:03:00.230> or<00:03:00.470> at<00:03:00.920> least<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.370> same<00:03:01.840> alright

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
then you were to get on that scale and

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.630 
then you were to get on that scale and
that<00:04:56.870> number<00:04:57.290> whatever<00:04:57.800> number<00:04:58.130> that<00:04:58.280> is<00:04:58.430> is

deserve all of a sudden now you look in
the<00:05:16.550> mirror<00:05:16.730> in<00:05:16.880> your<00:05:17.030> mind<00:05:17.480> plays<00:05:17.690> tricks<00:05:17.720> on

see in the mirror so using that form of

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.120 
see in the mirror so using that form of
measurement<00:05:23.510> certainly<00:05:24.440> didn't<00:05:24.740> help<00:05:24.860> you

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
on the scale and there was a very

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.930 
on the scale and there was a very
complimentary<00:05:30.920> number<00:05:31.280> it<00:05:31.460> was<00:05:31.580> a<00:05:31.610> great

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
complimentary number it was a great

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.700

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
he got in front of the mirror and you

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.900 
he got in front of the mirror and you

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.200 
didn't like what you saw you didn't
think<00:05:38.120> that<00:05:38.450> that<00:05:39.320> number<00:05:39.650> was<00:05:40.580> a<00:05:40.940> good

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
think that that number was a good

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.120 
think that that number was a good
indication<00:05:41.690> of<00:05:41.960> what<00:05:42.110> you<00:05:42.200> look<00:05:42.230> like<00:05:42.410> you

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
indication of what you look like you

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:44.530 
indication of what you look like you
weren't<00:05:43.400> happy<00:05:43.760> with<00:05:43.880> the<00:05:44.000> way<00:05:44.090> that<00:05:44.240> you<00:05:44.360> look

weren't happy with the way that you look

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.660 
weren't happy with the way that you look
would<00:05:45.200> that<00:05:45.940> great<00:05:46.940> number<00:05:47.360> on<00:05:47.600> the<00:05:48.170> scale

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:48.670 
would that great number on the scale

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.220 
would that great number on the scale
really<00:05:49.670> change<00:05:50.240> the<00:05:50.450> way<00:05:50.540> you<00:05:50.600> felt<00:05:50.930> about

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.230 
really change the way you felt about

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.040 
really change the way you felt about
your<00:05:51.890> efforts<00:05:52.250> the<00:05:52.760> same<00:05:53.030> could<00:05:53.360> be<00:05:53.390> said<00:05:53.510> with

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
your efforts the same could be said with

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.830 
your efforts the same could be said with
body<00:05:54.260> fat<00:05:54.500> percentages<00:05:55.130> so<00:05:55.970> the<00:05:56.300> mirror<00:05:56.660> is<00:05:56.810> a

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
body fat percentages so the mirror is a

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.510 
body fat percentages so the mirror is a
much<00:05:57.380> better<00:05:57.910> guy<00:05:58.910> a<00:05:59.530> much<00:06:00.530> better<00:06:00.860> way<00:06:01.040> to

much better guy a much better way to
