00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:45.969 
want to use it with a compact camera so

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:48.929 
want to use it with a compact camera so
you<00:01:46.060> don't<00:01:46.329> have<00:01:46.569> to<00:01:46.810> use<00:01:46.990> it<00:01:47.200> with<00:01:47.950> the<00:01:48.249> iphone

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.899 
you don't have to use it with the iphone
4<00:01:49.270> so<00:01:50.109> fitting<00:01:50.409> the<00:01:50.499> iphone<00:01:50.859> 4<00:01:51.219> we<00:01:51.520> have<00:01:51.670> to

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
4 so fitting the iphone 4 we have to

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:53.910 
4 so fitting the iphone 4 we have to
take<00:01:52.450> this<00:01:52.630> top<00:01:52.840> portion<00:01:53.079> out<00:01:53.380> you<00:01:53.590> saw<00:01:53.740> me

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
take this top portion out you saw me

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.410 
take this top portion out you saw me
slide<00:01:54.189> that<00:01:54.340> out<00:01:54.460> earlier<00:01:54.639> let<00:01:55.149> me<00:01:55.210> show<00:01:55.389> you

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
slide that out earlier let me show you

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.620 
slide that out earlier let me show you
again<00:01:55.780> so<00:01:56.560> this<00:01:56.710> sort<00:01:56.950> of<00:01:56.979> clips<00:01:57.880> out<00:01:58.119> like<00:01:58.329> so

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
again so this sort of clips out like so

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.169 
again so this sort of clips out like so
and<00:01:59.289> then<00:01:59.319> this<00:01:59.710> bottom<00:02:00.069> section<00:02:00.100> clips<00:02:00.969> out

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
and then this bottom section clips out

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:06.300 
and then this bottom section clips out
like<00:02:01.420> so<00:02:01.829> then<00:02:02.829> we<00:02:03.159> can<00:02:03.579> put<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.719> iphone<00:02:05.560> 4

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
like so then we can put the iphone 4

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.300 
like so then we can put the iphone 4
into<00:02:06.819> the<00:02:06.850> case<00:02:07.149> it's<00:02:07.899> quite<00:02:08.200> a<00:02:08.229> rigid<00:02:08.709> plastic

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
into the case it's quite a rigid plastic

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.449 
into the case it's quite a rigid plastic
so<00:02:10.300> do<00:02:10.720> be<00:02:10.750> careful<00:02:11.140> when<00:02:11.890> you'll<00:02:12.040> fit<00:02:12.250> in<00:02:12.280> your

it on to the gorillaz stand and we do

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.980 
it on to the gorillaz stand and we do
this<00:03:35.950> I<00:03:36.190> think<00:03:36.310> just<00:03:36.820> by<00:03:36.970> sliding<00:03:37.030> it<00:03:37.630> on<00:03:37.750> if<00:03:37.870> i

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
this I think just by sliding it on if i

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.210 
this I think just by sliding it on if i
remember<00:03:38.170> right<00:03:38.500> there<00:03:38.680> you<00:03:38.770> can<00:03:38.890> put<00:03:39.010> it<00:03:39.100> in

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
remember right there you can put it in

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.510 
remember right there you can put it in
either<00:03:39.810> orientation<00:03:40.810> and<00:03:41.190> it's<00:03:42.190> just<00:03:42.430> a

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
either orientation and it's just a

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.860 
either orientation and it's just a
simple<00:03:42.970> matter<00:03:43.180> of<00:03:44.850> sliding<00:03:45.850> it<00:03:46.090> on<00:03:46.210> as<00:03:46.540> far<00:03:46.750> as

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
simple matter of sliding it on as far as

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.060 
simple matter of sliding it on as far as
i<00:03:46.930> can<00:03:46.990> remember<00:03:47.170> there<00:03:47.500> we<00:03:47.590> go<00:03:47.710> so<00:03:47.890> there's

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
i can remember there we go so there's

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.540 
i can remember there we go so there's
like<00:03:48.220> a<00:03:48.250> slide<00:03:49.150> on<00:03:49.180> point<00:03:49.690> at<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:49.990> end<00:03:50.020> and<00:03:50.550> we

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
like a slide on point at the end and we

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.050 
like a slide on point at the end and we
just<00:03:51.760> slide<00:03:52.060> it<00:03:52.270> into<00:03:52.480> place<00:03:52.750> like<00:03:53.170> so<00:03:53.910> move<00:03:54.910> it

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
just slide it into place like so move it

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.110 
just slide it into place like so move it
into<00:03:55.180> the<00:03:55.390> sort<00:03:56.140> of<00:03:56.200> middle<00:03:56.410> position<00:03:56.920> of<00:03:57.820> the

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
into the sort of middle position of the

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.900 
into the sort of middle position of the
ipod<00:03:58.600> like<00:03:58.960> so<00:03:59.350> or<00:03:59.680> the<00:03:59.830> iphone<00:04:00.580> as<00:04:00.760> we're

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
ipod like so or the iphone as we're

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.000 
ipod like so or the iphone as we're
testing<00:04:01.240> the<00:04:01.270> iphone<00:04:01.750> one<00:04:01.930> let's<00:04:02.740> move<00:04:02.890> it

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
testing the iphone one let's move it

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.840 
testing the iphone one let's move it
along<00:04:03.100> a<00:04:03.310> little<00:04:03.370> bit<00:04:03.610> more<00:04:05.400> it<00:04:06.400> won't<00:04:06.700> move

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
along a little bit more it won't move

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.730 
along a little bit more it won't move
along<00:04:07.090> anymore<00:04:07.330> so<00:04:07.960> not<00:04:08.320> particularly

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
along anymore so not particularly

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.200 
along anymore so not particularly
impressed<00:04:09.040> with<00:04:09.220> that<00:04:09.250> but<00:04:09.970> here<00:04:10.090> we<00:04:10.180> go

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:10.210 
impressed with that but here we go

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.730 
impressed with that but here we go
spread<00:04:10.960> the<00:04:11.080> legs<00:04:11.110> out<00:04:11.530> like<00:04:11.800> so<00:04:12.280> and<00:04:13.590> we<00:04:14.590> can

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
spread the legs out like so and we can

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.530 
spread the legs out like so and we can
get<00:04:14.890> this<00:04:15.040> into<00:04:15.340> position<00:04:15.790> so<00:04:15.940> you<00:04:16.270> can<00:04:16.390> see

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
get this into position so you can see

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.849 
get this into position so you can see

here I've got a couple of folders of
photography<00:04:18.400> applications<00:04:19.030> for<00:04:19.270> the<00:04:19.330> ends<00:04:19.450> of

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
photography applications for the ends of

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.200 
photography applications for the ends of
the<00:04:19.630> first<00:04:19.870> one<00:04:20.109> absolutely<00:04:21.010> full<00:04:21.340> second

the first one absolutely full second

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.000 
the first one absolutely full second
one's<00:04:22.360> got<00:04:22.540> a<00:04:22.570> couple<00:04:22.780> of<00:04:22.960> Jobi<00:04:23.380> applications

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
one's got a couple of Jobi applications

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.950 
one's got a couple of Jobi applications
in<00:04:24.190> one<00:04:24.700> of<00:04:24.730> them's<00:04:24.970> their<00:04:25.150> original<00:04:25.660> gorilla

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
in one of them's their original gorilla

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.200 
in one of them's their original gorilla
cam<00:04:26.230> the<00:04:26.770> other<00:04:26.920> one<00:04:27.100> is<00:04:27.130> their<00:04:27.430> new<00:04:27.640> frame<00:04:27.970> by

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
cam the other one is their new frame by

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.960 
cam the other one is their new frame by
frame<00:04:28.680> so<00:04:29.680> you<00:04:29.830> can<00:04:29.950> see<00:04:30.100> that<00:04:30.130> loading<00:04:30.820> up<00:04:30.940> now

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.030 
frame so you can see that loading up now
and<00:04:31.540> then<00:04:31.990> you've<00:04:32.140> got<00:04:32.169> the<00:04:32.380> settings<00:04:32.740> you<00:04:32.919> got

going to result in a six second movie so
we're<00:05:15.669> going<00:05:15.790> to<00:05:15.850> use<00:05:15.970> my<00:05:16.000> little<00:05:16.450> figure<00:05:16.690> that

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
we're going to use my little figure that

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.260 
we're going to use my little figure that
I've<00:05:16.900> got<00:05:17.080> here<00:05:17.440> we're<00:05:18.220> going<00:05:18.310> to<00:05:18.400> say<00:05:18.580> that

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
I've got here we're going to say that

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.320 
I've got here we're going to say that
we've<00:05:19.650> happy<00:05:20.650> with<00:05:20.800> our<00:05:20.950> settings<00:05:21.370> and<00:05:22.180> we're

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
we've happy with our settings and we're

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.900 
we've happy with our settings and we're
going<00:05:22.450> to<00:05:22.479> tap<00:05:22.720> Done<00:05:23.430> so<00:05:24.430> it's<00:05:24.550> going<00:05:24.639> to<00:05:24.729> take

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
going to tap Done so it's going to take

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.320 
going to tap Done so it's going to take
one<00:05:25.270> every<00:05:26.250> second<00:05:27.250> so<00:05:27.700> I'm<00:05:27.880> not<00:05:28.060> going<00:05:28.210> to<00:05:28.270> be

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
one every second so I'm not going to be

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.909 
one every second so I'm not going to be
able<00:05:28.360> to<00:05:28.570> get<00:05:28.660> my<00:05:28.750> hand<00:05:28.990> out<00:05:29.110> short<00:05:29.470> on<00:05:29.560> every

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
able to get my hand out short on every

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:31.500 
able to get my hand out short on every
single<00:05:30.220> one<00:05:30.400> normally<00:05:30.940> you<00:05:31.090> would<00:05:31.240> set<00:05:31.479> a

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
single one normally you would set a

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.010 
single one normally you would set a
longer<00:05:31.990> delay<00:05:32.190> let's<00:05:33.190> take<00:05:33.400> this<00:05:33.520> going<00:05:34.020> so

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
longer delay let's take this going so

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.550 
longer delay let's take this going so
it's<00:05:35.110> same<00:05:35.290> one<00:05:35.590> two<00:05:36.430> three<00:05:37.300> and<00:05:38.020> I'm<00:05:38.110> moving

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
it's same one two three and I'm moving

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.590 
it's same one two three and I'm moving
this<00:05:38.680> in<00:05:38.860> little<00:05:39.100> increments<00:05:39.330> now<00:05:40.330> normally

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 
this in little increments now normally

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.170 
this in little increments now normally
you<00:05:41.050> would<00:05:41.169> have<00:05:41.400> longer<00:05:42.400> increments<00:05:43.090> that

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
you would have longer increments that

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.719 
you would have longer increments that
you<00:05:43.419> could<00:05:43.539> get<00:05:43.660> your<00:05:43.810> hand<00:05:44.110> out<00:05:44.350> shot<00:05:44.710> so<00:05:45.669> you

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
you could get your hand out shot so you

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.510 
you could get your hand out shot so you
maybe<00:05:46.060> would<00:05:46.330> set<00:05:46.539> it<00:05:46.570> to<00:05:46.960> two<00:05:47.710> seconds<00:05:48.370> or

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
maybe would set it to two seconds or

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.909 
maybe would set it to two seconds or
five<00:05:48.820> seconds<00:05:49.390> but<00:05:49.539> I<00:05:50.110> just<00:05:50.350> wanted<00:05:50.650> to<00:05:50.710> keep

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
five seconds but I just wanted to keep

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.040 
five seconds but I just wanted to keep
this<00:05:51.070> nice<00:05:51.310> and<00:05:51.370> short<00:05:51.760> for<00:05:52.090> you<00:05:52.240> so<00:05:52.900> you<00:05:52.960> can

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
this nice and short for you so you can

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.880 
this nice and short for you so you can
see<00:05:53.440> me<00:05:53.680> moving<00:05:54.160> him<00:05:54.430> across<00:05:54.669> and<00:05:55.470> as<00:05:56.470> I<00:05:56.740> say

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:56.890 
see me moving him across and as I say

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.580 
see me moving him across and as I say
normally<00:05:57.430> you<00:05:57.789> would<00:05:57.910> take<00:05:58.120> your<00:05:58.419> hand<00:05:59.140> out<00:05:59.530> of

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590 
normally you would take your hand out of

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.570 
normally you would take your hand out of
shot<00:06:00.039> for<00:06:00.850> every<00:06:01.150> single<00:06:01.720> frame<00:06:02.430> so<00:06:03.430> we're

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
shot for every single frame so we're

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.129 
shot for every single frame so we're
halfway<00:06:03.789> through<00:06:06.539> this<00:06:07.539> is<00:06:07.750> going<00:06:07.900> to<00:06:07.960> give

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:08.139 
halfway through this is going to give

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:10.730 
halfway through this is going to give
you<00:06:08.229> a<00:06:08.260> good<00:06:08.560> idea<00:06:08.590> of<00:06:09.060> how<00:06:10.060> the<00:06:10.120> application

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
you a good idea of how the application

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.800 
you a good idea of how the application
works<00:06:11.740> the<00:06:12.430> fact<00:06:12.669> that<00:06:12.729> we're<00:06:12.910> on<00:06:13.090> the<00:06:13.330> gorilla

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
works the fact that we're on the gorilla

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.590
