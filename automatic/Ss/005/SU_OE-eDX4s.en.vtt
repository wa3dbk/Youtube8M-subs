00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:14.120
 good president as harmoniously saintly 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:16.699
 well fine team we come little by little 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.440
 after a hard preseason putting together 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.750
 the team giving the identity they want 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.800
 the teacher but calm with the 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.830
 results we carry several matches 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.230
 undefeated counting the cup 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.339
 friendly and good they have us satisfied 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.960
 and improving little by little 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:31.789
 let's talk about the foreigner who brought the last 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.060
 How will the negotiation be when 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.100
 it arrives as it is the teacher's request 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.350
 profe who is the player and in that order 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.050
 we gave it the task of getting 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.390
 his full name is franco razzotti 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.540
 frankly right if player left 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:51.720
 champion in vélez sarfield with gareca 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.730
 went to europe romania return and good 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.810
 let's hope he did preseason 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.910
 with vélez 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.920
 will not have to try to have it on 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.840
 Tuesday here in Bogota so that 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.530
 start to start and start working with 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.630
 the group 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.070
 with this reason contracting and it 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.890
 close cycle of hiring alone 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.990
 there are still some surprises I would believe 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.500
 that if you would not believe that if what happens 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.100
 is that he is a player that the truth he believes 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:21.730
 that we need in the sense that 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.870
 so we have the 5 daniel suddenly he 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.030
 you also have a player 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.400
 temperament and I find it and also we 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.930
 you can take the right hand drive 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.880
 right then what would you say that 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.680
 we are ready chef if there is no replacement 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.970
 to omar pérez and I get carved 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.570
 perfectly the payroll that has 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.460
 Exactly that do not believe it or not there 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.590
 We have Ferreira is doing a good 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.590
 paper and arming vargas also 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.960
 Finally 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.510
 this is a short tournament in which 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.119
 we have to work with the base that 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.729
 we come and look at rest in 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.890
 positions that we believe of 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.409
 soon we need the two strikers 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.550
 they arrived interesting both morelos 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.150
 as 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.220
 as a rangel and in that order, I think that 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.990
 with leather and with medina above and with 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.900
 darío rodríguez we are complete as 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.240
 anda wilder well came from an injury already 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.030
 started doing work this week that 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.070
 happened I would think that on Wednesday it's going to 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.900
 play the cup game because we have 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.490
 with equity we have spoken throughout 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.200
 the week on the subject of subscribers 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.090
 what I am, I think it was a very 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.820
 nice example like this on that subject 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.520
 holy faith thinking about what remains of very 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.920
 well that is very well very well very well 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:39.480
 we are very satisfied with the 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.370
 reborn of the santafereño spirit 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.710
 many people I've seen paid 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.350
 reflected in the box is important not 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:50.200
 I have the ball, I do not have the amount but 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.360
 yes I know that financially it is a value 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.430
 generous and important for the coffers of 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.520
 holy faith all the people subscribed 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.310
 we still continue with the fertilizers of 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.290
 next week, we hope that 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.810
 people who have not subscribed and 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.210
 comedian used in numbers as he walks the 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.800
 budget with the line of investment 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.870
 of holy faith for this semester or for 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.540
 season how to handle all this is 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.120
 manage annual and we do not have 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:20.200
 no difficulty in that part that 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.420
 means no but I do not believe 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.560
 had I do not we are not I or is it already created 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.060

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.930

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.610

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.860
 always know that players 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.510
 adapt 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.340
 quickly to what you put the 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.470
 directives in this case to the new technician 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.420

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.720
