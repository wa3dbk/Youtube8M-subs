00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.629
 youtube inspiration 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.820
 I was at idea yesterday and there I am 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.530
 me this sleazy girl or lv 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.509
 discovered for the special price of 89 since 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.770
 I could not resist there and have 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.150
 bought it and I wanted to 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.560
 try again with the embroidery 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.260
 I've got you guys a couple of times already 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.090
 things shown with the embroidery and today 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.840
 then simply wanted this writing-case times 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.050
 beautify 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.939
 I have her light blue thread for that 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:34.140
 pink thread and lille on the tree 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.329
 follow and that is relatively thin it 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.059
 must be so thin that it through 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.760
 I also have a needle through which fits 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.860
 A pencil is the first thing you think about 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.469
 which pattern you would like to have and 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.210
 I want to sleep here the simple 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.280
 a girl with a side so a bit 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.620
 I decorate it with a zigzag 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.410
 First of all, I'll crack it with me 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.520
 a pencil and that's for both 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.520
 be with me 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.570
 so that I have zigzag pattern 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.360
 I have painted and my thread is yes 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.790
 already pulled through the needle and 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.300
 Now I cut myself a bit from the 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.740
 thread off 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.840
 not long but not too short 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:25.740
 and I'm here at the end of the thread 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.740
 a knot is best for a double 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:35.110
 then I just sit from the inside 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:38.100
 and because the needle is the one united 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.100
 recording 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.829
 the zigzag pattern is relative 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.110
 That's why I'm just standing there 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.970
 here at the next tip something completely 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.140
 one should still not big 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.390
 make intermediate steps 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.840
 but here I am at the top 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.840
 on 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.909
 then I stand at the next tip 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.909
 on 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.720
 bring 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.940
 and now I stand back with it 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.510
 then really my zig zag pattern 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.510
 arise 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.760
 then I stand again at the next 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.760
 top one 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.500
 and then I'll put it back 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.310
 next peak 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.730
 and back stitch 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.870
 the all sides finished and now do 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.730
 I continue on the other side 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.730
 but then you have to change the color 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.640
 I still want the page here 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.960
 I already decorate for it 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.860
 that a little something again 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:09.930
 painted I want there is such a 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.380
 small flowers or as a star back 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.700
 do 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:17.100
 Now I have forgotten so again 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.760
 praise and from behind 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.230
 here a fairy tale so I want 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.780
 here in the middle of such a small circle 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.580
 and from there they went after 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.780
 outside and I would like to in 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.780
 make different colors 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.710
 so they are a bit weird 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.100
 but actually I have it that way 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.870
 Also presented is a bit 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:52.660
 certain flower or in other after 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:56.040
 do not look quite even throughout 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:58.660
 different lengths stretch around 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.090
 and that fits very well color here 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.450
 also pulls says and I think it is 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:06.340
 really beautiful pencil and 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.960
 I think it's easy again 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.010
 It's such a bad pencil case 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.340
 can beautify 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:14.230
 perhaps he had also girls what you 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.610
 Not at all so much like and 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.290
 You're in the mood for something 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.690
 and you can really get everything 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:23.320
 possible on it because I do that 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:25.150
 just with a pencil and then try 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:28.150
 to put it back and forth carefully 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:31.200
 So first in and then from below again 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:33.780
 then close the gap 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.670
 I really enjoy it 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.380
 maybe you want to do something like that 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:39.389
 maybe I could give you one 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.250
 give some suggestions if it is yours 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:42.780
 I like it because it gives me a thumb 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.030
 we look up into the 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.770
 comments on how you find that and if you 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.990
 We also like to embroider lately 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.730
 something tuned embroidered off 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.040
 it's all in the comments 

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:55.080
 I'm really excited about that and 

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.520
 otherwise my other videos will do the same 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.950
 Also watch the other videos for sure 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:02.310
 For example, at the pocket of a trousers 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:03.630
 So what does it look like? 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.530
 Otherwise see us next time 

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.530
 bye bye again
