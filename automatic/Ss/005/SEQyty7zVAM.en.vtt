00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 remains of two fighters and details of the British 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.259
 tank Vallentyne found the island skie 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.910
 search engines at the village of muzzles in March 44 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.429
 there were fierce battles 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.650
 11 combat vehicles with crew members 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.389
 then missing now 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.820
 search engines intend to recover at least 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.550
 one exhibit armored vehicles will continue 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.130
 Victoria Parfenova something that once was 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.289
 mighty valentine tank now just 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.939
 mosaic island search engines squads 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.340
 collected on the ground fighting pieces of iron 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.560
 caterpillar cannon trunks of two tanks 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.079
 even partially managed to know their fate 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.579
 equipment of this type was supplied to the USSR 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.020
 during the second world war and 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.730
 united states of america 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.040
 Pskov region did not participate in battles 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.340
 beyond the village of the muzzles to the island of the sky region 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.000
 in March 44 11 cars with crews were gone 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.590
 without a trace 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.289
 Now search engines want to restore 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:54.270
 tanks using only the parts found 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:56.190
 already this year began together but it 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.989
 get brides because we do not 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.670
 we want to insert on water 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.530
 we want to deliver the details only those 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.379
 who here found let it be 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.510
 broken I pass it will be more expensive on and but 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.310
 it will be present the details are going 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.260
 they are pretty good in principle 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.330
 after the war the collective farmers 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.280
 blew the technique remaining in the fields 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.170
 so the pieces were scattered on the big 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.090
 squares get them to search engines 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.040
 had out of the water and mud mikhail 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.869
 Lukashevich even used diving 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.760
 wetsuit because fond of 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.670
 spear fishing therefore 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.890
 there is a wetsuit so itâ€™s all in it 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.230
 take it easy at least do not freeze 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.080
 the ice was frozen in places was still 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.300
 it is necessary to cut down to clear parts of tanks 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.440
 found in water with 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.230
 metal detectors as noted by search engines 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.300
 in places where there were fights the whole land rings and 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.510
 only a professional can decide the right ones 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.430
 here the diggers are not there live near the 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.010
 sky's shards of armor with pieces of armor 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.780
 life is our Soviet Casco except helmets 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.840
 the remains of two fighters were found and 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.000
 most likely these are soldiers of 813 rifle 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.650
 the regiment which is in june forty-fourth 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.200
 fought here earlier in the same territory 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:06.820
 A group of fallen warriors has already been found. 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:10.179
 same unit let's say we find 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:13.000
 something with the names of someone we are 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.010
 surnames with awards and with documents of persons 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.800
 signed things we try right away 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.209
 go to relatives here in the past 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.790
 year were relatives 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.209
 I found this stick which I 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.160
 told 713 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.520
 the year before, too, with a free kick 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.650
 battalion 14 also started it off from and 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.230
 relatives of the Vologda region 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.270
 for 25 years of work island and search engines 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.530
 raised and reburied the remains of more 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.390
 two thousand fighters 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.820
 give the same newly found land 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.560
 warriors decided in the summer on this experts 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.630
 try to find relatives true 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.700
 admit that it is unlikely to succeed 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.370
 dead there were no nominal items not 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.480
 personal belongings Victoria Parfenova Sergey 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.480
 clerks to keep holidays
