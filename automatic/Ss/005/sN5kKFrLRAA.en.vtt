00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.870
 yes 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.870
 and 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.760
 or the Spartan and expert hour 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.230
 let's do an experiment on 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.600
 experiment of the end of me phase 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.050
 of coins from my off 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:32.340
 we take everything to the ghost team and see 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:35.910
 why are you doing that what uncle was the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.100
 bottom of platoon fell unintentionally god 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.550
 who days and leave your comment with 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.550
 the dog 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.790
 good we carry 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.120
 so you can see 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:56.020
 manet as it is called my game gear and 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:01:00.100
 chandeleur and the plan but good we arrived 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:02.860
 to this avante because it eliminates pokemon 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.260
 ghost then let's make a 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.470
 experiment I have to pay 5 shifts but 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.470
 we are an experiment we pay 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.470
 yes 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.280
 come on let's have 15 turns 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.750
 the party does not scare you should not help 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.020
 I would put this here to go heating up 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:31.109
 bonnet or it could be the profit for that 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.409
 here we remove tam and warm to 

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:33.409
 magnetto 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.909
 today it was pretty good 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.250
 to see where we move 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.229
 where she is down here now 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.250
 in the processes because they help the 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.250
 evolution 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:10.200
 there is there 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.200
 leave giving him a yes yes 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.280
 to see what else 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.280
 come 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.730
 4 where I do not see it right 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.930
 what is now 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.569
 good good good 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:41.260
 and there we will no longer burst 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.260
 we burst to see what happens 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.370
 underdone has not 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.430
 to see where 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:05.660
 there is wind busting 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.660
 we do not know how the experiment will go 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:16.250
 and we said let's use it 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.250
 the stability option which is which 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:26.300
 waiting in the middle 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:33.230
 this adds this s down where the 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:35.590
 chemistry and the left chair ship I do not 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.590
 I'm learning 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:46.849
 where there is this s so that the 

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.849
 currency if they are only good and strategy 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.330
 and tiri titÃ­n 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.150
 I can use water and I'm here 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.450
 all coins 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.239
 there's also out there 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:32.810
 I'm going 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:38.050
 where do we put you as it is there 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.050
 ok if we remove phil to see if it drops further 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:54.320
 and that have been careful how it is which one 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:02.130
 and that's it 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.130
 and luck there 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.560
 and sometimes because it takes away is a bit 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.700
 brave in the other phase towards dad for 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.700
 without stopping in agreement 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.180
 I put it 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.910
 and because neither 

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:35.280
 what do we do 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.280
 do not 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.440
 we are meditating 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:54.259
 as from the middle 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:54.259
 4 4 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.570
 I raise that 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:12.249
 I wear 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:17.450
 here yes to see 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.360
 acute and 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:31.129
 and now he does it only in the one that is 

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:31.129
 in vertical 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.720
 to commemorate and at the same time 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.840
 some are already little movement 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.740
 it is here we have it is not bad 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:55.380
 up from left to right 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.509
 Try it out of banesto and see if something happens 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.509
 cool 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.560
 a lot of coins but not this 

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.870
 that's how it works 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:24.430
 5200 is not bad is that you have to subtract 

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.800
 to my 800 but surely some 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:29.260
 you have a boli mast in the technique 

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.530
 yes but you have already seen that there is nothing 

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.530
 wrong 

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:44.280
 good but not 5200 is pretty good 

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:44.280
 we subtract there the 800 remain 4,400 

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:51.110
 to see how many 4,400 and I think it's not 

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.090
 nothing bad I think that the time we have 

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:54.710
 got some remember that there was what 

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.990
 of shift I chew that I think there were three 

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:59.750
 objects of turn plus five because no 

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:01.010
 it would be nothing wrong so nothing will follow 

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.900
 with this tactic that it seems that 

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:04.250
 it works pretty well so nothing 

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.660
 Spartans see you with the networks 

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:09.050
 social we see ourselves here in the channel of 

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:13.330
 youtube from espartinas that same and as 

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:13.330
 always with the 3ds.com back forums
