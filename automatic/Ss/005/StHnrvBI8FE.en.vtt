00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello today i want to show how one 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.509
 Bees can walk around 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.880
 on the keyboard or piano or 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.830
 play another musical instrument 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.740
 for that we need a keyboard or a 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.929
 other musical instrument flag why 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.750
 consists of three parts the first and 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.859
 last part is the first one 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.710
 I thumb on c 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.019
 and then your hands on until 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:33.930
 little fingers on gs so the first part 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:35.160
 So it's two whole and then a quarter 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.210
 or 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.750
 an error and then an error 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:47.460
 whole c was the first and last 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.170
 at the same time that was the same now 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.770
 So I will now follow only 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.770
 can use 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:11.369
 the first part of the last emperor alike 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:14.759
 the middle part goes now like that and that was 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.680
 here so dark and now move it 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:20.009
 one to the left that is if that too 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.790
 good idea continues to find him for the 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:32.460
 11 heute.de and then the same yet 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:34.500
 times and now coming back the last 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.280
 part of the first one at the same time 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.280
 stop 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.020
 that was bee summum around 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.020
