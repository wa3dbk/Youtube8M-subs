quick within the first five minutes so I
yet<00:00:31.230> just<00:00:31.410> thought<00:00:31.590> I'd<00:00:31.710> point<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:32.040> out<00:00:32.130> so

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.979 
yet just thought I'd point that out so
you<00:00:32.489> can<00:00:32.550> probably<00:00:32.759> tell<00:00:33.030> from<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.480> record<00:00:33.840> I

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
you can probably tell from that record I

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.569 
you can probably tell from that record I
didn't<00:00:34.260> enjoy<00:00:34.530> too<00:00:34.800> much<00:00:34.950> other<00:00:35.130> strike<00:00:35.430> here

positioning<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.880> gets<00:01:09.240> effective<00:01:09.810> massively

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
positioning it gets effective massively

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.109

how he was outside the box when he's

how he was outside the box when he's
inside<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.610> box<00:01:35.790> he<00:01:36.119> can<00:01:36.299> be<00:01:36.390> deadly<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.869> can

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
inside the box he can be deadly and can

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.300 
inside the box he can be deadly and can
definitely<00:01:37.530> put<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.740> ball<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.009> back<00:01:38.159> and

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
definitely put the ball in the back and

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.770 
definitely put the ball in the back and
net<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.549> includes<00:01:38.880> with<00:01:39.270> his<00:01:39.390> head<00:01:39.570> too

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
net that includes with his head too

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.060 
net that includes with his head too
because<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.079> can<00:01:40.259> probably<00:01:40.530> imagine<00:01:40.650> with<00:01:40.950> his

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
because I can probably imagine with his

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.499 
because I can probably imagine with his
jumping<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.520> hidden<00:01:41.729> active<00:01:41.909> use<00:01:42.000> he<00:01:42.329> can

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
jumping and hidden active use he can

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.940 
jumping and hidden active use he can
definitely<00:01:42.869> put<00:01:43.229> them<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.560> back<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:43.829> it

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
definitely put them on the back in it

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.649 
definitely put them on the back in it
with<00:01:44.250> his<00:01:44.430> forehead<00:01:44.700> he's<00:01:45.060> also<00:01:45.240> got<00:01:45.450> decent

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
with his forehead he's also got decent

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.179 
with his forehead he's also got decent
stream<00:01:46.049> for<00:01:46.259> because<00:01:46.470> his<00:01:46.560> balance<00:01:46.860> was<00:01:47.009> so

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
stream for because his balance was so

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.740 
stream for because his balance was so
poor<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.579> just<00:01:47.880> found<00:01:48.000> him<00:01:48.210> just<00:01:48.360> get<00:01:48.540> knocked

to the floor so easy and you can

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.670 
to the floor so easy and you can
probably<00:01:50.759> imagine<00:01:50.970> very<00:01:51.509> very<00:01:51.899> annoying<00:01:52.290> so

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680
