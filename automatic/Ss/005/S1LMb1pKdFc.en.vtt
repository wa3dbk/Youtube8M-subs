00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
gonna get to that in just a moment one

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.180 
gonna get to that in just a moment one
thing<00:01:30.110> I<00:01:30.200> do<00:01:30.260> want<00:01:30.350> to<00:01:30.530> point<00:01:30.650> out<00:01:30.920> you've

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
thing I do want to point out you've

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.070 
thing I do want to point out you've
already<00:01:31.430> seen<00:01:31.700> it<00:01:31.880> we've<00:01:32.030> got<00:01:32.060> new<00:01:32.300> icons<00:01:32.780> for

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
already seen it we've got new icons for

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.899 
already seen it we've got new icons for
the<00:01:33.229> tools<00:01:33.560> in<00:01:33.860> the<00:01:33.950> hot<00:01:34.130> bar<00:01:34.340> here<00:01:34.549> I<00:01:34.580> really

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
the tools in the hot bar here I really

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:36.190 
the tools in the hot bar here I really
like<00:01:35.090> these<00:01:35.270> I<00:01:35.510> think<00:01:35.720> that<00:01:35.840> is<00:01:35.930> really

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
like these I think that is really

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.550 
like these I think that is really
pleasant<00:01:37.100> to<00:01:37.220> look<00:01:37.430> at<00:01:37.610> although<00:01:38.360> I<00:01:38.750> suppose

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
pleasant to look at although I suppose

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.350 
pleasant to look at although I suppose
it<00:01:39.920> would<00:01:40.070> make<00:01:40.250> things<00:01:40.280> if<00:01:40.760> this<00:01:40.909> is<00:01:41.060> if<00:01:41.210> these

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
it would make things if this is if these

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.460 
it would make things if this is if these
are<00:01:41.479> the<00:01:41.540> icons<00:01:41.930> are<00:01:42.020> always<00:01:42.260> going<00:01:42.350> to<00:01:42.440> be

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
are the icons are always going to be

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.110 
are the icons are always going to be
seeing<00:01:42.770> it's<00:01:43.370> gonna<00:01:43.549> make<00:01:43.670> things<00:01:43.729> a<00:01:44.000> little

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:44.120 
seeing it's gonna make things a little

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.850 
seeing it's gonna make things a little
interesting<00:01:44.420> to<00:01:45.049> differentiate<00:01:45.560> between<00:01:45.680> the

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
interesting to differentiate between the

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.469 
interesting to differentiate between the
different<00:01:46.159> types<00:01:46.460> of<00:01:46.729> tools<00:01:46.970> that<00:01:47.150> we<00:01:47.330> may

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
different types of tools that we may

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.469 
different types of tools that we may
have<00:01:47.720> such<00:01:48.020> as<00:01:48.049> iron<00:01:48.470> or<00:01:48.950> whatever<00:01:49.610> metals<00:01:50.180> or

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
have such as iron or whatever metals or

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.930 
have such as iron or whatever metals or
whatever<00:01:51.350> we<00:01:51.619> make<00:01:51.799> tools<00:01:52.040> out<00:01:52.280> of<00:01:52.430> so<00:01:52.610> maybe<00:01:52.820> a

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
whatever we make tools out of so maybe a

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.490 
whatever we make tools out of so maybe a
way<00:01:53.150> to<00:01:53.180> differentiate<00:01:53.690> between<00:01:53.990> these<00:01:54.290> would

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
way to differentiate between these would

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.100 
way to differentiate between these would
be<00:01:54.710> nice<00:01:55.430> but<00:01:55.460> I<00:01:55.909> like<00:01:56.390> them<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:56.780> really

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
be nice but I like them the really

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.370 
be nice but I like them the really
Pleasant<00:01:57.650> looking<00:01:58.040> icons<00:01:58.820> but<00:01:59.030> as<00:01:59.270> I<00:01:59.540> said<00:01:59.600> we

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
Pleasant looking icons but as I said we

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.810 
Pleasant looking icons but as I said we
have<00:02:00.619> creatures<00:02:01.340> I<00:02:01.960> should<00:02:02.960> probably<00:02:03.229> mention

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
have creatures I should probably mention

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.000 
have creatures I should probably mention
creatures<00:02:04.820> are<00:02:05.180> sort<00:02:05.900> of<00:02:05.960> there's<00:02:06.799> their

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
creatures are sort of there's their

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.770 
creatures are sort of there's their
place<00:02:07.310> holder<00:02:07.880> there<00:02:08.119> they're<00:02:08.330> using

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
place holder there they're using

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.210 
place holder there they're using
placeholder<00:02:09.500> art<00:02:09.709> and<00:02:09.950> a<00:02:09.979> placeholder

placeholder art and a placeholder

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.940 
placeholder art and a placeholder
animation<00:02:11.180> right<00:02:11.750> now<00:02:11.959> but<00:02:12.230> it<00:02:12.349> does<00:02:12.560> give<00:02:12.830> you

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
animation right now but it does give you

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.130 
animation right now but it does give you
an<00:02:13.040> idea<00:02:13.250> of<00:02:13.790> what<00:02:14.540> you're<00:02:14.690> gonna<00:02:14.810> be<00:02:14.959> seeing

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
an idea of what you're gonna be seeing

to<00:04:02.239> take<00:04:02.390> out<00:04:02.600> I<00:04:02.780> do<00:04:03.079> imagine<00:04:03.590> that<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.549> bow

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
to take out I do imagine that the bow

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.660 
to take out I do imagine that the bow
and<00:04:05.209> arrow<00:04:05.360> is<00:04:05.510> gonna<00:04:06.260> be<00:04:06.440> in<00:04:06.799> a<00:04:07.190> similar<00:04:07.640> vein

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
and arrow is gonna be in a similar vein

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.610 
and arrow is gonna be in a similar vein
to<00:04:08.209> the<00:04:08.299> way<00:04:08.480> that<00:04:08.720> the<00:04:08.780> grappling<00:04:09.260> hook<00:04:09.440> right

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
to the way that the grappling hook right

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.110 
to the way that the grappling hook right
works<00:04:09.920> right<00:04:10.160> now<00:04:10.310> so<00:04:10.610> for<00:04:10.790> those<00:04:10.850> of<00:04:10.910> you<00:04:11.030> that

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
works right now so for those of you that

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.910 
works right now so for those of you that
don't<00:04:11.269> know<00:04:11.390> the<00:04:11.540> grappling<00:04:11.840> hook<00:04:12.079> at<00:04:12.320> least

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
don't know the grappling hook at least

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.659 
don't know the grappling hook at least
last<00:04:13.190> I<00:04:13.430> was<00:04:13.700> told<00:04:14.030> is<00:04:15.130> basically<00:04:16.130> placeholder

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
last I was told is basically placeholder

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.580 
last I was told is basically placeholder
in<00:04:16.790> and<00:04:16.940> of<00:04:17.000> itself<00:04:17.150> it<00:04:17.510> is<00:04:17.540> tweaked<00:04:18.079> to<00:04:18.350> be

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
in and of itself it is tweaked to be

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.219 
in and of itself it is tweaked to be
more<00:04:18.799> focused<00:04:19.489> on<00:04:19.820> fun<00:04:20.150> right<00:04:20.540> now<00:04:20.720> as<00:04:20.959> opposed

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
more focused on fun right now as opposed

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.800 
more focused on fun right now as opposed
to<00:04:21.320> progression<00:04:21.680> in<00:04:22.010> the<00:04:22.910> completed<00:04:23.600> game

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
to progression in the completed game

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.170 
to progression in the completed game
you're<00:04:24.470> going<00:04:24.620> to<00:04:24.680> be<00:04:24.880> leveling<00:04:25.880> up<00:04:26.030> your

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
you're going to be leveling up your

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.460 
you're going to be leveling up your
grappling<00:04:26.390> hook<00:04:26.720> or<00:04:26.900> making<00:04:27.200> better

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
grappling hook or making better

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.080 
grappling hook or making better
grappling<00:04:27.860> hooks<00:04:28.070> so<00:04:28.430> that<00:04:28.580> you<00:04:28.700> can<00:04:28.880> do

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
grappling hooks so that you can do

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.750 
grappling hooks so that you can do
things<00:04:29.330> like<00:04:29.510> this<00:04:29.810> this<00:04:29.990> isn't<00:04:30.229> necessarily

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
things like this this isn't necessarily

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.760 
things like this this isn't necessarily
representation<00:04:32.420> of<00:04:32.570> the<00:04:32.810> final<00:04:33.320> grappling

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
representation of the final grappling

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.220 
representation of the final grappling
hook<00:04:33.920> and<00:04:34.070> I<00:04:34.130> imagine<00:04:34.790> that's<00:04:35.240> probably<00:04:36.020> the

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
hook and I imagine that's probably the

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.800 
hook and I imagine that's probably the
same<00:04:36.650> with<00:04:37.070> the<00:04:37.340> bow<00:04:37.550> and<00:04:37.790> arrow<00:04:38.060> I<00:04:38.180> imagine

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
same with the bow and arrow I imagine

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.690 
same with the bow and arrow I imagine
these<00:04:38.900> are<00:04:39.080> probably<00:04:39.470> a<00:04:39.770> little<00:04:40.310> bit<00:04:40.550> more

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
these are probably a little bit more

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.170 
these are probably a little bit more
powerful<00:04:41.240> than<00:04:42.130> we'll<00:04:43.130> be<00:04:43.280> seeing<00:04:43.670> from<00:04:44.000> the

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
powerful than we'll be seeing from the

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.380 
powerful than we'll be seeing from the
beginning<00:04:44.750> I<00:04:45.340> imagine<00:04:46.340> we'll<00:04:46.580> see<00:04:46.820> some<00:04:47.090> much

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
beginning I imagine we'll see some much

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.230 
beginning I imagine we'll see some much
weaker<00:04:48.020> bows<00:04:48.680> and<00:04:48.950> arrows<00:04:49.040> a<00:04:49.550> little<00:04:50.120> bit

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
weaker bows and arrows a little bit

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.000 
weaker bows and arrows a little bit
later<00:04:50.450> on<00:04:50.570> cuz<00:04:50.810> killer<00:04:51.080> I<00:04:51.200> mean<00:04:51.350> I<00:04:51.530> suppose

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
later on cuz killer I mean I suppose

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.920 
later on cuz killer I mean I suppose
these<00:04:52.190> could<00:04:52.490> just<00:04:52.520> be<00:04:52.790> you<00:04:53.300> know<00:04:53.390> really<00:04:53.630> weak

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
these could just be you know really weak

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.710
