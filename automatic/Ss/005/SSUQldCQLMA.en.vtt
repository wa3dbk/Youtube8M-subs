00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
heat I thought he might have got run of

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.190 
heat I thought he might have got run of
the<00:02:17.739> year<00:02:17.980> for<00:02:18.310> that<00:02:18.340> because<00:02:18.610> he<00:02:18.790> had<00:02:19.630> box<00:02:19.900> one

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
the year for that because he had box one

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.470 
the year for that because he had box one

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
and he was a done oil and so for many he

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.410 
and he was a done oil and so for many he
got<00:02:22.510> free<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:23.050> win<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.530> then<00:02:23.860> he<00:02:23.980> won<00:02:24.130> the

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420
