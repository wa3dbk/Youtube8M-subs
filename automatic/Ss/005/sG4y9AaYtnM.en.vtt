00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.230 
to go one or two notches at a time

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.860 
to go one or two notches at a time
notice<00:05:36.070> how<00:05:36.160> I<00:05:36.220> change<00:05:36.490> up<00:05:36.669> the<00:05:36.760> rib<00:05:36.910> to<00:05:37.150> -<00:05:37.810> all

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
notice how I change up the rib to - all

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.780 
notice how I change up the rib to - all
due<00:05:38.500> to<00:05:38.680> the<00:05:38.770> inspiration<00:05:39.310> of<00:05:39.460> the<00:05:39.580> sounds

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
due to the inspiration of the sounds

00:05:39.790 --> 00:06:11.870 
due to the inspiration of the sounds
that<00:05:39.850> I<00:05:39.970> get<00:05:40.180> when<00:05:40.630> I<00:05:40.660> turn<00:05:41.110> it<00:05:41.140> up<00:05:41.380> here<00:05:42.250> we<00:05:42.310> go

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.430 

you

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.460 

but

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:38.500 

I'm<00:06:20.470> fully<00:06:21.040> open

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:38.510 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:54.750 

Oh

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:54.760 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.520 

so<00:06:55.760> that's<00:06:55.940> a<00:06:56.030> tone<00:06:56.210> up<00:06:56.420> okay<00:06:57.200> he's<00:06:57.320> a<00:06:57.350> little

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:57.530 
so that's a tone up okay he's a little

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.830 
so that's a tone up okay he's a little
bit<00:06:57.620> of<00:06:57.710> loose
