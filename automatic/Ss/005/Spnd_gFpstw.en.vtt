00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.169
 Hehehe 

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:10.299
 I wish you folks 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:12.969
 or 87 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.449
 we warned the videos 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:16.579
 with him 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:19.579
 ip after a long time 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.689
 using the most diverse situations 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.810
 I think we already have the condition to make a 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.279
 a review 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.490

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.740
 seven inches 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.130
 800 by 480 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.130
 with the resistive screen but 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.570
 not as hard as other questions 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.810
 when the two scored as 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.430
 an interface customized by coin 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.430
 there the world crisis took over 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.360
 observed was shaken in me great 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.450
 if you can turn 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.170
 elt 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.660
 for example 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.790
 he is 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.770
 Support 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.770
 and turned almost to 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.650
 What are these people here? 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.770
 a neighbor 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.540

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.640
 on the dvd 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.040
 I cultivate something that requires you to be counting on the table. 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.640
 just remembering 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.720
 We listen to the capacitive menu that beck 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.320
 turn on and turn off 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.560

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.390
 my president 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.130
 it looks like it's a cohesive group 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.750
 in the world and in brazil nothing 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.410
 everything here 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.579
 here in paulínia 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:11.999
 emiko sp and the pits 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:13.399
 he carries 

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:15.949
 do not charge for the accident it carries 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:18.949
 with specific loaded with carpet 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.479
 public power explains 

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:24.959
 and with a trained public 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.910
 you can not put the old river coupon 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.859
 earplug 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:33.959
 automatically starts the course with the music player 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:34.790
 is here 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.929
 when measuring the volume of a speaker and here in the background we were 

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:41.149
 I had found in the video in question 

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:43.269
 pt itself 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:44.979
 is a good construction 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:49.159
 in the lonão by the squid in pernambuco apparent disparity 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.180
 another new face to colleague 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.729
 the rapporteur then 

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:56.729
 there is a certain care 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:00.099
 he and I 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.719
 concerned about the future 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:04.709
 in the book the team that never lost 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.209
 of 768 megabytes 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:08.399
 what 

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:10.629
 it's a pawn 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.809
 which gives a relatively good power 

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:15.210
 you check here 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.479
 I'm going to give bands example 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:18.590
 yea 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.590
 but I'm proud of him 

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:25.469
 the battery 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:26.909
 a critic 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:30.289
 has day I made the small 2200 battery with br 

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:32.329
 even trapped 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.129
 but in practice 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.619
 Do you get some time? 

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:41.009
 I ran, for example, if I'll send the video 

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:44.009
 Can you change the critic more delays? 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.179
 it still has a battery floor 

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:50.889
 it was a goal 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:53.129
 it was a little 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:54.629
 that's enough 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:59.029
 certainly larger journals larger materials with a beautiful basket of 

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:00.439
 people in beijing 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:03.439
 helped 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:06.159
 so maybe for a mouse 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:09.159
 it costs $ 299 in the United States 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:13.399
 in the prominent markets of your body and 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.840
 and I believe that 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.840
 the street is officially bringing you to Brazil 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.459
 will achieve low prices 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.360
 and probably 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.909
 if it really comes with some chance of you operator with your affective pair 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:30.340
 he is 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.479
 what the hell 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.509
 very low price or free 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:37.050
 it is quite reasonable even because they have to remember that this model does not have 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.289
 fish 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.270
 you can put 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.749
 your superpowers 

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:45.659
 it's a chore 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:49.409
 the cert with seven italy if from home 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.909
 I'm a grimace. 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:58.909
 the trade unions 

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:02.499
 the camera 

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:03.909
 we seek shame 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:06.909
 tapioca for the front too 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.400
 with respect to other artists' 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.300
 I think the on and off button is very sensitive 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.610
 so he and he argued that any reason 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.389
 ef 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:26.229
 I particularly had it soon. 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:28.719
 of figures with this and I do not know 

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:31.719
 suddenly how many of you will realize this difficulty 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.280
 Besides that 

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:40.659
 standard reuters keyboard with absolute of poule 

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:44.939
 I do not like seats so first thing the farm has a keyboard 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:49.589
 it was a jog and you do not have it when chris anyways 

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:52.589
 the Portuguese language, at least in my state, etc., and 

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:56.319
 clicking on your left pupil 6 ii 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:05:59.669
 exclaimed 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:03.050
 because we like it, I have liked it 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.020
 and one more hour 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.479
 on his return from remorse in robbery 

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:11.479
 with this service 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.949
 thank you for 

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:16.150
 so I said 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.780
 in this video
