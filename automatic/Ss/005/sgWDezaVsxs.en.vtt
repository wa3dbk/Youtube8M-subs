how<00:00:24.970> I<00:00:25.000> do<00:00:25.180> it

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
how I do it

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.500

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.510 
I'll take I'll just measure this all the

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.560 
I'll take I'll just measure this all the
way<00:00:28.630> around<00:00:28.930> and<00:00:29.340> when<00:00:30.340> I<00:00:30.460> come<00:00:30.730> to<00:00:30.760> the<00:00:31.000> end<00:00:31.030> I

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
way around and when I come to the end I

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.830 
way around and when I come to the end I
take<00:00:32.529> about<00:00:32.800> two<00:00:33.010> inches<00:00:33.399> extra<00:00:33.790> you<00:00:34.450> will<00:00:34.600> see

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
take about two inches extra you will see

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.979 
take about two inches extra you will see
why<00:00:35.020> I<00:00:35.050> need<00:00:35.379> this<00:00:35.649> later<00:00:36.070> on<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:37.719> I'll<00:00:37.809> just

why I need this later on so I'll just

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.380 
why I need this later on so I'll just
cut<00:00:38.230> this<00:00:38.260> off<00:00:38.590> I<00:00:38.860> can<00:00:39.519> just<00:00:39.730> press<00:00:39.910> it<00:00:40.059> with<00:00:40.239> my

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
cut this off I can just press it with my

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.689 
cut this off I can just press it with my
fingers<00:00:40.809> and<00:00:40.989> it<00:00:41.530> makes<00:00:41.800> quite<00:00:41.980> a<00:00:42.070> nice<00:00:42.309> crease

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699

00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:48.429 
one then you might need to iron it right

at<00:00:48.609> you<00:00:48.820> know<00:00:48.940> folding<00:00:49.329> the<00:00:49.480> center<00:00:49.839> okay

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:50.409 
at you know folding the center okay

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:53.040 
at you know folding the center okay
right<00:00:50.769> now<00:00:51.010> my<00:00:51.489> needle<00:00:52.089> is<00:00:52.300> in<00:00:52.539> the<00:00:52.629> center

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
right now my needle is in the center

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.799 
right now my needle is in the center
aligned<00:00:53.800> with<00:00:54.039> the<00:00:54.129> center<00:00:54.489> of<00:00:54.550> the<00:00:54.699> foot<00:00:54.879> now

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
aligned with the center of the foot now

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.860 
aligned with the center of the foot now
take<00:00:56.199> the<00:00:56.469> take<00:00:57.460> the<00:00:57.489> fabric<00:00:57.789> that<00:00:58.179> basically

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
take the take the fabric that basically

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
take the take the fabric that basically
just<00:00:59.589> hold<00:00:59.949> it<00:01:03.510> basically<00:01:04.510> just<00:01:04.900> place<00:01:05.229> the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
just hold it basically just place the

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.250 
just hold it basically just place the
bias<00:01:06.130> binding<00:01:06.510> into<00:01:07.510> the<00:01:07.600> fabric<00:01:08.020> quite

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
bias binding into the fabric quite

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.770 
bias binding into the fabric quite
securely<00:01:08.710> on<00:01:08.979> both<00:01:09.220> the<00:01:09.400> sides<00:01:09.640> go<00:01:10.420> ahead<00:01:10.600> and

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
securely on both the sides go ahead and

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.990 
securely on both the sides go ahead and
sew<00:01:11.049> at<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:11.829> edge<00:01:11.950> of<00:01:12.130> the<00:01:12.280> binding<00:01:12.490> if<00:01:12.909> you

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
sew at the edge of the binding if you

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.730 
sew at the edge of the binding if you
find<00:01:13.210> it<00:01:13.329> difficult<00:01:13.479> to<00:01:13.960> do<00:01:14.140> this<00:01:14.380> you<00:01:14.590> might

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
find it difficult to do this you might

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.080 
find it difficult to do this you might
want<00:01:15.009> to<00:01:15.100> tack<00:01:15.399> this<00:01:15.670> with<00:01:15.909> hand<00:01:16.149> stitching

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
want to tack this with hand stitching

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.730 
want to tack this with hand stitching
the<00:01:19.090> stitch<00:01:19.329> length<00:01:19.570> needs<00:01:19.930> to<00:01:20.110> be<00:01:20.229> quite<00:01:20.439> long

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
the stitch length needs to be quite long

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.350 
the stitch length needs to be quite long
you<00:01:20.979> don't<00:01:21.159> need<00:01:21.310> a<00:01:21.340> small<00:01:21.670> stitch<00:01:21.909> length<00:01:22.149> for

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
you don't need a small stitch length for

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:29.060 
you don't need a small stitch length for
this<00:01:22.479> because<00:01:22.689> this<00:01:22.960> is<00:01:23.020> just<00:01:23.350> a<00:01:23.469> safety<00:01:23.710> one

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.399 

as<00:01:30.070> you<00:01:30.310> go<00:01:30.490> along<00:01:30.610> just<00:01:31.060> nest<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:31.960> fabric

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
as you go along just nest the fabric

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:39.539 
as you go along just nest the fabric
right<00:01:32.920> inside<00:01:33.520> the<00:01:33.939> center<00:01:34.390> of<00:01:34.509> the<00:01:34.659> binding

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.100 

at<00:01:40.549> the<00:01:40.729> end<00:01:40.880> because<00:01:41.360> we<00:01:41.479> had<00:01:41.690> a<00:01:41.720> little<00:01:41.900> bit

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
at the end because we had a little bit

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.260 
at the end because we had a little bit
extra<00:01:42.440> there's<00:01:43.310> a<00:01:43.400> little<00:01:43.700> bit<00:01:43.820> extra<00:01:44.030> there

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
extra there's a little bit extra there

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.420 
extra there's a little bit extra there
so<00:01:44.630> we'll<00:01:44.900> just<00:01:45.080> trim<00:01:45.320> that<00:01:45.500> off<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:46.159> next

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
so we'll just trim that off the next

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.700 
so we'll just trim that off the next
step<00:01:46.670> is<00:01:46.909> going<00:01:47.210> to<00:01:47.390> be<00:01:47.540> that's<00:01:48.140> how<00:01:48.320> we<00:01:48.470> need

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
step is going to be that's how we need

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.730 
step is going to be that's how we need
to<00:01:48.830> start<00:01:49.100> however<00:01:49.940> we<00:01:50.900> need<00:01:51.080> to<00:01:51.290> finish<00:01:51.470> the

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
to start however we need to finish the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.440 
to start however we need to finish the
edge<00:01:51.950> because<00:01:52.460> we<00:01:52.580> can't<00:01:52.820> leave<00:01:53.090> this<00:01:53.270> raw

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
edge because we can't leave this raw

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.590 
edge because we can't leave this raw
edge<00:01:53.630> here<00:01:53.960> so<00:01:54.619> I'm<00:01:54.979> going<00:01:55.369> to<00:01:55.430> just<00:01:55.759> fold<00:01:56.360> it

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
edge here so I'm going to just fold it

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.670 
edge here so I'm going to just fold it
fold<00:01:57.050> the<00:01:57.290> edges<00:01:57.409> in<00:01:57.770> and<00:01:58.300> just<00:01:59.300> press<00:01:59.899> it<00:02:00.110> so

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
fold the edges in and just press it so

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.180 
fold the edges in and just press it so
that<00:02:00.830> I<00:02:00.920> get<00:02:01.100> a<00:02:01.130> crease<00:02:01.430> mark<00:02:01.759> and<00:02:02.090> then<00:02:03.190> again

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
that I get a crease mark and then again

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.780 
that I get a crease mark and then again
just<00:02:04.520> fold<00:02:05.180> this<00:02:06.020> corner<00:02:06.320> so<00:02:07.220> that<00:02:07.250> we<00:02:07.550> don't

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
just fold this corner so that we don't

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.080 
just fold this corner so that we don't
get<00:02:08.000> nasty<00:02:08.630> surprises<00:02:09.259> as<00:02:09.619> we<00:02:09.860> sew<00:02:10.130> and<00:02:10.429> this

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
get nasty surprises as we sew and this

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.190 
get nasty surprises as we sew and this
fold<00:02:11.390> this<00:02:11.930> sorry<00:02:12.769> it's<00:02:13.160> a<00:02:13.280> little<00:02:13.489> bit<00:02:13.610> tricky
