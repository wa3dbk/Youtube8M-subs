so I know that the rumors are true that
we<00:00:03.179> do<00:00:03.360> have<00:00:03.570> helicopters<00:00:03.840> that<00:00:04.350> make<00:00:04.920> no

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
we do have helicopters that make no

we do have helicopters that make no
noise<00:00:05.339> and<00:00:05.759> at<00:00:06.359> night<00:00:06.600> could<00:00:07.049> configure

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
noise and at night could configure

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.129 
noise and at night could configure
themselves<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:08.280> look<00:00:08.460> like<00:00:08.639> UFOs<00:00:09.179> and<00:00:09.450> fly

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
around fields and could pick up cattle

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.450 
around fields and could pick up cattle

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
and drop them back in fields now it's

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.960 
and drop them back in fields now it's
funny<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.289> not<00:00:22.289> too<00:00:22.470> long<00:00:22.650> after<00:00:23.250> these<00:00:23.550> ten

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
that they have have reached so I don't

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.049 
that they have have reached so I don't
know<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.980> answer<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.340> I'm<00:01:02.430> not<00:01:02.550> saying<00:01:02.850> that

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
know the answer and I'm not saying that

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.369 
know the answer and I'm not saying that
that's<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.420> answer<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.840> I'm<00:01:03.930> not<00:01:04.110> saying

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
that's the answer and I'm not saying

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.830 
that's the answer and I'm not saying
that<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.799> government<00:01:05.250> doing<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.700> but<00:01:05.909> I

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
that it's the government doing it but I

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.179 
that it's the government doing it but I
am<00:01:07.710> very<00:01:07.860> hesitant<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.909> believe<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.750> it's

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
am very hesitant to believe that it's

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.800 
am very hesitant to believe that it's
extraterrestrial<00:01:11.189> simply<00:01:12.119> because<00:01:12.420> no<00:01:12.630> one's

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
extraterrestrial simply because no one's

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.910 
extraterrestrial simply because no one's
ever<00:01:12.930> been<00:01:13.229> caught<00:01:15.290> mainly<00:01:16.290> because<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.650> the

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
ever been caught mainly because of the

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.330 
ever been caught mainly because of the
nature<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.840> the<00:01:18.840> organs<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.920> tissue<00:01:20.159> that

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
nature of the organs and the tissue that

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.789 
nature of the organs and the tissue that
is<00:01:20.610> taken<00:01:21.409> all<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.830> points<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.670> somebody

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
is taken all of it points to somebody

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.240 
is taken all of it points to somebody
wanting<00:01:25.799> large<00:01:26.250> amounts<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:26.880> blood<00:01:26.939> and

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
wanting large amounts of blood and

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.270 
wanting large amounts of blood and
number<00:01:29.250> two<00:01:29.659> tissue<00:01:30.659> samples<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:32.040> would

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
number two tissue samples that would

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.990 
number two tissue samples that would
tell<00:01:33.140> what<00:01:34.140> kind<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.770> pollution<00:01:35.100> has<00:01:35.490> moved<00:01:35.759> up

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
tell what kind of pollution has moved up

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.289 
tell what kind of pollution has moved up
the<00:01:36.210> food<00:01:36.240> chain<00:01:36.450> into<00:01:37.290> large<00:01:37.500> animals

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
the food chain into large animals

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.679 
the food chain into large animals
specifically<00:01:39.500> radiation<00:01:41.329> what<00:01:42.329> do<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.479> think

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
specifically radiation what do you think

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.140 
specifically radiation what do you think
about<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.140> yeah

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
about that yeah

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.750 
about that yeah
the<00:01:44.270> different<00:01:44.990> possibilities<00:01:45.670> there's<00:01:46.670> no

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
the different possibilities there's no

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.510 
the different possibilities there's no
question<00:01:47.120> in<00:01:47.180> my<00:01:47.300> mind<00:01:47.330> that<00:01:47.720> that<00:01:48.350> they<00:01:49.340> have

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
question in my mind that that they have

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.210 
question in my mind that that they have
these<00:01:49.730> silent<00:01:50.210> helicopters<00:01:50.870> I<00:01:51.200> don't<00:01:51.830> think

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
these silent helicopters I don't think

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.750 
these silent helicopters I don't think
if<00:01:52.520> some<00:01:52.820> people<00:01:52.970> say<00:01:53.420> that<00:01:53.810> they're<00:01:54.020> just

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
if some people say that they're just

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.520 
if some people say that they're just
very<00:01:55.760> quiet<00:01:56.270> I<00:01:56.600> think<00:01:56.630> they<00:01:57.110> are<00:01:57.290> absolutely

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
very quiet I think they are absolutely

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.370 
very quiet I think they are absolutely
silent<00:01:58.220> well<00:01:58.790> the<00:01:58.970> ones<00:01:59.180> that<00:01:59.450> passed<00:01:59.990> about<00:02:00.350> a

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
silent well the ones that passed about a

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.920 
silent well the ones that passed about a
hundred<00:02:00.740> feet<00:02:01.040> in<00:02:01.070> front<00:02:01.460> of<00:02:01.550> our<00:02:01.670> car<00:02:01.970> across

hundred feet in front of our car across
the<00:02:03.050> highway<00:02:03.820> in<00:02:04.820> a<00:02:05.000> very<00:02:05.480> rural<00:02:05.780> portion<00:02:06.410> of

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
the highway in a very rural portion of

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.109 
the highway in a very rural portion of
Arizona<00:02:07.130> where<00:02:07.310> there's<00:02:07.460> hardly<00:02:07.760> any<00:02:07.940> people

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
even care at all most rural people don't

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.030 
even care at all most rural people don't
care<00:02:17.450> if<00:02:17.690> they<00:02:17.840> see<00:02:17.900> a<00:02:18.050> helicopter<00:02:18.230> but<00:02:18.860> these

there and I get up in the morning where
in<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.769> hell<00:03:00.980> did<00:03:01.100> those<00:03:01.250> things<00:03:01.489> come<00:03:01.820> from

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
and the second night I finally asked

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.729 
and the second night I finally asked
somebody<00:03:05.060> and<00:03:05.390> they<00:03:05.450> said<00:03:05.660> Oh<00:03:05.750> they've<00:03:05.989> got<00:03:06.140> an

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
somebody and they said Oh they've got an

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.320 
somebody and they said Oh they've got an
underground<00:03:07.160> facility<00:03:07.610> that<00:03:07.760> they<00:03:07.910> use<00:03:08.090> it

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
underground facility that they use it

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.750 
underground facility that they use it
comes<00:03:08.750> out<00:03:08.959> of<00:03:09.050> the<00:03:09.110> building<00:03:09.470> runway<00:03:09.800> and<00:03:10.040> she

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
comes out of the building runway and she

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.370 
comes out of the building runway and she
was<00:03:10.880> very<00:03:11.030> nonspecific<00:03:11.480> but<00:03:11.989> apparently

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
was very nonspecific but apparently

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.500 
was very nonspecific but apparently
there<00:03:12.590> is<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:12.920> quite<00:03:13.220> a<00:03:13.250> large<00:03:13.640> underground

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
there is the quite a large underground

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.410 
there is the quite a large underground
base<00:03:14.810> under<00:03:15.410> Mariana<00:03:16.310> that's<00:03:16.730> the<00:03:16.850> first<00:03:17.120> I'd

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
base under Mariana that's the first I'd

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.570 
base under Mariana that's the first I'd
heard<00:03:17.630> about<00:03:17.750> it<00:03:17.930> but<00:03:18.080> I<00:03:18.290> didn't<00:03:18.530> read<00:03:18.739> it<00:03:19.100> so<00:03:19.370> I

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
heard about it but I didn't read it so I

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.680 
heard about it but I didn't read it so I
stay<00:03:20.030> down<00:03:20.269> there

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
stay down there

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:21.850 
stay down there
there<00:03:20.959> must<00:03:21.170> be<00:03:21.260> something<00:03:21.530> underground

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
there must be something underground

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.009 
there must be something underground
because<00:03:22.280> there<00:03:22.370> is<00:03:22.459> nowhere<00:03:22.640> where<00:03:22.970> else<00:03:23.390> for

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
because there is nowhere where else for

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.880 
because there is nowhere where else for
these<00:03:24.170> things<00:03:24.500> to<00:03:24.860> park<00:03:26.049> quite<00:03:27.049> familiar<00:03:27.200> with

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
these things to park quite familiar with

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.870 
these things to park quite familiar with
he'll<00:03:28.340> have<00:03:28.580> equality<00:03:28.880> and<00:03:29.300> pronoun<00:03:29.690> so<00:03:30.110> it's

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
he'll have equality and pronoun so it's

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.670 
he'll have equality and pronoun so it's
we<00:03:31.880> have<00:03:32.030> those<00:03:32.270> things<00:03:32.480> here<00:03:32.930> also<00:03:33.200> while<00:03:33.650> I

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.350 
little turn out there where we filmed
toward<00:04:12.200> the<00:04:12.440> groom<00:04:12.650> Lake<00:04:12.860> facility<00:04:13.270> part<00:04:14.270> of

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:14.360 
toward the groom Lake facility part of

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.580 
toward the groom Lake facility part of
the<00:04:14.420> mountain<00:04:14.720> just<00:04:14.870> opened<00:04:15.230> up<00:04:15.290> in<00:04:15.440> this

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
the mountain just opened up in this

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:16.960 
the mountain just opened up in this
helicopter<00:04:15.830> flew<00:04:16.310> right<00:04:16.489> into<00:04:16.669> the<00:04:16.820> mountain

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
helicopter flew right into the mountain

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.970 
helicopter flew right into the mountain
and<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.359> door<00:04:17.510> closed<00:04:17.810> and<00:04:17.989> it<00:04:18.140> it<00:04:18.680> didn't

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
and the door closed and it it didn't

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.289 
and the door closed and it it didn't
even<00:04:19.070> look<00:04:19.250> like<00:04:19.310> a<00:04:19.459> door<00:04:19.730> I<00:04:19.760> mean<00:04:20.030> it<00:04:20.180> was

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
even look like a door I mean it was

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.070 
even look like a door I mean it was
desert<00:04:20.840> land<00:04:22.270> out<00:04:23.270> and<00:04:23.660> I<00:04:23.780> probably

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
desert land out and I probably

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.150 
desert land out and I probably
helicopter<00:04:24.880> fly<00:04:25.880> into<00:04:26.740> what<00:04:27.740> appeared<00:04:28.040> to<00:04:28.070> be

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
helicopter fly into what appeared to be

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.800 
helicopter fly into what appeared to be
about<00:04:28.310> but<00:04:28.640> I<00:04:28.700> didn't<00:04:28.910> see<00:04:29.030> a<00:04:29.060> door<00:04:29.330> open<00:04:29.630> but

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
about but I didn't see a door open but

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.719 
about but I didn't see a door open but
it<00:04:29.930> definitely<00:04:30.790> disappeared

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
it definitely disappeared

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.219 
it definitely disappeared
exactly<00:04:34.729> where<00:04:35.330> I<00:04:35.390> thought<00:04:35.419> that<00:04:35.720> happened

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
exactly where I thought that happened

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.500 
exactly where I thought that happened
it's<00:04:36.440> probably<00:04:37.010> the<00:04:37.160> the<00:04:37.490> exact<00:04:37.880> same<00:04:38.150> spot

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
it's probably the the exact same spot

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.420 
it's probably the the exact same spot
with<00:04:38.720> the<00:04:38.810> people<00:04:39.110> up<00:04:39.200> on<00:04:39.320> the<00:04:39.440> mountain<00:04:39.800> they

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
with the people up on the mountain they

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.400 
with the people up on the mountain they
all<00:04:40.669> thought<00:04:40.880> it<00:04:40.940> just<00:04:41.180> disappeared<00:04:41.930> they

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
all thought it just disappeared they

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.710 
all thought it just disappeared they
didn't<00:04:42.710> see<00:04:42.860> the<00:04:43.010> door<00:04:43.190> open<00:04:43.610> either<00:04:43.910> and<00:04:44.270> if<00:04:44.600> I

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
didn't see the door open either and if I

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.240 
didn't see the door open either and if I
hadn't<00:04:45.050> have<00:04:45.140> been<00:04:45.229> looking<00:04:45.710> directly<00:04:46.010> at

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
hadn't have been looking directly at

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.159 
hadn't have been looking directly at
that<00:04:46.640> spot<00:04:47.030> I<00:04:47.300> don't<00:04:47.570> think<00:04:47.780> I<00:04:47.870> would<00:04:48.050> have

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
that spot I don't think I would have

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.620 
that spot I don't think I would have
seen<00:04:48.350> the<00:04:48.500> door<00:04:48.650> open<00:04:49.010> either<00:04:49.130> but<00:04:50.090> I<00:04:50.120> managed

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
seen the door open either but I managed

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.230 
seen the door open either but I managed
to<00:04:50.720> see<00:04:50.990> the<00:04:51.140> door<00:04:51.320> open<00:04:51.800> and<00:04:52.010> this<00:04:52.520> helicopter

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
to see the door open and this helicopter

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.150 
to see the door open and this helicopter
flew<00:04:53.479> in<00:04:53.690> and<00:04:53.840> it<00:04:53.930> just<00:04:54.200> closed<00:04:54.500> back<00:04:54.890> behind

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
flew in and it just closed back behind

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.130 
flew in and it just closed back behind
it<00:04:55.900> and<00:04:56.900> it<00:04:57.440> was<00:04:57.590> it<00:04:57.890> was<00:04:57.919> incredible<00:04:58.750> to<00:04:59.750> watch

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
it and it was it was incredible to watch

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.050 
it and it was it was incredible to watch
this<00:05:00.530> it<00:05:00.740> was<00:05:00.860> like<00:05:01.040> watching<00:05:01.220> an<00:05:01.640> old<00:05:01.729> Flash

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
this it was like watching an old Flash

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.909 
this it was like watching an old Flash
Gordon<00:05:02.360> movie<00:05:02.810> I<00:05:03.080> don't<00:05:03.650> know<00:05:03.740> if<00:05:03.830> you<00:05:03.890> ever

saw those old Flash Gordon serials but
they<00:05:06.380> had<00:05:06.590> a<00:05:06.620> part<00:05:06.950> where<00:05:07.160> this<00:05:07.850> spaceship<00:05:08.450> is

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
they had a part where this spaceship is

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.240 
they had a part where this spaceship is
flying<00:05:09.020> along<00:05:09.350> and<00:05:09.560> it<00:05:09.650> goes<00:05:09.830> into<00:05:10.070> this

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
flying along and it goes into this

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.040 
flying along and it goes into this
mountain<00:05:10.550> and<00:05:10.970> all<00:05:11.120> these<00:05:11.270> Cowboys<00:05:11.780> are

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050

mountain and all these Cowboys are
chasing<00:05:12.470> it<00:05:12.560> on<00:05:12.680> the<00:05:12.800> horseback<00:05:13.310> and<00:05:13.630> they

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
chasing it on the horseback and they

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.300 
chasing it on the horseback and they
just<00:05:14.840> go<00:05:15.200> up<00:05:15.350> to<00:05:15.380> the<00:05:15.620> cliff<00:05:15.919> and<00:05:16.130> there's<00:05:16.280> a

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
just go up to the cliff and there's a

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.159 
just go up to the cliff and there's a
cliff<00:05:16.610> and<00:05:16.820> they<00:05:16.940> they<00:05:17.750> don't<00:05:17.870> know<00:05:17.960> what

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
cliff and they they don't know what

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.290 
cliff and they they don't know what
happened<00:05:18.560> I<00:05:18.740> remember<00:05:19.729> that<00:05:19.880> from<00:05:20.180> when<00:05:20.419> I<00:05:20.510> was

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
happened I remember that from when I was

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.450 
happened I remember that from when I was
and<00:05:21.900> the<00:05:21.990> reason<00:05:22.290> I<00:05:22.380> remember<00:05:22.440> it<00:05:22.890> is<00:05:23.010> because

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
and the reason I remember it is because

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.190 
and the reason I remember it is because
all<00:05:23.820> of<00:05:24.150> these<00:05:24.270> things<00:05:24.570> about<00:05:24.810> underground

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
all of these things about underground

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.980 
all of these things about underground
bases<00:05:25.740> and<00:05:25.770> flying<00:05:26.100> saucers<00:05:26.780> brought<00:05:27.780> that

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
bases and flying saucers brought that

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.810 
bases and flying saucers brought that
memory<00:05:28.350> back<00:05:28.380> to<00:05:28.620> me<00:05:30.440> John<00:05:31.440> I<00:05:31.470> think<00:05:31.830> that<00:05:32.040> the

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
memory back to me John I think that the

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.060 
memory back to me John I think that the
people<00:05:33.570> have<00:05:34.230> better<00:05:34.500> start<00:05:34.860> paying

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
people have better start paying

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:40.060 
people have better start paying
attention<00:05:35.250> to<00:05:35.880> this<00:05:36.060> and<00:05:36.600> that<00:05:37.200> better<00:05:38.030> begin

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
attention to this and that better begin

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:45.020 
attention to this and that better begin
to<00:05:41.870> do<00:05:42.870> something<00:05:43.380> at<00:05:43.890> least<00:05:44.070> to<00:05:44.220> think<00:05:44.520> I<00:05:44.760> mean

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
to do something at least to think I mean

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.620 
to do something at least to think I mean
thinking<00:05:45.510> is<00:05:45.630> a<00:05:45.660> starting<00:05:46.140> point<00:05:46.170> I<00:05:46.680> believe

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630 
thinking is a starting point I believe

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.020 
thinking is a starting point I believe
but<00:05:48.630> we're<00:05:48.810> out<00:05:48.960> of<00:05:48.990> time<00:05:49.550> maybe<00:05:50.550> we<00:05:50.760> can<00:05:50.910> do

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
but we're out of time maybe we can do

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.210 
but we're out of time maybe we can do
this<00:05:51.180> another<00:05:51.390> night<00:05:51.600> do<00:05:52.500> this<00:05:52.680> again<00:05:52.980> because

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
this another night do this again because

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.010 
this another night do this again because
there's<00:05:53.370> a<00:05:53.430> lot<00:05:53.640> of<00:05:53.670> things<00:05:53.970> that<00:05:54.330> maybe<00:05:54.900> we

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
there's a lot of things that maybe we

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.390 
there's a lot of things that maybe we
should<00:05:55.230> have<00:05:55.320> talked<00:05:55.560> about<00:05:55.860> that<00:05:56.100> we<00:05:56.190> didn't

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
should have talked about that we didn't

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.220 
should have talked about that we didn't
get<00:05:56.520> to<00:05:58.730> would<00:05:59.730> you<00:05:59.910> consent<00:06:00.420> to<00:06:00.570> come<00:06:00.750> back<00:06:00.960> on

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.230 
get to would you consent to come back on

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.790 
get to would you consent to come back on
I<00:06:02.150> can't<00:06:03.150> believe<00:06:03.270> the<00:06:03.570> time<00:06:03.750> is<00:06:03.780> that<00:06:04.200> passes

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
I can't believe the time is that passes

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.160 
I can't believe the time is that passes
quickly<00:06:04.980> but<00:06:05.460> yeah<00:06:06.450> I<00:06:06.480> think<00:06:06.600> there's<00:06:06.900> a<00:06:06.990> lot

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:07.170 
quickly but yeah I think there's a lot

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.320 
quickly but yeah I think there's a lot
of<00:06:07.290> other<00:06:07.410> things<00:06:08.250> we<00:06:08.490> could<00:06:08.670> delve<00:06:08.880> into<00:06:09.120> I

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
of other things we could delve into I

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.560 
of other things we could delve into I
sure<00:06:09.810> wish<00:06:10.020> I<00:06:10.460> shared<00:06:11.460> your<00:06:11.610> optimism<00:06:12.240> our<00:06:12.540> I

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:12.570 
sure wish I shared your optimism our I

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.650 
sure wish I shared your optimism our I
don't<00:06:12.900> know<00:06:12.990> whether<00:06:13.140> it's<00:06:13.700> or<00:06:14.700> realistic

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
don't know whether it's or realistic

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.560 
don't know whether it's or realistic
thinking<00:06:16.460> but<00:06:17.460> certainly<00:06:17.760> people<00:06:18.120> have<00:06:18.330> got

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570 
thinking but certainly people have got

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.800 
thinking but certainly people have got
to<00:06:18.690> wake<00:06:18.870> up<00:06:20.180> there's<00:06:21.180> no<00:06:21.300> question<00:06:21.720> about

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.810 
to wake up there's no question about

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.510 
to wake up there's no question about
that<00:06:22.550> well<00:06:23.550> I<00:06:23.760> think<00:06:24.150> that<00:06:24.510> our<00:06:24.600> forefathers

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 
that well I think that our forefathers

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.790 
that well I think that our forefathers
had<00:06:26.520> the<00:06:26.670> right<00:06:26.850> idea<00:06:27.270> but<00:06:27.540> I<00:06:28.230> also<00:06:28.350> think<00:06:28.740> that

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
had the right idea but I also think that

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.100 
had the right idea but I also think that
they<00:06:29.010> did<00:06:29.220> this<00:06:29.400> as<00:06:29.610> an<00:06:29.730> experiment<00:06:30.240> and<00:06:30.660> I

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
they did this as an experiment and I

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.360 
they did this as an experiment and I
think<00:06:31.410> that<00:06:31.650> through<00:06:31.830> reading<00:06:32.220> their

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370 
think that through reading their

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.120 
think that through reading their
writings<00:06:32.820> it's<00:06:33.450> clear<00:06:33.840> to<00:06:34.020> me<00:06:34.050> that<00:06:34.470> they<00:06:35.070> were

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.130 
writings it's clear to me that they were

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.670 
writings it's clear to me that they were
were<00:06:35.880> well<00:06:36.150> versed<00:06:36.480> in<00:06:36.720> human<00:06:37.169> nature<00:06:37.500> and

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 
were well versed in human nature and

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.610 
were well versed in human nature and
they<00:06:38.580> knew<00:06:38.820> all<00:06:39.330> the<00:06:39.570> way<00:06:39.690> back<00:06:39.930> then<00:06:40.230> that<00:06:40.500> we

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 
they knew all the way back then that we

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.180 
they knew all the way back then that we
would<00:06:40.800> probably<00:06:41.100> lose<00:06:42.030> our<00:06:42.570> republic<00:06:43.190> through

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190 
would probably lose our republic through

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.460 
would probably lose our republic through
our<00:06:44.340> own<00:06:44.580> abdication<00:06:45.540> ignorance<00:06:46.320> stupidity

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:46.470 
our own abdication ignorance stupidity

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.280 
our own abdication ignorance stupidity
whatever<00:06:47.340> you<00:06:47.460> want<00:06:47.640> to<00:06:47.730> call<00:06:47.880> it<00:06:48.140> but<00:06:49.140> I<00:06:49.169> think

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:49.290 
whatever you want to call it but I think

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.080 
whatever you want to call it but I think
the<00:06:49.680> experiments<00:06:50.190> not<00:06:50.340> over<00:06:50.640> yet<00:06:50.910> because

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:51.090 
the experiments not over yet because

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.510 
the experiments not over yet because
it's<00:06:51.419> not<00:06:51.510> gone<00:06:51.900> yet<00:06:51.930> and<00:06:52.560> I<00:06:52.980> think<00:06:53.250> we<00:06:53.370> can

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 
it's not gone yet and I think we can

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.090 
it's not gone yet and I think we can
take<00:06:53.730> it<00:06:53.880> back<00:06:53.910> if<00:06:54.419> people<00:06:55.140> just<00:06:55.350> could<00:06:56.070> be

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:56.100 
take it back if people just could be

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.100 
take it back if people just could be
brought<00:06:56.580> to<00:06:56.640> understand<00:06:57.480> what<00:06:57.810> it<00:06:57.930> is<00:06:57.960> that

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
brought to understand what it is that

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.159 
brought to understand what it is that
they're<00:06:58.500> going<00:06:58.650> to<00:06:58.770> lose<00:06:59.419> then<00:07:00.419> maybe<00:07:00.810> they

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:01.169 
they're going to lose then maybe they

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:02.450 
they're going to lose then maybe they
would<00:07:01.320> be<00:07:01.350> willing<00:07:01.650> to<00:07:01.770> do<00:07:01.980> something<00:07:02.370> about

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 
would be willing to do something about

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:02.900 
would be willing to do something about
it

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:02.910 
it

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:05.030 
it
but<00:07:03.480> all<00:07:03.600> throughout<00:07:03.870> history<00:07:04.169> I<00:07:04.410> see<00:07:04.740> that

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:05.040 
but all throughout history I see that

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.490 
but all throughout history I see that
even<00:07:05.850> our<00:07:05.970> own<00:07:06.120> revolution<00:07:06.750> was<00:07:06.900> only<00:07:07.140> carried

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:07.500 
even our own revolution was only carried

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.580 
even our own revolution was only carried
out<00:07:07.650> by<00:07:07.919> by<00:07:08.550> less<00:07:08.910> than<00:07:08.940> 5%<00:07:09.150> of<00:07:10.080> the<00:07:10.140> people<00:07:10.380> who

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:10.590 
out by by less than 5% of the people who

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.470 
out by by less than 5% of the people who
lived<00:07:10.800> in<00:07:10.919> the<00:07:11.040> colonies<00:07:11.490> the<00:07:11.970> rest<00:07:12.240> were

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:12.480 
lived in the colonies the rest were

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.970 
lived in the colonies the rest were
either<00:07:12.510> solidly<00:07:13.200> on<00:07:13.290> the<00:07:13.410> side<00:07:13.620> of<00:07:13.650> King

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:13.980 
either solidly on the side of King

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:28.230 
mind is except that I just absolutely

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:32.520 
mind is except that I just absolutely
refused<00:07:29.230> to<00:07:29.380> give<00:07:29.590> up<00:07:29.820> and<00:07:30.820> and<00:07:31.330> and<00:07:31.690> every
