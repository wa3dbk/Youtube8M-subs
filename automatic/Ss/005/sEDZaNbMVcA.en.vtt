 different from others 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.300
 of course too much 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.570
 dramatically slow down and the world is detachments 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.730
 which are equipped with rockets like this 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.540

 man of the north goal 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.680
 they must be associated with 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.050
 by them 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.540
 these realia boar orbit day baths

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.420
 one of the most colorful 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.330
 characters approximately 2 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.830
 it became to keep this china it is very 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.300
 dear at the same time probably for themselves 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.360
 place of our further delivery process 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.840
 five years malta one of the antagonists 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.670
 the leaders 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.420
 m this is Magomedov from madrid 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.070
 we thought for a long time how we his children 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.270
 the player uniquely associated him 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.390
 with this very element 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.390
 Ukraine, we are his, he is also warm step 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.040
 in the morning so he will compete to the neck 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.690
 afraid to continue it 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.670
 and we gave him the legs topping you know 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.190
 what happens on rooftops 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.490
 making analogies with this type of case 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.790
 quite powerful because 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.220
 the plane on which without such this 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.169
 discos Maltsev should 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:13.439
 congratulated MSK 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:16.159
 we picked up a suitable one for a long time 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:18.540
 voice for this role expert we wanted 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.249
 to get a character when 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:22.749
 Conversation with which players skipped 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:25.749
 unpleasant issues calmer 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.219
 I am not interested in my secrets 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:31.239
 and gratitude is the money option than he 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.829
 of them my taste 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.169
 just in the game we will see the development of conflict 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:37.989
 between mind 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.749
 now people definitely 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:42.010
 harass infrared red 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.129
 whites 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.549
 main character who heads 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.549
 resistance and paternal karelia 

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:54.169
 in which 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:56.419
 yet a good example of how we 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:58.069
 handle classic 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.269
 fantasy archetypes creating sex on 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.389
 residence can be a fire of departments 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:05.909
 squad leader sky italia leipzig center 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:06.659
 formed a certain 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:10.150
 archetype leading table in elf text 

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:13.469
 they are born more transparent they are fertile and how 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:15.749
 rule they have a richly decorated complex 

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:16.360
 weapons 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.420
 so that is, such stereotypes are very 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.029
 lot 

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:19.930
 that is, we 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.060
 but we can say we have not won back 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.990
 on characters including on its orbit 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.500
 he was deprived of the natural beauty of dobkin then 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.070
 terrible mutilated place kopeks who 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.650
 fighting in partisan detachments 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.339
 no speech development 

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:35.899
 for such legendary deep Belarusians successes 

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:38.609
 I have a lot of space that he has experience and that 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.719
 same time for your health in general May 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:42.449
 a small part of his gear 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:44.759
 see seven-story promises weight 

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:46.939
 here it is worth noting individuals 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:49.889
 most described it to the faithful roschette 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.029
 but at the very beginning of the game 

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:55.029
 this is the usual order 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:59.219
 one of the guests is generous this is ambassador schiller if 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:01.299
 he represents no cards 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:02.739
 however powerful 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.209
 state archives of course protest 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.769
 emil of cards 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.309
 while totalitarianism 

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:11.699
 by the way he should be associated with 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:13.789
 conquerors with 

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:15.840
 candles break thousand 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.329
 but I don't know no 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.329
 son of Pereyaslavets 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.259
 father garda representatives like lady mazda2 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:25.199
 serves as a messenger neck tasks 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:27.300
 seminar I can say that in 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.900
 principle all their human traits 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.889
 he sacrificed himself then 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:35.190
 diplomacy v.yushchenko he ceased to be 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.389
 man make up what he became politicians 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:38.639
 politicians 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.510
 found a living person means but why all 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:44.770
 our actions 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.699
 this politician 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:49.960
 then dressed rich and of course gorgeous 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.849
 thefts from successful countries 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:54.279
 the concern owns all its views will continue 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:56.839
 show those who meet 

00:04:56.839 --> 00:05:00.139
 in series what is the strength of the current itself 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.050
 hurry up with him is worth 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.060
 now we wanted to give players more 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.979
 opportunities to develop from 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:09.080
 ministries it will help not only when 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.460
 help the development system of the hero need 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.840
 but also thanks to a variety of items of expenditure 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.569
 and an element of clothing on our business 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:17.929
 they affect its characteristics and 

00:05:17.929 --> 00:05:20.569
 simultaneously about how it looks in the game 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:23.539
 Tottenham thanks to this prospero 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:25.419
 pa while constantly changing 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:28.659
 we can create such a hero 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:31.469
 I would like and the choice of clothes has 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:34.520
 effect on growth characteristics 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.030
 we created a pyramid of more than 30 tee 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.289
 variety of costumes 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.490
 he will have a set of clothes associated with 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.789
 different fractions in g 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:46.099
 stronger weaker kits 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:47.219
 jackets 

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:49.649
 here apparently those of that we also wanted juice 

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:51.610
 collected including with a minimum 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.229
 clothes so you can see how 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:56.489
 looks like his skin vice speaker 

00:05:56.489 --> 00:05:58.099
 really experienced a lot 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:05:59.719
 not all he went to many battles 

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:03.020
 through not born wounded and his case is covered 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.020
 scars to create it really need 40 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.459
 you look at it with dynamics and you understand what 

00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:11.389
 this is almost a living person there is one not 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:12.689
 maybe not invented 

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:14.589
 superhero from the comic snow which 

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:17.449
 Now will save the world of the author of the article 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:20.449
 revenge 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.970
 Of course the creators of the witch remains 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.090
 andrzej serakovski stop and we in our 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.090
 queue doing all that was in our power 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.759
 to continue his creations i hope 

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:33.120
 that the banana will be pleased with the characters 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.500
 2 items especially because they could look 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.760
 personally overload the role of the well-known 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.870
 by the book with appeared quite a lot 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.900
 new characters of the novel we created 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.860
 which we hope 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.699
 Mortality fit perfectly
