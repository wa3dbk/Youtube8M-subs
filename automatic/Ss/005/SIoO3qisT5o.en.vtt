00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.260
 perhaps the first time we took a test is not new 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:07.899
 car and the one that is removed from 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:10.090
 production but it's not just machines it 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:10.660
 legend 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.780
 for nearly 60 years this SUV 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.020
 was a class maker 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.880
 but it's time to upgrade 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.630
 we will try it compared to the new 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.730
 we only have a veteran on our hands 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.730
 successor we will evaluate in absentia 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.010
 East 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.200
 here it is patrol sixth generation 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.170
 rude brutal is absolutely male already 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.900
 on the exterior of this car is clear 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.270
 what is uncompromising 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.550
 SUV short overhangs high ground clearance 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.600
 in the toothed wheel and the presence of logins and what 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.360
 will offer us a newbie from old style not 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.910
 nothing remains subtle less 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.239
 refined style there is no such handsome 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.970
 just sorry to shove 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.450
 off road and what if you get dirty 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.380
 suddenly pearl paint will fade 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.600
 feather mushrooms massive easy to leave on 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.290
 track 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.020
 here and come off the race 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.180
 last class representative 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.280
 these SUVs 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.820
 what 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.620
 style 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.550
 Here it is an example of an Oscar of engineering school 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.600
 when this car was created by him 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.170
 interior 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.909
 another universally applied 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:21.540
 computer simulation such 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.460
 things like material reinforced buttons 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.570
 landing controls 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.009
 came out with the help of long studies 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.100
 trial and error did not trust these things 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.020
 soulless computer 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.500
 and the reader here is like being in 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.340
 old office in the library after 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.840
 typical office new generation of course 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.940
 prime sophistication of sophistication getting 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.510
 in the interior of the seventh patrol you already understand 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.030
 heredity with the brand infiniti about it 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.390
 speak and his unified 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.080
 governing body and refined materials 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.900
 white skin is a huge amount 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.260
 all kinds of electronic 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.440
 freaks you can see that this is a matter of sipri 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.500
 using a computer and need this very 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.360
 worked well marketer but nothing 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.980
 can not be done unfortunately all 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.970
 the car is not moving now 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.449
 so ways 

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:10.919
 just became the time of illness old arbat 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.349
 role percentage of marriage 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.409
 we have said both in appearance and gods 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:16.369
 legal parameters 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:18.109
 absolutely SUV him 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:20.259
 The design is old kindly tested 

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:21.109
 equal to 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:23.189
 in it of course on the track in the car 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:25.229
 feel not quite comfortable though 

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:28.139
 but due to the long base wide gauge and 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:30.389
 of course he is confident enough 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:31.849
 direct but nonetheless 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.239
 but due to the fact that he had all the same 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.379
 good old continuous bridge 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.069
 over bumps or bends car 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.929
 I always behaves adequately need this 

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:42.549
 understand and do not need to take it in 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.409
 attention always 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.579
 as for the new car of course 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.290
 he is completely different he lost his frame 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.389
 construction 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:51.249
 he has a completely different kinematics and 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:53.669
 he has no suspension system 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:55.559
 I know he has a bridge 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:57.909
 independent suspension 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:59.469
 first-class but equipped 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:01.929
 a system that controls banks 

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:03.239
 body percentage 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.609
 and correspondingly 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:05.889
 always hold 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:07.769
 in the correct position in any 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:08.679
 conditions 

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:10.549
 maybe it's nice maybe it's 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:11.959
 comfortable but 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.669
 dad flood it is rather passenger 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:16.989
 car and not recent SUV 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.700
 as for a little off road this 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.399
 of course this car 

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:22.509
 even just imagine what he is 

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:24.489
 what kind of question is going to go to Shostka 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.049
 because cars are expensive and 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.239
 obviously even in appearance was not 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.069
 adapted for heavy off-road 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.079
 but he certainly has 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.329
 huge amount of help systems on 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.419
 off-road begins banal 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:40.649
 Things like a slave slip 

00:03:40.649 --> 00:03:41.809
 on the system 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:43.199
 in help touch me 

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:45.519
 uphill descent control system with 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.039
 mountains on the central tunnel appeared 

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:50.089
 selector that is responsible for the system 

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:52.839
 off-road assistance, you can choose from 

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:54.359
 multiple modes i.e. it is valid 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.519
 snow gravel sand and so on already 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.539
 electronics will decide how should 

00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:00.449
 behave like a car should behave 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:01.729
 powertrain how should behave 

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:02.879
 engine 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.069
 maybe so good about helping these cities 

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:09.369
 wants to literally stay just 

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:12.699
 and push the pedal away the car 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:14.259
 will solve everything for him 

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:17.009
 but for those who truly love fell 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:18.509
 of course so probably even 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:19.579
 somewhat offensive 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.520
 function as for engines then on 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.069
 this car is installed 

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:25.189
 three-liter 

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:27.899
 good old diesel without any 

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:29.149
 convoluted monetary systems 

00:04:29.149 --> 00:04:30.289
 royal teams 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:32.599
 it gives off the car 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:34.830
 Well, firstly the sound is good to hear 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.259
 sound insulation booster perfect 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:39.479
 It is good because this sound is also 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.240
 gives courage to experience verse 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.090
 car racer and probably me 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.560
 the owners of a new generation of patrol is not 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.440
 boasts such figures because 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.050
 that he is still outdated 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.780
 not so powerful not so much 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.780
 environmentally friendly but it doesn’t have to be proud 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.340
 the fact that it will be a new patrol 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.210
 set as they say new 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.349
 engine capacity of 3 to 6 liters 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:02.110
 400 horsepower this will allow in the new 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.800
 control generation accelerate to 100 km 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.819
 an hour in 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:06.089
 six point six seconds 

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:08.469
 good result 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:10.370
 but again this is already 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:11.510
 bet is made 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.699
 not passable not on 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:15.930
 traction power characteristics from on 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.529
 the dynamics of the pleasure of 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:19.979
 driving primarily on the track but 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:21.999
 as I said before the change of image change 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:24.870
 concept car although generally assure 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.870
 which is largely patrol 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.680
 should give in to few 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.520
 off road sides 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.080
 well it's time to take stock 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.729
 king off-road 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:36.189
 he managed to plant but you know 

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:38.400
 a bad thing simple enough for me 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.779
 suggests that the seventh generation 

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:42.449
 patrol may not have reached cano miracle 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:44.629
 so in suits you can say that 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:46.499
 luxury respectability 

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:47.800
 took over the brutality 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.870
 natural but agree because those 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.439
 people who bought this car maybe 

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:54.930
 bought exactly for this and were looking for 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.080
 such adventures and rather a new car 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.819
 just fit for those 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:01.759
 wants to go far fast comfortable a 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:04.050
 if it comes off-road it 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.830
 just press a few keys and 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.379
 maybe this car do everything for you 

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:10.599
 nothing can be done are common 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:11.709
 automotive trends
