00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 Hello dear lovers of scale 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.510
 models and just those who watch my 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.150
 video today i want to show you 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:15.509
 very much in my opinion a unique model 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:23.519
 this old model she was produced with 85 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:26.150
 88 year this car gull gaz-14 and 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.220
 What is unique about this model is that 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.610
 This model itself was produced by Gorky 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:37.160
 the plant is the same factory that manufactured 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:40.700
 real cars brand seagull and 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:44.030
 of course he is very sad fate that 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.930
 all molds everything was destroyed and 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.320
 also repeated the fate and 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.719
 and production models are also all 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.710
 molds and everything was irrevocable 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.079
 destroyed and 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:02.129
 and now many collectors have left 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:05.220
 such models and I do not know myself some 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.340
 people who wish to purchase such 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.960
 model despite the fact that it is made 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:15.600
 quite rude and the model itself 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.610
 she is made of metal she is very 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.990
 heavy 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:24.210
 the bottom of the model is also made of 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:27.210
 metal is all very massive and made 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.840

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:34.700

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.590

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:41.000
 seagulls and on country with her this model she 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.000
 perceived as some kind of monster 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.989
 This model has 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.730

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:47.610
 there will be such an interesting car 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:49.980

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.710
 there are collections too and I know people 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:58.050
 who are not even going to change it 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:04:01.110
