00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.700
 there's no doubt 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.750
 the 21 flyer is a great multi-functional vehicle 

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:11.050
 it rocks on any terrain 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.480
 and goes to places that other vehicles only dream of going 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.369
 Special forces can surprise and wipe out enemies in a blink of 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.369
 eyes 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.150
 the flyer 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.640
 is still manufactured today by the california fly and until new says and by the sea 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.730
 vehicle 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.149
 it was invented by alternate state 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.149
 that projected vehicles of the Israeli army 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.910
 if he went to the united states to compete in races only spoke and 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.050
 combined this knowledge with his military experience to create the Bahian 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.350
 instead of names and transsexuals from San Luis 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.960
 the former team of which the job is always to have a job seeker has to 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.480
 be guilty 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.480
 did at the time to predict that she wants 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.589
 but I would only speak 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.900
 it's more than a little kremen 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.330
 he can carry weapons that I respect 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.370
 like a 50 caliber machine gun a 40-pounder grenade launcher 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.280
 or anti-tank missiles 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.590
 so the army and the marines are watching him 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.460
 the first version used by special forces was an ambulance for use 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.950
 general 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.030
 which carried six marks 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.439
 there were also transport of soldiers that carried seventeen people on foot 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.320
 the most current version is modular 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.150
 and can be adapted to the war platform 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.170
 transport for six people or ambulance 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.399
 the fly and despite the age of the ranking 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.350
 but carries the same type of weaponry 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.350
 this provides much more agility to light units as the forces 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.280
 special parachutists and marines 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.960
 plus all this lk come a helicopter mode of transport 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.990
 of these attack forces 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.250
 one of the best features of the fly up to its ability to be stacked 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.180
 within transport it is even possible to place two at the same time in the 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.589
 cargo compartment 

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:23.449
 This allows the aircraft to carry two or even three times more 

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:26.349
 beaches and I did not 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:31.419
 plus great mobility and ease of transportation another secret of success 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:32.650
 of the vehicle 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.859
 is its tubular structure 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:40.280
 this is what makes it light but also sturdy and durable there are also many 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:43.279
 same items because in this case it's good 

00:02:47.029 --> 00:02:48.619
 dancer 

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:50.059
 this was what was expected 

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:51.299
 the car 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.029
 gartner 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:53.799
 Paulo 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.719
 the avengers rice beans and soybeans 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:57.139
 with these prophets 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:02:59.429
 compliance with the dry law on the river 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:02.549
 What do you want to call the guard phone? 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.839
 the councilman made fun of 

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:09.919
 if you are looking at these tires and thinking they will be punched 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:11.820
 by the bullets of the enemy 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:12.949
 think again 

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:17.319
 the internal pressure is so low that the vehicle does not stop even when its 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.109
 tires are hit 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.769
 it can even continue to move with only three wheels if the front is 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.219
 destroyed 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:30.519
 this happens because the 'motor' is in the rear which takes the weight of the tire 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.949
 front and give more visibility to the driver because the front is shorter 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:42.180
 the flyer has a low center of gravity but is still 40 centimeters 

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:42.630
 floor 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.630
 double the majority of military vehicles 

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:49.609
 this distance is very useful in this field 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.609
 today it is possible to make one flyer per day 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:59.939
 but after I walked in one of them 

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:05.139
 it is best for them to prepare to increase production 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.259
 tony hadley in the same year and the art work 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:24.380
 forgiveness should not reach the real and now it
