00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.100 
thing to own right so now this school
has<00:03:33.280> definitely<00:03:33.940> had<00:03:34.060> their<00:03:34.180> teeth<00:03:34.510> taken<00:03:34.989> out

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
has definitely had their teeth taken out

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.500 
has definitely had their teeth taken out
because<00:03:35.560> like<00:03:35.800> people<00:03:35.830> can<00:03:36.790> show<00:03:37.030> up<00:03:37.239> wear

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
because like people can show up wear

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.180 
because like people can show up wear
whatever<00:03:37.780> they<00:03:38.020> want<00:03:38.050> and<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:38.590> punishment<00:03:39.070> is

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
whatever they want and the punishment is

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.310 
whatever they want and the punishment is
to<00:03:39.310> wear<00:03:39.459> something<00:03:39.700> even<00:03:40.090> cooler<00:03:40.269> all<00:03:41.050> right

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
to wear something even cooler all right

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.140 
to wear something even cooler all right
so<00:03:41.830> we've<00:03:42.400> solved<00:03:42.790> that<00:03:42.850> problem<00:03:43.180> she<00:03:43.989> uh
