worse way in a more sort of
unconventional<00:03:10.520> way<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:11.480> probably<00:03:12.260> killed

unconventional way and probably killed

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.250 
unconventional way and probably killed
and<00:03:12.920> so<00:03:13.310> on<00:03:13.520> though<00:03:14.060> there<00:03:14.390> is<00:03:14.690> no<00:03:15.020> particular

and so on though there is no particular
limit<00:03:15.830> apart<00:03:16.520> from<00:03:16.730> people<00:03:17.000> themselves<00:03:17.840> and

limit apart from people themselves and
