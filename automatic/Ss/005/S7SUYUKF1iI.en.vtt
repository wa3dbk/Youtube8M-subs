up<00:04:25.610> let's<00:04:25.940> see<00:04:26.360> how<00:04:26.480> long<00:04:26.540> it<00:04:26.750> takes<00:04:26.780> the<00:04:27.020> power

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
up let's see how long it takes the power

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.080 
up let's see how long it takes the power
because<00:04:27.500> blackberries<00:04:28.460> were<00:04:28.580> known<00:04:28.790> to<00:04:28.820> take

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
because blackberries were known to take

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.470 
because blackberries were known to take
forever<00:04:29.540> to<00:04:29.990> power<00:04:30.380> up<00:04:30.620> and<00:04:30.890> shut<00:04:31.250> down<00:04:31.490> in<00:04:32.360> the

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
forever to power up and shut down in the

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.160 
forever to power up and shut down in the
first<00:04:32.720> place<00:04:32.870> so<00:04:32.990> I<00:04:33.500> hit<00:04:34.160> the<00:04:34.310> power<00:04:34.550> button

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
first place so I hit the power button

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.730 
first place so I hit the power button
and<00:04:36.850> see<00:04:37.850> if<00:04:37.970> we<00:04:38.090> can<00:04:38.240> turn<00:04:38.420> this<00:04:38.630> right<00:04:39.410> so<00:04:39.590> I'd

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
and see if we can turn this right so I'd

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.970 
and see if we can turn this right so I'd
to<00:04:39.860> go<00:04:39.980> ahead<00:04:40.220> and<00:04:40.400> charge<00:04:40.820> the<00:04:41.270> z10<00:04:41.690> and<00:04:41.960> if<00:04:42.740> I

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
to go ahead and charge the z10 and if I

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.680 
to go ahead and charge the z10 and if I
did<00:04:43.250> the<00:04:43.430> startup<00:04:43.940> but<00:04:44.180> I've<00:04:44.240> already<00:04:44.360> set

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
did the startup but I've already set

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.540 
did the startup but I've already set
things<00:04:44.930> up<00:04:45.140> but<00:04:45.350> what<00:04:45.860> I<00:04:45.890> wanted<00:04:46.190> to<00:04:46.280> show<00:04:46.370> you

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
things up but what I wanted to show you

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.160 
things up but what I wanted to show you
here<00:04:46.910> basically<00:04:47.120> was<00:04:47.480> just<00:04:47.720> the<00:04:47.840> start<00:04:48.020> of

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
here basically was just the start of

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.170 
here basically was just the start of
process<00:04:48.650> and<00:04:48.890> then<00:04:49.010> we'll<00:04:49.130> get<00:04:49.250> into<00:04:49.310> it<00:04:49.610> so

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
process and then we'll get into it so

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.640 
process and then we'll get into it so
much<00:04:50.360> you're<00:04:50.570> gonna<00:04:50.660> just<00:04:51.020> hit<00:04:51.290> the<00:04:51.440> power

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
much you're gonna just hit the power

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.950 
much you're gonna just hit the power
button<00:04:51.680> down<00:04:52.160> and<00:04:53.000> you<00:04:53.180> see<00:04:53.420> it<00:04:53.540> of<00:04:53.660> course<00:04:53.840> the

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
button down and you see it of course the

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.300 
button down and you see it of course the
indicator<00:04:54.290> lights<00:04:54.560> up<00:04:54.740> meaning<00:04:55.100> of<00:04:55.190> course

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
indicator lights up meaning of course

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.160 
indicator lights up meaning of course
it's<00:04:55.550> about<00:04:55.700> to<00:04:55.880> start<00:04:56.090> up<00:04:56.270> black<00:04:56.840> measures

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170 
it's about to start up black measures

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.320 
it's about to start up black measures
we're<00:04:57.350> well<00:04:57.920> known<00:04:57.950> for<00:04:58.370> having<00:04:58.490> very<00:04:58.850> slow

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
we're well known for having very slow

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.830 
we're well known for having very slow
startup<00:04:59.900> times<00:05:00.550> but<00:05:01.550> as<00:05:02.180> we<00:05:02.450> go<00:05:02.570> through<00:05:02.780> this

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
startup times but as we go through this

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.720 
startup times but as we go through this
process<00:05:02.930> you<00:05:03.290> guys<00:05:03.620> can<00:05:04.100> see<00:05:04.310> and<00:05:04.460> see<00:05:04.610> how

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
process you guys can see and see how

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.850 
process you guys can see and see how
long<00:05:04.790> it<00:05:05.060> takes<00:05:05.090> what<00:05:06.080> you<00:05:06.290> should<00:05:06.350> understand

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
long it takes what you should understand

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.850 
long it takes what you should understand
about<00:05:06.890> the<00:05:07.280> z10<00:05:07.850> about<00:05:08.320> the<00:05:09.320> philosophy<00:05:09.500> of

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
about the z10 about the philosophy of

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.980 
about the z10 about the philosophy of
course<00:05:10.130> with<00:05:10.280> the<00:05:10.400> new<00:05:10.430> BlackBerry<00:05:11.060> OS<00:05:11.510> is

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
course with the new BlackBerry OS is

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.750 
course with the new BlackBerry OS is
that<00:05:12.170> everything<00:05:12.830> is<00:05:12.920> contextual<00:05:13.460> to<00:05:13.640> the

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
that everything is contextual to the

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.700 
that everything is contextual to the
edges<00:05:14.150> of<00:05:14.180> the<00:05:14.300> device<00:05:14.690> so<00:05:14.960> basically<00:05:15.440> you

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
edges of the device so basically you

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.920 
edges of the device so basically you
kind<00:05:16.400> of<00:05:16.580> you<00:05:17.000> close<00:05:17.180> application<00:05:17.420> from

kind of you close application from

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.870 
kind of you close application from
sliding<00:05:18.200> from<00:05:18.410> the<00:05:18.560> bottom<00:05:19.100> switch

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
sliding from the bottom switch
