00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.529
 pascal of horticulturist coaches in marcinelle 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.940
 in southern burgundy 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:21.210
 we will talk about multiplication 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.189
 plants by seedling indeed 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.029
 many plants multiplies by 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.619
 sowing we select the 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.599
 best varieties for you 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.550
 can have a better result in 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.960
 your gardens 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:38.000
 there are many varieties of 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.320
 shapes and colors 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.379
 so we have some for 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.469
 illustrate my words 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:51.660
 we have pear cabbage and 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:55.500
 coriander of leek zinnia 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.420
 sage and pickle seedling can get 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.260
 do two ways manually or 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.820
 mechanically we have a seeder that 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.549
 is piloted by didier so we sow 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.299
 in plates 1 to lift hall of 240 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.850
 alveoli filled with potting soil 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.950
 to make plugs that will be taken 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.330
 more easily by the sly art because 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.970
 that we will automatically transplant 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.680
 seeder so works the way 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.310
 next we put the seeds 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.409
 here they are sucked by the nozzles that 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.150
 are interchangeable according to the 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.799
 seed size because we have a 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.079
 size of seeds that vary enormously 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.290
 from one plant to another and they are 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.840
 sown row by row in the plates 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.220
 alveoli so each cell must 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.220
 collect one or more seeds 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.210
 after sowing we water copiously 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.560
 the plates and seeds for them 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:01.740
 can swollen and sprouted properly 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:05.729
 then we put them in the greenhouse with a 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.500
 floor temperature of 20 degrees in 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.770
 plant function germination is 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.040
 different for tomatoes 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.650
 it takes about a week 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.780
 once we have reached completed 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:25.440
 their growth in plates 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:27.030
 they will repot mechanically so 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.200
 we are in the potting hall ya 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.870
 a lot of noise because the machines 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.590
 are running at full speed 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.910
 so we saw the smi stage once 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.250
 the complaints arrive the seedlings 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.120
 matures 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:46.850
 they are prepared for repotting 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:50.970
 we pass them to the demo who goes so 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:53.730
 take off the root of the pl from the plate 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:03:01.280
 and then we place them on the art 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:04.830
 stitcher then the plates waiting 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:09.510
 are put into art on stingy art 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.410
 time virginia they emerge repot 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.460
 in the trays 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:17.310
 at the other end of the machine 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.890
 then we put the labels with the 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.210
 name of the variety 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:25.530
 it goes through the watering tunnels 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:28.800
 to be watered and they are put 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:32.250
 in place permanently at the end of the carpet 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.950
 in the greenhouse the plans will be cultivated 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.500
 four to six weeks in the sister and 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.650
 will be ready to be planted in your 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.650
 gardens
