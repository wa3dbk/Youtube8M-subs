underway<00:00:05.330> and<00:00:06.330> honestly<00:00:06.899> it<00:00:07.230> is<00:00:07.410> just<00:00:07.740> getting

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
underway and honestly it is just getting

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.980 
underway and honestly it is just getting
started<00:00:08.040> out<00:00:08.400> here<00:00:08.670> at<00:00:09.480> least<00:00:09.690> for<00:00:09.900> the

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
started out here at least for the

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.440 
started out here at least for the
majority<00:00:10.469> of<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.650> region<00:00:11.240> looking<00:00:12.240> outside

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
majority of the region looking outside

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.060 
majority of the region looking outside
right<00:00:12.780> now<00:00:12.809> in<00:00:13.049> southwestern<00:00:13.650> Connecticut

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
right now in southwestern Connecticut

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.330 
right now in southwestern Connecticut
the<00:00:14.880> smell<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.599> coming<00:00:15.900> down<00:00:16.199> very<00:00:16.500> heavy<00:00:17.039> and

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
the smell is coming down very heavy and

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.220 
the smell is coming down very heavy and
the<00:00:17.880> winds<00:00:18.180> are<00:00:18.210> already<00:00:18.630> starting<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.020> gust

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
the winds are already starting to gust

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.560 
the winds are already starting to gust
and<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:20.160> is<00:00:20.250> thanks<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.670> our<00:00:20.970> developing<00:00:21.480> a

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
and that is thanks to our developing a

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.900 
and that is thanks to our developing a
low<00:00:21.689> pressure<00:00:22.020> system<00:00:22.550> offshore<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:23.789> will

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
low pressure system offshore that will

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.480 
low pressure system offshore that will
continue<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:24.779> develop<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.380> throw<00:00:25.980> those<00:00:26.220> two

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
continue to develop and throw those two

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.210 
continue to develop and throw those two
back<00:00:26.699> in<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.810> front<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.080> snow<00:00:28.349> along<00:00:29.070> the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
back in the front of snow along the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.310 
back in the front of snow along the
coast<00:00:29.429> or<00:00:29.670> even<00:00:29.880> further<00:00:30.029> inland<00:00:30.390> now<00:00:31.050> there's

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
coast or even further inland now there's

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.630 
coast or even further inland now there's
been<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.500> lot<00:00:31.650> of<00:00:31.679> rumors<00:00:32.070> going<00:00:32.099> around<00:00:32.369> about

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
been a lot of rumors going around about

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.729 
been a lot of rumors going around about
how<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.059> storm<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.450> progressing<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:34.110> far<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:34.680> I

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
how the storm is progressing so far so I

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.280 
how the storm is progressing so far so I
want<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:34.950> clear<00:00:35.130> some<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.399> those<00:00:35.489> up<00:00:36.050> the<00:00:37.050> first

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
want to clear some of those up the first

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.290 
want to clear some of those up the first
one<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.829> storm<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.129> weaker<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.730> that

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
one is that the storm is weaker and that

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.150 
one is that the storm is weaker and that
the<00:00:39.420> northern<00:00:39.809> fringe<00:00:40.110> is<00:00:40.379> really<00:00:40.739> filling<00:00:40.980> in

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
the northern fringe is really filling in

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.270 
the northern fringe is really filling in
with<00:00:41.219> dry<00:00:41.489> air<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:42.030> weakening<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.980> not

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
with dry air and weakening that is not

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.700 
with dry air and weakening that is not
really<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.820> case<00:00:44.969> first<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.510> all<00:00:45.629> we<00:00:46.260> do<00:00:46.500> have

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
really the case first of all we do have

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.770 
really the case first of all we do have
some<00:00:46.920> dry<00:00:47.100> air<00:00:47.280> coming<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:47.789> on<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.690> the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
some dry air coming in on to the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.990 
some dry air coming in on to the
northern<00:00:49.079> part<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.379> system<00:00:49.610> but<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.730> won't

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
northern part of the system but it won't

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.139 
northern part of the system but it won't
be<00:00:51.120> affecting<00:00:52.050> those<00:00:52.649> areas<00:00:53.160> much<00:00:53.370> due<00:00:53.910> to

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
be affecting those areas much due to

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.450 
be affecting those areas much due to
such<00:00:54.329> high<00:00:54.600> ratios<00:00:55.140> notes<00:00:55.469> now<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.340> other

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
such high ratios notes now the other

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.360 
such high ratios notes now the other
thing<00:00:56.610> with<00:00:56.850> that<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.829> this<00:00:58.829> dry<00:00:59.100> air<00:00:59.280> is

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
thing with that is that this dry air is

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.799 
thing with that is that this dry air is
going<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.640> stop<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.120> could<00:01:00.300> already<00:01:00.510> seen

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
going to stop and you could already seen

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.660 
going to stop and you could already seen
happening<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:02.129> due<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.640> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
happening and that is due to the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.729 
happening and that is due to the
negative<00:01:02.969> tilt<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.989> I'm<00:01:04.199> going<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.559> talk

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
negative tilt that I'm going to talk

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.270 
negative tilt that I'm going to talk
about<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.129> just<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.519> second<00:01:06.680> in<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.860> last<00:01:08.070> few

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
about in just a second in the last few

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.640 
about in just a second in the last few
frames<00:01:08.580> here<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:09.060> dry<00:01:09.360> air<00:01:09.630> comes<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.320> halt

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
frames here this dry air comes to a halt

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.100 
frames here this dry air comes to a halt
and<00:01:10.920> instead<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.210> actually<00:01:12.570> starts<00:01:12.840> backing

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
and instead it actually starts backing

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.200 
and instead it actually starts backing
up<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.500> little<00:01:13.530> bit<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:13.979> that's<00:01:14.549> because<00:01:14.939> we're

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
up a little bit and that's because we're

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.330 
up a little bit and that's because we're
having<00:01:15.540> our<00:01:15.630> low<00:01:15.780> pressure<00:01:16.110> system<00:01:16.590> develop

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
having our low pressure system develop

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.789 
having our low pressure system develop
offshore<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:18.180> throw<00:01:18.750> back<00:01:18.930> more<00:01:19.259> moisture

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
offshore and throw back more moisture

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.219 
offshore and throw back more moisture
and<00:01:20.070> stop<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.119> process<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:21.960> thing

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
and stop the process of this thing

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.230 
and stop the process of this thing
moving<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:23.009> zipping<00:01:23.189> off<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.729> east<00:01:23.759> like

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
moving just zipping off to the east like

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.179 
moving just zipping off to the east like
some<00:01:24.479> have<00:01:24.570> been<00:01:24.689> forecasting<00:01:25.350> instead<00:01:26.040> it's

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
some have been forecasting instead it's

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.020 
some have been forecasting instead it's
going<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.369> stick<00:01:26.520> around<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.820> little<00:01:26.850> longer

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
going to stick around a little longer

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.630 
going to stick around a little longer
give<00:01:27.869> them<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.110> stronger<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.890> that's<00:01:29.430> gonna

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
give them a stronger and that's gonna

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.910 
give them a stronger and that's gonna
lead<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.970> somewhere<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.420> snow<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:31.170> line<00:01:31.710> with

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
lead to somewhere of snow in line with

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.940 
lead to somewhere of snow in line with
our<00:01:32.009> forecasts<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.060> let's<00:01:33.180> get<00:01:33.299> started<00:01:33.420> here

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
our forecasts so let's get started here

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.499 
our forecasts so let's get started here
we'll<00:01:34.950> start<00:01:35.130> with<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.369> water<00:01:35.670> vapor<00:01:36.000> imagery

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
we'll start with the water vapor imagery

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.980 
we'll start with the water vapor imagery
and<00:01:36.750> this<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.920> very<00:01:38.189> telling<00:01:38.990> satellite

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
and this is a very telling satellite

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.319 
and this is a very telling satellite
imagery<00:01:40.350> here<00:01:40.650> what<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.700> your<00:01:42.030> storm

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
imagery here what you have is your storm

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.120 
imagery here what you have is your storm
system<00:01:42.720> developing<00:01:43.259> over<00:01:43.530> here<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:44.009> could

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
system developing over here you could

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.950 
system developing over here you could
see<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.460> cloud<00:01:44.820> tops<00:01:45.090> are<00:01:45.390> actually<00:01:45.689> cooling

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
see the cloud tops are actually cooling

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.020 
see the cloud tops are actually cooling
right<00:01:46.229> now<00:01:46.380> which<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.189> sign<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.759> storm

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
right now which is a sign of the storm

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.899 
right now which is a sign of the storm
going<00:01:48.240> through<00:01:48.540> rapid<00:01:48.659> intensification<00:01:49.909> now

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
going through rapid intensification now

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.069 
going through rapid intensification now
what<00:01:51.060> we're<00:01:51.180> looking<00:01:51.450> at<00:01:51.479> here<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.869> low

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
what we're looking at here is a low

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.429 
what we're looking at here is a low
pressure<00:01:52.350> system<00:01:52.850> developing<00:01:53.850> offshore<00:01:54.439> to

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
pressure system developing offshore to

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.170 
pressure system developing offshore to
our<00:01:55.590> self<00:01:55.860> pretty<00:01:56.219> good<00:01:56.399> pretty<00:01:56.820> far<00:01:57.149> to

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
our self pretty good pretty far to

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.149 
our self pretty good pretty far to
ourselves<00:01:57.390> but<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.680> won't<00:01:58.860> matter<00:01:58.950> that

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
ourselves but that won't matter that

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.330 
ourselves but that won't matter that
much<00:01:59.430> now<00:02:00.329> what's<00:02:00.570> important<00:02:01.020> here<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.469> that

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
much now what's important here is that

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.270 
much now what's important here is that
we<00:02:02.640> have<00:02:02.790> this<00:02:02.969> Arctic<00:02:03.570> disturbance<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:05.070> is

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
we have this Arctic disturbance that is

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.660 
we have this Arctic disturbance that is
pushing<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:07.020> southern<00:02:07.829> side<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.280> our

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
pushing on the southern side of our

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.420 
pushing on the southern side of our
storm<00:02:09.000> system<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:10.229> basically

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
storm system and that is basically

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.010 
storm system and that is basically
forcing<00:02:11.430> our<00:02:11.580> storm<00:02:11.849> system<00:02:12.180> can<00:02:12.480> spread<00:02:12.810> more

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
forcing our storm system can spread more

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.350 
forcing our storm system can spread more
no

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
no

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.570 
no
it<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.600> stay<00:02:14.440> a<00:02:14.470> little<00:02:14.770> bit<00:02:14.890> longer<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.460> that

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
it and stay a little bit longer and that

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.100 
it and stay a little bit longer and that
is<00:02:15.700> due<00:02:15.820> to<00:02:15.940> that<00:02:16.090> negative<00:02:16.330> tilt<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:16.990> is

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
is due to that negative tilt it is

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.710 
is due to that negative tilt it is
pushing<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.800> trough<00:02:18.070> negative<00:02:18.910> and<00:02:19.120> again

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
pushing the trough negative and again

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.690 
pushing the trough negative and again
that's<00:02:19.930> going<00:02:20.320> to<00:02:20.470> enhance<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:21.070> storm<00:02:21.340> more

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
that's going to enhance the storm more

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.030 
that's going to enhance the storm more
than<00:02:21.910> forecasted<00:02:22.570> so<00:02:23.140> that's<00:02:23.320> why<00:02:23.440> this<00:02:23.530> is<00:02:23.800> so

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
than forecasted so that's why this is so

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.260 
than forecasted so that's why this is so
important<00:02:24.700> um<00:02:25.320> moving<00:02:26.320> along<00:02:26.650> here<00:02:26.970> this<00:02:27.970> is

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
important um moving along here this is

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.030 
important um moving along here this is
the<00:02:28.450> 500<00:02:28.930> millibar<00:02:29.260> pattern<00:02:29.590> again<00:02:29.800> this<00:02:29.920> is

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
the 500 millibar pattern again this is

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.980 
the 500 millibar pattern again this is
at<00:02:30.160> 18,000<00:02:31.060> feet<00:02:31.090> so<00:02:31.480> kind<00:02:31.690> of<00:02:31.750> a<00:02:31.810> different

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
at 18,000 feet so kind of a different

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.440 
at 18,000 feet so kind of a different
view<00:02:32.290> and<00:02:32.320> this<00:02:32.530> is<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.800> current<00:02:33.160> pattern<00:02:33.610> now

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
view and this is the current pattern now

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.910 
view and this is the current pattern now
what<00:02:34.660> we're<00:02:34.840> seeing<00:02:35.020> here<00:02:35.140> this<00:02:35.590> is<00:02:35.860> the

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
what we're seeing here this is the

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.340 
what we're seeing here this is the
trough<00:02:36.460> and<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:37.360> have<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:37.660> see<00:02:37.900> it<00:02:38.110> whether

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
trough and you have to see it whether

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.320 
trough and you have to see it whether
it's<00:02:38.680> you<00:02:38.980> know<00:02:39.010> neutral<00:02:39.610> positive<00:02:40.240> or

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
it's you know neutral positive or

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.870 
it's you know neutral positive or
negative<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.780> tilt<00:02:41.050> and<00:02:41.320> right<00:02:42.130> now<00:02:42.310> you<00:02:42.370> can

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
negative the tilt and right now you can

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.030 
negative the tilt and right now you can
see<00:02:43.120> that<00:02:43.150> before<00:02:43.660> when<00:02:44.050> I<00:02:44.110> posted<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.590> map<00:02:44.770> it

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
see that before when I posted the map it

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.400 
see that before when I posted the map it
was<00:02:45.220> neutral<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:45.970> now<00:02:46.510> we're<00:02:46.780> starting<00:02:47.170> to

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
was neutral and now we're starting to

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.380 
was neutral and now we're starting to
see<00:02:47.440> signs<00:02:47.920> of<00:02:48.130> it<00:02:48.280> turning<00:02:48.580> negative<00:02:49.000> which

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
see signs of it turning negative which

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.890 
see signs of it turning negative which
is<00:02:49.540> crucial<00:02:49.810> because<00:02:50.560> that<00:02:50.920> is<00:02:51.130> an<00:02:51.250> automatic

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
is crucial because that is an automatic

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.880 
is crucial because that is an automatic
signal<00:02:52.900> that<00:02:53.380> you're<00:02:53.500> going<00:02:53.620> to<00:02:53.680> have<00:02:53.860> a

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
signal that you're going to have a

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.470 
signal that you're going to have a
bigger<00:02:54.190> storm<00:02:54.550> you're<00:02:55.030> going<00:02:55.150> to<00:02:55.209> have<00:02:55.270> more

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
bigger storm you're going to have more

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.840 
bigger storm you're going to have more
snowfall<00:02:56.020> totals<00:02:56.440> along<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.160> coast<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.640> even

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
snowfall totals along the coast and even

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.760 
snowfall totals along the coast and even
further<00:02:58.000> inland<00:02:58.510> so<00:02:59.020> we<00:02:59.140> can<00:02:59.290> see<00:02:59.470> that<00:02:59.590> this

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
further inland so we can see that this

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.030 
further inland so we can see that this
is<00:03:00.010> neutral<00:03:00.400> right<00:03:00.489> this<00:03:01.090> is<00:03:01.300> your<00:03:02.050> eye<00:03:02.260> it's

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
is neutral right this is your eye it's

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.250 
is neutral right this is your eye it's
on<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.489> breadline<00:03:03.700> it's<00:03:04.270> really<00:03:04.540> beginning

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
on the breadline it's really beginning

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.780 
on the breadline it's really beginning
to<00:03:05.440> become<00:03:05.560> negative<00:03:06.100> right<00:03:06.280> now<00:03:06.430> which<00:03:06.760> is

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
to become negative right now which is

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.850 
to become negative right now which is
something<00:03:07.270> that<00:03:07.390> wasn't<00:03:07.690> really<00:03:07.930> forecasted

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
something that wasn't really forecasted

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.160 
something that wasn't really forecasted
and<00:03:09.040> that's<00:03:09.610> again<00:03:09.940> why<00:03:10.330> we<00:03:10.510> have<00:03:10.720> such<00:03:10.989> high

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
and that's again why we have such high

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.030 
and that's again why we have such high
titles<00:03:11.650> across<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:12.580> region<00:03:13.470> now<00:03:14.470> looking

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
titles across the region now looking

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.650 
titles across the region now looking
further<00:03:15.310> into<00:03:15.459> it<00:03:15.850> this<00:03:16.000> is<00:03:16.120> at<00:03:16.239> the<00:03:16.390> surface

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
further into it this is at the surface

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.080 
further into it this is at the surface
and<00:03:17.080> this<00:03:17.170> is<00:03:17.290> our<00:03:17.410> load<00:03:17.680> pressure<00:03:18.040> trying<00:03:18.880> to

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
and this is our load pressure trying to

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.720 
and this is our load pressure trying to
form<00:03:19.299> it<00:03:19.930> is<00:03:20.080> confused<00:03:20.650> with<00:03:20.860> where<00:03:21.070> firm<00:03:21.430> it

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
form it is confused with where firm it

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.550 
form it is confused with where firm it
was<00:03:22.000> over<00:03:22.269> here<00:03:22.480> in<00:03:22.570> North<00:03:22.750> Carolina<00:03:22.930> before

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
was over here in North Carolina before

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.479 
was over here in North Carolina before
and<00:03:23.830> now<00:03:24.280> it's<00:03:24.489> further<00:03:24.790> out<00:03:25.209> in<00:03:25.720> the<00:03:25.870> ocean

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
and now it's further out in the ocean

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.550 
and now it's further out in the ocean
way<00:03:27.489> offshore<00:03:27.730> but<00:03:28.660> again<00:03:28.870> this<00:03:29.080> this<00:03:29.410> is<00:03:29.530> a

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
way offshore but again this this is a

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.229 
way offshore but again this this is a
broad<00:03:29.920> area<00:03:30.370> of<00:03:30.430> low<00:03:30.580> pressure<00:03:30.610> this<00:03:31.000> is<00:03:31.120> what

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
broad area of low pressure this is what

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.699 
broad area of low pressure this is what
the<00:03:31.299> models<00:03:31.630> have<00:03:31.720> been<00:03:31.750> arguing<00:03:32.230> about<00:03:32.380> four

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
the models have been arguing about four

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.250 
the models have been arguing about four
days<00:03:32.970> where<00:03:33.970> the<00:03:34.000> low<00:03:34.390> pressure<00:03:34.630> was<00:03:34.930> finally

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
days where the low pressure was finally

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.660 
days where the low pressure was finally
going<00:03:35.380> to<00:03:35.530> form<00:03:35.799> we've<00:03:36.010> been<00:03:36.160> seeing<00:03:36.370> again

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
going to form we've been seeing again

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.770 
going to form we've been seeing again
back<00:03:36.970> and<00:03:37.180> forth<00:03:37.360> battling<00:03:37.900> of<00:03:37.989> the<00:03:38.110> lows<00:03:39.780> so

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
back and forth battling of the lows so

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.330 
back and forth battling of the lows so
really<00:03:41.380> what's<00:03:41.620> going<00:03:41.739> to<00:03:41.799> happen<00:03:42.100> now<00:03:42.190> with

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
really what's going to happen now with

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.460 
really what's going to happen now with
this<00:03:42.430> negative<00:03:42.910> tilt<00:03:43.180> is<00:03:43.840> that<00:03:44.320> this

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
this negative tilt is that this

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.930 
this negative tilt is that this
low-pressure<00:03:44.920> system<00:03:45.430> is<00:03:45.549> going<00:03:45.640> to<00:03:45.760> develop

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
low-pressure system is going to develop

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.890 
low-pressure system is going to develop
right<00:03:46.360> around<00:03:46.600> here<00:03:47.019> and<00:03:47.230> move<00:03:48.070> further<00:03:48.610> north

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
right around here and move further north

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.630 
right around here and move further north
hold<00:03:49.900> the<00:03:50.080> club<00:03:50.350> coast<00:03:50.709> a<00:03:50.920> little<00:03:51.280> bit<00:03:51.400> more

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
hold the club coast a little bit more

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.960 
hold the club coast a little bit more
and<00:03:52.019> you<00:03:53.019> know<00:03:53.140> hence<00:03:53.590> it's<00:03:54.190> going<00:03:54.489> to<00:03:54.610> throw

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
and you know hence it's going to throw

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.660 
and you know hence it's going to throw
back<00:03:55.209> heavier<00:03:55.930> snowfall<00:03:56.320> totals<00:03:56.920> towards<00:03:57.549> the

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
back heavier snowfall totals towards the

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.100 
back heavier snowfall totals towards the
coast<00:03:57.880> and<00:03:58.060> that's<00:03:58.209> why<00:03:58.330> we're<00:03:58.540> honing<00:03:58.750> in<00:03:58.989> on

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
coast and that's why we're honing in on

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.979 
coast and that's why we're honing in on
that<00:03:59.230> detail<00:03:59.470> so<00:03:59.920> much<00:04:00.160> um<00:04:00.600> it's<00:04:01.600> because

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
that detail so much um it's because

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:03.270 
that detail so much um it's because
that's<00:04:02.200> something<00:04:02.410> that<00:04:02.560> people<00:04:02.950> are<00:04:03.010> kind<00:04:03.250> of

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
that's something that people are kind of

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.070 
that's something that people are kind of
overlooking<00:04:03.790> right<00:04:04.030> now<00:04:04.180> and<00:04:04.420> it's<00:04:04.870> one<00:04:04.989> of

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
overlooking right now and it's one of

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.259 
overlooking right now and it's one of
those<00:04:05.170> nowcasting<00:04:05.860> developing<00:04:06.310> developments

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
those nowcasting developing developments

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.759 
those nowcasting developing developments
that<00:04:07.780> we're<00:04:07.930> currently<00:04:08.230> watching<00:04:08.620> um<00:04:10.709> now<00:04:11.709> to

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
that we're currently watching um now to

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.620 
that we're currently watching um now to
look<00:04:12.459> at<00:04:12.579> you<00:04:12.850> know<00:04:12.970> putting<00:04:13.209> it<00:04:13.360> all<00:04:13.480> together

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
look at you know putting it all together

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.560 
look at you know putting it all together
and<00:04:14.140> and<00:04:14.739> taking<00:04:15.459> the<00:04:15.549> analysis<00:04:16.030> and<00:04:16.359> kind<00:04:16.510> of

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
and and taking the analysis and kind of

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.030 
and and taking the analysis and kind of
putting<00:04:16.720> it<00:04:16.870> into<00:04:16.989> one<00:04:17.229> map<00:04:17.470> this<00:04:17.680> is<00:04:17.799> what<00:04:17.950> we

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
putting it into one map this is what we

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.400 
putting it into one map this is what we
put<00:04:18.220> out<00:04:18.250> about<00:04:18.910> two<00:04:19.209> hours<00:04:19.359> ago<00:04:19.660> and<00:04:19.989> this

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
put out about two hours ago and this

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.230 
put out about two hours ago and this
kind<00:04:20.590> of<00:04:20.680> explains<00:04:21.040> everything<00:04:21.310> so<00:04:21.669> good<00:04:21.700> you

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
kind of explains everything so good you

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.880 
kind of explains everything so good you
know<00:04:22.330> don't<00:04:22.840> know<00:04:22.960> whether<00:04:23.200> in<00:04:23.410> depth<00:04:23.620> for

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
know don't know whether in depth for

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.160 
know don't know whether in depth for
people<00:04:24.099> that<00:04:24.190> didn't<00:04:24.340> understand

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
people that didn't understand

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.050 
people that didn't understand
again<00:04:25.500> we<00:04:25.650> have<00:04:25.830> this<00:04:25.950> Arctic<00:04:26.490> disturbance

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
again we have this Arctic disturbance

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.980 
again we have this Arctic disturbance
and<00:04:27.240> you<00:04:27.330> could<00:04:27.480> see<00:04:27.630> in<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:27.840> bottom

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
and you could see in the bottom

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.110 
and you could see in the bottom
right-hand<00:04:28.320> corner<00:04:28.620> as<00:04:28.950> well<00:04:29.160> this<00:04:29.700> Arctic

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
right-hand corner as well this Arctic

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.790 
right-hand corner as well this Arctic
disturbance<00:04:30.630> that's<00:04:30.870> moving<00:04:31.230> through<00:04:31.770> the

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
disturbance that's moving through the

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.910 
disturbance that's moving through the
area<00:04:32.190> and<00:04:32.520> taking<00:04:33.450> his<00:04:33.600> trough<00:04:33.930> and<00:04:34.290> what<00:04:34.830> it's

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
area and taking his trough and what it's

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.010 
area and taking his trough and what it's
doing<00:04:35.220> is<00:04:35.310> it's<00:04:35.520> changing<00:04:36.030> the<00:04:36.120> access<00:04:36.510> from<00:04:36.780> a

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
doing is it's changing the access from a

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.670 
doing is it's changing the access from a
neutral<00:04:37.860> tilt<00:04:38.250> to<00:04:38.790> a<00:04:39.060> negative<00:04:39.510> tilt<00:04:39.930> now<00:04:40.530> I'm

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
neutral tilt to a negative tilt now I'm

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.960 
neutral tilt to a negative tilt now I'm
not<00:04:40.710> going<00:04:40.890> to<00:04:40.950> go<00:04:41.040> to<00:04:41.160> all<00:04:41.280> the<00:04:41.400> details<00:04:41.760> about

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
not going to go to all the details about

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.880 
not going to go to all the details about
what<00:04:42.150> exactly<00:04:42.540> that<00:04:42.570> means<00:04:42.690> but<00:04:43.560> what<00:04:43.740> you

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
what exactly that means but what you

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.200 
what exactly that means but what you
should<00:04:44.100> know<00:04:44.220> is<00:04:44.250> that<00:04:44.520> this<00:04:44.610> negative<00:04:45.030> tilt

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
should know is that this negative tilt

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.510 
should know is that this negative tilt
is<00:04:45.360> going<00:04:45.630> to<00:04:45.690> allow<00:04:46.020> the<00:04:46.050> storm<00:04:46.590> system<00:04:46.980> to

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
is going to allow the storm system to

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.920 
is going to allow the storm system to
move<00:04:47.670> a<00:04:47.790> little<00:04:47.940> further<00:04:48.150> north<00:04:48.300> hug<00:04:48.810> the

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
move a little further north hug the

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.960 
move a little further north hug the
coast<00:04:49.140> a<00:04:49.260> little<00:04:49.440> bit<00:04:49.530> more<00:04:49.650> and<00:04:49.970> enhance

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
coast a little bit more and enhance

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.180 
coast a little bit more and enhance
snowfall<00:04:51.690> across<00:04:52.350> this<00:04:52.650> region<00:04:52.860> that<00:04:53.130> I've

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
snowfall across this region that I've

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.060 
snowfall across this region that I've
highlighted<00:04:53.520> in<00:04:53.760> the<00:04:53.850> worst<00:04:54.060> of<00:04:54.240> the<00:04:54.330> storm<00:04:55.070> we

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
highlighted in the worst of the storm we

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.010 
highlighted in the worst of the storm we
have<00:04:56.250> this<00:04:56.400> nice<00:04:56.700> subtropical<00:04:57.480> jet<00:04:57.720> that's

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
have this nice subtropical jet that's

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.450 
have this nice subtropical jet that's
coming<00:04:58.290> up<00:04:58.350> you<00:04:58.470> can<00:04:58.590> see<00:04:58.680> again<00:04:58.920> the<00:04:59.100> bottom

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
coming up you can see again the bottom

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.490 
coming up you can see again the bottom
right-hand<00:04:59.610> corner<00:04:59.880> and<00:05:00.390> that's<00:05:00.840> allowing

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
right-hand corner and that's allowing

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.830 
right-hand corner and that's allowing
all<00:05:01.680> this<00:05:01.890> moisture<00:05:02.130> to<00:05:02.790> be<00:05:02.880> drawn<00:05:03.180> in<00:05:03.390> along

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
all this moisture to be drawn in along

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.320 
all this moisture to be drawn in along
the<00:05:04.500> coastline<00:05:04.950> so<00:05:05.850> that's<00:05:06.000> why<00:05:06.120> we're<00:05:06.240> going

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
the coastline so that's why we're going

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.470 
the coastline so that's why we're going
to<00:05:06.420> see<00:05:06.570> turtles<00:05:06.810> so<00:05:07.350> high<00:05:08.360> something<00:05:09.360> I

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
to see turtles so high something I

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.740 
to see turtles so high something I
should<00:05:09.660> also<00:05:09.780> mention<00:05:09.960> is<00:05:10.410> this<00:05:10.560> area<00:05:10.860> up<00:05:11.190> here

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
should also mention is this area up here

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.480 
should also mention is this area up here
just<00:05:12.750> to<00:05:12.870> the<00:05:12.990> north<00:05:13.200> of<00:05:13.290> Boston<00:05:13.770> and<00:05:13.980> across

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
just to the north of Boston and across

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.550 
just to the north of Boston and across
even<00:05:14.940> some<00:05:15.570> of<00:05:15.630> the<00:05:15.690> other<00:05:15.900> portions<00:05:16.410> of

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
even some of the other portions of

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.180 
even some of the other portions of
Massachusetts<00:05:17.310> we're<00:05:18.030> getting<00:05:18.360> reports<00:05:18.540> of

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
Massachusetts we're getting reports of

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.250 
Massachusetts we're getting reports of
upwards<00:05:20.190> of<00:05:20.340> 20<00:05:20.790> inches<00:05:21.210> of<00:05:21.390> snow<00:05:21.660> and<00:05:21.930> this

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
upwards of 20 inches of snow and this

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.290 
upwards of 20 inches of snow and this
store<00:05:22.500> has<00:05:22.800> barely<00:05:23.130> started<00:05:23.280> for<00:05:23.760> those<00:05:23.880> areas

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
store has barely started for those areas

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.030 
store has barely started for those areas
so<00:05:24.810> what<00:05:24.960> that<00:05:24.990> tells<00:05:25.290> me<00:05:25.380> is<00:05:25.500> that<00:05:25.740> we're

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
so what that tells me is that we're

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.280 
so what that tells me is that we're
going<00:05:26.130> to<00:05:26.190> see<00:05:26.490> area<00:05:27.000> here<00:05:27.330> that<00:05:27.360> ends<00:05:27.930> up<00:05:28.020> with

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
going to see area here that ends up with

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.980 
going to see area here that ends up with
more<00:05:29.160> than<00:05:29.310> two<00:05:29.520> feet<00:05:29.700> of<00:05:29.760> snow<00:05:29.850> and<00:05:30.300> it's

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
more than two feet of snow and it's

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.350 
more than two feet of snow and it's
actually<00:05:31.440> very<00:05:31.470> lightly<00:05:31.860> likely<00:05:32.460> I<00:05:32.640> only

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
actually very lightly likely I only

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.620 
actually very lightly likely I only
heard<00:05:33.840> of<00:05:33.990> a<00:05:34.050> point<00:05:34.290> of<00:05:34.410> 22<00:05:34.980> inches<00:05:35.280> of<00:05:35.460> snow<00:05:35.730> to

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
heard of a point of 22 inches of snow to

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.780 
heard of a point of 22 inches of snow to
the<00:05:36.690> north<00:05:36.780> of<00:05:37.170> Boston<00:05:37.680> which<00:05:37.980> is<00:05:38.160> absolutely

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
the north of Boston which is absolutely

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.940 
the north of Boston which is absolutely
incredible<00:05:39.420> this<00:05:39.900> is<00:05:40.020> from<00:05:40.200> the<00:05:40.230> high<00:05:40.500> ratio

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
incredible this is from the high ratio

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.310 
incredible this is from the high ratio
snows<00:05:41.280> and<00:05:41.580> from<00:05:42.120> the<00:05:42.240> overrun<00:05:42.630> event<00:05:43.020> that<00:05:43.230> we

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
snows and from the overrun event that we

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.740 
snows and from the overrun event that we
saw<00:05:43.500> earlier<00:05:43.770> in<00:05:44.100> the<00:05:44.190> day<00:05:44.370> so<00:05:45.240> you<00:05:45.600> know<00:05:45.720> don't

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
saw earlier in the day so you know don't

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.040 
saw earlier in the day so you know don't
be<00:05:46.200> surprised<00:05:46.620> to<00:05:46.800> see<00:05:46.950> totals<00:05:47.340> around<00:05:47.490> here

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
be surprised to see totals around here

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.250 
be surprised to see totals around here
25<00:05:49.050> 26<00:05:49.650> 27<00:05:49.770> you<00:05:50.760> know<00:05:50.880> up<00:05:51.120> to<00:05:51.180> 30<00:05:51.720> inches<00:05:51.960> of

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
25 26 27 you know up to 30 inches of

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.130 
25 26 27 you know up to 30 inches of
snow<00:05:52.500> is<00:05:52.770> not<00:05:53.340> out<00:05:53.580> of<00:05:53.610> the<00:05:53.820> question<00:05:54.140> it's

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140 
snow is not out of the question it's

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.390 
snow is not out of the question it's
just<00:05:55.350> the<00:05:55.470> kind<00:05:55.680> of<00:05:55.770> storm<00:05:56.010> we're<00:05:56.160> dealing

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.330 
just the kind of storm we're dealing
with<00:05:56.430> here<00:05:56.930> it's<00:05:57.930> very<00:05:58.200> tricky<00:05:58.680> to<00:05:58.890> forecast

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
with here it's very tricky to forecast

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.820 
with here it's very tricky to forecast
again<00:06:00.210> I've<00:06:00.420> highlighted<00:06:00.720> the<00:06:00.900> coastline<00:06:01.380> for

across southwestern Connecticut so this

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.580
