00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:21.719 
worth noting that i did go ahead and

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:24.380 
worth noting that i did go ahead and
boot<00:01:21.990> this<00:01:22.110> up<00:01:22.350> on<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.740> map<00:01:23.250> size<00:01:23.520> classic<00:01:24.210> and

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
boot this up on the map size classic and

boot this up on the map size classic and
that's<00:01:24.930> just<00:01:25.079> so<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.380> i<00:01:25.409> can<00:01:25.500> easier<00:01:25.890> or<00:01:26.189> more

that's just so that i can easier or more

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.520 
that's just so that i can easier or more
easily<00:01:26.850> rather<00:01:27.119> showcase<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:28.200> for

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
easily rather showcase this for

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
here this is exactly where you spawn or

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.050 
here this is exactly where you spawn or

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
this is where i spawned rather and it's

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.359 
this is where i spawned rather and it's
on<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:42.450> kind<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:42.990> island<00:01:43.409> up<00:01:43.530> here<00:01:43.770> now<00:01:44.159> like

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
on this kind of island up here now like

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.529 
on this kind of island up here now like
I<00:01:44.490> said<00:01:44.520> at<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.850> very<00:01:44.939> beginning<00:01:45.179> of<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
I said at the very beginning of the

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:47.270 
I said at the very beginning of the
video<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:45.929> map<00:01:46.140> has<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.469> lot<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.859> water<00:01:47.130> i

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
video this map has a lot of water i

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.149 
video this map has a lot of water i
would<00:01:47.579> say<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.030> it's<00:01:48.479> probably<00:01:49.049> at<00:01:49.439> least<00:01:49.829> at

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
would say that it's probably at least at

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.160 
would say that it's probably at least at
least<00:01:50.219> at<00:01:50.579> least<00:01:50.640> sixty<00:01:51.240> percent<00:01:51.390> water<00:01:51.810> and

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
least at least sixty percent water and

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.840 
least at least sixty percent water and
the<00:01:52.560> cool<00:01:52.799> thing<00:01:52.829> about<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:53.340> map<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.579> that

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
the cool thing about this map is that

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.520 
the cool thing about this map is that
you<00:01:53.909> can<00:01:54.060> see<00:01:54.299> kind<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.869> north<00:01:55.200> part<00:01:55.469> of

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
you can see kind of in the north part of

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.039 
you can see kind of in the north part of
this<00:01:55.649> map<00:01:55.859> there<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.609> a<00:01:56.640> lot<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.119> land<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.960> in

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
this map there is a lot of land and in

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.539 
this map there is a lot of land and in
the<00:01:58.140> southern<00:01:58.469> part<00:01:58.499> there's<00:01:58.890> just<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.249> lot<00:01:59.399> of

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
the southern part there's just a lot of

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.730 
the southern part there's just a lot of
islands<00:01:59.969> in<00:02:00.119> water<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:01.049> depending<00:02:01.469> on<00:02:01.590> what

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
islands in water so depending on what

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.200 
islands in water so depending on what

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
your world you can maybe build like a

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.789 
your world you can maybe build like a
house<00:02:05.850> or<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.119> hut<00:02:06.359> or<00:02:06.509> something<00:02:06.869> up<00:02:06.990> here<00:02:07.590> on

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
house or a hut or something up here on

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.249 
house or a hut or something up here on
this<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.580> top<00:02:08.880> part<00:02:09.119> of<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.330> map<00:02:09.569> up<00:02:09.960> on<00:02:10.170> the

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
this the top part of the map up on the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.900 
this the top part of the map up on the
northern<00:02:10.619> section<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.160> then<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.370> can<00:02:11.520> go<00:02:11.670> off

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
northern section and then you can go off

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.460 
northern section and then you can go off
and<00:02:11.940> explore<00:02:12.390> these<00:02:12.660> southern<00:02:12.930> islands<00:02:13.380> if

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
and explore these southern islands if

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.870 
and explore these southern islands if
that's<00:02:13.980> what<00:02:14.069> you<00:02:14.160> want<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.400> do<00:02:14.460> I<00:02:14.520> just<00:02:14.700> really

that's what you want to do I just really
think<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.120> this<00:02:15.180> map<00:02:15.360> has<00:02:15.600> had<00:02:16.080> so<00:02:16.260> many

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
think that this map has had so many

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.960 
think that this map has had so many
diverse<00:02:16.740> little<00:02:16.980> features<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:17.610> I

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
diverse little features to it and I

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:18.830 
diverse little features to it and I

seeing on this map don't have a
blacksmith<00:02:52.709> in<00:02:52.890> them<00:02:53.069> however<00:02:53.760> just<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.150> sheer

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
blacksmith in them however just a sheer

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.180 
blacksmith in them however just a sheer
number<00:02:54.780> of<00:02:54.810> them<00:02:55.049> will<00:02:55.230> give<00:02:55.379> you<00:02:55.470> an<00:02:55.590> absolute

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
number of them will give you an absolute

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.250 
number of them will give you an absolute
massive<00:02:56.640> number<00:02:56.909> of<00:02:56.940> trading<00:02:57.390> options<00:02:57.780> that

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
massive number of trading options that

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.440 
massive number of trading options that

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
you can do and I just think it's a super

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
that you're going to see that over here

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.080 
that you're going to see that over here
we<00:03:03.989> have<00:03:04.200> yet<00:03:04.409> another<00:03:04.889> village<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.519> right<00:03:05.970> on

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
we have yet another village and right on

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.879 
we have yet another village and right on
the<00:03:06.180> other<00:03:06.209> side<00:03:06.359> of<00:03:06.599> that<00:03:06.780> another<00:03:07.470> village

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889 
the other side of that another village

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.339 
the other side of that another village
and<00:03:08.069> right<00:03:08.489> on<00:03:08.609> the<00:03:08.700> other<00:03:08.730> side<00:03:08.909> of<00:03:09.150> that<00:03:09.569> you

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
and right on the other side of that you

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.280 
and right on the other side of that you
can<00:03:10.530> see<00:03:10.739> there<00:03:10.950> is<00:03:11.329> if<00:03:12.329> we<00:03:12.450> look<00:03:12.720> very<00:03:12.989> closely

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
can see there is if we look very closely

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.039 
can see there is if we look very closely
you'll<00:03:13.769> see<00:03:13.859> there<00:03:14.609> is<00:03:14.790> another<00:03:15.420> village<00:03:15.900> so

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
you'll see there is another village so

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.420 
you'll see there is another village so
that's<00:03:16.200> right<00:03:16.349> you<00:03:16.409> could<00:03:16.560> actually<00:03:16.739> see<00:03:16.950> from

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.740 
where I'm flying right now you can see
three<00:03:20.099> villages<00:03:20.609> in<00:03:20.849> one<00:03:21.060> render<00:03:21.389> distance<00:03:21.510> so

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
three villages in one render distance so

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.030 
three villages in one render distance so
you<00:03:21.810> can<00:03:21.930> see<00:03:22.049> there's<00:03:22.200> one<00:03:22.230> right<00:03:22.980> there

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
you can see there's one right there

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.550 
you can see there's one right there
there's<00:03:23.639> 10<00:03:24.359> if<00:03:24.690> i<00:03:24.870> turn<00:03:24.930> my<00:03:25.260> camera<00:03:25.470> just

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
there's 10 if i turn my camera just

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.750 
there's 10 if i turn my camera just
right<00:03:25.889> you<00:03:25.920> can<00:03:26.010> see<00:03:26.220> over<00:03:26.340> there<00:03:26.430> on<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.549> left

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
right you can see over there on the left

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.909 
right you can see over there on the left
hand<00:03:26.879> side<00:03:27.000> there's<00:03:27.690> one<00:03:27.989> about<00:03:28.230> right<00:03:28.680> there

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:28.919 
hand side there's one about right there

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:30.650 
hand side there's one about right there
and<00:03:29.220> then<00:03:29.790> there's<00:03:29.970> obviously<00:03:30.299> that<00:03:30.449> one<00:03:30.569> over

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
and then there's obviously that one over

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.259 
and then there's obviously that one over
there<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.019> a<00:03:31.290> desert<00:03:31.470> temple<00:03:31.970> so<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.090> cool

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
there and a desert temple so the cool

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.210 
there and a desert temple so the cool
thing<00:03:33.299> about<00:03:33.449> this<00:03:33.780> map<00:03:34.019> like<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:34.739> said<00:03:34.799> isn't

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
thing about this map like I said isn't

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.400 
thing about this map like I said isn't
necessarily<00:03:35.879> the<00:03:36.000> stuff<00:03:36.359> on<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:36.599> but<00:03:37.230> rather

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
necessarily the stuff on it but rather

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.129 
necessarily the stuff on it but rather
how<00:03:37.829> close<00:03:38.340> together<00:03:38.669> the<00:03:39.060> things<00:03:39.329> are<00:03:39.599> so

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
how close together the things are so

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:41.449 
how close together the things are so

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
right here you can see the coordinates

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.699 
right here you can see the coordinates
for<00:03:41.549> the<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.359> desert<00:03:42.660> temple<00:03:42.959> here<00:03:43.169> and<00:03:43.349> if<00:03:43.650> I

desert<00:04:03.780> temple<00:04:04.049> probably<00:04:04.379> a<00:04:04.410> good<00:04:04.530> starter

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
desert temple probably a good starter

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.710 
desert temple probably a good starter
one<00:04:05.129> because<00:04:05.639> you<00:04:05.669> don't<00:04:05.940> actually<00:04:06.120> spawn<00:04:06.480> too

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
one because you don't actually spawn too

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.240 
one because you don't actually spawn too
far<00:04:06.930> away<00:04:07.079> from<00:04:07.260> from<00:04:07.859> where<00:04:08.010> this<00:04:08.099> is

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
far away from from where this is

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.979 
far away from from where this is
actually<00:04:08.519> at<00:04:08.609> over<00:04:08.849> that<00:04:09.000> way<00:04:09.150> towards<00:04:09.510> the

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
actually at over that way towards the

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.009 
actually at over that way towards the
the<00:04:10.319> other<00:04:10.440> second<00:04:11.010> island<00:04:11.280> I<00:04:11.400> suppose<00:04:11.669> and

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
the other second island I suppose and

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.720 
the other second island I suppose and
then<00:04:13.019> over<00:04:13.230> here<00:04:13.260> like<00:04:13.530> I<00:04:13.650> said<00:04:13.919> you<00:04:14.400> can<00:04:14.430> see

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
then over here like I said you can see

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.420 
then over here like I said you can see
we<00:04:14.879> have<00:04:14.909> yet<00:04:15.269> another<00:04:15.510> village<00:04:15.989> and<00:04:16.229> one<00:04:17.220> more

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
we have yet another village and one more

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.670 
we have yet another village and one more
over<00:04:17.609> here<00:04:17.639> now<00:04:17.909> I<00:04:17.940> think<00:04:18.599> that<00:04:19.109> this<00:04:19.289> village

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
over here now I think that this village

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.439 
over here now I think that this village
over<00:04:19.919> here<00:04:20.099> is<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.370> only<00:04:20.519> one<00:04:20.820> with<00:04:21.030> an<00:04:21.180> actual

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
over here is the only one with an actual

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.060 
over here is the only one with an actual
blacksmith<00:04:21.930> in<00:04:22.109> it<00:04:22.229> and<00:04:22.620> you<00:04:22.680> can<00:04:22.830> see<00:04:22.949> it's

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
blacksmith in it and you can see it's

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.260 
blacksmith in it and you can see it's
kind<00:04:23.159> of<00:04:23.280> raised<00:04:23.490> off<00:04:23.639> of<00:04:23.729> the<00:04:23.789> ground<00:04:23.940> so<00:04:24.150> he

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
kind of raised off of the ground so he

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.460 
kind of raised off of the ground so he
must<00:04:24.449> think<00:04:24.510> he's<00:04:24.750> all<00:04:24.900> high<00:04:25.050> and<00:04:25.080> mighty<00:04:25.260> in

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
must think he's all high and mighty in

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.080 
must think he's all high and mighty in
here<00:04:25.740> so<00:04:26.190> we<00:04:26.310> come<00:04:26.490> in<00:04:26.580> here<00:04:26.729> we<00:04:26.820> can<00:04:26.940> see

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
here so we come in here we can see

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.879 
here so we come in here we can see
exactly<00:04:27.360> we<00:04:27.599> get<00:04:27.720> in<00:04:27.780> the<00:04:27.840> chest<00:04:28.110> a<00:04:28.320> little<00:04:28.560> bit

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
exactly we get in the chest a little bit

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:30.500 
exactly we get in the chest a little bit
of<00:04:28.979> iron<00:04:29.190> some<00:04:29.550> bread<00:04:29.789> a<00:04:29.820> gold<00:04:30.210> and<00:04:30.389> some

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
of iron some bread a gold and some

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.029 
of iron some bread a gold and some
sampling<00:04:30.900> so<00:04:31.050> nothing<00:04:31.289> real<00:04:31.469> special<00:04:31.620> in<00:04:31.950> this

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
sampling so nothing real special in this

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.010 
sampling so nothing real special in this
blacksmith<00:04:32.460> chest<00:04:32.760> but<00:04:33.240> like<00:04:33.419> i<00:04:33.539> said<00:04:33.570> the

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
blacksmith chest but like i said the

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.660 
blacksmith chest but like i said the
digits<00:04:34.409> just<00:04:34.620> the<00:04:34.710> proximity<00:04:35.219> of

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
digits just the proximity of

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.670 
digits just the proximity of
villages<00:04:36.060> together<00:04:36.270> and<00:04:36.660> how<00:04:37.170> close<00:04:37.380> they

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
villages together and how close they

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.220 
villages together and how close they
spawned<00:04:38.040> is<00:04:38.280> absolutely<00:04:38.970> incredible<00:04:39.240> so<00:04:39.990> like

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
spawned is absolutely incredible so like

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.480 
spawned is absolutely incredible so like
I<00:04:40.320> said<00:04:40.380> when<00:04:40.620> you<00:04:40.680> first<00:04:40.890> start<00:04:41.100> off<00:04:41.190> this<00:04:41.280> map

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
I said when you first start off this map

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.440 
I said when you first start off this map
maybe<00:04:41.670> you'll<00:04:41.850> want<00:04:42.030> to<00:04:42.060> come<00:04:42.270> up<00:04:42.420> here

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
maybe you'll want to come up here

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.930 
maybe you'll want to come up here
immediately<00:04:42.900> to<00:04:43.170> this<00:04:43.440> top<00:04:43.680> area<00:04:44.040> and<00:04:44.280> explore

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
immediately to this top area and explore

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.310 
immediately to this top area and explore
these<00:04:45.090> islands<00:04:45.540> you<00:04:45.630> know<00:04:45.720> maybe<00:04:45.900> build<00:04:46.170> a

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
these islands you know maybe build a

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.930 
these islands you know maybe build a
mansion<00:04:46.560> or<00:04:46.860> something<00:04:47.130> on<00:04:47.250> this<00:04:47.400> area<00:04:47.670> and

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
mansion or something on this area and

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.670 
mansion or something on this area and
then<00:04:48.390> you<00:04:48.480> can<00:04:48.660> head<00:04:48.930> down<00:04:49.170> to<00:04:49.320> the<00:04:49.440> southern

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
then you can head down to the southern

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.950 
then you can head down to the southern
area<00:04:50.010> where<00:04:50.610> you<00:04:50.640> can<00:04:50.940> find<00:04:51.330> all<00:04:51.690> of<00:04:51.750> the

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
area where you can find all of the

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.090 
area where you can find all of the
different<00:04:52.260> islands<00:04:52.560> I'm<00:04:52.680> just<00:04:52.860> over<00:04:53.070> here

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
different islands I'm just over here

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.170 
different islands I'm just over here
really<00:04:53.400> quick<00:04:53.520> to<00:04:53.640> make<00:04:53.670> sure<00:04:53.880> that<00:04:54.060> there

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
really quick to make sure that there

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.460 
really quick to make sure that there
actually<00:04:54.300> isn't<00:04:54.600> a<00:04:54.720> blacksmith<00:04:55.080> over<00:04:55.200> here

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
actually isn't a blacksmith over here

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.280 
actually isn't a blacksmith over here
and<00:04:55.620> it<00:04:56.040> doesn't<00:04:56.340> appear<00:04:56.520> that<00:04:56.610> there<00:04:56.850> is<00:04:57.290> like

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
and it doesn't appear that there is like

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.870 
and it doesn't appear that there is like
I've<00:04:58.440> thought<00:04:58.620> and<00:04:58.890> so<00:04:59.310> I<00:04:59.340> will<00:04:59.580> just<00:04:59.610> go<00:04:59.760> ahead

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
I've thought and so I will just go ahead

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.160 
I've thought and so I will just go ahead
and<00:04:59.970> show<00:05:00.150> you<00:05:00.210> guys<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.570> other<00:05:00.690> mushroom

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
and show you guys the other mushroom

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.450 
and show you guys the other mushroom
islands<00:05:01.470> on<00:05:01.560> this<00:05:01.680> map<00:05:01.830> I<00:05:01.920> believe<00:05:02.220> there<00:05:02.370> are

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
islands on this map I believe there are

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.610 
islands on this map I believe there are
two<00:05:02.640> more<00:05:02.820> so<00:05:03.030> three<00:05:03.300> total<00:05:03.480> and<00:05:04.260> you<00:05:04.350> can<00:05:04.500> see

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
two more so three total and you can see

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.600 
two more so three total and you can see
there's<00:05:04.800> a<00:05:04.860> kind<00:05:05.010> of<00:05:05.100> this<00:05:05.220> little<00:05:05.400> river

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
there's a kind of this little river

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.120 
there's a kind of this little river
thing<00:05:05.850> here<00:05:06.120> that<00:05:06.150> kind<00:05:06.480> of<00:05:06.600> goes<00:05:06.780> almost<00:05:07.320> from

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
thing here that kind of goes almost from

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.860 
thing here that kind of goes almost from
sea<00:05:08.550> to<00:05:08.580> sea<00:05:08.700> so<00:05:09.090> i<00:05:09.120> assume<00:05:09.450> that<00:05:09.480> there's<00:05:09.780> a

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
sea to sea so i assume that there's a

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.020 
sea to sea so i assume that there's a
sea<00:05:10.050> up<00:05:10.170> that<00:05:10.350> way<00:05:10.500> that<00:05:11.280> this<00:05:11.580> River<00:05:11.940> goes

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
sea up that way that this River goes

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.030 
sea up that way that this River goes
from<00:05:12.720> sea<00:05:12.960> to<00:05:12.990> sea<00:05:13.110> actually<00:05:13.560> so<00:05:13.680> it<00:05:13.770> connects

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
from sea to sea actually so it connects

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.830 
from sea to sea actually so it connects
it<00:05:14.160> so<00:05:14.580> if<00:05:14.670> you<00:05:14.760> had<00:05:14.880> a<00:05:14.910> boat<00:05:15.150> of<00:05:15.300> some<00:05:15.510> sort<00:05:15.720> you

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
it so if you had a boat of some sort you

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.960 
it so if you had a boat of some sort you
could<00:05:15.960> actually<00:05:16.140> travel<00:05:16.770> along<00:05:17.430> that<00:05:17.790> the

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
could actually travel along that the

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.420 
could actually travel along that the
entire<00:05:18.300> way<00:05:18.690> now<00:05:19.350> flying<00:05:19.710> up<00:05:19.920> here<00:05:19.950> into<00:05:20.340> the

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
entire way now flying up here into the

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.130 
entire way now flying up here into the
northern<00:05:20.640> corner<00:05:21.120> which<00:05:21.420> there<00:05:21.600> is<00:05:21.750> a<00:05:21.780> couple

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
northern corner which there is a couple

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.410 
northern corner which there is a couple
islands<00:05:22.620> up<00:05:22.710> here<00:05:22.920> you<00:05:23.400> are<00:05:23.550> going<00:05:23.760> to<00:05:23.850> see<00:05:24.090> one

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
islands up here you are going to see one

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.180 
islands up here you are going to see one
of<00:05:24.540> these<00:05:24.630> islands<00:05:25.080> is<00:05:25.200> actually<00:05:25.770> a<00:05:25.800> mooshroom

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
of these islands is actually a mooshroom

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.160 
of these islands is actually a mooshroom
island<00:05:26.550> so<00:05:26.640> here's<00:05:26.850> yet<00:05:27.060> another<00:05:27.090> one<00:05:27.540> right

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
island so here's yet another one right

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.920 
island so here's yet another one right
here<00:05:28.970> so<00:05:29.970> again<00:05:30.210> you<00:05:30.330> can<00:05:30.450> check<00:05:30.600> this<00:05:30.720> one<00:05:30.870> out

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
here so again you can check this one out

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.630 
here so again you can check this one out
for<00:05:31.620> yourself<00:05:31.740> and<00:05:32.160> I'm<00:05:32.220> actually<00:05:32.340> going<00:05:32.550> to

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
for yourself and I'm actually going to

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.740 
for yourself and I'm actually going to
sleep<00:05:32.850> really<00:05:32.970> quick<00:05:33.210> before<00:05:33.360> we<00:05:33.480> go<00:05:33.630> and

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
sleep really quick before we go and

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.690 
sleep really quick before we go and
check<00:05:33.870> out<00:05:34.080> the<00:05:34.560> last<00:05:34.830> one<00:05:35.070> just<00:05:35.190> so<00:05:35.340> it's<00:05:35.520> a

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
check out the last one just so it's a

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.040 
check out the last one just so it's a
little<00:05:35.910> bit<00:05:36.030> nicer<00:05:36.240> out<00:05:36.570> here<00:05:36.600> so<00:05:36.900> we<00:05:36.930> can

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
little bit nicer out here so we can

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.950 
little bit nicer out here so we can
actually<00:05:37.170> see<00:05:37.530> what<00:05:38.220> is<00:05:38.400> going<00:05:38.790> on<00:05:39.030> and<00:05:39.330> I

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
actually see what is going on and I

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.300 
actually see what is going on and I
really<00:05:40.200> like<00:05:40.320> I<00:05:40.440> said<00:05:40.620> like<00:05:40.710> this<00:05:40.890> map<00:05:41.070> just

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
really like I said like this map just

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.740 
really like I said like this map just
because<00:05:41.610> of<00:05:41.730> the<00:05:41.760> diversity<00:05:41.970> I<00:05:42.360> really<00:05:42.630> don't

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
because of the diversity I really don't

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.180 
because of the diversity I really don't
know<00:05:42.780> how<00:05:42.900> many<00:05:43.050> times<00:05:43.140> I<00:05:43.290> can<00:05:43.440> say<00:05:43.470> that<00:05:43.620> it's

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
know how many times I can say that it's

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:45.680 
know how many times I can say that it's
just<00:05:44.490> it's<00:05:44.670> just<00:05:44.730> kind<00:05:45.000> of<00:05:45.060> cool<00:05:45.240> not<00:05:45.510> very

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
just it's just kind of cool not very

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.050 
just it's just kind of cool not very
many<00:05:45.840> maps<00:05:46.140> do<00:05:46.350> you<00:05:46.410> have<00:05:46.620> the<00:05:46.740> option<00:05:46.950> of<00:05:47.340> you

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
many maps do you have the option of you

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.090 
many maps do you have the option of you
know<00:05:48.180> being<00:05:48.540> on<00:05:48.750> land<00:05:49.170> for<00:05:49.470> half<00:05:49.680> of<00:05:49.830> the<00:05:49.950> time

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
know being on land for half of the time

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.100 
know being on land for half of the time
and<00:05:50.460> being<00:05:50.730> at<00:05:50.910> sea<00:05:51.150> for<00:05:51.180> the<00:05:51.450> other<00:05:51.570> half<00:05:51.870> and

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
and being at sea for the other half and

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.140 
and being at sea for the other half and
that's<00:05:52.650> just<00:05:52.770> because<00:05:53.070> most<00:05:53.550> maps<00:05:53.790> are<00:05:54.000> either

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
that's just because most maps are either

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.480 
that's just because most maps are either
all<00:05:54.450> land<00:05:54.780> or<00:05:54.960> all<00:05:55.080> ocean<00:05:55.560> you<00:05:55.980> know<00:05:56.010> or<00:05:56.280> like<00:05:56.430> a

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
all land or all ocean you know or like a

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.030 
all land or all ocean you know or like a
ridiculous<00:05:56.700> mix<00:05:57.270> of<00:05:57.390> the<00:05:57.480> two<00:05:57.510> so<00:05:57.900> I<00:05:58.650> just

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.040 
ridiculous mix of the two so I just

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.740 
ridiculous mix of the two so I just
think<00:05:59.220> this<00:05:59.400> map<00:05:59.610> is<00:05:59.640> kind<00:06:00.210> of<00:06:00.270> a<00:06:00.330> cool<00:06:00.480> and<00:06:00.630> I

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
think this map is kind of a cool and I

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.390 
think this map is kind of a cool and I
thought<00:06:00.900> you<00:06:00.990> guys<00:06:01.110> might<00:06:01.290> enjoy<00:06:01.350> and<00:06:02.010> not<00:06:02.280> to

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
thought you guys might enjoy and not to

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.800 
thought you guys might enjoy and not to

just you know that typical forest biome

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.110 
just you know that typical forest biome

you are looking for so as far as this
seed<00:06:39.630> goes<00:06:39.870> I<00:06:40.080> think<00:06:40.110> that's<00:06:40.590> about<00:06:40.770> it<00:06:40.980> i<00:06:41.190> hope

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.550 
seed goes I think that's about it i hope

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.520 
seed goes I think that's about it i hope
you<00:06:41.700> guys<00:06:41.850> did<00:06:42.000> enjoy<00:06:42.090> this<00:06:42.360> video<00:06:42.480> and<00:06:42.780> like<00:06:43.440> i

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:43.530 
you guys did enjoy this video and like i

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:44.720 
you guys did enjoy this video and like i
said<00:06:43.590> just<00:06:43.860> like<00:06:44.010> the<00:06:44.310> i<00:06:44.340> don't<00:06:44.640> know<00:06:44.700> just

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:44.730 
said just like the i don't know just

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:45.950 
said just like the i don't know just
these<00:06:44.970> islands<00:06:45.420> down<00:06:45.510> here<00:06:45.690> i<00:06:45.720> think<00:06:45.810> the

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 
these islands down here i think the

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.090 
these islands down here i think the
islands<00:06:46.380> are<00:06:46.440> really<00:06:46.620> what<00:06:46.740> I<00:06:46.770> like<00:06:46.950> the<00:06:47.070> most

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:47.100 
islands are really what I like the most

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.070 
islands are really what I like the most
because<00:06:47.880> if<00:06:48.000> you<00:06:48.060> look<00:06:48.240> around<00:06:48.390> you<00:06:48.720> can<00:06:48.750> just

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 
because if you look around you can just

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.570 
because if you look around you can just
see<00:06:49.200> there<00:06:49.350> are

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:49.580 
see there are

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.189 
see there are
absolute<00:06:49.970> massive<00:06:50.449> number<00:06:50.659> of<00:06:50.689> islands<00:06:51.020> is<00:06:51.139> a

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:51.199 
absolute massive number of islands is a

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:53.140 
absolute massive number of islands is a
good<00:06:51.409> bit<00:06:51.560> of<00:06:51.590> distance<00:06:51.830> between<00:06:52.039> between<00:06:52.970> all

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.150 
good bit of distance between between all

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:54.010 
good bit of distance between between all
of<00:06:53.180> them<00:06:53.330> you<00:06:53.449> can<00:06:53.569> see<00:06:53.720> that<00:06:53.870> there<00:06:53.990> is

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.020 
of them you can see that there is

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.140 
of them you can see that there is
another<00:06:54.349> one<00:06:54.500> way<00:06:54.800> over<00:06:55.069> there<00:06:55.250> there's<00:06:55.909> some

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.150 
another one way over there there's some

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:57.189 
another one way over there there's some
over<00:06:56.360> here<00:06:56.389> and<00:06:56.750> it's<00:06:56.870> just<00:06:57.050> this<00:06:57.139> whole

00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 
over here and it's just this whole

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:00.490 
over here and it's just this whole
southern<00:06:57.889> area<00:06:58.400> of<00:06:58.780> water<00:06:59.780> and<00:07:00.050> islands<00:07:00.409> that

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:00.500 
southern area of water and islands that

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.080 
southern area of water and islands that
I<00:07:00.530> thought<00:07:00.740> was<00:07:00.889> kind<00:07:01.039> of<00:07:01.159> cool<00:07:01.310> and<00:07:01.580> I<00:07:01.939> thought

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.090 
I thought was kind of cool and I thought

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.909 
I thought was kind of cool and I thought
you<00:07:02.210> guys<00:07:02.300> might<00:07:02.509> enjoy<00:07:02.569> so<00:07:03.169> anyway<00:07:03.800> that's

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:03.919 
you guys might enjoy so anyway that's

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:05.469 
you guys might enjoy so anyway that's
probably<00:07:04.340> about<00:07:04.460> it<00:07:04.699> for<00:07:04.849> this<00:07:04.939> video<00:07:05.090> and<00:07:05.270> it
