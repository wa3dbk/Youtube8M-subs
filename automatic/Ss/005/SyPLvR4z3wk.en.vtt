00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.380
 we do not have this tablet 

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:09.050
 7-inch chrono 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.120
 model 70 20 which has arrived because 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.950
 does not want to load and the first thing we're going 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.500
 to do is a very simple review 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.540
 let's try in this case how many 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.520
 has the battery at this time we are going to 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:23.660
 place the multimeter on the 20 scale 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.500
 and in voltage measurement we will see that 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.300
 have 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.960
 they brought it with 2.40 what they did not light 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.960
 neither the tablet nor the charger was capable of 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.700
 revive the and yacanto of 7 349 without 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.739
 However, with this voltage, 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.650
 turn on the table and if you get to turn on 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.460
 it would go off immediately because here 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:50.340
 says that this capacity this battery of 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.559
 3.7 volts should have that that voltage 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.980
 to be able to turn on the tablet and have 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.180
 a capacity of 3400 milliamps of 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.240
 durability 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.260
 what is an average plus or minus 3 to 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.480
 5 hours of use of the tablet 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.090
 and what we have to do are two things 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.730
 and we have a source of power then 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.710
 we will be able to if the tablet has the 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.120
 completely dead battery where I 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:21.890
 we gave and did not have any voltage 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.890
 then disconnect and wire the cables 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:29.290
 we would then load another download 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.240
 initial to the tablet to the battery 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.540
 we would connect directly positive with 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.280
 positive and negative with negative 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.920
 we would place our our source of 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.850
 power the source of power is this that 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.550
 we see there we put it in a voltage of 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.609
 3.7 to 4 volts so that another is the 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:52.429
 battery takeoff 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:54.200
 we wait for one or two minutes here not 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:56.659
 we are going to be able to let it charge because 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.460
 we could damage the source of force that 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.130
 it's not for charging batteries but 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.039
 simply to deliver them let's say that 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.649
 we take it off then the second thing that 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.899
 let's do is a reading if the 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.989
 charger is failing because here the 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.489
 client has brought it because it does not charge 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.500
 we connect the charger and we will take 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.530
 a voltage reading is action of the 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.250
 soldered the battery 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.780
 give an average between four and a half 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.400
 between four and a half 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.170
 at 3.7 volts in this case it does not give anything 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.780
 meaning that this charger there what 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.670
 I have connected to the outlet is not sending 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.260
 voltage and there is the fault the client this 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.280
 says he charges a cell phone with this 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.030
 but here no voltage is bouncing 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.890
 since this charger must be so that 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.080
 charge normally and receive the battery 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.810
 It has to be from 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.210
 5 volts to 2000 milliamps and you 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.180
 we connect a cell phone charger that 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:01.330
 are 1000 of 800 milliamperes the 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.220
 tablet going to load around there 10 or 15 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.040
 percent and never charge all your 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.110
 whole here I will do a test 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.530
 of the voltage that goes in when you plugged it in 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.220
 to the usb 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.590
 for you to look 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.930
 as it is when the charger was 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.650
 all right 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.650
 I'm going here to do the voltage tap we see 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.380
 that there are four points 18 volts this 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.590
 voltage is correct 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.020
 4 points 18 volts then wants 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.000
 say the pin the voltage is good and 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.250
 the whole circuit is good because I 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.830
 the proper voltage is coming here 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.570
 the problem is the charger and in this 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.850
 case the client has already tried it with another 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.490
 charger and I will not charge you because the battery 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.040
 it was discharged the whole was left at zero or 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.960
 was left with a voltage so poor that 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.560
 I would need an original charger to 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:56.760
 that the tablet feed the battery and 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:59.490
 over there the 20 or 40 minutes the tablet 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.040
 could revive then here we go to 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.299
 watch 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.299
 I'm going to connect 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.160
 the battery again and after 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.500
 have taken it off if we do not have a 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.930
 We can take off the source in a 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.299
 Universal charger we can weld two 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.190
 cables and cough or try as we can 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.980
 to be able to make contact between the positive and 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.070
 negative and start charging the battery in 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.590
 a universal charger everyone knows 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.020
 the universal charger is a charger 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.529
 cell batteries and there we can 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:35.109
 load now we see here 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:37.349
 that there was a 4.10 voltage but something that 

00:04:35.109 --> 00:04:40.119
 he connected the battery then that voltage 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:42.969
 is reduced because the battery is already 

00:04:40.119 --> 00:04:47.349
 consuming and is storing in your 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:49.509
 inside and that's why he came to 3.53 at what 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:54.549
 the battery will go up that voltage that 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:58.139
 glass goes up there we go 54 go 55 

00:04:54.549 --> 00:05:01.419
 and so on until you reach your full capacity 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:04.839
 yes then we try to turn on the tablet 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:07.239
 there are connected already then now yes 

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:10.109
 would light because the battery is 

00:05:07.239 --> 00:05:10.109
 taking charge 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.949
 the theory is taking charge 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:21.080
 remember if the battery does not have 3.7 and 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:23.810
 has 3.6 and down will not turn on the 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:27.110
 tablet if the battery is bad and the 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:30.710
 we connect to our our computer 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:33.080
 and turn on and off then it can be 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:37.520
 the battery that is damaged we can 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:40.370
 revive the to be able to give this load 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.580
 initial back to the battery there we see 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:46.900
 already turned on the tablet gave us a notice 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.900
 that it is downloaded 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:54.750
 and then we see that the battery is 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:58.760
 totally downloaded would have that 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:00.920
 present before going to do other things 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.750
 and before us to finish another 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.850
 bezel failure arauca service
