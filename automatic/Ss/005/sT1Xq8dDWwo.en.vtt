00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
gameplay mechanic it looks like I'm not

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.869 
gameplay mechanic it looks like I'm not
sure<00:00:59.160> how<00:00:59.250> they're<00:00:59.399> actually<00:00:59.699> going<00:00:59.790> to

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
sure how they're actually going to

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.310 
sure how they're actually going to
implement<00:01:00.089> it<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.540> you<00:01:00.660> can't<00:01:00.870> really<00:01:00.989> say

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
implement it and you can't really say

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.170 
implement it and you can't really say
too<00:01:01.379> much<00:01:01.589> by<00:01:01.769> going<00:01:02.190> by<00:01:02.399> just<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.910> trailer

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
too much by going by just the trailer

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.729 
too much by going by just the trailer
itself<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.989> we'll<00:01:04.110> have<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.350> wait<00:01:04.500> till

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
itself and we'll have to wait till

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.859 
itself and we'll have to wait till
details<00:01:05.159> get<00:01:05.339> released<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:06.360> from<00:01:06.750> the

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
details get released but from the

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.960 
details get released but from the
initial<00:01:07.080> way<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:07.800> looks<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.369> seems<00:01:08.670> like<00:01:08.820> it's

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
initial way it looks it seems like it's

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.730 
initial way it looks it seems like it's
going<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.149> be<00:01:09.210> very<00:01:09.360> interesting<00:01:10.020> like<00:01:10.619> it

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
going to be very interesting like it

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.889 
going to be very interesting like it
seems<00:01:10.890> like<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.430> your<00:01:11.850> actions<00:01:12.030> against<00:01:12.780> the

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
seems like that your actions against the

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:14.450 
seems like that your actions against the
enemies<00:01:13.229> actually<00:01:13.649> have<00:01:13.800> some<00:01:13.979> weight<00:01:14.190> like

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
enemies actually have some weight like

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.370 
enemies actually have some weight like
you<00:01:14.610> can<00:01:14.759> see<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.450> kicking<00:01:15.930> them<00:01:16.050> has<00:01:16.229> an

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
you can see you kicking them has an

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.230 
you can see you kicking them has an
effect<00:01:16.710> or<00:01:17.159> if<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.430> hit<00:01:17.580> them<00:01:17.700> with<00:01:17.850> something

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
effect or if you hit them with something

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.450 
effect or if you hit them with something
it<00:01:18.420> stuns<00:01:18.750> them<00:01:18.990> that's<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.710> lot<00:01:19.890> more<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.280> say

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
it stuns them that's a lot more to say

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.919 
it stuns them that's a lot more to say
than<00:01:20.640> some<00:01:20.820> other<00:01:21.000> games<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.420> try<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.750> do

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:21.929 
than some other games that try to do

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:23.749 
than some other games that try to do
this<00:01:22.080> like<00:01:22.289> medieval<00:01:22.590> combat<00:01:23.009> kind<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.550> stuff

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759
