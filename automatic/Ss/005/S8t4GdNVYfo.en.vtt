00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.719
 it seems a bit like autumn 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.660
 from the big phones 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.990
 first if the 5.7 inch galaxy note 3 then 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.000
 got the 6.4 inch xperia z ultra 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.800
 and this month htc comes with a big one 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.699
 variant of the htc one 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.710
 the 5.9 inch htc one max and the one max 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.699
 closely resembles the normal one 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.340
 the slightly more than half a year ago 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.830
 came out and things run differently 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.140
 so you can remove the back and you 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.739
 htc has a fingerprint scanner 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.739
 added 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.760
 the design is actually more like the 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.190
 one mini from the normal one it comes 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.079
 all the way through that white plastic grande 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.460
 lapping is also on the mini and not around 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.199
 on a normal man with a normal man 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.910
 has a chassis that is complete of 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.460
 aluminum is made and it stays that way 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.270
 my eyes are the most beautiful version 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.820
 to be here 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.619
 differences are not very big though 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.900
 a big difference that is the back 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.000
 which can disconnect now is small here 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.580
 slide to the side and like you 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.590
 so germ now clicks as it were 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.360
 open fold and unfortunately means 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.409
 not that you can replace the battery 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.090
 just stuck 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.830
 but she does have a micro-sd slot 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.479
 built in and that they are definitely one 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.790
 improvement over the others 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.290
 versions of the htc one 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.960
 the construction in the finish is unfortunately 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.950
 not as good as we are used to from htc 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.600
 harry the back again 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.610
 then you don't get very much 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.759
 feedback you need a little clumsy everywhere 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.829
 and then hope that he stuck 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.600
 and if he discovers it is like me 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.590
 does not heal perfectly close at least 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.150
 our test model 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.329
 because there the back closes in the 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.200
 Corners just not ashore macs 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.509
 is as you can see 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.770
 a very large phone, he is happy 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.630
 just in your pocket 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.280
 but to serve nice and you have 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.810
 really need two hands 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.009
 that is of course not really a downside 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.200
 because this thing is just made for 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.939
 people who want a big phone and 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.950
 It also causes a lot 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.200
 nice device is for example on the 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.030
 browser and especially watching videos is going very well 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.399
 nice and that is partly because he won 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.530
 macs the familiar boomerz speakers 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.640
 above and below after flower would it 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.440
 sounds a bit hollow 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.240
 marketing term but it is it 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.950
 really not your speakers really sound one 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.570
 much better than that of others 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.620
 smartphones 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.020
 when macs is one of the few 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.910
 telephones with a fingerprint scanner 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.650
 Motorola has in the past one 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.350
 The most recent of course is the 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.000
 iphone 5s and you can use it to 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.290
 from the lockscreen to the telephone 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.810
 unlock or launch an app 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.640
 for example the camera for that you can 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.230
 up to three different fingers 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.900
 they can all register again 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.150
 other action link the implementation 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.860
 from htc is different from apple 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.900
 to begin with it is not a scanner 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.300
 what you have to put your finger on 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.500
 one that you have to wipe over and 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.480
 in addition, he is not like the 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.490
 iphone on the front but on the 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.950
 back and those two things together 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.210
 make sure it is quite difficult to handle 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.800
 to use 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.360
 you don't see what you think of it 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.440
 you are not blind 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.090
 operate that scanner you must first 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.430
 and then you also need care 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.990
 that you neatly from top to bottom 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.850
 sweep over that scanner otherwise you'll be 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.890
 finger not recognized and start in 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.600
 search for music and work after one 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.970
 few days it was a lot better 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.550
 it never feels really fast or 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.320
 intuitive and finally got that 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.120
 feature range turned off because I am faster 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.250
 could work with a traditional 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.830
 unlock the camera pattern on the cheek 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.690
 ex is almost the same as with the cheek you 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.940
 therefore again receives resolution of four 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.290
 megapixels and that is not much 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.420
 but the sensor is therefore bad 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.940
 photosensitive making photos with even 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.260
 low light look very good 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.700
 you really don't want to go digital 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.530
 zoom or want to crop or large 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.050
 make prints because that's for it 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.150
 resolution just too low 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.260
 compared to the normal man, hc 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.690
 unfortunately the optical 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.700
 image stabilization omitted, I think 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.840
 a real shame because he really wore it again 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.160
 extra with 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.410
 good performance in low light 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.140
 and he also took care of that 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.820
 movies more stable in the eyes 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.640
 inside the band macs is just one 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.180
 normal man he same snapdragon 600 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.400
 chip 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.530
 combined with two chi memory that 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.640
 is not the newest of the newest 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.530
 phones that have recently been switched off 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.260
 and often the faster snapdragon 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.790
 800 sock but that does n't make him almex 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.919
 suddenly outdated and fortunately not 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.900
 slow use the combination of 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.239
 Android 4 point three and their own shell 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.550
 since time point 5 luckily just runs 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.289
 also the screen quality 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.250
 similar to the smaller cheek that 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:28.170
 viewing angles 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.180
 still fine the brightness is high 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:33.120
 the contrast is good and so are the colors 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.100
 and production is fine the only downside 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.050
 that white is a little bit of green 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.030
 and so probably little 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.220
 people stand out but is the one max 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.420
 next to a better screen than you can 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.740
 see the difference 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.710
 And in addition you can in some cases 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.210
 also see vertical line running whole 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.100
 vague you is especially with white 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.610
 backgrounds and what it is exactly that 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.260
 I do not know 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.820
 maybe it's the electrode of it 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.890
 touch screen but that would of course 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.990
 actually not allowed to see and how long the 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.640
 normal version didn't bother 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.070
 compared to normal one is one 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.350
 big difference in battery life that mix has 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.960
 a 33 100 million per hour battery 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.940
 built in and that is considerably more than the 23 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.860
 100 million per hour 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.690
 in the normal cheek now it will be bigger 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.640
 screen a bit more power but ask 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.430
 is part of that extra capacity 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.590
 hours of profit, and you will notice that in our 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.810
 browser test is just slightly more than 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.880
 eleven hours in the video test 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.110
 a good ten in half an hour and 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.880
 this makes it one of the best 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.880
 phones in terms of battery life 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:35.430
 the one max is apart from that 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.309
 fingerprint scanner and that larger battery 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.779
 just an inflated htc one and that 

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:42.089
 not so bad at all because I am still scared 

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:43.949
 He always makes a very good phone 

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:45.779
 However, not as much impression as that man 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:47.370
 made when it came out 

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:49.050
 and that is because the finish is less 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.279
 and what those hardware those eight months 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.460
 ago the newest of the newest 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:55.529
 was yes that of course is no longer 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.389
 htc price that tree merckx though as if 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:59.610
 it is the very best in the fastest 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:02.610
 phone is currently costing 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:05.639
 slightly less than 700 euros that approximately 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.889
 200 euros more than a normal htc one and 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:09.960
 100 euros more than for example 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:11.430
 has a note 3 and that is also large 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.349
 has a good battery life and has another 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.300
 faster hardware 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:17.789
 that doesn't make a new almex a bad one 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.620
 phone but a bad buy what 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:23.539
 the price of the HTC is currently on 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.539
 asking here is certainly not worth it
