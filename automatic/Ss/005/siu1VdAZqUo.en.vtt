told him he was vectoring him around the
727<00:01:48.210> which<00:01:48.630> was<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:48.900> final<00:01:49.260> approach<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
727 which was on final approach and the

pilot who was flying the plane was on

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.740 
pilot who was flying the plane was on
visual<00:01:52.560> flight<00:01:52.830> rules<00:01:52.890> at<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.490> time<00:01:53.760> and<00:01:54.450> I

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
visual flight rules at that time and I

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.480 
visual flight rules at that time and I
looked<00:01:55.020> up<00:01:55.170> out<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.470> my<00:01:55.620> car<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.130> could<00:01:56.310> see

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
looked up out of my car and I could see

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.580 
looked up out of my car and I could see
the<00:01:56.610> plane<00:01:56.820> coming<00:01:57.120> out<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:58.020> my<00:01:58.140> right<00:01:58.380> you

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
the plane coming out to my right you

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.500 
the plane coming out to my right you
could<00:01:58.740> see<00:01:58.890> his<00:01:59.010> navigation<00:01:59.640> lights<00:01:59.850> there

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
could see his navigation lights there

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.780 
could see his navigation lights there
were<00:02:00.600> no<00:02:00.750> flames<00:02:01.080> at<00:02:01.260> that<00:02:01.410> time<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:02.550> thing

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
were no flames at that time the thing

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.520 
were no flames at that time the thing
that<00:02:02.940> struck<00:02:03.150> me<00:02:03.210> odd<00:02:03.510> as<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:03.840> saw<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.230> plane

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
that struck me odd as I saw the plane

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.100 
that struck me odd as I saw the plane
was<00:02:05.220> that<00:02:05.430> its<00:02:06.150> rate<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.480> descent<00:02:06.900> was

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
was that its rate of descent was

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.109 
was that its rate of descent was
extremely<00:02:07.830> steep<00:02:08.100> it<00:02:08.340> was<00:02:08.460> coming<00:02:08.730> down<00:02:08.880> like

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
extremely steep it was coming down like

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.560 
extremely steep it was coming down like
this<00:02:09.390> whereas<00:02:10.100> normally<00:02:11.100> they<00:02:11.760> make<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.000> much

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
this whereas normally they make a much

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.680 
this whereas normally they make a much
more<00:02:12.780> shallow<00:02:13.230> rate<00:02:13.830> of<00:02:13.950> descent<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:14.940> as<00:02:15.540> he

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
more shallow rate of descent and as he

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.330 
more shallow rate of descent and as he
started<00:02:16.050> his<00:02:16.230> flare<00:02:16.560> at<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.800> bottom<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:17.280> this

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
started his flare at the bottom of this

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.090 
started his flare at the bottom of this
descent<00:02:17.760> prior<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.660> landing<00:02:19.080> it<00:02:19.650> looked<00:02:19.920> like

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
descent prior to landing it looked like

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.680 
descent prior to landing it looked like
perhaps<00:02:20.400> he<00:02:20.730> might<00:02:20.910> have<00:02:21.030> started<00:02:21.240> his<00:02:21.420> flare

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
perhaps he might have started his flare

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.330 
perhaps he might have started his flare
too<00:02:21.930> late<00:02:22.140> because<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.740> plane<00:02:22.950> simply

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
too late because the plane simply

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.800 
too late because the plane simply
continued<00:02:23.820> right<00:02:24.030> into<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.360> ground

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
continued right into the ground

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.690 
continued right into the ground
and<00:02:25.320> upon<00:02:25.560> contact<00:02:25.980> with<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.220> ground<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:26.550> could

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
and upon contact with the ground I could

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.280 
and upon contact with the ground I could
hear<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:26.970> crash<00:02:27.210> I<00:02:27.510> was<00:02:27.630> about<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.870> mile<00:02:28.140> away

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
hear the crash I was about a mile away

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.250 
hear the crash I was about a mile away
and<00:02:28.860> there<00:02:29.820> were<00:02:29.910> flames<00:02:30.210> the<00:02:30.630> fuel<00:02:30.870> tanks<00:02:31.200> and

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
and there were flames the fuel tanks and

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.720 
and there were flames the fuel tanks and
the<00:02:31.350> wings<00:02:31.560> undoubtedly<00:02:32.220> had<00:02:32.370> been<00:02:32.490> ruptured

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
the wings undoubtedly had been ruptured

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.210 
the wings undoubtedly had been ruptured
and<00:02:33.600> as<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.930> shot<00:02:34.170> down<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.530> runway<00:02:34.830> finally

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
and as the shot down the runway finally

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.190 
and as the shot down the runway finally
came<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.550> a<00:02:35.580> stop<00:02:35.690> probably<00:02:36.690> about<00:02:36.870> eight<00:02:37.050> or

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
came to a stop probably about eight or

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.560 
came to a stop probably about eight or
nine<00:02:37.230> hundred<00:02:37.350> yards<00:02:37.860> further<00:02:38.040> on<00:02:38.360> then<00:02:39.360> the

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
nine hundred yards further on then the

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.230 
nine hundred yards further on then the
flames<00:02:39.990> really<00:02:40.290> broke<00:02:40.590> out<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:41.880> could<00:02:42.060> see

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
flames really broke out and I could see

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.090 
flames really broke out and I could see
the<00:02:42.360> people<00:02:42.650> leaping<00:02:43.650> out<00:02:43.770> of<00:02:43.830> the<00:02:43.980> aircraft

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
the people leaping out of the aircraft

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.340 
the people leaping out of the aircraft
silhouetted<00:02:44.910> against<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.209> flames<00:02:45.570> it<00:02:45.930> was<00:02:46.050> a

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
silhouetted against the flames it was a

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.020 
silhouetted against the flames it was a
sight<00:02:46.890> one<00:02:47.130> that<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.340> never<00:02:47.520> want<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.760> see<00:02:47.910> again

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
sight one that I never want to see again

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.090 
sight one that I never want to see again
certainly<00:02:48.990> one<00:02:49.200> that<00:02:49.320> I<00:02:49.440> never<00:02:49.650> want<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:49.920> see

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
certainly one that I never want to see

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.710 
certainly one that I never want to see
again<00:02:50.370> as<00:02:50.490> we<00:02:50.640> arrived<00:02:50.970> on<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.330> scene<00:02:51.510> tonight

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
again as we arrived on the scene tonight

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.729 
again as we arrived on the scene tonight
the<00:02:52.440> flame<00:02:52.709> was<00:02:52.980> still<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:55.140> plane<00:02:55.470> was<00:02:55.650> still

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
the flame was still the plane was still

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.940 
the flame was still the plane was still
burning<00:02:56.160> furiously<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:58.230> would<00:02:58.560> speculate

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
burning furiously and I would speculate

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.070 
burning furiously and I would speculate
that<00:02:59.340> most<00:02:59.820> of<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.150> victims<00:03:00.360> in<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.870> plane

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
that most of the victims in the plane

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.460 
that most of the victims in the plane
tonight<00:03:01.260> were<00:03:01.560> overcome<00:03:02.070> by<00:03:02.250> smoke<00:03:02.810> as<00:03:03.810> Morgan

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
tonight were overcome by smoke as Morgan

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.170 
tonight were overcome by smoke as Morgan
