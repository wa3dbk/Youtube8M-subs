00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:13.480
 hello I'm easy painting mate for you 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.549
 today I want to answer several 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.130
 questions that have sent me in 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.380
 relation to varnishes what types of 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.419
 varnishes exist for what they are used 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.460
 how are they applied the most 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:27.820
 What are the ones that I recommend? 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.099
 etcetera these questions have come to 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.290
 root of the final treatment that always 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.480
 I recommend giving finished jobs 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.059
 on the web and especially by the 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.030
 treatment of the candles that we will see in 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:43.540
 the next video I wanted to divide it 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.940
 because they are two separate subjects the 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.329
 first question goes in relation to the type 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:52.390
 we can use varnish roughly 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.460
 and simplifying the subject a lot 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.700
 find in the market two types of 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:01.000
 varnish one to water and the other to 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.130
 solvent what does this mean that 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.100
 to dissolve it or to understand me 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.219
 better when you want to clean your brush or 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.550
 clean your work table for example 

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:14.890
 you will use tap water in the first case 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.280
 as for example the turpentine for 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.280
 second 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.619
 which is with solvent then you have the 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.380
 varnish the water that dissolves with water 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:28.070
 and the solvent varnish that is 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.050
 dissolve for example with turpentine 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.300
 this does not mean that you have to 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.090
 Mix your water with water or mix it 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.610
 with solvent is only the mode of 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.780
 cleaning of the material that we are going to 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.229
 use 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.090
 which I recommend you good since 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.790
 we are painting with paint 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.009
 acrylic that dissolves to water and 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.650
 we usually work at home or in 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.540
 our workshop behind closed doors so that 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.670
 let's use solvents I'll 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.090
 I recommend using water varnish 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.159
 as far as finishing is concerned, the 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.330
 varnish to water as a varnish 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:11.950
 solvent you'll have three varnish options 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.680
 Matte satin and glossy what you want 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.769
 say this 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.280
 It is the final finish that you want 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:23.630
 Give your piece how much brightness you want 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.900
 have your piece once finished 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.930
 If you choose the matt varnish your pieces do not 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.620
 they will shine 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:35.500
 not even appear to have varnish 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.090
 this is fine for example when you do 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.030
 aged jobs 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.700
 If you choose the satin your piece will shine 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.629
 a little bit it will be noticed that it has varnish and 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.910
 will give you some enhancement particularly is 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:51.700
 the one that I use and the one that most 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.280
 apply 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.430
 the bright varnish shines almost like a 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.950
 mirror for my taste is too much but 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.590
 I recognize that by applying in certain areas 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.800
 of certain pieces is very good for 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:10.150
 example the background of a steward or a 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:13.330
 eye dish not to apply on the edges 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.480
 not only in the central design does not give 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:20.220
 much enhancement or also on the surface 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.970
 of jeweler boxes or boxes 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.850
 then 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:29.310
 these varnishes you can find them in 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:31.810
 canister to be applied with a brush or spray 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.330
 particularly I prefer the brush 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.610
 because the spray like you do not in a 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.180
 open space and protecting everything 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.190
 around with newspaper or plastic 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.760
 you can be varnishing everything that is 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:48.810
 in your work area and it seems like a 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.810
 little piggy to work 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.730
 finally 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.370
 and to close the subject a bit I want 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.980
 recommend that the polyurethane varnish that 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:03.569
 is a water-based varnish to apply with 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:06.510
 brush or brush you'll find in mate 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:09.599
 in satin and in bright but that 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.730
 its chemical component has properties 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.489
 that will help us with our 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:17.430
 craft and painting works has 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:20.370
 Excellent quality acts as anti 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.610
 waterproof mold has very good 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.380
 adhesion serves as a sealer and is very 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.160
 resistant 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:32.190
 now where you can find them in 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.890
 any hardware store drugstore 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.810
 of DIY or sale of paintings of 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.190
 wall of course that also the 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.070
 you can find in stores 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.320
 crafts but it will cost you more money 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:46.230
 buy a 100 milliliter bottle 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.590
 in the craft shop that a boat 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:52.430
 of a liter in a hardware store 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:54.530
 Well I hope I have answered so 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.990
 clear to the questions about the 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.300
 varnishes emphasizing again that I have 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.880
 I tried to make a very 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.710
 simplified but to help you choose 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.410
 the varnish to protect your pieces 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.600
 painted you know that if you have more 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.000
 questions or something that was not clear 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.760
 can you leave me your comment on the channel 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.070
 from youtube or on our painting website 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.070
