00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.270
 passenger right now that they will hit is a 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.149
 concept to travel comfortably with

 an autonomy of more than one thousand five hundred 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.199
 nautical miles that is to say us in 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.320
 this plane we can load main 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:58.300
 and fly quietly miami do

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.909
 Venezuela 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.650
 the idea of having a ship 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.830
 fortunate 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.670
 once of regional cut of 50 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.070
 passengers that allow us to give all 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.300
 the passengers comfort tranquility 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.410
 we are in maracay 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.870
 we fight with none of our 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.610
 sisters after we had money from 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.130
 maracaibo from it to see everything 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.220
 which is the area another version 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.040
 western and from and do operations 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.810
 from maracaibo to maiquetÃ­a 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.840
 We are mainly going to fly by sea 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.450
 to san antonio abad effort hunger 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.650
 mark 200 songs I fall 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:49.420
 barquisimeto maracaibo rooms the week 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.420
 and later already 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.600
 an international would fly from 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.230
 Maracaibo towards the city of MedellÃ­n 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.660
 Bogota Cartagena and let's say the republic 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.630
 Dominican and say to panama would do more 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.520
 astro americas and from porlamar that goes to 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.730
 be our second base of operations 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.620
 we will be talking to the Caribbean and north 

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:13.160
 of Brazil is in the Caribbean that we would be 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.240
 flying 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:21.060
 Martin has kept an air activity and 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.760
 in the brain always sends 2% north 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.060
 brazil because the north brazil the 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.320
 population of that does not have a line 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.100
 air that can lead directly 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.750
 to the Caribbean or to the north 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.190
 what is the americas then for 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.890
 they do that operation they have to 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.200
 take a flight from managua san paulo 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.510
 four hours waiting for an hour of 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.200
 transit and then take a flight from 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.750
 networks even if his team broke up in 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.500
 long in the person that the king in 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.380
 cattle would do an operation from 11 to 12 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.540
 flight hours to reach their destination 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.230
 flying with a mining that goes from 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.720
 man out towards porlamar talking alone and 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.730
 mean and then in the time that 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.830
 correspond to be able your destiny to 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.600
 put to doubt the person 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.790
 It takes three and a half hours coming 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.860
 over there which would give more or less a 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.270
 67-hour range that you can use 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.970
 to get to the beach 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.340
 Now we are going to give you access to our 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.950
 conflict and like our moon 20 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.100
 of the year 97 is a modern ship 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.290
 updated private radio to see that 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.240
 our country does not have any kind of 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.650
 analog instrumentation I feel that it's going 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.230
 to get a number of screens 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.720
 digital with these digital screens 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.760
 Pilots can monitor the status 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.610
 of the aircraft and the operation of the route 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.740
 a voice comes from this screen 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.030
 immediately the pilots pass all 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.130
 that information to the next screen 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.460
 then continue with the monitor of a 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.380
 sure of both the ship and the 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.090
 operation of the route without any kind of 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.860
 inconvenience which are going to 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.400
 always keep in the safety of 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:07.590
 and flight safety of the aircraft will 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.930
 I thank you for having known your 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.150
 comfort and now I invite you that one does not 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:16.430
 can happen something that speaks with the 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.430
 captain so our captain 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.019
 completely focus on young children 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.420
 to be able to sit in the captain chair 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:29.780
