that have accumulated during the period
the<00:01:09.390> land<00:01:09.570> was<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.900> production<00:01:10.580> then<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:12.090> rest

the land was in production then the rest
of<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.540> farm<00:01:12.810> which<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.740> production<00:01:14.460> we

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
of the farm which is in in production we

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:28.899 
of the farm which is in in production we
do<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.570> lot<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.840> inner<00:01:16.049> cropping

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.039 

one<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.180> things<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.630> we<00:01:30.720> think<00:01:30.869> is

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
one of the things that we think is

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.899 
one of the things that we think is
unique<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.409> we<00:01:31.680> do<00:01:31.860> here<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.549> we<00:01:32.670> use<00:01:32.880> a

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
unique that we do here is that we use a

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.510 
unique that we do here is that we use a
lot<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.210> hybrid<00:01:33.750> mulching<00:01:34.229> we'll<00:01:34.920> have<00:01:35.159> a

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
lot of hybrid mulching we'll have a

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.020 
lot of hybrid mulching we'll have a
living<00:01:35.880> cover<00:01:36.439> and<00:01:37.439> then<00:01:37.770> within<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.250> living

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
living cover and then within that living

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.050 
living cover and then within that living
cover<00:01:39.299> crop<00:01:39.780> area<00:01:40.200> will<00:01:40.439> put<00:01:40.710> rows<00:01:41.399> of<00:01:41.610> plastic

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
cover crop area will put rows of plastic

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.330 
cover crop area will put rows of plastic
within<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.509> living<00:01:42.689> mulch<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.560> use<00:01:44.189> the

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
within a living mulch and use the

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.889 
within a living mulch and use the
advantage<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.149> living<00:01:45.450> mulch<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.869> keep

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
advantage of the living mulch to keep

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.080 
advantage of the living mulch to keep
the<00:01:46.200> plastic<00:01:46.579> covered<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.789> to<00:01:47.909> give<00:01:48.060> it

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
the plastic covered and to give it

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.200 
the plastic covered and to give it
longevity<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.020> also<00:01:49.350> again<00:01:49.679> to<00:01:49.979> make<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.000> a

longevity and also again to make it a
more<00:01:51.390> workable<00:01:51.630> environments<00:01:52.590> there<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:53.100> no

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
plastic this is the first year of our

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.969 
plastic this is the first year of our
one<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.789> our<00:02:00.000> hybrid<00:02:00.420> mulch<00:02:00.689> fields<00:02:01.289> was

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
one of our hybrid mulch fields was

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.499 
one of our hybrid mulch fields was
planted<00:02:02.429> in<00:02:02.580> Rye<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:03.709> in<00:02:04.709> October<00:02:05.179> the<00:02:06.179> way<00:02:06.330> we

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
planted in Rye in in October the way we

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.990 
planted in Rye in in October the way we
normally<00:02:06.959> would<00:02:07.200> do<00:02:07.380> this<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:08.039> we<00:02:08.250> would<00:02:08.399> plant

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
normally would do this is we would plant

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.530 
normally would do this is we would plant
the<00:02:09.179> whole<00:02:09.330> field<00:02:09.630> in<00:02:09.899> Rye<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:11.340> then<00:02:11.760> come<00:02:12.390> in

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
the whole field in Rye and then come in

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.870 
the whole field in Rye and then come in
on<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.810> same<00:02:13.049> day<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.440> lay<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.769> plastic<00:02:13.890> this

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
on the same day and lay the plastic this

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.250 
on the same day and lay the plastic this
year<00:02:15.150> we<00:02:15.299> tried<00:02:15.569> something<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:16.049> little

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
year we tried something a little

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.850 
year we tried something a little
different

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
different

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.830 
different
tried<00:02:17.099> planting<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.880> ride<00:02:18.060> between<00:02:18.299> the<00:02:18.690> rows

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
tried planting the ride between the rows

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.380 
tried planting the ride between the rows
of<00:02:19.049> plastic<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.799> don't<00:02:20.459> really<00:02:20.730> like<00:02:20.910> that<00:02:21.150> as

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
of plastic and don't really like that as

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.270 
of plastic and don't really like that as
well<00:02:21.630> because<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:22.290> ended<00:02:22.590> up<00:02:22.680> with<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:22.980> little

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
well because you ended up with a little

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.750 
well because you ended up with a little
bit<00:02:23.400> of<00:02:23.580> band<00:02:24.060> along<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.720> plastic<00:02:25.579> plastic<00:02:26.579> in

high growth in the Isles is very

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.030 
high growth in the Isles is very
flexible<00:02:57.180> so<00:02:57.569> we<00:02:57.959> come<00:02:58.350> through<00:02:58.380> here<00:02:58.859> with<00:02:59.010> a

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
flexible so we come through here with a

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.509 
flexible so we come through here with a
mulch<00:02:59.340> lifter<00:02:59.880> it<00:03:00.569> comes<00:03:00.870> out<00:03:01.079> in<00:03:01.350> in<00:03:01.829> one

piece<00:03:02.819> in<00:03:03.540> this<00:03:03.660> case<00:03:04.410> we're<00:03:04.680> planting

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
piece in this case we're planting

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.699 
piece in this case we're planting
tomatoes<00:03:05.280> into<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:05.940> hybrid<00:03:06.329> mode<00:03:06.510> system<00:03:07.049> so

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
tomatoes into the hybrid mode system so

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.160 
tomatoes into the hybrid mode system so
the<00:03:07.859> way<00:03:08.010> we<00:03:08.190> will<00:03:08.310> do<00:03:08.430> this<00:03:08.609> is<00:03:08.850> we'll<00:03:09.170> burn

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
the way we will do this is we'll burn

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.140 
the way we will do this is we'll burn
holes<00:03:10.680> every<00:03:11.280> other<00:03:11.459> three-foot<00:03:12.180> spacing<00:03:14.150> we

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
then cover the plant with mulch to keep

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.440 
then cover the plant with mulch to keep
any<00:03:31.680> weeds<00:03:31.920> from<00:03:32.099> coming<00:03:32.189> up<00:03:32.640> in<00:03:32.849> the<00:03:33.000> hole

any weeds from coming up in the hole

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.170 
any weeds from coming up in the hole
we<00:03:33.960> then<00:03:34.170> set<00:03:34.410> a<00:03:34.440> cage<00:03:34.770> on<00:03:35.100> top<00:03:35.340> of<00:03:35.520> that<00:03:35.640> hole

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
we then set a cage on top of that hole

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.560 
we then set a cage on top of that hole
for<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.600> tomato<00:03:37.080> to<00:03:37.170> grow<00:03:37.470> up<00:03:37.770> into<00:03:38.360> with<00:03:39.360> the

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.330 
for the tomato to grow up into with the
Rye<00:03:39.750> it's<00:03:40.080> important<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.710> let<00:03:40.860> it<00:03:40.980> grow<00:03:41.160> as

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
Rye it's important to let it grow as

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.220 
Rye it's important to let it grow as

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
down there are two ways to mow the crop

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.820 
down there are two ways to mow the crop

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:12.050 
being mowed it comes back with increased
vigor<00:05:07.620> so<00:05:08.070> it's<00:05:08.880> a<00:05:08.970> good<00:05:09.150> crop<00:05:09.480> for<00:05:09.720> that<00:05:11.060> these
