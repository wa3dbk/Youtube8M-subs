00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:12.680 

not<00:00:04.589> much<00:00:04.830> aggregation<00:00:05.609> here<00:00:11.540> alright<00:00:12.540> so

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
not much aggregation here alright so

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.999 
not much aggregation here alright so
let's<00:00:12.990> see<00:00:13.139> what<00:00:13.320> different<00:00:13.650> amounts<00:00:13.950> of

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
let's see what different amounts of

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:23.460 
let's see what different amounts of
compost<00:00:14.490> start<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.880> do<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.120> this

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.830 

you<00:00:24.470> don't<00:00:24.680> have<00:00:24.859> those<00:00:25.039> medium<00:00:26.029> sized<00:00:26.419> pores

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
you don't have those medium sized pores

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.260 
you don't have those medium sized pores
you've<00:00:27.050> got<00:00:27.230> very<00:00:27.439> small<00:00:27.529> pores<00:00:28.099> and<00:00:28.460> when

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
you've got very small pores and when

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.450 
you've got very small pores and when
they<00:00:29.449> shrink<00:00:29.810> and<00:00:29.989> swell<00:00:30.109> and<00:00:30.590> you<00:00:30.980> get<00:00:31.130> frost

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
they shrink and swell and you get frost

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.299 
they shrink and swell and you get frost
action<00:00:32.029> or<00:00:32.300> or<00:00:33.050> drought<00:00:33.500> and<00:00:33.800> get<00:00:33.949> the<00:00:34.070> big

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
action or or drought and get the big

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.979 
action or or drought and get the big
crash<00:00:34.580> so<00:00:34.940> you<00:00:34.970> get<00:00:35.180> those<00:00:35.360> major<00:00:36.230> big<00:00:36.470> pores

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
crash so you get those major big pores

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.540 
crash so you get those major big pores
but<00:00:38.989> it<00:00:39.460> starting<00:00:40.460> to<00:00:40.519> crumble<00:00:40.699> a<00:00:40.970> little<00:00:41.000> more

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
but it starting to crumble a little more

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.950 
but it starting to crumble a little more
but<00:00:43.550> you<00:00:43.670> have<00:00:43.790> a<00:00:43.820> limited<00:00:44.269> window<00:00:44.390> for<00:00:44.839> when

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
but you have a limited window for when

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.829 
but you have a limited window for when
you<00:00:45.050> could<00:00:45.199> actually<00:00:45.379> do<00:00:45.710> this<00:00:45.920> we've<00:00:46.430> got<00:00:46.670> a

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 
you could actually do this we've got a

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:50.979 
you could actually do this we've got a
narrow<00:00:47.839> range<00:00:48.230> of<00:00:48.559> soil<00:00:49.010> moisture<00:00:49.570> that<00:00:50.570> you

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
narrow range of soil moisture that you

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:52.119 
narrow range of soil moisture that you
could<00:00:51.140> actually<00:00:51.320> get<00:00:51.589> in<00:00:51.739> there<00:00:51.920> with<00:00:52.100> a

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
could actually get in there with a

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.609 
could actually get in there with a
tiller<00:00:52.430> and<00:00:52.940> do<00:00:53.690> this<00:00:53.900> so<00:00:54.110> this<00:00:54.379> isn't

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:54.619 
tiller and do this so this isn't

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:55.960 
tiller and do this so this isn't
something<00:00:54.890> that<00:00:55.100> you<00:00:55.220> could<00:00:55.369> do<00:00:55.489> when<00:00:55.729> it<00:00:55.820> was

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
something that you could do when it was

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.780 
something that you could do when it was
already<00:00:56.150> baked<00:00:57.080> like<00:00:57.290> a<00:00:57.320> brick<00:00:57.650> or<00:00:57.979> completely

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
already baked like a brick or completely

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.840 
already baked like a brick or completely
saturated<00:00:59.449> in<00:00:59.659> the<00:00:59.750> spring<00:01:00.110> now<00:01:00.920> what<00:01:01.339> I<00:01:01.369> would

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
saturated in the spring now what I would

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.160 
saturated in the spring now what I would
I'd<00:01:02.030> be<00:01:02.479> applying<00:01:02.930> this<00:01:03.229> onto<00:01:04.360> the<00:01:05.360> surface

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
I'd be applying this onto the surface

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.740 
I'd be applying this onto the surface
and<00:01:06.320> then<00:01:06.500> tilling<00:01:06.830> it<00:01:06.979> in<00:01:07.630> potentially<00:01:08.630> that

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
and then tilling it in potentially that

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.240 
and then tilling it in potentially that
would<00:01:08.900> be<00:01:09.049> one<00:01:09.590> application<00:01:10.189> so<00:01:10.369> if<00:01:10.460> you<00:01:10.580> had<00:01:10.759> a

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
would be one application so if you had a

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.679 
would be one application so if you had a
disturbed<00:01:13.250> site<00:01:13.490> that<00:01:13.939> was<00:01:14.090> less<00:01:14.299> than<00:01:14.479> five

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
disturbed site that was less than five

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.080 
disturbed site that was less than five
percent<00:01:14.720> grade<00:01:15.320> and<00:01:15.650> you<00:01:16.220> wanted<00:01:16.610> to<00:01:16.640> restore

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
percent grade and you wanted to restore

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.740 
percent grade and you wanted to restore
a<00:01:17.920> working<00:01:18.920> topsoil<00:01:19.790> light<00:01:20.060> condition<00:01:20.509> and

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
a working topsoil light condition and

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.200 
a working topsoil light condition and
didn't<00:01:21.320> want<00:01:21.499> a<00:01:21.590> truck<00:01:21.829> in<00:01:22.039> both<00:01:22.670> America

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
didn't want a truck in both America

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.690 
didn't want a truck in both America
topsoil<00:01:23.719> this<00:01:24.380> could<00:01:24.619> be<00:01:24.740> a<00:01:24.770> strategy<00:01:25.100> to<00:01:25.549> try

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
topsoil this could be a strategy to try

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.440 
topsoil this could be a strategy to try
to<00:01:26.740> I'm<00:01:27.740> using<00:01:27.979> the<00:01:28.280> existing<00:01:28.820> soil<00:01:28.999> which<00:01:29.299> is

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
to I'm using the existing soil which is

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.760 
to I'm using the existing soil which is
basically<00:01:29.869> clay<00:01:30.200> just<00:01:30.950> amending<00:01:31.490> a<00:01:31.759> compost

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
basically clay just amending a compost

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.349 
basically clay just amending a compost
mixture<00:01:33.770> to<00:01:34.039> it<00:01:35.679> to<00:01:36.679> see<00:01:36.950> what<00:01:37.159> East<00:01:37.369> what<00:01:38.210> the

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:38.359 
mixture to it to see what East what the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:40.599 
mixture to it to see what East what the
material<00:01:39.259> does<00:01:39.590> when<00:01:39.920> it's<00:01:40.039> mixed<00:01:40.280> when<00:01:40.520> these

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:40.609 
material does when it's mixed when these

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:42.580 
material does when it's mixed when these
different<00:01:40.999> soil<00:01:41.569> types<00:01:41.630> so<00:01:42.079> this<00:01:42.289> isn't

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
different soil types so this isn't

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.700 
different soil types so this isn't
necessarily<00:01:43.069> a<00:01:44.259> best<00:01:45.259> management<00:01:45.590> practice

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.289 

BMPs<00:01:50.280> but<00:01:50.670> it's<00:01:50.869> just<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.049> show<00:01:52.700> how<00:01:53.700> these<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
BMPs but it's just to show how these the

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.390 
BMPs but it's just to show how these the
materials<00:01:54.840> blend<00:01:55.229> together<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.920> how<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.100> can

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
materials blend together and how it can

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.080 
materials blend together and how it can
change<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:57.140> characteristics<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.350> soil

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
change the characteristics of the soil

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.940 
change the characteristics of the soil
so<00:02:00.090> I've<00:02:00.240> got<00:02:00.479> more<00:02:00.810> compost<00:02:01.320> in<00:02:01.590> here<00:02:01.800> than

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
so I've got more compost in here than

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.410 
so I've got more compost in here than
clay<00:02:02.220> of<00:02:02.340> this<00:02:02.490> one<00:02:02.990> so<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.050> compact<00:02:04.470> it<00:02:04.650> now

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
clay of this one so you compact it now

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.660 
clay of this one so you compact it now
completely<00:02:06.420> stay<00:02:06.720> like<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.960> brick<00:02:07.399> and<00:02:08.399> again

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
completely stay like a brick and again

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.490 
completely stay like a brick and again
it<00:02:08.819> would<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.209> would<00:02:09.300> take<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.569> while<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.899> really

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
it would it would take a while to really

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.760 
it would it would take a while to really
get<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.890> worked<00:02:11.160> in<00:02:11.340> well<00:02:11.580> together<00:02:12.500> but<00:02:13.500> if<00:02:13.620> a

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
get it worked in well together but if a

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.840 
get it worked in well together but if a
rain<00:02:14.300> fell<00:02:15.300> on<00:02:15.330> this<00:02:15.780> blended<00:02:16.319> soil<00:02:16.850> versus

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
rain fell on this blended soil versus

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.570 
rain fell on this blended soil versus
just<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.239> clay<00:02:18.480> think<00:02:19.290> about<00:02:19.530> how<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:20.280> would

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
just the clay think about how that would

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.840 
just the clay think about how that would
run<00:02:20.760> off<00:02:20.940> or<00:02:21.300> soak<00:02:21.600> in<00:02:21.810> for<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.739> two<00:02:22.890> two

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
run off or soak in for the two two

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.150 
run off or soak in for the two two
differences<00:02:24.330> again<00:02:25.290> clay<00:02:25.590> clay<00:02:26.010> is<00:02:26.130> a

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
differences again clay clay is a

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.420 
differences again clay clay is a
challenge<00:02:26.640> there's<00:02:26.910> no<00:02:27.090> doubt<00:02:27.269> about<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.720> you

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
challenge there's no doubt about it you

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.430 
challenge there's no doubt about it you
may<00:02:29.430> still<00:02:29.730> need<00:02:29.940> to<00:02:30.120> put<00:02:30.360> a<00:02:30.950> mulch<00:02:31.950> or<00:02:33.440> other

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
may still need to put a mulch or other
