00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
on it that I think you might find

on it that I think you might find
enlightening<00:00:44.720> and<00:00:45.020> bold<00:00:45.440> and<00:00:46.300> first<00:00:47.300> of<00:00:47.450> all

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
enlightening and bold and first of all

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.930 
enlightening and bold and first of all
it's<00:00:48.380> got<00:00:48.559> a<00:00:48.620> vintage<00:00:49.010> e<00:00:49.160> neck<00:00:49.399> on<00:00:49.610> it<00:00:49.790> but

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
it's got a vintage e neck on it but

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.000 
it's got a vintage e neck on it but
what's<00:00:50.120> interesting<00:00:50.480> about<00:00:51.079> it<00:00:51.140> is<00:00:51.380> it's<00:00:51.829> got

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
what's interesting about it is it's got

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.799 
what's interesting about it is it's got
22<00:00:52.430> frets<00:00:52.640> because<00:00:52.910> sometimes<00:00:53.270> you're<00:00:53.480> in<00:00:53.600> B

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
22 frets because sometimes you're in B

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.950 
22 frets because sometimes you're in B
and<00:00:54.020> you<00:00:54.110> just<00:00:54.260> need<00:00:54.380> to<00:00:54.469> go<00:00:55.510> give<00:00:56.510> that<00:00:56.540> extra

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
and you just need to go give that extra

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.330 
and you just need to go give that extra
little<00:00:57.079> push<00:00:57.320> over<00:00:57.649> the<00:00:57.680> edge<00:00:57.920> to<00:00:58.129> cause<00:00:58.309> a

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
little push over the edge to cause a

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.950 
little push over the edge to cause a
little<00:00:58.460> trouble<00:00:58.610> because<00:00:59.000> most<00:00:59.180> strats<00:00:59.510> older

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
little trouble because most strats older

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.630 
little trouble because most strats older
vintage<00:01:00.260> strats<00:01:00.530> only<00:01:00.739> have<00:01:00.860> 21<00:01:01.129> as<00:01:01.430> you

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
vintage strats only have 21 as you

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.570 
vintage strats only have 21 as you
probably<00:01:01.910> already<00:01:02.329> know<00:01:02.540> but<00:01:03.309> just<00:01:04.309> in<00:01:04.430> case

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
probably already know but just in case

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.710 
probably already know but just in case
you<00:01:04.729> didn't<00:01:05.000> I<00:01:05.059> thought<00:01:05.210> I'd<00:01:05.360> point<00:01:05.539> that<00:01:05.630> out

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
you didn't I thought I'd point that out

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.080 
you didn't I thought I'd point that out
so<00:01:05.990> this<00:01:06.170> one<00:01:06.350> also<00:01:06.380> has<00:01:06.950> 22<00:01:07.550> so<00:01:07.759> you<00:01:07.850> can<00:01:07.940> reach

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
so this one also has 22 so you can reach

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.820 
so this one also has 22 so you can reach
up<00:01:08.270> there<00:01:08.420> and<00:01:08.479> rock<00:01:08.720> like<00:01:08.930> a<00:01:08.960> pagan<00:01:09.289> warlord

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
up there and rock like a pagan warlord

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.380 
up there and rock like a pagan warlord
if<00:01:10.009> that's<00:01:10.190> the<00:01:10.280> way<00:01:10.369> you<00:01:10.430> like<00:01:10.580> to<00:01:10.610> roll<00:01:10.850> now

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
if that's the way you like to roll now

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
if that's the way you like to roll now
the<00:01:11.450> other<00:01:11.690> thing<00:01:11.869> that's<00:01:11.899> interesting<00:01:12.080> about

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
the other thing that's interesting about

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.350 
the other thing that's interesting about
this<00:01:12.800> neck<00:01:13.070> is<00:01:13.100> is<00:01:13.550> that<00:01:13.670> it<00:01:13.789> has<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:14.030> vintage

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
this neck is is that it has the vintage

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.630 
this neck is is that it has the vintage
frets<00:01:14.750> which<00:01:15.020> are<00:01:15.140> the<00:01:15.259> smaller<00:01:15.619> frets<00:01:16.190> see

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
frets which are the smaller frets see

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.680 
frets which are the smaller frets see
but<00:01:17.450> it's<00:01:17.600> got<00:01:17.750> a<00:01:17.780> flatter<00:01:18.170> radius<00:01:18.679> it's<00:01:18.920> a<00:01:19.009> 9.5

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
but it's got a flatter radius it's a 9.5

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.449 
but it's got a flatter radius it's a 9.5
so<00:01:20.690> it's<00:01:21.289> a<00:01:21.470> little<00:01:21.649> bit<00:01:21.740> more<00:01:21.860> playable<00:01:22.340> it's

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:22.459 
so it's a little bit more playable it's

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:27.520 
so it's a little bit more playable it's
good<00:01:22.610> for<00:01:22.789> getting<00:01:25.360> that<00:01:26.360> crazy<00:01:26.660> vibrato<00:01:27.140> or

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
good for getting that crazy vibrato or

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:40.240 
good for getting that crazy vibrato or
clamping<00:01:27.920> legs<00:01:37.720> all<00:01:38.720> right<00:01:38.929> now<00:01:39.890> some<00:01:40.160> other

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
clamping legs all right now some other

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.529 
clamping legs all right now some other
things<00:01:40.340> about<00:01:40.640> this<00:01:40.849> guitar<00:01:41.179> that<00:01:41.209> are<00:01:41.390> very

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
things about this guitar that are very

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.660 
things about this guitar that are very
interesting<00:01:42.190> first<00:01:43.190> of<00:01:43.280> all<00:01:43.340> it<00:01:43.429> has<00:01:43.490> these

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
interesting first of all it has these

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.999 
interesting first of all it has these
noiseless<00:01:44.119> pickups<00:01:44.479> on<00:01:44.630> it<00:01:44.780> which<00:01:45.740> as<00:01:45.890> you

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
noiseless pickups on it which as you

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.809 
noiseless pickups on it which as you
would<00:01:46.130> imagine<00:01:46.220> are<00:01:46.729> noiseless<00:01:47.619> crazy<00:01:48.619> and<00:01:49.039> so

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819 
would imagine are noiseless crazy and so

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:51.580 
would imagine are noiseless crazy and so
that<00:01:50.000> allows<00:01:50.240> us<00:01:50.420> to<00:01:50.539> go<00:01:50.660> into<00:01:50.840> any<00:01:51.080> kind<00:01:51.470> of

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
that allows us to go into any kind of

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.400 
that allows us to go into any kind of
neon<00:01:52.149> infested<00:01:53.149> place<00:01:53.630> where<00:01:54.020> we<00:01:54.110> might<00:01:54.349> be

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
neon infested place where we might be

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.109 
neon infested place where we might be
gigging<00:01:54.920> which<00:01:55.099> of<00:01:55.220> course<00:01:55.459> sometimes<00:01:55.940> the

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
gigging which of course sometimes the

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.520 
gigging which of course sometimes the
places<00:01:56.420> we<00:01:56.539> have<00:01:56.660> to<00:01:56.810> play<00:01:56.989> in<00:01:57.140> order<00:01:57.259> to<00:01:57.380> make

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
places we have to play in order to make

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.690 
places we have to play in order to make
a<00:01:57.560> little<00:01:57.770> money<00:01:57.920> you're<00:01:58.160> set<00:01:58.310> up<00:01:58.340> next<00:01:58.580> to<00:01:58.640> a

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
a little money you're set up next to a

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.430 
a little money you're set up next to a
popcorn<00:01:58.940> machine<00:01:59.270> and<00:01:59.780> there's<00:02:00.170> all<00:02:00.259> kind<00:02:00.410> of

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
popcorn machine and there's all kind of

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.729 
popcorn machine and there's all kind of
hang<00:02:01.750> and<00:02:02.750> I<00:02:02.810> just<00:02:02.959> kind<00:02:03.080> of<00:02:03.110> buzzing<00:02:03.319> going<00:02:03.649> on

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:03.739 
hang and I just kind of buzzing going on

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:05.529 
hang and I just kind of buzzing going on
so<00:02:04.280> because<00:02:04.580> these<00:02:04.729> are<00:02:04.849> noiseless<00:02:05.209> pickups

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
so because these are noiseless pickups

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:06.880 
so because these are noiseless pickups
they're<00:02:05.690> completely<00:02:06.020> quiet<00:02:06.319> so<00:02:06.560> you<00:02:06.590> can<00:02:06.679> go

do something clean he's got that tone

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.490 
do something clean he's got that tone
it's<00:02:52.310> because<00:02:52.610> this<00:02:52.790> preamp<00:02:53.180> is<00:02:53.330> engaged<00:02:53.750> okay

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
it's because this preamp is engaged okay

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.820 
it's because this preamp is engaged okay
now<00:02:55.310> as<00:02:56.030> I<00:02:56.180> said<00:02:56.240> it's<00:02:56.480> always<00:02:56.690> on<00:02:56.990> whether<00:02:57.650> you

now as I said it's always on whether you

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.830 
now as I said it's always on whether you
actually<00:02:58.160> bring<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.970> tone<00:02:59.180> control<00:02:59.540> up<00:02:59.720> at

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
actually bring the tone control up at

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.970 
actually bring the tone control up at
all<00:02:59.930> because<00:03:00.080> here's<00:03:00.290> what's<00:03:00.500> here's<00:03:00.860> the

all because here's what's here's the

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.400 
all because here's what's here's the
deal<00:03:01.130> on<00:03:01.160> this<00:03:01.370> guitar<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:02.750> volume<00:03:03.080> works<00:03:03.290> as

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
deal on this guitar the volume works as

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.220 
deal on this guitar the volume works as
a<00:03:03.440> regular<00:03:03.590> volume<00:03:04.570> the<00:03:05.570> tone<00:03:05.780> control<00:03:06.020> is<00:03:06.110> is

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
a regular volume the tone control is is

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.260 
a regular volume the tone control is is
tbx<00:03:06.740> tone<00:03:06.980> control<00:03:07.340> so<00:03:07.520> about<00:03:07.730> at<00:03:07.940> five

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
tbx tone control so about at five

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.120 
tbx tone control so about at five
there's<00:03:08.660> a<00:03:08.690> little<00:03:08.900> detent<00:03:09.350> so<00:03:09.530> it<00:03:09.650> there's<00:03:10.070> a

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
there's a little detent so it there's a

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.360 
there's a little detent so it there's a
little<00:03:10.550> click<00:03:10.880> and<00:03:11.320> it<00:03:12.320> actually<00:03:12.530> adds<00:03:12.920> more

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
little click and it actually adds more

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.520 
little click and it actually adds more
highs<00:03:13.640> if<00:03:14.120> you<00:03:14.660> need<00:03:14.870> it<00:03:14.990> because<00:03:15.140> down<00:03:15.500> here

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
highs if you need it because down here

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.400 
highs if you need it because down here
this<00:03:16.340> tone<00:03:16.580> control<00:03:16.910> right<00:03:17.090> here<00:03:17.380> engages<00:03:18.380> a

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
this tone control right here engages a

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.700 
this tone control right here engages a
25<00:03:19.010> DB<00:03:19.460> boost<00:03:19.820> so<00:03:20.240> it's<00:03:20.390> like<00:03:20.540> having<00:03:20.840> a<00:03:20.960> boost

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 
25 DB boost so it's like having a boost

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.200 
25 DB boost so it's like having a boost
pedal<00:03:21.920> in<00:03:22.220> your<00:03:22.400> guitar<00:03:22.700> and<00:03:22.880> you'll<00:03:23.000> see

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
pedal in your guitar and you'll see

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:24.790 
pedal in your guitar and you'll see
Clapton<00:03:23.660> he<00:03:23.750> goes<00:03:23.930> straight<00:03:24.170> into<00:03:24.380> an<00:03:24.590> old

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
Clapton he goes straight into an old

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.910 
Clapton he goes straight into an old
well<00:03:25.790> now<00:03:25.910> he<00:03:26.000> uses<00:03:26.150> a<00:03:26.330> new<00:03:26.450> one<00:03:26.630> a<00:03:26.780> tweed<00:03:27.590> twin

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
well now he uses a new one a tweed twin

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.949 
well now he uses a new one a tweed twin
he<00:03:28.610> just<00:03:28.790> goes<00:03:28.940> straight<00:03:29.060> into<00:03:29.450> the<00:03:29.540> amp<00:03:29.750> and

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
he just goes straight into the amp and

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.180 
he just goes straight into the amp and
what<00:03:30.050> happens<00:03:30.350> is<00:03:30.470> when<00:03:30.709> you<00:03:30.860> kicked<00:03:31.100> this

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
what happens is when you kicked this

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.580 
what happens is when you kicked this
thing<00:03:31.400> at<00:03:31.520> 25<00:03:31.970> DB<00:03:32.360> is<00:03:32.480> a<00:03:32.510> pretty<00:03:32.780> sizable<00:03:33.350> boost

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
thing at 25 DB is a pretty sizable boost

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.430 
thing at 25 DB is a pretty sizable boost
so<00:03:33.920> you'll<00:03:34.100> hear<00:03:34.310> it<00:03:34.430> from<00:03:35.000> going

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.040 

most<00:03:40.440> sudden<00:03:40.740> BAM<00:03:41.430> you<00:03:42.330> got<00:03:42.510> a<00:03:42.540> whole<00:03:42.780> lot<00:03:42.930> of

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
most sudden BAM you got a whole lot of

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.900 
most sudden BAM you got a whole lot of
gristle<00:03:43.560> going<00:03:44.040> on<00:03:44.190> there<00:03:44.400> one<00:03:44.610> fell<00:03:44.880> swoop

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
gristle going on there one fell swoop

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.150 
gristle going on there one fell swoop
but<00:03:45.420> what<00:03:45.780> happens<00:03:46.050> is<00:03:46.170> though<00:03:46.320> it's<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.740> it's<00:03:47.070> a

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
but what happens is though it's a it's a

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.470 
but what happens is though it's a it's a
mid<00:03:47.370> boost<00:03:47.550> so<00:03:47.850> it<00:03:47.940> gets<00:03:48.060> kind<00:03:48.240> of<00:03:48.270> mid-range

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
mid boost so it gets kind of mid-range

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.330 
mid boost so it gets kind of mid-range
so<00:03:48.870> that's<00:03:49.050> where<00:03:49.230> this<00:03:49.320> tbx<00:03:49.770> tone<00:03:50.010> control

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
so that's where this tbx tone control

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.040 
so that's where this tbx tone control
comes<00:03:50.610> in<00:03:50.730> having<00:03:51.030> handy<00:03:51.510> you<00:03:51.690> turn<00:03:51.900> that

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
comes in having handy you turn that

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.960 
comes in having handy you turn that
thing<00:03:52.110> up<00:03:52.320> to<00:03:52.470> ten<00:03:55.340> it<00:03:56.340> gives<00:03:56.550> you<00:03:56.670> a<00:03:56.700> little

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
thing up to ten it gives you a little

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:06.410 
thing up to ten it gives you a little
bit<00:03:57.090> more<00:03:57.240> high<00:03:57.390> end<00:04:03.860> it<00:04:04.860> back<00:04:05.010> down<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:06.270> get

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
bit more high end it back down to get

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
bar in set it up the way you want it and

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.630 
bar in set it up the way you want it and
let<00:04:52.530> the<00:04:52.620> good<00:04:52.710> times<00:04:52.770> roll<00:04:53.070> but<00:04:53.370> it<00:04:53.460> comes

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
let the good times roll but it comes

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.190 
let the good times roll but it comes
with<00:04:53.820> the<00:04:53.940> Block<00:04:54.150> in<00:04:54.390> which<00:04:54.690> is<00:04:54.840> fine<00:04:55.020> and

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
with the Block in which is fine and

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.450 
with the Block in which is fine and
dandy<00:04:55.290> if<00:04:55.560> that's<00:04:55.710> the<00:04:55.830> way<00:04:55.919> you<00:04:55.980> like<00:04:56.160> to<00:04:56.250> roll

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
dandy if that's the way you like to roll

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.430 
dandy if that's the way you like to roll
so<00:04:57.030> it's<00:04:57.210> basically<00:04:57.419> like<00:04:57.510> a<00:04:57.600> souped-up<00:04:58.050> 50
