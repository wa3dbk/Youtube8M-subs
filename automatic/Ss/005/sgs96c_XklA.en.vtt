00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.030 
the argument for intelligent design is
based<00:02:22.859> on<00:02:23.359> observation<00:02:24.359> of<00:02:24.629> the<00:02:24.780> facts<00:02:25.260> now

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
based on observation of the facts now

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.550 
based on observation of the facts now
that's<00:02:26.220> my<00:02:26.430> definition<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:27.269> good<00:02:27.480> science

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
that's my definition of good science

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.099 
that's my definition of good science
it's<00:02:29.010> observation<00:02:29.970> of<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.150> facts<00:02:30.420> and<00:02:31.019> when

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
it's observation of the facts and when

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.140 
it's observation of the facts and when
you<00:02:31.200> observe<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.799> facts<00:02:32.040> as<00:02:32.340> Michael<00:02:32.730> Behe<00:02:33.060> is

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
you observe the facts as Michael Behe is

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.509 
you observe the facts as Michael Behe is
done<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.569> what<00:02:33.780> do<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:33.959> observe<00:02:34.160> you<00:02:35.160> observe

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
done and what do you observe you observe

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.470 
done and what do you observe you observe
this<00:02:35.819> incredible<00:02:36.690> pattern<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:37.380> interrelated

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
this incredible pattern of interrelated

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.660 
this incredible pattern of interrelated
complexity<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:40.709> way<00:02:40.859> we<00:02:41.099> conclude

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
complexity and the way we conclude

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.210 
complexity and the way we conclude
intelligent<00:02:42.359> design<00:02:42.660> for<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.739> bacterial

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
intelligent design for the bacterial

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.009 
intelligent design for the bacterial
flagellum<00:02:44.730> is<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.120> same<00:02:45.329> way<00:02:45.510> we<00:02:45.660> conclude

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
flagellum is the same way we conclude

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.479 
flagellum is the same way we conclude
intelligent<00:02:46.530> design<00:02:46.769> for<00:02:47.010> an<00:02:47.069> outboard<00:02:47.370> motor

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
intelligent design for an outboard motor

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.909 
intelligent design for an outboard motor
when<00:02:48.030> we<00:02:48.150> see<00:02:48.329> an<00:02:48.419> outboard<00:02:48.720> motor<00:02:48.810> we<00:02:49.650> see<00:02:49.799> the

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:49.919 
when we see an outboard motor we see the

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.069 
when we see an outboard motor we see the
way<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.160> parts<00:02:50.430> interact<00:02:50.849> and<00:02:51.090> so<00:02:51.480> on<00:02:51.630> we<00:02:51.900> know

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
way the parts interact and so on we know

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.069 
way the parts interact and so on we know
somebody<00:02:52.650> made<00:02:52.950> that<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:54.209> reasoning<00:02:54.660> is<00:02:54.870> the

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
somebody made that the reasoning is the

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.789 
somebody made that the reasoning is the
same<00:02:55.410> for<00:02:55.889> biological<00:02:56.819> machines<00:02:57.599> so<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.530> idea

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
same for biological machines so the idea

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.250 
same for biological machines so the idea
of<00:02:58.859> an<00:02:58.980> intelligent<00:02:59.430> design<00:02:59.760> is<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.720> completely

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
of an intelligent design is a completely

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.650 
of an intelligent design is a completely
scientific<00:03:01.590> one<00:03:02.250> certainly<00:03:02.819> it<00:03:03.000> it<00:03:03.450> might

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
scientific one certainly it it might

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.539 
scientific one certainly it it might
have<00:03:03.810> religious<00:03:04.169> implications<00:03:04.799> but<00:03:05.160> it<00:03:05.340> does

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
have religious implications but it does

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.770 
have religious implications but it does
not<00:03:05.669> depend<00:03:06.150> on<00:03:06.480> religious<00:03:06.930> premises<00:03:08.750> when<00:03:09.750> I

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
not depend on religious premises when I

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.349 
not depend on religious premises when I
look<00:03:09.989> at<00:03:10.109> the<00:03:10.230> evidence<00:03:10.349> objectively<00:03:11.359> without

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
look at the evidence objectively without

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.740 
look at the evidence objectively without
ruling<00:03:12.959> out<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.530> possibility<00:03:13.620> of<00:03:14.280> design

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
ruling out the possibility of design

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.500 
ruling out the possibility of design
design<00:03:15.750> just<00:03:16.049> leaps<00:03:16.349> up<00:03:17.190> as<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:18.060> most<00:03:18.269> likely

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
design just leaps up as the most likely

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.970 
design just leaps up as the most likely
explanation

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
explanation

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.830 
explanation
and<00:03:20.099> that's<00:03:20.670> why<00:03:20.880> I<00:03:20.910> believe<00:03:21.209> that<00:03:21.390> it's<00:03:21.660> true

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
and that's why I believe that it's true

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.160 
and that's why I believe that it's true
I<00:03:22.200> think<00:03:22.800> design<00:03:23.310> is<00:03:23.370> back<00:03:23.730> on<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.000> table<00:03:24.360> you

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
I think design is back on the table you

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.880 
I think design is back on the table you
know<00:03:25.260> we<00:03:25.560> can't<00:03:25.860> explain<00:03:26.220> these<00:03:26.459> systems<00:03:26.880> by

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
know we can't explain these systems by

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.100 
know we can't explain these systems by
natural<00:03:28.890> law<00:03:29.099> and<00:03:29.880> if<00:03:30.300> we're<00:03:30.510> searching<00:03:30.690> for

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
natural law and if we're searching for

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.280 
natural law and if we're searching for
truth<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:31.760> they<00:03:32.760> are<00:03:32.940> in<00:03:33.120> fact<00:03:33.390> designed<00:03:34.020> if

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
truth and they are in fact designed if

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.020 
truth and they are in fact designed if
we<00:03:34.440> have<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.739> be<00:03:34.860> design<00:03:35.220> engineers<00:03:35.760> to

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
we have to be design engineers to

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.420 
we have to be design engineers to
understand<00:03:36.510> them<00:03:36.830> then<00:03:37.830> I<00:03:37.920> say<00:03:38.130> what's<00:03:38.340> the

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
understand them then I say what's the

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.120 
understand them then I say what's the
problem<00:03:38.900> you<00:03:39.900> know<00:03:40.020> you<00:03:40.380> go<00:03:40.620> or<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:40.920> data

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
problem you know you go or the data

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.630 
problem you know you go or the data
Legion<00:03:41.550> and<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:42.450> implications<00:03:43.400> yeah<00:03:44.400> they

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
Legion and the implications yeah they

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.210 
Legion and the implications yeah they
have<00:03:44.760> profound<00:03:45.209> metaphysical<00:03:45.840> implications

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
have profound metaphysical implications

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:52.040 
have profound metaphysical implications
but<00:03:47.480> so<00:03:48.480> be<00:03:48.660> it<00:03:49.849> so<00:03:50.849> it's<00:03:51.030> a<00:03:51.120> powerful<00:03:51.510> idea

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
but so be it so it's a powerful idea

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.720 
but so be it so it's a powerful idea
that<00:03:52.140> the<00:03:52.410> universe<00:03:52.739> is<00:03:52.890> rational<00:03:53.580> and

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
that the universe is rational and

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.530 
that the universe is rational and

rationality out there but if it in fact
