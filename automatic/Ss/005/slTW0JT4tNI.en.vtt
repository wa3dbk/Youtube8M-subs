get a map of the london underground the

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.290 
get a map of the london underground the
tube<00:00:23.410> network<00:00:23.699> over<00:00:24.699> on<00:00:24.789> the<00:00:24.850> right<00:00:25.000> hand<00:00:25.150> side

tube network over on the right hand side

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.420 
tube network over on the right hand side
there's<00:00:25.750> a<00:00:25.779> couple<00:00:25.900> of<00:00:26.109> tabs<00:00:26.800> so<00:00:27.010> we<00:00:27.100> can<00:00:27.220> tap

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
there's a couple of tabs so we can tap

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.570 
there's a couple of tabs so we can tap
to<00:00:27.580> zoom<00:00:27.609> in<00:00:27.939> and<00:00:28.090> zoom<00:00:28.119> out<00:00:29.310> bottom<00:00:30.310> left<00:00:30.490> hand

to zoom in and zoom out bottom left hand

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.729 
to zoom in and zoom out bottom left hand
side<00:00:30.850> there's<00:00:31.060> another<00:00:31.210> tab<00:00:31.539> you<00:00:32.500> can<00:00:32.559> see

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:32.739 
side there's another tab you can see

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.710 
side there's another tab you can see
this<00:00:32.890> kind<00:00:33.070> of<00:00:33.190> like<00:00:33.280> a<00:00:33.400> pound<00:00:34.030> sign<00:00:34.269> icon

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:34.720 
this kind of like a pound sign icon

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.110 
this kind of like a pound sign icon
there<00:00:34.930> if<00:00:34.989> we<00:00:35.110> tap<00:00:35.350> that<00:00:35.559> it<00:00:36.280> reloads<00:00:36.730> the<00:00:36.820> page

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
there if we tap that it reloads the page

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.910 
there if we tap that it reloads the page
it<00:00:37.420> gives<00:00:37.449> us<00:00:37.750> a<00:00:37.900> slightly<00:00:38.170> different<00:00:38.379> view<00:00:38.710> of

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
it gives us a slightly different view of

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.850 
it gives us a slightly different view of
the<00:00:39.370> map<00:00:40.089> but<00:00:40.839> I<00:00:40.930> can<00:00:41.140> actually<00:00:41.260> figure<00:00:41.589> out

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
the map but I can actually figure out

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.640 
the map but I can actually figure out
these<00:00:42.190> four<00:00:43.920> i'm<00:00:44.920> not<00:00:45.159> sure<00:00:45.519> what<00:00:45.729> the<00:00:46.650> the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
these four i'm not sure what the the

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.320 
these four i'm not sure what the the
difference<00:00:47.949> in<00:00:48.070> icons<00:00:48.460> actually<00:00:48.820> means<00:00:49.030> to<00:00:49.239> be

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:49.330 
difference in icons actually means to be

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.820 
difference in icons actually means to be
honest<00:00:49.510> with<00:00:49.629> you<00:00:49.720> so<00:00:49.960> you<00:00:50.019> like<00:00:50.260> to<00:00:50.350> excuse<00:00:50.680> me

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
honest with you so you like to excuse me

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.979 
honest with you so you like to excuse me
about<00:00:51.010> that<00:00:51.220> the<00:00:51.879> apps<00:00:52.030> free<00:00:52.360> as<00:00:52.629> you<00:00:52.720> can<00:00:52.780> see

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
about that the apps free as you can see

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:54.390 
about that the apps free as you can see
we<00:00:53.140> have<00:00:53.170> got<00:00:53.290> an<00:00:53.440> advert<00:00:53.739> there<00:00:53.949> at<00:00:54.040> the<00:00:54.159> top

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
we have got an advert there at the top

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.840 
we have got an advert there at the top
which<00:00:54.640> she's<00:00:55.199> only<00:00:56.199> only<00:00:56.769> slightly<00:00:57.400> annoying

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
which she's only only slightly annoying

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.850 
which she's only only slightly annoying
so<00:00:58.150> it's<00:00:58.269> not<00:00:58.390> too<00:00:58.540> bad<00:00:58.750> but<00:00:59.019> then<00:00:59.500> if<00:00:59.589> we<00:00:59.680> jump

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
so it's not too bad but then if we jump

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.140 
so it's not too bad but then if we jump
into<00:00:59.979> the<00:01:00.190> menu<00:01:00.339> we<00:01:00.580> get<00:01:00.699> some<00:01:00.850> other<00:01:00.940> options

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
into the menu we get some other options

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.340 
into the menu we get some other options
when<00:01:01.600> the<00:01:02.019> blind<00:01:02.320> status<00:01:02.860> so<00:01:03.100> we<00:01:03.220> can<00:01:03.369> view<00:01:04.350> any

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
when the blind status so we can view any

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.789 
when the blind status so we can view any
of<00:01:05.530> the<00:01:05.680> the<00:01:06.340> tube<00:01:06.700> lines<00:01:06.940> and<00:01:07.390> it<00:01:07.990> will<00:01:08.140> share

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
of the the tube lines and it will share

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:10.980 
of the the tube lines and it will share
if<00:01:08.860> there's<00:01:09.040> any<00:01:09.189> problems<00:01:09.700> or<00:01:09.990> whether

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
if there's any problems or whether

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.560 
if there's any problems or whether
there's<00:01:11.259> any<00:01:11.500> planned<00:01:12.250> engineering<00:01:12.939> works<00:01:13.149> we

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
there's any planned engineering works we

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.440 
there's any planned engineering works we
look<00:01:14.170> at<00:01:14.289> the<00:01:14.409> later<00:01:14.619> or<00:01:15.039> the<00:01:15.219> weekend<00:01:15.579> tab<00:01:15.850> we

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
look at the later or the weekend tab we

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.230 
look at the later or the weekend tab we
see<00:01:16.479> there's<00:01:16.869> a<00:01:16.930> good<00:01:17.140> service<00:01:17.530> in<00:01:17.590> operation

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
see there's a good service in operation

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.149 
see there's a good service in operation
and<00:01:19.240> then<00:01:19.750> if<00:01:19.840> we<00:01:19.960> go<00:01:19.990> to<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.320> next<00:01:20.469> one<00:01:20.590> route

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
and then if we go to the next one route

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.389 
and then if we go to the next one route
planner<00:01:21.429> so<00:01:22.179> we<00:01:22.479> can<00:01:23.039> we're<00:01:24.039> going<00:01:24.130> to<00:01:24.189> make<00:01:24.340> a

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
planner so we can we're going to make a

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.230 
planner so we can we're going to make a
journey<00:01:24.700> we<00:01:25.390> can<00:01:25.979> start<00:01:26.979> typing<00:01:27.250> and<00:01:27.789> it<00:01:28.090> will

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
journey we can start typing and it will

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.179 
journey we can start typing and it will
predict<00:01:28.689> the<00:01:28.899> the<00:01:29.170> station's<00:01:29.619> depending<00:01:30.070> on

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
predict the the station's depending on

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.580 
predict the the station's depending on
what<00:01:31.090> letters<00:01:31.450> you<00:01:31.539> actually<00:01:31.780> type<00:01:31.990> in<00:01:32.229> so

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
what letters you actually type in so

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.660 
what letters you actually type in so
select<00:01:33.369> that<00:01:33.549> one<00:01:33.579> and<00:01:34.049> we'll<00:01:35.049> finish<00:01:35.289> at<00:01:35.670> make

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
select that one and we'll finish at make

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:45.280 
select that one and we'll finish at make
one<00:01:36.850> up<00:01:36.969> but<00:01:37.689> one<00:01:39.090> calculate<00:01:40.090> route

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.260 

and<00:01:46.290> then<00:01:46.980> it<00:01:47.400> will<00:01:47.580> then<00:01:47.730> show<00:01:47.940> the<00:01:48.120> actual

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
and then it will then show the actual

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.600 
and then it will then show the actual
actual<00:01:49.170> route<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.770> we<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.070> click<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.400> show

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
actual route and we can click the show

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.630 
actual route and we can click the show
map<00:01:50.910> and<00:01:51.620> funnily<00:01:52.620> enough<00:01:52.620> it<00:01:53.010> will<00:01:53.190> show<00:01:53.460> us

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
map and funnily enough it will show us

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.370 
map and funnily enough it will show us
on<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.000> map<00:01:55.010> there<00:01:56.010> we<00:01:56.130> go<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:57.270> let's<00:01:57.510> zoom<00:01:58.230> out

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
on the map there we go so let's zoom out

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.980 
on the map there we go so let's zoom out
a<00:01:58.440> little<00:01:58.500> bit<00:01:58.830> and<00:01:59.390> you<00:02:00.390> can<00:02:00.450> see<00:02:00.660> the<00:02:00.780> route

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
a little bit and you can see the route

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.530 
a little bit and you can see the route
is<00:02:01.020> shown<00:02:01.470> with<00:02:01.650> the<00:02:01.800> the<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:05.360> dots<00:02:06.360> on

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
is shown with the the the the dots on

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.090 
is shown with the the the the dots on
the<00:02:06.690> screen<00:02:06.810> we've<00:02:07.200> got<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.410> blue<00:02:07.560> dots<00:02:07.800> there

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
the screen we've got the blue dots there

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.470
