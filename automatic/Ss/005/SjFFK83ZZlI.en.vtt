00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
that shot where Naruto is talking like

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.439 
that shot where Naruto is talking like
if<00:00:28.949> he's<00:00:29.099> dying<00:00:29.369> or<00:00:29.670> something<00:00:30.060> but<00:00:30.179> we<00:00:30.269> don't

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
if he's dying or something but we don't

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.359 
if he's dying or something but we don't
know<00:00:30.570> what<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.840> fuck<00:00:31.019> he's<00:00:31.199> saying<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.679> the

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
know what the fuck he's saying and the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.209 
know what the fuck he's saying and the
subtitle<00:00:33.090> version<00:00:33.600> he's<00:00:34.140> basically<00:00:34.500> saying<00:00:34.950> I

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
subtitle version he's basically saying I

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.869 
subtitle version he's basically saying I
entrust<00:00:36.090> him<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.710> Sasuke<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.520> what

entrust him to you to Sasuke and what

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.910 
entrust him to you to Sasuke and what
I'm<00:00:39.000> guessing<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.450> supported<00:00:39.930> though<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.290> a

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
I'm guessing is supported though and a

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.830 
I'm guessing is supported though and a
couple<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.430> different<00:00:41.700> instances<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.360> scenes

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
couple of different instances of scenes

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.880 
couple of different instances of scenes
that<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.170> happened<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:43.680> trailer

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
that that happened in this trailer

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.860 
that that happened in this trailer
really<00:00:44.789> lead<00:00:44.969> me<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.300> believe<00:00:45.420> there's<00:00:45.719> a

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
really lead me to believe there's a

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.470 
really lead me to believe there's a
possibility<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:47.039> Naruto<00:00:47.910> could<00:00:48.149> die<00:00:48.300> in

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
possibility that Naruto could die in

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.600 
possibility that Naruto could die in
this<00:00:48.629> movie<00:00:48.899> now<00:00:49.050> we<00:00:49.739> know<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:50.070> shown<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.520> we

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
this movie now we know it's shown and we

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.580 
this movie now we know it's shown and we
know<00:00:50.730> anything<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.149> they<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.899> likelihood

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
know anything that they the likelihood

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.650 
know anything that they the likelihood
isn't<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.309> high<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.850> something<00:00:54.239> like<00:00:54.390> that

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
isn't that high of something like that

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.510 
isn't that high of something like that
but<00:00:55.170> if<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.559> take<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.829> closer<00:00:56.129> look<00:00:56.250> at<00:00:56.460> the

I think that there's huge hints that

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
I think that there's huge hints that
there's<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.170> possibility

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
side of the bottle though and meets key

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.300 
side of the bottle though and meets key
but<00:03:21.960> we<00:03:22.050> get<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.290> see<00:03:22.410> his<00:03:22.560> power<00:03:22.800> and<00:03:23.070> it<00:03:23.130> seems

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
but we get to see his power and it seems

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.800 
but we get to see his power and it seems
as<00:03:23.400> though<00:03:23.550> he's<00:03:23.730> stretching<00:03:24.060> now<00:03:24.570> it's<00:03:24.720> not

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
as though he's stretching now it's not

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.410 
as though he's stretching now it's not
exactly<00:03:24.930> like<00:03:25.650> luffy's<00:03:26.160> or<00:03:26.310> whatever<00:03:26.580> but<00:03:27.180> I

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
exactly like luffy's or whatever but I

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.480 
exactly like luffy's or whatever but I
think<00:03:27.480> that's<00:03:27.870> possibly<00:03:28.290> Kishimoto<00:03:28.860> Hammad's

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
think that's possibly Kishimoto Hammad's

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.370 
think that's possibly Kishimoto Hammad's
to<00:03:29.880> Luffy<00:03:30.330> like<00:03:30.540> you<00:03:30.840> know<00:03:30.930> I<00:03:30.960> think<00:03:31.080> that

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
to Luffy like you know I think that

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.750 
to Luffy like you know I think that
you've<00:03:31.500> seen<00:03:31.680> at<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.040> end<00:03:32.160> of<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.340> manga<00:03:32.640> he

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
you've seen at the end of the manga he

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.850 
you've seen at the end of the manga he
had<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:33.030> Jolly<00:03:33.570> Roger<00:03:33.870> of<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:34.230> straw<00:03:34.440> hats<00:03:34.680> on

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
had the Jolly Roger of the straw hats on

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.010 
had the Jolly Roger of the straw hats on
top<00:03:35.130> of<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.340> Hokage<00:03:35.670> Mountain<00:03:36.210> so<00:03:36.450> maybe

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
top of the Hokage Mountain so maybe

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.840 
top of the Hokage Mountain so maybe
meets<00:03:37.350> these<00:03:37.560> powers<00:03:38.010> is<00:03:38.160> homage<00:03:38.580> to<00:03:38.610> that

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
meets these powers is homage to that

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.400 
meets these powers is homage to that
like<00:03:39.000> he<00:03:39.300> would<00:03:39.420> love<00:03:39.570> to<00:03:39.660> have<00:03:39.750> Luffy<00:03:40.110> a<00:03:40.140> part

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
like he would love to have Luffy a part

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.630 
like he would love to have Luffy a part
of<00:03:40.530> you<00:03:40.650> know<00:03:40.770> the<00:03:40.890> manga<00:03:41.220> one<00:03:41.370> way<00:03:41.490> or<00:03:41.610> another

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
of you know the manga one way or another

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.850 
of you know the manga one way or another

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
and maybe that's his idea maybe just

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.130 
and maybe that's his idea maybe just
