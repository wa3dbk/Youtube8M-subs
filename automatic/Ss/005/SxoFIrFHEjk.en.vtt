00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello to all girls here is also a new one 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.170
 video 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.150
 in this video I will show you a new one 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.639
 a nail art tutorial with france e 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.099
 enough to grind with single-color flowers 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:19.289
 moved with the color gel technique 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:22.230
 used as always the necessary moments 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.720
 for these the cans are a primer one 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.330
 sixth gear semipermanent base enamel 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.099
 of the farmer I recommend a colored gel 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.679
 just any other color that 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.780
 prefer a pink acrylic color a 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.030
 one color magenta acrylic color 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.210
 acrylic sickness not top red houses of 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.329
 permanent boy if you don't have the base 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.829
 and separate top coat permanent clothes 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.020
 the cooked is abolished 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.660
 in fact, in this case it will be precisely 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.670
 yours in copies that are made at 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.399
 base that seal the faith 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.469
 black semipermanent colombo that of 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.160
 show or briefly what it is 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.539
 this technique you are seeing 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.129
 in demonstration note of 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.619
 an application that if you are my mother 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.439
 the technique of this technique leads us 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.710
 ie using a skeptical primer 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.380
 malt primer seed sealant base 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.170
 permanent and as a color a simple gel 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.540
 colored is a technique that I discovered 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.850
 pour in the oven of a different ace and alle 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.159
 girls who frequent it and wanted 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.630
 share it with you 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.600
 you may be wondering but what 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.810
 they can start with two different products 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.420
 like permanent seeds and gels you boy 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.509
 type is a technique that ok that I have 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.530
 waited over and over again 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.570
 after I realized that 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.400
 actually worked and I was very 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:46.409
 satisfied I wanted to share it with 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.810
 you this is the result after a 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:53.220
 full month from the application then 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:56.040
 girls not only does not create problems that 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.219
 it is also left that they come into contact with the 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.469
 permanent seeds with gels but I discovered 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.530
 that also a longer duration of the seeds 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.080
 permanent 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.690
 unfortunately communicates difference 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.610
 remove it being a non colored gel 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.459
 dissolves with the solvent as it happens 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.410
 with permanent seeds but must be filed 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.810
 for toledo via but it tends anyway 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.489
 by the West 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.140
 obviously boys and services of eight of 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.780
 make this application long 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.860
 you have to keep them a certain length 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.560
 proposing a veil is fine because 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.840
 otherwise devoid of camber like you 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.060
 you know you can go to ruptures 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.790
 it is very bad I do myself 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.360
 I recommend not feeling harmed by one 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.360
 certain length 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.959
 made this small premise sorry if 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.230
 I have dwelt a little longer than expected 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.180
 this is my this new video 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.620
 meanwhile he leaves me the tutorial and I hope you 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.260
 like I recommend for any 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.590
 question or doubt do not hesitate to 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.940
 contact me good vision at all 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.320
 therefore all the various ones are very broken 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.630
 nail preparation stages 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.670
 opaque and already offended the trainer is 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.430
 made to air dry take of 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.950
 semi-permanent malt its meeting that 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.900
 I will use design as a basis for my design 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.090
 leaving the bunga I make a pass 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.970
 thin without ever touching the cuticles 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.530
 otherwise it creates me lifts 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.019
 once covered, retaining it 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.989
 catalize born from forgive those at the end 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.750
 of catalyzing without degreasing for 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.870
 a simple cover a simple gel in the 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.239
 kata also called camouflage them 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.370
 cover and code 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.049
 you understand my bed of the only one 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.150
 I do all the nails except on 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.160
 annular because we trust to give will go to 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.079
 roll out the new color you will see here 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.930
 that the stand also on the annular music inn 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.890
 it's my mistake I made because 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.600
 chatting with my friend I was 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.549
 distracted and therefore does not tell me but 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.160
 nothing serious because then much with 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:51.440
 monochrome andrea power you who are 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.540
 you must do this process 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.100
 France and the stretch where the coverciano 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.980
 do for france while he was 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.930
 release them for free and then beat 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.540
 directly the genoa and ligia to the corato 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.579
 sorry for unicoloured have not been opened 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.620
 all our gels again 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:08.620
 catalyze in struggle since ever nichi 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.930
 once the kinder catalonia is finished 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.080
 cover what he did 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.270
 when my gel colored and colored berry 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.160
 begins to outline a simple french 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.670
 on all the nail textures that on 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:07.010
 annular with the usual tricks like 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.530
 little product at the tip creating a beautiful 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.870
 smile and doing well side and toe 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.860
 or as it owes us from every angle 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.180
 to be 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.300
 you should not see the side of the 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.690
 shows in short once outlined the 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:23.150
 French the paintings urges locatelli gen 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.040
 lamp for three minutes 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.930
 being already colored as of what still 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.330
 less tender minute later one event 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.760
 catalyze all of it in big france 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.910
 morning as you signal it begins again 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:37.160
 he extends his hand as well, he is my gel 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.780
 colored in this way 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.700
 as I see before I had 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.590
 wrong before beating the gel 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.230
 colored or slightly clubbed 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:50.660
 surface because haller and that effect 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:52.550
 in altitude that created the cover one 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.820
 Once it is precisely on their colors 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.590
 on the children of both paci years lari 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.020
 Lightly paint the surface with i 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:04.190
 beats but right there the girls guides 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:07.220
 just to remove that slight of 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.650
 level that creates the trench coat 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.480
 dull our ungainly nails and 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.180
 we are right for may milk up 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.610
 at one o'clock I pick up the pink acrylic and 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.340
 magenta begins to create flowers with 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.590
 the one stroke technique in this way in 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.970
 this way I'm sorry I make a first one 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.340
 passed on both years 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.800
 rearrangement that dries and then creates one 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:31.370
 second pass for di appears precisely the 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.990
 more opaque flower once finished 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:36.580
 to make the flower 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.580
 we are waiting for you to choose well 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:47.200
 once the flowers are dry 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:50.169
 with a brown acrylic heart a brush 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:53.050
 of the tip to 0 2 cousins ​​in the middle of the 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:55.180
 flower the one and some dots under the 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.830
 flower is above I wait for it in the art 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.680
 it is completely dry after which 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.820
 seal step the cuticle oil is this 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.060
 the result of my art 

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:05.320
 completely sealed 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.820

 I want to clarify that the only thing 

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.530
 which changes between a semi permanent 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:19.300
 colored and a colored gel and that they have 

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:22.390
 put removals on this one 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:24.490
 technique where beach towels unlike 

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:26.290
 semi permanent colored which at the moment 

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:29.620
 of removal as you prefer 

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:32.160
 you need to dissolve them with the liquid 

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:35.290
 dedicated while using this 

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:37.120
 technique beats you revive a little bit e 

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:40.150
 color will go quietly away feel 

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:41.950
 that your urgent will ruin some 

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:45.060
 all boy refers to the next video 

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.060
 a kiss to all bye
