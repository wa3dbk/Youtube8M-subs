it's an arm cortex it's an ARM processor
but<00:00:22.650> its<00:00:22.800> full<00:00:23.010> course<00:00:23.630> that's<00:00:24.630> quad<00:00:24.869> core<00:00:25.230> and

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
but its full course that's quad core and

but its full course that's quad core and
a<00:00:25.920> PSP<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.400> don't<00:00:26.670> know<00:00:26.789> if<00:00:26.880> that's<00:00:27.029> really<00:00:27.210> true

a PSP I don't know if that's really true

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.929 
a PSP I don't know if that's really true
let's<00:00:28.680> say<00:00:28.769> this<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.550> know<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:29.880> is

no bigger than what already was but this
is<00:00:40.950> going<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.129> be<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.309> official<00:00:41.660> look<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.870> the

is going to be the official look of the

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.340 
is going to be the official look of the
next-gen<00:00:43.590> PSP<00:00:44.129> now<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.300> doesn't<00:00:45.899> leave<00:00:46.110> that

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
next-gen PSP now it doesn't leave that

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.000 
next-gen PSP now it doesn't leave that
same<00:00:46.649> PSP<00:00:47.160> look<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.730> know<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.590> lr<00:00:49.590> buttons

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
same PSP look you know the lr buttons

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.880 
same PSP look you know the lr buttons
and<00:00:50.340> how<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.640> curves<00:00:50.969> at<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:52.379> know<00:00:52.530> where

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
and how it curves at the you know where

and how it curves at the you know where
the<00:00:52.980> lr<00:00:53.250> buttons<00:00:53.910> are<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.360> mean<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.930> design<00:00:55.260> of

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
the lr buttons are I mean the design of

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.220 
the lr buttons are I mean the design of
the<00:00:55.469> PHP<00:00:55.800> hasn't<00:00:56.039> changed<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.930> PSP<00:00:57.930> slim

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
the PHP hasn't changed that PSP slim

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.500 
the PHP hasn't changed that PSP slim
screen<00:00:59.100> with<00:00:59.280> smaller<00:00:59.520> i'm<00:00:59.730> sure<00:01:00.090> i<00:01:00.149> had<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
screen with smaller i'm sure i had the

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.600 
screen with smaller i'm sure i had the
same<00:01:00.539> processor<00:01:02.120> but<00:01:03.120> um<00:01:03.650> it's<00:01:04.650> NGP<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.309> guess

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
same processor but um it's NGP I guess

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.469 
same processor but um it's NGP I guess
it's<00:01:05.820> supposed<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.150> come<00:01:06.330> out<00:01:07.460> I<00:01:08.460> don't<00:01:09.360> know

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
it's supposed to come out I don't know

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.570 
it's supposed to come out I don't know

and this is what they're saying this is
they're<00:01:11.790> just<00:01:12.000> showing<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.360> actual<00:01:13.070> updated

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.460 
rendering of the actual item I mean have
the<00:01:17.189> PSP<00:01:17.840> so<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.080> what<00:01:19.229> it's<00:01:19.320> going<00:01:19.409> to

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.620 
the PSP so this is what it's going to
look<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.100> let's<00:01:20.909> go<00:01:21.060> through<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.330> specs

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
look like and let's go through the specs

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.840 
look like and let's go through the specs
this<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.350> what<00:01:22.530> it's<00:01:22.650> saying<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.490> I'm<00:01:23.700> not

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
this is what it's saying that I'm not

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.270 
this is what it's saying that I'm not
sure<00:01:24.030> if<00:01:24.090> it's<00:01:24.150> true<00:01:24.450> or<00:01:24.479> not<00:01:25.100> it's<00:01:26.100> going<00:01:26.220> to

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
sure if it's true or not it's going to

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.730 
sure if it's true or not it's going to
be<00:01:26.430> four<00:01:26.850> core<00:01:27.090> arm<00:01:27.299> processor<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.140> don't<00:01:28.650> know

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
be four core arm processor I don't know

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.980 
be four core arm processor I don't know
what<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.159> actual<00:01:29.310> frequency<00:01:30.240> is<00:01:30.659> going<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.869> be

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
what the actual frequency is going to be

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.660 
what the actual frequency is going to be
it's<00:01:31.500> got<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> 5-inch<00:01:32.220> Oh<00:01:32.430> LED<00:01:33.360> multi-touch<00:01:34.670> so

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
it's got a 5-inch Oh LED multi-touch so

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.179 
it's got a 5-inch Oh LED multi-touch so
that's<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:36.030> touchscreen<00:01:36.360> on<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.750> PSP<00:01:36.990> it's<00:01:37.920> got

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
that's a touchscreen on the PSP it's got

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:46.039 
that's a touchscreen on the PSP it's got
a<00:01:38.460> 200<00:01:39.000> megahertz<00:01:39.770> HDX<00:01:41.720> 133<00:01:44.000> MP<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.299> think<00:01:45.899> that

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
a 200 megahertz HDX 133 MP I think that

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.580 
a 200 megahertz HDX 133 MP I think that
some<00:01:46.399> mega<00:01:47.869> polygons<00:01:48.869> I'm<00:01:49.170> not<00:01:49.320> really<00:01:49.470> sure

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
some mega polygons I'm not really sure

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.060 
some mega polygons I'm not really sure
mega<00:01:50.009> polygons<00:01:50.549> 4<00:01:51.270> Giga<00:01:51.540> pixels<00:01:52.350> fill<00:01:52.829> rate

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
mega polygons 4 Giga pixels fill rate

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.490 
mega polygons 4 Giga pixels fill rate
that<00:01:53.670> sounds<00:01:54.060> pretty<00:01:54.210> powerful<00:01:54.840> for<00:01:55.290> such<00:01:55.470> a

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
that sounds pretty powerful for such a

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.109 
that sounds pretty powerful for such a
small<00:01:55.740> system<00:01:58.009> it's<00:01:59.009> got<00:01:59.189> bluetooth<00:01:59.549> phone<00:01:59.969> it

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
small system it's got bluetooth phone it

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.780 
small system it's got bluetooth phone it
and<00:02:00.270> wireless<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.200> actually<00:02:02.130> let<00:02:02.460> me<00:02:02.579> check

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
and wireless a actually let me check

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.179 
and wireless a actually let me check
