such as the features and the system

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.840 
such as the features and the system
requirements<00:01:17.790> now<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.750> should<00:01:18.990> work<00:01:19.229> on

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
requirements now this should work on

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.330 
requirements now this should work on
Windows<00:01:20.850> XP<00:01:21.479> all<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.259> way<00:01:22.380> up<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.650> Windows<00:01:22.979> 7

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
Windows XP all the way up to Windows 7

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.490 
Windows XP all the way up to Windows 7

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
but I think it should still support

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.859 
but I think it should still support
Windows<00:01:25.830> 8<00:01:26.130> because<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.850> newly<00:01:27.299> released

forward you'll expose the air and this

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.940 
forward you'll expose the air and this
is<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.450> area<00:03:06.659> that<00:03:06.690> would<00:03:06.900> actually<00:03:07.379> insert
