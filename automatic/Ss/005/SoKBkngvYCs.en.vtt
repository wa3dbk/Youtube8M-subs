00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello recipe friends today let's see 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.730
 how to cook the quina this food is 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.780
 very used nowadays is a pseudo 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.839
 cereal rich in vitamins in fiber in 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.960
 proteins and can be used as a 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.769
 substitute voice or accompany him with 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:27.599
 vegetables with meat or pucho and for this 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:30.359
 we're going to need 250 grams of kina and 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.440
 double the amount of grams what 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.960
 first thing we do is soak the 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.710
 insufficient amount of water and we're going 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.829
 to remove 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.829
 lack a shell boat she cited that 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:47.670
 it gives a bitter taste and that part in the 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.670
 that we should discard 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:54.090
 We leave it to soak approximately 20 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.060
 minutes and then we're going to discard everything from 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.180
 the surface and wash it well 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:04.270
 we put to boil twice the amount of 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.620
 water that we say and we're going to add the 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.620
 there in the boiling water already 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.650
 we can prepare it alone or the 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:19.640
 We can prepare with vegetables in a 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:23.540
 broth of meat or in a broth of vegetables 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.350
 when it's boiling, we cover it and go to 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.330
 leave cooking over medium low heat 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.130
 approximately 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.860
 12 to 15 minutes 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:37.180
 or until it completely dry 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.189
 water and here when she is like that 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.850
 spongy and has dried completely 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:45.490
 Water 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.470
 we test the grain and the grain this soft 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.470
