00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.110 
kind of sucks because you know your race
starts<00:05:53.540> like<00:05:53.810> dpsing<00:05:54.530> the<00:05:55.100> dummy<00:05:55.370> acid<00:05:55.790> as<00:05:56.060> a

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
starts like dpsing the dummy acid as a

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.570 
starts like dpsing the dummy acid as a
rogue<00:05:56.710> because<00:05:57.710> you<00:05:57.800> don't<00:05:57.950> have<00:05:57.979> all<00:05:58.220> the<00:05:58.340> bus

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
rogue because you don't have all the bus

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.490 
rogue because you don't have all the bus
from<00:05:58.850> the<00:05:59.000> other<00:05:59.120> members<00:05:59.360> so<00:05:59.750> like<00:05:59.960> you're

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
from the other members so like you're

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.280 
from the other members so like you're
gonna<00:06:00.620> be<00:06:00.890> a<00:06:00.919> little<00:06:01.370> energy<00:06:01.820> starved<00:06:02.240> and<00:06:02.479> so

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:03.290 
gonna be a little energy starved and so

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.740 
gonna be a little energy starved and so
