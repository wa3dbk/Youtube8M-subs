00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:03.770
 7 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.770
 With 

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:12.539
 the beast is the Sony Ericsson b 5 9 5 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:17.539
 That's a pretty cheap one to kill Phoenix - can it be that 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.810
 with and Thies and even HIV the PEA is equipped 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:25.529
 the Hyundai did not have anything running outside a smaller one 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.519
 I think so 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.519
 pretty good in the hand it seemed easy 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.640
 under me he has percent connection leads the headphone Internet site 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.960
 The movie makes Sony Ericsson Herbert in a nutshell 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.000
 and what especially strikes this Henning the Finn at the same time 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.860
 So Sony Ericsson becomes Athena with the 5 2 um 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.760
 Connections for headphones so you can listen to music as a couple 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.410
 Percent Clara Foster over the speakers 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.449
 and wait, how come the storekeeper, but what not? 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.510
 the stress tests 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.790
 Chile this Stefan the 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.830
 comes here accordingly 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.380
 to the side 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.070
 and then we have 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.450
 Gerd is relatively large piece here where then 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.260
 normal jack can be connected in two pieces 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.310
 had this here 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.670
 It is too good that this is open to you but you can make him one 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.979
 to connect the second headphones but you have to and around yourself 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.200
 that is to say 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.340
 Sony Ericsson only delivers 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.840
 own park victims with 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.300
 and who really wants to use this opportunity for the second victory 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.200
 hear 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.200
 it needs one percentage point more than the headphones 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.780
 Hermann still has the usb cable as well as this connection on the side 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.630
 is closed differently in her 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.030
 Of course, the cast also with it 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.410
 and go down and down KÃ¶hler Kliche 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.539
 Manual pc-soft clock down further
