to dry formula it's full coverage but

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.490 
to dry formula it's full coverage but
you<00:00:33.090> can<00:00:33.300> make<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.570> look<00:00:33.690> really<00:00:33.899> natural<00:00:34.140> I

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
you can make it look really natural I

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.440 
you can make it look really natural I
have<00:00:34.770> tried<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.340> combo<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.820> oily<00:00:36.180> before

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
have tried the combo to oily before

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.790 
have tried the combo to oily before
because<00:00:36.600> that's<00:00:36.750> actually<00:00:37.140> more<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.410> my<00:00:37.500> skin

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
because that's actually more of my skin

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.440 
because that's actually more of my skin
type<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:39.239> was<00:00:39.480> like<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.590> drying<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.820> mad<00:00:42.180> it

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
type and it was like so drying so mad it

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.319 
type and it was like so drying so mad it
felt<00:00:42.719> like<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:43.079> mask<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.829> just<00:00:44.040> was<00:00:44.219> not<00:00:45.030> good

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
felt like a mask it just was not good

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.069 
felt like a mask it just was not good
this<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.950> little<00:00:47.309> it's<00:00:47.940> not<00:00:48.090> do<00:00:48.450> we<00:00:48.660> it's

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
this is a little it's not do we it's

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.690 
this is a little it's not do we it's
still<00:00:49.410> more<00:00:49.620> considered<00:00:50.100> like<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.219> natural

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
still more considered like a natural

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.549 
still more considered like a natural
finish<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:51.149> guess<00:00:51.329> it's<00:00:51.539> not<00:00:51.660> completely<00:00:52.199> mad

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
finish I guess it's not completely mad

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.930 
finish I guess it's not completely mad
but<00:00:53.360> last<00:00:54.530> beautifully<00:00:55.530> does<00:00:55.920> not<00:00:56.129> oxidize<00:00:56.910> or

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940

single day for seriously years it's too

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.480 
single day for seriously years it's too
cool<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.439> then<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.710> makes<00:02:01.860> everything<00:02:02.310> look

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
cool and then it makes everything look

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.440 
cool and then it makes everything look
cool<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.479> pulls<00:02:03.780> gray<00:02:04.310> whereas<00:02:05.310> this<00:02:05.880> pulls

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
cool and pulls gray whereas this pulls

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.690 
cool and pulls gray whereas this pulls
more<00:02:06.780> yellow<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.500> warms<00:02:07.950> things<00:02:08.009> up<00:02:08.340> it's

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
more yellow it warms things up it's

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.900 
more yellow it warms things up it's
golden<00:02:09.860> so<00:02:10.860> just<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.099> different<00:02:11.430> option<00:02:11.730> but

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
golden so just a different option but

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.920

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
brushes with this one I I just can't get

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.000 
brushes with this one I I just can't get
enough<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.640> it's<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.300> crease<00:02:33.660> brush<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.410> it's<00:02:34.890> a

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
enough it it's a crease brush and it's a

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.310 
enough it it's a crease brush and it's a
decent<00:02:35.490> size<00:02:35.550> crease<00:02:36.030> brush<00:02:36.180> but<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:36.930> kind<00:02:37.230> of

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
decent size crease brush but it kind of

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.470 
decent size crease brush but it kind of
comes<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.800> a<00:02:37.830> point<00:02:37.890> there<00:02:38.580> so<00:02:39.090> it's<00:02:39.240> not<00:02:39.330> just

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
comes to a point there so it's not just

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.300 
comes to a point there so it's not just
wide<00:02:39.960> and<00:02:40.170> fluffy<00:02:40.530> it's<00:02:40.710> not<00:02:40.980> just<00:02:41.190> for

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
wide and fluffy it's not just for

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.660 
wide and fluffy it's not just for
blending<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.880> reason<00:02:42.300> i<00:02:42.450> love<00:02:43.170> this<00:02:43.670> is

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
blending the reason i love this is

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.310 
blending the reason i love this is
because<00:02:45.150> at<00:02:45.270> that<00:02:45.360> point<00:02:45.600> what<00:02:45.870> i<00:02:45.900> like<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.200> do

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
because at that point what i like to do

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.490 
because at that point what i like to do
is<00:02:46.650> for<00:02:47.130> my<00:02:47.340> kind<00:02:48.030> of<00:02:48.090> mid-tone<00:02:48.660> crease<00:02:49.170> color

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
is for my kind of mid-tone crease color

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.070 
is for my kind of mid-tone crease color
it's<00:02:50.310> so<00:02:50.670> nice<00:02:50.820> because<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.240> get<00:02:51.540> a<00:02:51.600> crease

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
it's so nice because you get a crease

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.100 
it's so nice because you get a crease
and<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:53.130> can<00:02:53.280> get<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.460> defined<00:02:53.940> crease<00:02:54.390> without

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
and you can get a defined crease without

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.670 
and you can get a defined crease without
it<00:02:55.320> being<00:02:55.530> too<00:02:55.860> harsh<00:02:56.850> because<00:02:57.240> the<00:02:58.230> bristles

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
it being too harsh because the bristles

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.820 
it being too harsh because the bristles
are<00:02:58.890> like<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.280> brush<00:02:59.870> kind<00:03:00.870> of<00:03:00.930> tapers<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:01.410> so

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
are like the brush kind of tapers and so

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.320 
are like the brush kind of tapers and so
it<00:03:01.980> comes<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.400> point<00:03:02.460> so<00:03:02.880> that<00:03:03.000> you<00:03:03.060> can<00:03:03.240> get

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
it comes to a point so that you can get

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.810 
it comes to a point so that you can get
definition<00:03:04.080> but<00:03:04.620> then<00:03:04.830> these<00:03:04.980> outer<00:03:05.250> bristles

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
definition but then these outer bristles

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.240 
definition but then these outer bristles
kind<00:03:06.360> of<00:03:06.450> soften<00:03:06.960> it<00:03:07.080> up<00:03:07.170> so<00:03:07.560> it's<00:03:07.710> really<00:03:08.010> like

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
kind of soften it up so it's really like

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.490 
kind of soften it up so it's really like
one<00:03:08.280> brush<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.210> i<00:03:09.360> can<00:03:09.540> do<00:03:09.630> my<00:03:09.660> whole<00:03:09.960> crease<00:03:10.260> i

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
one brush and i can do my whole crease i

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.310 
one brush and i can do my whole crease i
can<00:03:11.100> do<00:03:11.190> like<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.400> nice<00:03:11.640> outer<00:03:11.880> V<00:03:12.210> but<00:03:12.900> it's<00:03:13.050> just

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
can do like a nice outer V but it's just

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.560 
can do like a nice outer V but it's just
it<00:03:13.530> keeps<00:03:13.950> it<00:03:14.100> from<00:03:14.250> being<00:03:14.310> it<00:03:15.090> doesn't<00:03:15.420> just<00:03:15.450> a

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
it keeps it from being it doesn't just a

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.450 
it keeps it from being it doesn't just a
blend<00:03:15.810> too<00:03:16.140> much<00:03:16.320> that<00:03:16.590> things<00:03:16.860> get<00:03:17.130> muddy

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
blend too much that things get muddy

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.690 
blend too much that things get muddy
looking<00:03:17.910> and<00:03:18.240> it's<00:03:18.420> not<00:03:18.630> too<00:03:19.020> defined<00:03:19.500> that<00:03:20.070> it

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
looking and it's not too defined that it

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.310 
looking and it's not too defined that it
can<00:03:20.910> make<00:03:21.030> harsh<00:03:21.330> lines<00:03:21.570> and<00:03:21.810> be<00:03:21.870> hard<00:03:22.020> to<00:03:22.140> work

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320
