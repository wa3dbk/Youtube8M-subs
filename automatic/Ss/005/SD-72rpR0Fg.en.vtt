 new means kotovskaya firm

 bucks creates a series of cutting tools 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.080
 the same year the counter brand was founded 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.540
 tool and knife existing and 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.520
 present day 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.080
 the actual products of the company are different 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.729
 specific design strong influence 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.850
 on the formation of which had 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.330
 culture of salvador besides knives kukri 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.250
 machete axes and shovels company condor 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.110
 makes the need for cutting 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.840
 leather tool kaydeksa and 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.920
 ballistic nylon small 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.290
 clarification should not be confused 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.320
 company Condor tool and knife on 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.299
 condor outdoor products 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.130
 completely different firms and even though 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.020
 outdoor products company 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.570
 based in california in the ninetieth 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.399
 year engaged in the release of tactical 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.799
 equipment and and the catalog is available 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.380
 Several models of knives still have 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.950
 completely different emblems completely 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.439
 different 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.810
 symbolism origin and in general it 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:05.659
 completely different companies will be which 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:12.180
 not worth the knife from the company itself 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:14.970
 condor enough now to say a couple 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.950
 words regarding the dimensions of the knife in 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.459
 overall comparable to the dimensions here 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:25.200
 Lara Croft line actually here here 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:29.129
 it turns out I see it 208 207 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.440
 millimeters total length about 90 7 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.870
 millimeters blade length and a little bit 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.099
 less but maybe about 95 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.530
 millimeters cutting edge length 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:43.739
 the actual thickness of the boxing of the knife 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.569
 2 and 9 millimeters like this 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.730
 look like if we put a match 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.220
 boxes 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.849
 Well, actually still put a spider to 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.239
 military 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:56.700
 it looks like this is about like this 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.879
 there is a relatively compact knife 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.319
 relatively comfortable in hand on the very 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.379
 in spite of its seemingly 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.739
 a simple handle ergonomics 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.709
 handle 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:11.610
 so barrel-shaped and fills well 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:14.700
 its shape with the palm in general 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.310
 quite comfortable but I spent 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.080
 testing this knife and cutting this 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.269
 knife me after all on wood 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.730
 And this, I think, its main purpose is not 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.299
 impressed but as well as by products for 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.519
 account of its relatively thick butt 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.810
 the knife is not the best way but I am 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.720
 again geometry is not the best way 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.000
 copes on products that is mora i 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.730
 still would prefer ergonomics 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.540
 the hilt and the cut as wood 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.519
 so and the knife is carbon so therefore 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.310
 rusts hard enough but still 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:50.849
 again this is not that kind of crowbar 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.220
 relatively inexpensive and in its own way 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.900
 interesting knife especially produces 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.120
 the impression that this is Fulton 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.430
 design and when you hold it in your hand 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.420
 marvel at his rather large 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.400
 weight well for such sizes for such 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.700
 a knife that is, it is somewhat more 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.209
 adores the trust of respect 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:15.099
 yes you take him in your hand such a moment 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.099
 I hope you were interested bye
