00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.340 
my head plucking in this spot creates
more<00:01:13.920> vibration<00:01:14.610> than<00:01:15.119> if<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.750> first<00:01:16.020> finger

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
more vibration than if the first finger

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.010 
more vibration than if the first finger
the<00:01:16.380> pointer<00:01:16.799> finger<00:01:17.130> were<00:01:17.700> above<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.780> thumb

if you don't believe me try it

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.359 
if you don't believe me try it
the<00:01:22.540> end<00:01:22.720> result<00:01:23.110> should<00:01:23.229> look<00:01:23.440> like<00:01:23.650> this

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
the end result should look like this

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.719 
the end result should look like this

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
see when the instrument is between the

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.070 
see when the instrument is between the
shoulder<00:01:35.110> and<00:01:35.409> your<00:01:35.650> Java<00:01:36.360> now<00:01:37.360> let's<00:01:37.900> learn

shoulder and your Java now let's learn

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.460 
shoulder and your Java now let's learn
about<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.409> names<00:01:38.800> of<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.190> strings<00:01:39.490> on<00:01:39.700> violin

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
about the names of the strings on violin

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.680 
about the names of the strings on violin
first<00:01:41.470> I<00:01:41.860> want<00:01:42.159> you<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.369> notice<00:01:42.640> which<00:01:43.300> strings

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
first I want you to notice which strings

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.130 
first I want you to notice which strings
are<00:01:43.960> much<00:01:44.290> thinner<00:01:44.799> than<00:01:45.130> others<00:01:45.850> the<00:01:46.780> string

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
are much thinner than others the string

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.380 
are much thinner than others the string
that<00:01:47.470> is<00:01:47.649> the<00:01:47.979> thinnest<00:01:48.399> is<00:01:48.640> called<00:01:49.119> the<00:01:49.360> E

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
that is the thinnest is called the E

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.160 
that is the thinnest is called the E
string<00:01:49.990> it<00:01:50.409> is<00:01:50.680> located<00:01:51.070> on<00:01:51.369> the<00:01:51.549> right<00:01:52.170> the

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
string it is located on the right the

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.169 
string it is located on the right the
next<00:01:53.350> thickest<00:01:53.979> string<00:01:54.250> would<00:01:54.610> be<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:55.149> a

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
next thickest string would be the a

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.370 
next thickest string would be the a
string<00:01:55.750> then<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.770> D<00:01:56.979> and<00:01:57.250> then<00:01:57.910> the<00:01:58.119> G<00:01:58.390> if<00:01:58.780> you

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
string then the D and then the G if you

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.260 
string then the D and then the G if you
wanted<00:01:59.679> to<00:01:59.890> you<00:02:00.250> could<00:02:00.429> remember<00:02:00.729> this<00:02:01.030> by

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
wanted to you could remember this by

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.520 
wanted to you could remember this by
thinking<00:02:01.330> of<00:02:01.960> good<00:02:02.800> dogs<00:02:03.100> always<00:02:03.550> eat<00:02:04.530> when

finger try not to pluck with the edge of
your<00:02:15.459> finger<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:16.420> will<00:02:16.569> not<00:02:16.690> get<00:02:16.930> as<00:02:17.050> much

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
your finger you will not get as much

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.949 
your finger you will not get as much
vibration<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.310> string<00:02:18.700> therefore<00:02:19.510> the

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
vibration and the string therefore the

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.070 
vibration and the string therefore the
sound<00:02:20.260> won't<00:02:20.500> come<00:02:21.100> out<00:02:21.280> as<00:02:21.459> a<00:02:21.700> fool<00:02:22.030> or<00:02:22.330> clear

plucking<00:02:27.660> or<00:02:27.840> bowing<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:29.070> volume<00:02:29.370> level<00:02:29.700> will

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
plucking or bowing the volume level will

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.420 
plucking or bowing the volume level will
sound<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.240> lot<00:02:30.390> louder<00:02:30.720> than<00:02:31.650> if<00:02:31.890> I<00:02:32.100> were<00:02:32.310> to

remember to pluck a little harder than

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.750 
remember to pluck a little harder than
usual<00:02:39.060> so<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:39.840> way<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.590> audience<00:02:40.770> can<00:02:41.370> hear

if you pluck too hard the string could

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.410 
if you pluck too hard the string could
either<00:02:44.760> get<00:02:45.060> out<00:02:45.120> of<00:02:45.300> tune<00:02:45.540> or<00:02:45.960> break<00:02:47.420> notice

let's go ahead and play along with some
music<00:03:21.470> we're<00:03:22.470> gonna<00:03:22.560> start<00:03:22.920> on<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.430> D<00:03:23.760> string

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
music we're gonna start on the D string

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.030 
music we're gonna start on the D string
which<00:03:24.360> is<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.600> third<00:03:25.080> string<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.010> left

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
which is the third string to the left

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.900 
which is the third string to the left
and<00:03:26.780> also<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:27.930> third<00:03:28.170> thickest<00:03:28.920> string<00:03:29.250> and

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
and also the third thickest string and

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:45.280 
and also the third thickest string and
let's<00:03:30.150> go<00:03:30.300> ahead<00:03:30.390> and<00:03:30.750> play<00:03:31.140> this<00:03:31.350> rhythm<00:03:31.650> here

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.190 

if<00:03:46.290> you<00:03:47.040> did<00:03:47.190> really<00:03:47.400> well<00:03:47.520> then<00:03:48.330> let's<00:03:49.020> move

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
if you did really well then let's move

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.380 
if you did really well then let's move
on<00:03:49.410> if<00:03:49.770> you<00:03:49.830> didn't<00:03:50.340> do<00:03:50.520> really<00:03:50.880> well<00:03:51.060> or<00:03:51.240> you

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
on if you didn't do really well or you

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.840 
on if you didn't do really well or you
missed<00:03:51.690> one<00:03:51.959> go<00:03:52.560> back<00:03:52.770> and<00:03:53.040> look<00:03:53.250> at<00:03:53.400> the<00:03:53.520> music

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
missed one go back and look at the music

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.030 
missed one go back and look at the music
again

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
again

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.670 
again
let's<00:03:55.819> try<00:03:56.120> another<00:03:56.269> one<00:03:56.510> this<00:03:57.019> time<00:03:57.319> it'll<00:03:57.590> be

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
let's try another one this time it'll be

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.100 
let's try another one this time it'll be
a<00:03:57.769> little<00:03:57.980> harder<00:03:58.400> and<00:03:58.640> it'll<00:03:59.599> add<00:03:59.810> the<00:04:00.079> a

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
a little harder and it'll add the a

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.830 
a little harder and it'll add the a
stream<00:04:00.829> to<00:04:01.400> see<00:04:01.640> if<00:04:01.879> you<00:04:02.000> can<00:04:02.180> switch<00:04:02.450> over<00:04:02.629> to

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
stream to see if you can switch over to

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:22.000 
stream to see if you can switch over to
strength<00:04:18.940> let's<00:04:19.940> try<00:04:20.209> an<00:04:20.479> even<00:04:21.139> harder<00:04:21.500> one

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
strength let's try an even harder one

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.540 
strength let's try an even harder one
this<00:04:22.610> one<00:04:22.880> will<00:04:23.300> required<00:04:23.690> you<00:04:23.930> play<00:04:24.169> D<00:04:24.770> and<00:04:25.039> a

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
this one will required you play D and a

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.500 
this one will required you play D and a
and<00:04:25.960> a<00:04:26.960> different<00:04:27.380> type<00:04:27.620> of<00:04:27.830> rhythm<00:04:28.160> and<00:04:28.510> this

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
and a different type of rhythm and this

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.750 
and a different type of rhythm and this
rhythm<00:04:29.930> showing<00:04:30.350> we<00:04:30.919> usually<00:04:31.280> call<00:04:31.460> this

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
rhythm showing we usually call this

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.390 
rhythm showing we usually call this
pepperoni<00:04:32.630> pizza<00:04:33.229> there<00:04:33.830> are<00:04:33.919> other<00:04:34.100> names

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
pepperoni pizza there are other names

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.340 
pepperoni pizza there are other names
for<00:04:34.550> it<00:04:34.850> but<00:04:34.880> this<00:04:35.360> is<00:04:35.570> what<00:04:35.780> we<00:04:35.900> will<00:04:36.020> call<00:04:36.169> it

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
for it but this is what we will call it

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.060 
for it but this is what we will call it
for<00:04:36.530> right<00:04:36.650> now

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
for right now

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.330 
for right now
pepperoni<00:04:37.910> pizza<00:04:38.479> let's<00:04:39.260> go<00:04:39.440> ahead<00:04:39.560> and<00:04:39.979> try

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
pepperoni pizza let's go ahead and try

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.400 
pepperoni pizza let's go ahead and try
it<00:04:40.400> on<00:04:40.760> the<00:04:41.210> D<00:04:41.419> string<00:04:41.449> first<00:04:43.120> member<00:04:44.120> roni<00:04:44.570> P

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
it on the D string first member roni P

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:52.770 
it on the D string first member roni P
so<00:04:46.539> let's<00:04:47.539> try<00:04:47.780> it<00:04:47.840> a<00:04:47.870> little<00:04:47.900> faster<00:04:51.370> now

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
so let's try it a little faster now

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:58.730 
so let's try it a little faster now
without<00:04:53.780> my<00:04:53.990> voice

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:07.160 

try<00:04:59.490> the<00:04:59.550> same<00:04:59.880> with<00:05:00.090> your<00:05:00.300> a<00:05:00.330> string<00:05:06.020> go<00:05:07.020> ahead

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
try the same with your a string go ahead

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:08.960 
try the same with your a string go ahead
and<00:05:07.350> try<00:05:07.530> it<00:05:07.560> again<00:05:07.710> this<00:05:08.370> time<00:05:08.430> a<00:05:08.670> little

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
and try it again this time a little

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:23.810 
and try it again this time a little
louder<00:05:13.790> this<00:05:14.790> time<00:05:14.850> really<00:05:15.300> soft<00:05:21.380> good<00:05:22.820> there

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
louder this time really soft good there

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.370
