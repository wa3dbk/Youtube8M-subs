you know I think we're good to be
connected<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:55.650> I<00:03:56.340> think<00:03:56.549> we<00:03:56.670> killed<00:03:56.879> we

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
connected and I think we killed we

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.399 
connected and I think we killed we
killed<00:03:57.239> those<00:03:57.420> like<00:03:57.599> you<00:03:57.689> so<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:57.930> all<00:03:58.019> sort<00:03:58.319> of

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409 
killed those like you so it all sort of

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:01.130 
killed those like you so it all sort of
ties<00:03:58.650> together<00:03:59.000> to<00:04:00.000> give<00:04:00.150> one<00:04:00.390> a<00:04:00.420> sense<00:04:00.870> of

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
ties together to give one a sense of

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.750 
ties together to give one a sense of
belonging<00:04:01.409> and<00:04:03.439> our<00:04:04.439> the<00:04:04.950> Scots<00:04:05.280> I<00:04:05.459> think<00:04:05.640> are

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
belonging and our the Scots I think are

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.660 
belonging and our the Scots I think are
particularly<00:04:06.860> interested<00:04:07.860> in<00:04:08.010> that<00:04:08.220> but<00:04:08.519> it

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
particularly interested in that but it

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.610 
particularly interested in that but it
all<00:04:08.790> comes<00:04:09.000> back<00:04:09.120> to<00:04:09.299> one<00:04:09.599> essential<00:04:10.349> thing<00:04:10.409> I

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
all comes back to one essential thing I

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.670 
all comes back to one essential thing I
think<00:04:10.890> which<00:04:11.069> is<00:04:11.099> the<00:04:11.959> the<00:04:12.959> extraordinary

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
think which is the the extraordinary

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.110 
think which is the the extraordinary
pride<00:04:14.099> there<00:04:14.459> is<00:04:14.609> in<00:04:15.450> our<00:04:16.019> heritage<00:04:16.709> and<00:04:17.340> in

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
pride there is in our heritage and in

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.139 
pride there is in our heritage and in
