00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.840

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
think he had a bus stop with the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.600 
think he had a bus stop with the
Liverpool<00:02:03.210> fans<00:02:03.479> i<00:02:03.630> remember<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.140> when<00:02:04.610> he

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
Liverpool fans i remember that when he

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.670 
Liverpool fans i remember that when he
did<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.329> liverpool<00:02:06.689> fans<00:02:06.930> live<00:02:07.229> as<00:02:07.649> a

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
did that to the liverpool fans live as a

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.880 
did that to the liverpool fans live as a
of<00:02:08.399> course<00:02:08.759> abused<00:02:09.569> him<00:02:09.810> from<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.229> from<00:02:10.770> the

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
of course abused him from the from the

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.150 
of course abused him from the from the
stands<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:11.550> maybe<00:02:11.790> that's<00:02:12.120> why<00:02:12.330> he<00:02:12.569> really

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
stands so maybe that's why he really

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.370 
stands so maybe that's why he really
it's<00:02:13.250> like<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.610> pool<00:02:13.910> I<00:02:14.120> think<00:02:14.630> I<00:02:14.810> think

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
it's like the pool I think I think

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.260 
it's like the pool I think I think

the three losses against of course
difficult<00:03:02.840> opposition<00:03:03.440> so<00:03:03.950> it's<00:03:04.100> not

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
difficult opposition so it's not

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.950 
difficult opposition so it's not
impossible<00:03:04.610> that<00:03:04.970> many<00:03:05.330> night<00:03:05.510> it<00:03:05.660> will<00:03:05.780> keep

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
impossible that many night it will keep

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.570

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
magnetic game is huge today because if

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.650

tomorrow<00:03:15.110> could<00:03:15.470> maybe<00:03:15.770> get<00:03:16.700> a<00:03:16.760> victory

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060

tomorrow could maybe get a victory
against<00:03:17.630> Chelsea<00:03:18.110> then<00:03:18.680> it's<00:03:18.860> on<00:03:19.010> I<00:03:19.070> think

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
against Chelsea then it's on I think

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.180 
against Chelsea then it's on I think
it's<00:03:19.730> on<00:03:19.970> but<00:03:20.360> if<00:03:20.600> basically<00:03:21.500> this<00:03:21.620> weekend<00:03:22.070> I

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
it's on but if basically this weekend I

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.030 
it's on but if basically this weekend I
think<00:03:22.430> will<00:03:22.640> will<00:03:23.209> show<00:03:23.480> us<00:03:23.660> a<00:03:23.690> lot<00:03:24.140> in<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.680> top

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
think will will show us a lot in the top

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.170 
think will will show us a lot in the top
4<00:03:25.250> race<00:03:26.080> because<00:03:27.160> because<00:03:28.160> if<00:03:28.310> you<00:03:28.700> don't<00:03:28.970> win

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
4 race because because if you don't win

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.900 
4 race because because if you don't win
against<00:03:29.510> Chelsea<00:03:29.959> then<00:03:30.530> it's<00:03:30.680> over<00:03:30.860> no<00:03:31.700> matter

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
against Chelsea then it's over no matter

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.210 
against Chelsea then it's over no matter
what<00:03:32.270> the<00:03:32.420> man<00:03:32.540> united<00:03:32.900> result<00:03:33.260> is<00:03:33.470> I<00:03:33.740> don't

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
what the man united result is I don't

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.220 
what the man united result is I don't
think<00:03:34.520> man<00:03:34.820> united<00:03:35.209> we<00:03:35.330> lose<00:03:35.570> the<00:03:35.810> last<00:03:35.990> two

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
think man united we lose the last two

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.050 
think man united we lose the last two
games<00:03:36.470> it's<00:03:36.709> not<00:03:36.890> impossible<00:03:37.160> but<00:03:37.550> it's<00:03:37.880> very

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
games it's not impossible but it's very

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.140 
games it's not impossible but it's very
highly<00:03:38.450> likely<00:03:38.740> if<00:03:39.740> they<00:03:40.010> get<00:03:40.220> some<00:03:40.490> points

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
highly likely if they get some points

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.580 
highly likely if they get some points
against<00:03:41.420> crystal<00:03:41.780> palace<00:03:41.810> and<00:03:42.140> yeah<00:03:42.230> if<00:03:42.410> may<00:03:42.560> I

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590

Liverpool<00:03:45.680> loose<00:03:45.800> to<00:03:45.980> Chelsea<00:03:46.430> it<00:03:46.550> could<00:03:46.730> be

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
Liverpool loose to Chelsea it could be

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:51.190 
Liverpool loose to Chelsea it could be
over<00:03:47.209> by<00:03:47.959> the<00:03:48.020> weekend<00:03:48.590> and<00:03:48.920> if<00:03:49.820> Lupo<00:03:50.600> had<00:03:50.959> a
