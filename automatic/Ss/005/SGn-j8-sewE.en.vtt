00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.500
 Hello dear friends with you Nikita 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.090
 and now I will play asphalt 8 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.820
 airborne and on my laptop this is not 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:17.220
 Installed from the market it is launched through 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.550
 emulator android that is, I downloaded from the play 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.430
 market ordinary google skogo and honestly 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.890
 I just say in afig from what 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.689
 Actually here is the graphics and see I 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.480
 quite a while not playing flagship 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.059
 devices not but what really everything 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.000
 It looks so cool that I have withdrawn from 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:39.750
 this my samsung galaxy tab 2 is just 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.340
 Generally you washi whom I used to first 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.809
 that I rushed to check it at a construction site 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.510
 graphic and there is no see 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.610
 automatically put the maximum in 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.199
 In principle, it is understandable to compare 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:59.129
 the power of a laptop with a phone is ridiculous 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:01.969
 so now let's run any race i'm clean 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.439
 demonstrate how it all looks 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.380
 honestly say drawing at all 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.290
 smartest something like a game 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.570
 because well too many effects and 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.630
 You can even say that this game can 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.710
 compete with pc racing games somewhere 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.909
 2008 2009 I remember flatout 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.979
 the ultimatum carnage is about 2009 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:29.409
 there were also about 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:33.909
 well traced all straight dirt there 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:36.399
 spray water but still brings physics and 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:41.020
 but I do not know how it is not enough breakdowns 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:44.409
 machines still a little wrong control 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.579
 here is usually well almost normal for a space 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:51.340
 it's nitro on the counter it's brakes and 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:54.099
 turns the usual arrows well in 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.579
 principle and everything as I said that 

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:59.380
 not every game supports 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.509
 third-party controllers but asphalt 8 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.729
 he supports absolutely everything and 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:07.000
 settings when you choose 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:10.810
 management there is a separate item 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.829
 keyboard is there please her here 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:18.579
 I am content to play my game 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:23.140
 computer, if possible, I can 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:26.640
 I will try to write reviews of applications not 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.620
 from the camera your tablet even from a laptop 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.890
 I think so it will be possible to prettier 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.060
 for the book a little reviews and more interesting 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:42.209
 mount for now be content 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:45.209
 awesome game soundtracks and graphics 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.209
 asphalt 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.110
 but 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.980
