00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.280 
I think offensive linemen defensive
lineman<00:01:26.880> should<00:01:27.000> go<00:01:27.090> at<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.360> every<00:01:27.630> day<00:01:27.810> db's

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
lineman should go at it every day db's

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.899 
lineman should go at it every day db's
and<00:01:28.470> receivers<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.070> should<00:01:29.220> be<00:01:29.310> violent<00:01:29.790> it

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
and receivers it should be violent it

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.130 
and receivers it should be violent it
should<00:01:30.060> be<00:01:30.150> going<00:01:30.390> at<00:01:30.540> each<00:01:30.570> other<00:01:30.810> every<00:01:31.110> day
