00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:25.890
 cf trampled us on the link steps 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:29.919
 but it was just an experiment 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:33.460
 hargriv knew that we dig him there 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:35.559
 wanted to experience a suit in these conditions 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.710
 I wanted to see what will happen with the technicians 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:42.579
 costume operators when we finally 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.879
 get to the shop for that bastard we 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:48.670
 always consumable 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.030
 guinea pigs biological 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.940
 spare parts for war with workshops 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.160
 he didn't even deny it 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:01.550
 I have become the warriors of the future 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:05.089
 count it perimeter debt you lied to us 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.370
 he laughed when i left saying i 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.800
 I will return that I have no choice 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.800
 on this war to ordinary people me 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.570
 the most lousy he was right this 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.940
 sick bastard was right in everything he 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.830
 prepared himself for the meeting with the numbers but was 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:27.140
 too weak to complete the job 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.140
 death is now nothing more than 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:34.630
 with what i discovered i had to 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:38.100
 return but it was too late 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:41.600
 too damn late 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.600
 the invasion was already in full swing 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.430
 maybe hargriv foresaw and this is me 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:52.170
 I know he lives for more than a hundred years 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.170
 who knows what he is capable of 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.320
 the only thing he couldn't predict 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:02.100
 this is your appearance alcatraz he knew 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:06.740
 that i die without a suit without his help but 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.740
 he did not expect me to find you
