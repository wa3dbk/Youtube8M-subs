00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:29.369
 oh this is neighbors neighbors will roll shorter 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:31.170
 we will now clouds want creature that only 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:42.989
 their faces have failed 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:45.770
 stop the site not to remove them and the topic than 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.770
 calmer or something 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.630
 we can continue to shoot and yes guys like 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.450
 You probably understand today I will play 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.520
 the shadow of a tyrant just funny errands 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.920
 begin and continue simultaneously in 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.470
 general today I have a goal really 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.339
 win this round because well and not 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.830
 only this round 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.770
 next round too because the series 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.660
 turn yourself off two rounds at this one 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.060
 love to give them what this spoils 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:24.270
 but they expected but understood unsuccessfully as direct 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:27.180
 okay, I started to carry everything nonsense and 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.970
 in general , we all dropped in no way 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.110
 it is clear where this is all just yes 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:38.160
 in general, then I start to fall there 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:41.160
 I run here trying to survive and win all 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.619
 but because as already today white 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.020
 win a veteran because i never 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.660
 honestly didn't win guys at all like 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.950
 then even on the previous tinker clip on 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.520
 which was shot about three or four 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.530
 months ago I played three rounds me too 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.990
 none of them won well as i did 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.920
 could fall damn stupid for not pressing 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.280
 double w 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:07.950
 well that's how so that's how just order 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:11.100
 it seems to me that I am just losers by them 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.550
 in such play but destination in 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.860
 friend but still and all the same us already 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.680
 fewer people than it was originally h0 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.569
 four people will be there 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:27.209
 there is a huge amount she decides 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.720
 but now here is the light sprint he 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.400
 falls off 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.819
 some moments whether it is specifically 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.500
 so done either something with me is not me 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.920
 I don't know why but 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.740
 10th round will not hear wow wow 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.220
 here you saw yes and he ran to the front 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:47.670
 it escaped and now here he fell as 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.580
 cool I dropped someone for the first time notice 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.440
 oh oh all that a little prilovchilsya 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.870
 I can play a little bit already 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.210
 Now we will just run here. 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.550
 stay already 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:02.480
 them so to say oh oh oh oh something 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.990
 started bad 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.120
 better choose to cover where there is more 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:12.350
 places because here I understand for a long time 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:15.530
 I will not survive 14 people already but I do not know 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.330
 damn i can't win guys i never 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.000
 can't win here forgive me 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.520
 for my many visible actions or 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.010
 Viktor and drags in this mini-game and here I am 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.620
 not one of them because I have it well 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.270
 which let the cube and double jump me 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.570
 helped right now I'm with them 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:36.710
 took advantage of chic chic chic 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:40.190
 I live smartly and I live once again 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:45.170
 and this player is absolutely all seven players 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:47.060
 guys I win at least I drag 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.860
 I want to enter the top three at least not the top three 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.930
 Let's look at least a threesome of people 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:58.460
 who are but cool would be us already 5 6 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:03.940
 maybe I will have 2 timka you 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:05.150
 can i believe in you friend talk myself 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.670
 43 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:12.710
 I entered the top three guys gorgeous chic 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:17.390
 Nost it here so that's my look 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:20.150
 in the tyrant come on timka you can be in the mood 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:24.800
 and we are all cool not even they are cool I do not 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:30.010
 cool and then play bad it 'll close damn 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:34.360
 you yourself know and see probably come on so 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:37.250
 but the insult is not a level below fell 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.090
 but it does not matter it is not a barrier to 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.350
 such a cool dude like me because 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:48.830
 because oh how oh what 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:51.110
 asshole that damn no but I entered 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.390
 three guys I almost won and you 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.890
 must put like a plan behind it 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:05:00.050
 was the first round and we go to 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:02.990
 round two is round two 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.060
 and on again dropped it is not clear where 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.520
 it is not clear where there is no clear where it is 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:13.009
 it is clear where because everything is clear and in 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:16.900
 in general, I lag like so guys u 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:20.240
 I imagine a lag as well, damn near 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.199
 them and g 500 fps when shooting but how can u 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.819
 can lag me 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:27.099
 then tyrant damn you do I want you 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:29.629

 viewers you terrible veteran hate these 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.909
 This is the moment to find 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.090
 to lower 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:46.219
 how to explain how to lower it 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.349
 shorter drawing can in this case 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:51.259
 what I look like also on the underlying 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:53.060
 block me but give me the same 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:55.639
 underlying all the same so i must say 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:59.509
 or downline it doesn't matter in general you sense 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:02.690
