myth I have got some pretty solid

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.620

evidence here that this myth I suppose

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.480 
evidence here that this myth I suppose
you<00:01:06.689> could<00:01:06.840> say<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.170> true<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.680> cannot<00:01:08.280> get<00:01:08.460> a

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
you could say is true you cannot get a

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.429

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
obviously one bit of evidence doesn't

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.660 
obviously one bit of evidence doesn't

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:43.499 
position it's arguable whether or not we

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:44.870 
position it's arguable whether or not we
where<00:01:43.709> there<00:01:43.740> was<00:01:44.039> a<00:01:44.069> defender<00:01:44.579> coming<00:01:44.729> across

where there was a defender coming across

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.489 
where there was a defender coming across
and<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.149> was<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> pretty<00:01:45.509> tight<00:01:45.689> angle<00:01:46.020> so<00:01:46.380> you'd

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:46.499 
and it was a pretty tight angle so you'd

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:47.989 
and it was a pretty tight angle so you'd
have<00:01:46.529> to<00:01:46.709> agree<00:01:46.799> yellow<00:01:47.159> cards<00:01:47.490> pretty<00:01:47.759> fair

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:47.999

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
decision I was happy for that I think it

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.660 
decision I was happy for that I think it

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
didn't speak to the goalkeeper anything

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.550 
didn't speak to the goalkeeper anything
like<00:02:23.849> that<00:02:23.879> he<00:02:24.659> just<00:02:24.690> goes<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.290> gives<00:02:25.470> a

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
like that he just goes and gives a

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.530 
like that he just goes and gives a
penalty<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.010> as<00:02:26.099> with<00:02:26.250> pep<00:02:26.430> Lex<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:26.879> I've<00:02:27.209> got

penalty so as with pep Lex and I've got

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.500 
penalty so as with pep Lex and I've got
thinking<00:02:27.959> maybe<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.620> is<00:02:28.799> because<00:02:29.510> he

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
thinking maybe that is because he

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.539 
thinking maybe that is because he
doesn't<00:02:30.959> want<00:02:31.260> goalkeepers<00:02:31.769> to<00:02:32.010> get<00:02:32.190> sent<00:02:32.400> off

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
behind why this is is because it is

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.069 
behind why this is is because it is
actually<00:02:48.180> pretty<00:02:48.390> easy<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.750> lure<00:02:49.049> a

player out and not a single car that was

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:22.940 
player out and not a single car that was
given<00:03:21.540> so<00:03:21.629> this<00:03:21.720> keeper<00:03:22.079> is<00:03:22.230> now<00:03:22.620> give<00:03:22.799> away

opportunities<00:03:25.109> and<00:03:25.620> he<00:03:25.739> still<00:03:26.069> hasn't<00:03:26.310> picked

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
opportunities and he still hasn't picked

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.970 
opportunities and he still hasn't picked
up<00:03:26.700> a<00:03:26.880> yellow<00:03:27.239> card<00:03:27.480> or<00:03:27.690> even<00:03:28.019> he<00:03:28.590> still<00:03:28.769> hasn't

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
up a yellow card or even he still hasn't

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.110 
up a yellow card or even he still hasn't
picked<00:03:29.040> up<00:03:29.160> a<00:03:29.280> red<00:03:29.459> which<00:03:29.639> he<00:03:29.730> should've<00:03:30.030> done

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
picked up a red which he should've done

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.460 
picked up a red which he should've done
and<00:03:30.269> he<00:03:30.329> hasn't<00:03:30.510> even<00:03:30.660> picked<00:03:30.959> up<00:03:31.079> a<00:03:31.200> yellow

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
and he hasn't even picked up a yellow

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.099 
and he hasn't even picked up a yellow
which<00:03:31.709> is<00:03:31.739> just<00:03:32.010> absolutely<00:03:32.160> ludicrous<00:03:32.669> so

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
which is just absolutely ludicrous so

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.270 
which is just absolutely ludicrous so
like<00:03:34.109> I<00:03:34.139> was<00:03:34.290> saying<00:03:34.349> I<00:03:34.680> think<00:03:34.739> this<00:03:35.160> is

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
like I was saying I think this is

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.949 
like I was saying I think this is
because<00:03:35.579> it's<00:03:35.790> too<00:03:35.940> easy<00:03:35.970> to<00:03:36.239> get<00:03:36.510> goalkeeper

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
because it's too easy to get goalkeeper

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.539 
because it's too easy to get goalkeeper
sent<00:03:37.139> off<00:03:37.290> if<00:03:37.470> you<00:03:37.650> do<00:03:37.739> actually<00:03:37.889> try<00:03:38.190> to<00:03:38.250> and

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
sent off if you do actually try to and

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.039 
sent off if you do actually try to and
people<00:03:38.790> would<00:03:38.910> get<00:03:39.030> royally<00:03:39.480> pissed<00:03:39.660> off<00:03:39.840> if

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
people would get royally pissed off if

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.839 
people would get royally pissed off if
the<00:03:40.230> kamijo<00:03:40.470> gains<00:03:40.889> people<00:03:41.160> who<00:03:41.639> just

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
the kamijo gains people who just

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.009 
the kamijo gains people who just
deliberately<00:03:42.180> tried<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.480> get<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.840> goalie

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
deliberately tried to get the goalie

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.020 
deliberately tried to get the goalie
sent<00:03:43.290> off<00:03:43.379> every<00:03:43.799> single<00:03:44.099> game<00:03:44.220> so<00:03:44.849> if<00:03:44.910> you

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
sent off every single game so if you

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.729 
sent off every single game so if you
like<00:03:45.209> EA<00:03:45.419> have<00:03:45.750> put<00:03:45.959> a<00:03:45.989> thing<00:03:46.200> in<00:03:46.230> to<00:03:46.530> online

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
like EA have put a thing in to online

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.589

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
yellow cards which you can see he does

all game it does end up coming out with

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:57.949 
all game it does end up coming out with
the<00:03:56.849> ball<00:03:57.060> and<00:03:57.209> when<00:03:57.389> we<00:03:57.480> look<00:03:57.629> at<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.810> replay

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
the ball and when we look at the replay

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.780 
the ball and when we look at the replay
he<00:03:58.410> actually<00:03:58.739> gets<00:03:58.949> the<00:03:59.099> ball<00:03:59.280> straight<00:03:59.549> away

he actually gets the ball straight away

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.909 
he actually gets the ball straight away
absolutely<00:04:00.629> baffled<00:04:01.260> why<00:04:01.560> he's<00:04:01.709> give<00:04:01.889> a

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
absolutely baffled why he's give a

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:03.289 
absolutely baffled why he's give a
penalty<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:02.430> why<00:04:02.609> he's<00:04:02.790> given<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.150> yellow

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:04.909 
penalty and why he's given the yellow
card<00:04:03.540> finally<00:04:03.989> the<00:04:04.440> other<00:04:04.530> two<00:04:04.709> with

card finally the other two with

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.890 
card finally the other two with
Stonewall<00:04:05.250> red<00:04:05.639> cards<00:04:05.940> in<00:04:06.000> my<00:04:06.030> opinion<00:04:06.449> we<00:04:06.870> can

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
Stonewall red cards in my opinion we can

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.270 
Stonewall red cards in my opinion we can
see<00:04:07.139> that<00:04:07.260> when<00:04:07.410> he<00:04:07.500> gets<00:04:07.650> us<00:04:07.769> onto<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.099> ball

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
see that when he gets us onto the ball

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.770 
see that when he gets us onto the ball
and<00:04:08.459> he<00:04:08.549> scoops<00:04:08.819> it<00:04:08.970> in<00:04:09.060> and<00:04:09.239> then<00:04:09.419> hides<00:04:09.629> the

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
and he scoops it in and then hides the

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.809 
and he scoops it in and then hides the
chance<00:04:10.019> absolutely<00:04:10.650> perfect<00:04:11.069> title<00:04:11.250> I<00:04:11.519> would

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
chance absolutely perfect title I would

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.129 
chance absolutely perfect title I would
say<00:04:11.970> let<00:04:12.180> me<00:04:12.269> know<00:04:12.389> what<00:04:12.540> you<00:04:12.599> guys<00:04:12.720> think<00:04:12.959> as

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
say let me know what you guys think as

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.050 
say let me know what you guys think as
well<00:04:13.260> but<00:04:14.190> I<00:04:14.280> would<00:04:14.340> say<00:04:14.519> that<00:04:14.669> is<00:04:14.760> actually

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
well but I would say that is actually

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.210 
well but I would say that is actually
the<00:04:15.150> only<00:04:15.449> one<00:04:15.599> that<00:04:16.260> wasn't<00:04:16.500> a<00:04:16.709> stole<00:04:16.979> more

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
the only one that wasn't a stole more

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.129 
the only one that wasn't a stole more
penalty<00:04:17.609> and<00:04:17.760> a<00:04:17.880> Stonewall<00:04:18.299> sends<00:04:18.660> enough<00:04:18.870> but

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
penalty and a Stonewall sends enough but

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:21.050 
penalty and a Stonewall sends enough but
that<00:04:19.769> is<00:04:19.889> just<00:04:20.039> the<00:04:20.190> way<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.340> game<00:04:20.669> goes

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
that is just the way the game goes

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.790 
that is just the way the game goes
