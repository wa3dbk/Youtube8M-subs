took<00:00:29.429> up<00:00:29.519> too<00:00:29.640> much<00:00:29.670> plastic<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.300> could<00:00:30.420> like

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
took up too much plastic you could like

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.900 
took up too much plastic you could like
really<00:00:30.840> see<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.109> core<00:00:31.349> inside<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.460> hole<00:00:32.610> but

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
really see the core inside the hole but

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.290 
really see the core inside the hole but
on<00:00:33.059> this<00:00:33.210> one<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:34.020> did<00:00:34.380> less<00:00:34.820> it<00:00:35.820> turns<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.210> lot

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
on this one I did less it turns a lot

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.260 
on this one I did less it turns a lot
better<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.960> salute<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.559> core<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:39.090> put

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
better and a salute the core and I put

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.510 
better and a salute the core and I put
some<00:00:39.420> Lube<00:00:39.660> right<00:00:39.930> here<00:00:40.590> for<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.250> tips

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
some Lube right here for the tips

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.540 
some Lube right here for the tips
because<00:00:41.820> they<00:00:42.000> were<00:00:42.059> kind<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.390> stiff<00:00:43.399> so<00:00:44.399> now

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
because they were kind of stiff so now

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.369 
because they were kind of stiff so now
it's<00:00:44.789> broken<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.270> really<00:00:45.600> nice<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.230> can

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
it's broken and really nice and you can

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.750 
it's broken and really nice and you can
just<00:00:46.530> kind<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.860> see<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.460> don't<00:00:47.610> really

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
just kind of see it you don't really

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.119 
just kind of see it you don't really
take<00:00:48.090> off<00:00:48.210> too<00:00:48.510> much<00:00:48.690> plastic<00:00:48.989> just<00:00:49.950> about

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
take off too much plastic just about

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.130 
take off too much plastic just about
right<00:00:50.370> there<00:00:50.579> it's<00:00:50.789> pretty<00:00:50.969> good<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:51.989> can

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
right there it's pretty good so you can

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.200 
right there it's pretty good so you can
kind<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.410> see<00:00:52.730> it<00:00:53.730> sounds<00:00:54.180> very<00:00:54.390> very<00:00:54.750> nice

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
kind of see it sounds very very nice

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.819 
kind of see it sounds very very nice
it's<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.420> smooth<00:00:57.750> it's<00:00:58.079> been<00:00:58.320> it's<00:00:58.710> been

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
it's so smooth it's been it's been

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.439 
it's so smooth it's been it's been
broken<00:00:59.280> with<00:01:00.260> whom<00:01:01.260> probably<00:01:02.329> two<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.420> three

hundred Sol's since the mod it was
pretty<00:01:05.670> broken<00:01:05.909> before<00:01:06.420> i<00:01:06.720> modded<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.260> but

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
pretty broken before i modded it but

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.230 
pretty broken before i modded it but
just<00:01:07.920> modding<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.490> made<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:08.939> much<00:01:09.000> easier

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
just modding it made it so much easier

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.980 
just modding it made it so much easier
it<00:01:09.659> doesn't<00:01:09.930> lock<00:01:10.080> up<00:01:10.290> or<00:01:10.439> anything<00:01:11.990> those

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
it doesn't lock up or anything those

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.740 
it doesn't lock up or anything those
were<00:01:13.110> simple<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.500> do<00:01:13.680> um<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.340> know<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.270> external

rounded<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.259> with<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.380> dremel<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.950> then<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.100> went

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
rounded it with a dremel and then I went

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.249 
rounded it with a dremel and then I went
over<00:01:20.520> with<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.759> emery<00:01:21.030> board<00:01:21.299> just<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:21.990> smooth

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
over with the emery board just to smooth

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.080 
over with the emery board just to smooth
the<00:01:22.350> plastic<00:01:22.799> out<00:01:22.950> but<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.790> seemed<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.060> work

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
the plastic out but it seemed to work

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.960 
the plastic out but it seemed to work
very<00:01:24.840> very<00:01:24.900> well<00:01:25.340> so<00:01:26.340> if<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.549> don't<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:26.939> it

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
you don't have to have a dribble but if

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.520 
you don't have to have a dribble but if
um<00:01:28.560> if<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.890> have<00:01:29.390> sandpaper<00:01:30.390> or<00:01:30.750> any<00:01:31.140> kind<00:01:31.409> of

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
filing device project now file to I just

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.999 
filing device project now file to I just
like<00:01:33.840> if<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:33.990> didn't<00:01:34.229> nail<00:01:34.350> file<00:01:34.530> take<00:01:34.860> you

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
like if you didn't nail file take you

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.370 
like if you didn't nail file take you
well<00:01:35.159> because<00:01:36.000> these<00:01:36.270> pieces<00:01:36.509> have<00:01:36.659> sure<00:01:37.259> a

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
well because these pieces have sure a

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.530 
well because these pieces have sure a
sharp<00:01:37.770> points<00:01:38.220> which<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.909> one<00:01:39.119> here<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.450> i

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
sharp points which is one here that i

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.719 
sharp points which is one here that i
have<00:01:39.689> about<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.770> can<00:01:40.950> see<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.310> difference

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
have about it you can see the difference

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.039 
have about it you can see the difference
here<00:01:43.310> that<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.520> pyramid<00:01:45.450> comes<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.020> point

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
here that the pyramid comes to a point

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.649 
here that the pyramid comes to a point
right<00:01:46.590> there<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.119> can<00:01:48.210> see<00:01:48.329> this<00:01:48.509> is

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
right there and you can see this is

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.569 
right there and you can see this is
rounded<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.500> just<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.860> nail<00:01:50.070> file<00:01:50.310> we<00:01:50.549> just
