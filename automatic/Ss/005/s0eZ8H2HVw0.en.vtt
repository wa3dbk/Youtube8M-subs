what the owners manual says the owners

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.369 
what the owners manual says the owners
manual<00:00:38.760> may<00:00:39.149> say<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.870> coolant<00:00:40.260> is

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
manual may say that the coolant is

150,000 miles that doesn't mean it will
so<00:00:47.850> be<00:00:47.879> proactive<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:48.989> check<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.440> before<00:00:49.590> it

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
so be proactive and check it before it

does<00:00:50.160> damage<00:00:50.489> one<00:00:51.480> thing<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.840> can<00:00:52.020> do<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.379> use

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
does damage one thing you can do is use

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.459 
does damage one thing you can do is use
a<00:00:52.649> simple<00:00:53.160> hydrometer<00:00:53.850> like<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.510> draws<00:00:55.140> some

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
a simple hydrometer like this draws some

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.229 
a simple hydrometer like this draws some
coolant<00:00:55.890> up<00:00:56.039> inside<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.879> tells<00:00:57.030> you

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
coolant up inside it and it tells you

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.810 
coolant up inside it and it tells you
the<00:00:57.329> freeze<00:00:57.570> protection<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.770> also<00:00:59.039> tells<00:00:59.579> you

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
the freeze protection it also tells you

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.330 
the freeze protection it also tells you
if<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.030> coolant<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.719> still<00:01:01.079> clear<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
if the coolant is still clear in the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.479 
if the coolant is still clear in the
proper<00:01:02.730> color<00:01:03.019> but<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.260> better<00:01:04.739> way<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.010> do<00:01:05.339> it

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
proper color but a better way to do it

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.469 
proper color but a better way to do it
is<00:01:05.670> right<00:01:05.909> here

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
is right here

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.140 
is right here
these<00:01:06.810> are<00:01:07.260> coolant<00:01:07.799> test<00:01:08.100> strips<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.850> dip

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
these are coolant test strips you dip

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.020 
these are coolant test strips you dip
these<00:01:09.420> into<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.900> coolant<00:01:10.320> then<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.369> little

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
these into the coolant then the little

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.969 
these into the coolant then the little
pads<00:01:12.360> on<00:01:12.750> them<00:01:12.930> change<00:01:13.260> color<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.860> you

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
pads on them change color and you

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.030 
pads on them change color and you
compare<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.729> color<00:01:15.030> with<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.259> colors<00:01:16.799> on

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
compare that color with the colors on

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.310 
compare that color with the colors on
the<00:01:17.159> side<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.670> bottle<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.750> tells<00:01:18.990> you

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
the side of the bottle and it tells you

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.980 
the side of the bottle and it tells you
whether<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.430> coolant<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.000> good<00:01:21.270> or<00:01:21.420> bad

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
whether the coolant is good or bad

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.620 
whether the coolant is good or bad
now<00:01:22.619> another<00:01:23.280> test<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.270> one<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.600> a

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
now another test and this one is a

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.719 
now another test and this one is a
little<00:01:24.950> sophisticated<00:01:25.950> but<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.250> need<00:01:26.460> a

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
little sophisticated but you need a

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.920 
little sophisticated but you need a
simple<00:01:27.680> voltmeter<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:29.310> set<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.729> on<00:01:29.850> DC<00:01:30.420> volts

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
simple voltmeter you set it on DC volts

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.190 
simple voltmeter you set it on DC volts
you<00:01:31.590> connect<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.220> negative<00:01:32.759> cable<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
you connect the negative cable to the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.429 
you connect the negative cable to the
negative<00:01:35.100> terminal<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.060> battery<00:01:36.439> then

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
negative terminal of the battery then

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.560 
negative terminal of the battery then
with<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.799> radiator<00:01:38.250> cap<00:01:38.579> off<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.360> car

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
with the radiator cap off and the car

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.470 
with the radiator cap off and the car
running<00:01:40.020> at<00:01:40.140> about<00:01:40.229> 2,000<00:01:41.220> rpm<00:01:42.140> you<00:01:43.140> dip<00:01:43.560> the

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
running at about 2,000 rpm you dip the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:51.220 
running at about 2,000 rpm you dip the
read<00:01:45.140> probe<00:01:46.270> into<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:48.080> coolant<00:01:49.090> like<00:01:50.090> so<00:01:50.450> and

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
read probe into the coolant like so and

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.350 
read probe into the coolant like so and
you<00:01:51.440> get<00:01:51.560> a<00:01:51.620> reading<00:01:51.920> on<00:01:52.280> here<00:01:52.640> that<00:01:52.700> reading

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
you get a reading on here that reading

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.560 
you get a reading on here that reading
should<00:01:53.660> be<00:01:53.720> less<00:01:54.320> than<00:01:55.160> four<00:01:55.550> tenths<00:01:55.910> of<00:01:56.150> one

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
should be less than four tenths of one

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.530 
should be less than four tenths of one
volt<00:01:56.960> if<00:01:57.590> it<00:01:57.920> exceeds<00:01:58.340> four<00:01:58.790> tenths<00:01:59.120> of<00:01:59.300> one

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
volt if it exceeds four tenths of one

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.870 
volt if it exceeds four tenths of one
volt<00:01:59.810> the<00:02:00.380> coolant<00:02:00.770> needs<00:02:01.040> to<00:02:01.280> come<00:02:01.460> out<00:02:01.610> the

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
volt the coolant needs to come out the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.210 
volt the coolant needs to come out the
system<00:02:02.300> flushed<00:02:02.720> and<00:02:03.290> if<00:02:03.470> that<00:02:03.680> doesn't<00:02:04.070> take

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
system flushed and if that doesn't take

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.760 
system flushed and if that doesn't take
care<00:02:04.520> of<00:02:04.700> it<00:02:04.850> then<00:02:05.390> you<00:02:05.840> need<00:02:06.080> to<00:02:06.350> check<00:02:06.560> the

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
care of it then you need to check the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.730 
care of it then you need to check the
electrical<00:02:07.310> system<00:02:07.700> on<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:08.000> car<00:02:08.240> also<00:02:09.170> the
