00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:06.490
 but welcome to more and good in this 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.080
 I bring you a little guide of 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.849
 the sting that you have asked me 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.190
 too much on twitter and I said nothing because 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:15.219
 do not make a video and well the question is 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.690
 how its at level 21 or 22 as you can see 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.930
 all these people have different 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.220
 levels 27-25 in yellow are me 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.680
 asking how do they rise in level 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.780
 after reaching level 20 as in 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.000
 level 20 version and I no longer have the line 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.910
 of experience what happens here is that 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.580
 destine the maximum level is 20 but 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.620
 from experience that is to say that I mean 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.500
 we reach level 20 and we can not win 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.530
 more exp and then as you level up 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.210
 after 20 then very simple and now 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.340
 what you're going to see is let's say the armor 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.560
 between better things we have in our 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.110
 armor more level we will win by 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.350
 example how can they see you in an arm 81 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.450
 and to the part in an arm 153 this 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.980
 arm in the specifications by 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.940
 put it somehow the details 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.340
 it comes out that it has strength plus 62 and of the use 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.860
 of light has more than 8 that we do not put 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.940
 and as you can see here, light comes out 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.630
 20 in yellow 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:14.710
 and then here we have a chest of 153 and 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.270
 one of 175 that has light 5 not what 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.790
 we put and as you can see here in the 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.010
 border the experience of the experience already 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.740
 advanced a little in yellow what 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.620
 means that more things with light 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.030
 we have more level of like we are going to have 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.250
 which is why all these are coming out 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.230
 people in yellow then that's what 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.140
 means that more armor 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:38.590
 we have but with light or for level 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.450
 20 more level we will now have as 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.550
 we get that very easy armor the 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.820
 we unlock in games when 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.500
 we are playing or in the tower when they are 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.080
 a level 20 are unlocked several 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.140
 stores like for example this when 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.500
 we approach at least the sells 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.240
 layers and objects and now all this no longer 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.360
 it is with normal money normal money 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.290
 is this that I am here marking 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.840
 normally in all stores it is used 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.940
 this one that are brands does not pronounce that 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.950
 word but this money that I have 16 is 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.179
 which is normally used normally in 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.120
 the stores 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.859
 this what they sell are layers and objects 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.739
 specials as you can see charges in 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:20.739
 light amounts what is that 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.420
 those are special objects we go to 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.120
 inventory I have two as you can see 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.030
 but most stores charge 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.430
 I do not know if you pronounce cross ebook that marx 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.980
 how do we get this we just go 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.519
 to the store or the person who gives us 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.980
 let's say missions for multiplayer and 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.150
 missions for the campaign and that does not fit 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.060
 is that we will achieve it will unlock us 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.879
 more and more and more as you can see I have 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.889
 six if there are 25 weapons here 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.840
 enough power and equal enough armor 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:52.269
 power that has let's say light has more 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.159
 18 when we buy that simply 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:57.129
 we are going to be going up and going up 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:03:00.069
 level up to the maximum level that 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:02.799
 really by pure armor I do not know which 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.120
 will be but and well that would be all I hope 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.219
 that you have liked this little guide 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.680
 what I did to them and clarified the 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:11.310
 doubt my name roberto - very careful 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.310
 goodbye
