00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
be snoopy TSA's of plywood put them

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.990 
be snoopy TSA's of plywood put them
together<00:01:27.810> with<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.500> lazy<00:01:28.860> susan<00:01:29.189> bearings<00:01:29.759> of

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
together with the lazy susan bearings of

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.630 
together with the lazy susan bearings of
it<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.329> it'll<00:01:30.450> stand<00:01:30.920> very<00:01:31.920> important<00:01:32.520> that

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
it so it'll stand very important that

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.170 
it so it'll stand very important that
you<00:01:32.670> then<00:01:33.000> glue<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.600> screw<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.259> cleat<00:01:35.060> to<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
you then glue and screw a cleat to the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.670 
you then glue and screw a cleat to the
bottom<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.720> bottle<00:01:37.049> teach<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.439> want<00:01:37.619> to

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
bottom of the bottle teach you want to

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.260 
bottom of the bottle teach you want to
make<00:01:37.799> sure<00:01:37.829> it's<00:01:38.130> glued<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.579> screwed<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:39.119> it

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
make sure it's glued and screwed so it

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.910 
make sure it's glued and screwed so it
can't<00:01:39.509> come<00:01:39.720> off<00:01:39.930> that<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.380> necessarily<00:01:40.530> know

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
can't come off that you necessarily know

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.440 
can't come off that you necessarily know
when<00:01:41.040> it's<00:01:41.159> separating<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:41.820> your<00:01:42.030> test<00:01:42.240> them

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
when it's separating on your test them

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.920 
when it's separating on your test them
the<00:01:43.350> only<00:01:43.619> other<00:01:43.740> did<00:01:44.040> once<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.340> do<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.930> is

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
the only other did once you do that is

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.700 
the only other did once you do that is
nike's<00:01:46.799> little<00:01:47.720> cable<00:01:48.720> clamps<00:01:49.200> on<00:01:49.350> then<00:01:49.560> you

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
nike's little cable clamps on then you

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.380 
nike's little cable clamps on then you
can<00:01:49.829> night<00:01:49.979> several<00:01:50.250> sets<00:01:50.579> on<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:51.000> spaced

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
can night several sets on that spaced

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.929 
can night several sets on that spaced
and<00:01:51.950> according<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.189> widths<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.700> size
