alive what's been going on well I mean
we<00:03:10.440> just<00:03:10.650> kind<00:03:10.860> of<00:03:10.950> all<00:03:11.100> needed<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:11.790> go<00:03:11.910> our

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
we just kind of all needed to go our

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.490 
we just kind of all needed to go our
separate<00:03:12.390> ways<00:03:12.540> I<00:03:12.720> think<00:03:12.780> it's<00:03:13.200> kind<00:03:13.380> of<00:03:13.410> the

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
separate ways I think it's kind of the

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.590 
separate ways I think it's kind of the
best<00:03:13.620> for<00:03:13.890> all<00:03:14.010> of<00:03:14.130> us<00:03:14.220> we<00:03:15.150> played<00:03:15.360> a<00:03:15.390> lot

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
best for all of us we played a lot

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.420 
best for all of us we played a lot
together<00:03:16.020> I<00:03:16.500> guess<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:16.800> just<00:03:16.830> didn't<00:03:17.160> work<00:03:17.190> out

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
together I guess it just didn't work out

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.670 
together I guess it just didn't work out
and<00:03:17.610> finally<00:03:17.850> we<00:03:18.120> decided<00:03:18.630> to<00:03:19.140> start<00:03:19.440> kind<00:03:19.560> of
